IKAI LAN: Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.890
Welcome to Google "Apps
Script Office Hours"

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.500
for November 9, 2012.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.380
My name Ikai Lan.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.670
ERIC KOLEDA: And I'm
Eric Koleda.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.490
IKAI LAN: And we've got a great
"Office Hours" show for

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.240
you, today.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.320
ERIC KOLEDA: Just like
every "Office Hours."

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.400
IKAI LAN: Every "Office Hours"
we have is top notch.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.680
So we've got a couple of

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.560
interesting things to announce.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.100
First off, I'll start by
announcing that we-- wow,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.770
we're actually starting
to fill for

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.120
the Los Angeles Hackathon.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.720
I think there's not that
many spaces left.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.840
So if you get a chance and
you're in the Los Angeles, do

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.025
come check us out.

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:43.100
You can search for the Hackathon
site at Google Apps

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.810
Script Los Angeles Hackathon.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.880
It was actually easier to say
that whole thing than to read

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.010
out the URL, which is actually
really long.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.230
So go ahead and sign up.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.550
Let us know if you're coming.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.030
We'd love to meet you and hear
about what you're doing, and

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.305
help you come up with ideas
for trying to solve your

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:02.990
workflow problems, and just
automating things you're doing

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.730
with Google Apps.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.926
ERIC KOLEDA: So maybe for some
people that haven't been at a

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:06.240
Google Hackathon before,
can you run us

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.145
through what happens?

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:08.140
IKAI LAN: Oh, yeah, sure.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.450
See?

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.440
I just assumed that everyone's
been to a Hackathon.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.240
So what we're going to do is
we're hosted at the Google Los

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.320
Angeles office across
from Venice Beach.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.470
ERIC KOLEDA: Ooh.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.740
IKAI LAN: Yeah, you know,
get to the chopper.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.310
That's the worst Arnold
impression.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.630
So what we're going to do is
we're going to lead you guys

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.670
through a tutorial of how to do
a sign-up sheet via Google

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.210
Forms and Google Spreadsheets.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.990
We're going to talk about some
of the things that people use

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.940
Apps Script for.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.730
We're going to try to organize
you into teams, but we don't

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.890
necessarily have
a competition.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.170
We just want everyone to have
a good time and learn some

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.190
stuff about Apps Script.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.140
Now, I'd say about half the
people use the time to hack

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.900
and try to build new products or
new tools and new scripts.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.115
Whereas the other half, what
they do is they like to run

00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:50.930
through tutorials.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.970
And it's a very good time to do
tutorials as well, because

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.410
we'll be there to help you if
you run into any problems and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.450
answer any questions you have.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.140
Now, obviously what we want is
for you to build products.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.180
And what people end up doing
is they end up looking up

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.740
tutorials and saying, well, I
need to do something very,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.640
very similar to this.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.680
So first I'm going to do a
tutorial, then I'm going to go

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.000
ahead and adopt something, so
I'm going to turn this into

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.520
something I would
use everyday.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.527
What is this guy?

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:15.870
What's happening over here?

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.250
That goes on the
outtakes video.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.810
We're making an outtake.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.980
ERIC KOLEDA: We're good.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.810
IKAI LAN: That would be good.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.712
Anyway, so a good example is
someone came last time and he

00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:24.720
did our chart tutorial,
and he merged it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.270
with his own invoices.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.190
He keeps Invoices for his
clients in Google

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.840
Spreadsheets.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.490
So he wrote a script that goes
through his Google Drive,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.950
looks for all the invoices,
and charts how

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.700
much money he's making.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.426
So it was kind of funny because
he demoed it, and he

00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:38.530
demoed with his live data, and
he showed us all the money he

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.320
was making or wasn't making
at certain times.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.470
And that was kind of funny.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.510
ERIC KOLEDA: It was
very open of him.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.760
IKAI LAN: He's an open guy.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.250
I liked him.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.300
ERIC KOLEDA: It was good, but
I think he had like what?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.480
Maybe five, six hours
of hacking in there.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.395
It depends, I guess, on how late
you stay in the night,

00:02:52.395 --> 00:02:53.490
but some time to hack.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.140
So it's hard to go all
the way from idea to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.240
fully polished app.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.230
So using the tutorials or
working in a team is a way to

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.990
speed up the process, and get
further, and explore more

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.750
rather than just going solo
or something like that.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.000
IKAI LAN: Yeah, it's really
going to be a lot of fun.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.350
We love talking to people.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.150
And we will have food.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.110
I think last time we had pizza,
and this time we will

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.510
have pizza and also a healthier
option, which is we

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.230
will have Mediterranean food--

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.300
if things go to plan.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.570
But I can't guarantee that.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.380
I can't guarantee the we'll
have that available.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.280
So it might change at the last
minute depending on our needs.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.010
ERIC KOLEDA: Sign up now,
I guess, right?

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.540
IKAI LAN: Yeah, sign up now.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.150
We still have a couple spots.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.280
We have a lot of sign-ups
the last few days.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.630
It's going to be a really
packed event.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.840
I'm really looking
forward to this.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.410
ERIC KOLEDA: Killer.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.650
IKAI LAN: We've got a couple
of other things we want to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.350
talk about today.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.110
So hold on real quick while
I log into my laptop.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.900
So we're going to talk about
the Release Notes.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.360
Some good stuff has
been pushed out.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.870
We've got two recent
blog posts that we

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.480
just want to highlight.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.200
Eric's going to help us
highlight these things.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.130
And we're going to talk about
Google Cloud SQL a little bit.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.000
The Cloud SQL is a product that
we have that allows you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.600
to create hosted SQL databases
that you can use in your

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.480
applications.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.270
You could access it via Google
App Engine, but now you'll be

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.670
able to access your Google Cloud
SQL via Apps Script,

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.010
which gives you yet another
persistence option.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.034
So we'll talk a little bit about
that before we head to

00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:22.640
the live Q&amp;A and discussion.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.040
ERIC KOLEDA: Sounds good.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.300
IKAI LAN: Sound good?

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.690
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.250
IKAI LAN: So why don't
we start by talking--

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.335
do you want to do release notes
first, or do you want to

00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:29.155
do the recent blog
posts first?

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:30.180
ERIC KOLEDA: Let's
do blog posts.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.920
IKAI LAN: OK, let's do blog--

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.800
that makes sense.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.980
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah,
all right so this

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.480
week, we had our election.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.250
But the week prior, we--

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.090
IKAI LAN: We had an election.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.430
This is true.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.300
ERIC KOLEDA: We had
an election.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.020
And the week prior, we put out
some blog posts that were

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.970
election themed just in
time for the season.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.760
So the first of which is that
here on the Apps Script

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.120
Developer Relations team, we put
together a sample app that

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.140
uses Apps Script to build a web
application that connects

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.870
to the Google Civic
Information API.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.300
This is an API that Google
provided that allows you to

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.790
query for a given address--
where do I go vote?

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.810
How late are they open?

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.250
What's the address?

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.400
Who are the candidates?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.010
So we use that API to build this
sample web application.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.470
Because we think of this
kind of scope, right?

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.750
Having a data source that's JSON
based, that's publicly

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.540
accessible, and serving that
in a web format that

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.970
integrates with your Google
properties is really the

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.150
strong point of Google
Apps Script.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.550
So this sample application
created a calendar event for

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.480
election day.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.530
It saved to Drive information
about where to go vote or even

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.112
send you an email for the
details of where to go vote.

00:05:35.112 --> 00:05:37.330
And It was a really cool
sample app that we had

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.810
[? Calian ?]

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.550
on our team and Arun
put together.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.810
And I think they turned
out pretty great.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.220
IKAI LAN: Where are
those guys now?

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.020
ERIC KOLEDA: Where
are they now?

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.090
IKAI LAN: Yeah, they're
never here.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.690
I'm just kidding.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.300
[? Calian's helping ?] helping
us produce this show, and he's

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.950
like giving me the evil
eye right now.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.050
And Arun, I think he's
at an event, right?

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.140
At that your cause, I believe?

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.610
ERIC KOLEDA: I think so.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.775
He'll probably report
back next week.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.830
IKAI LAN: Yeah, that
would make sense.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.080
So there's a second sample
app as well.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.780
I remember using this
application, and it's funny

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.160
when you're working with
applications that aren't fully

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.840
developed yet.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.660
And they asked us to test
their app, and I do it.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.530
And I'm like, how come
it says my polling

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.530
place is North Carolina?

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.490
And they go, oh, we only have
one polling place in the

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.210
database right now.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.140
So I'm like, oh, right,
well, otherwise, it

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.680
works pretty well.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.330
ERIC KOLEDA: Test data.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.580
IKAI LAN: Yeah, test data.

00:06:26.431 --> 00:06:27.400
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, so that
was one blog post we did.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.860
And then we did a second one
where we actually have another

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.210
Googler named Chris Cartland.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.790
IKAI LAN: So a funny story
about Chris Cartland.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.770
We always laugh about this.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.906
In our employee directory, you
can set the name you want to

00:06:39.906 --> 00:06:40.600
be called as.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.810
So he likes being known
as Cartland.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.420
So inside the employee
directory, it says his name is

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.120
Cartland Cartland.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.640
So we we're arguing about
whether or not that was his

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.190
birth name.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.390
ERIC KOLEDA: No.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.760
Chris Cartland.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.650
IKAI LAN: Yes, his name
is Chris Cartland

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.340
ERIC KOLEDA: Officially.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.740
IKAI LAN: But he likes to
be called Cartland.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.450
ERIC KOLEDA: So Cartland put
together this cool script,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.960
actually back when he was at
university, for doing voting.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.510
So there are a lot of
different types of

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.140
voting in the world.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.110
The ones that we use for
elections here in the United

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.470
States is majority
wins, right?

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.150
But there are a lot of other
more complex types.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.140
And the one that he wanted to
use was this one called

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.440
instant run-off voting.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.550
It's basically a system where
instead of just selecting one

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.830
person that you want to vote
for, you give an ordered list

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.810
of who you'd like to vote for.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.120
And if the first person on your
list isn't going to come

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.180
close to winning, they scratch
it off and then go to your

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.040
next choice.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.980
So it's kind of a way to bring
in third parties or make it so

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.900
it's a different type of voting
that can in some case

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.470
work out better.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.200
So he wanted to use that
for, I think, a

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.510
university club he was in.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.830
So we wrote an Apps Script
that uses Google Forms to

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.240
collect the data, then put it
into a spreadsheet, and then

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.670
use Apps Script to process all
those results, do the voting

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.580
calculation, and then come
up with a winner.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.720
Obviously, doing a more complex
voting scheme is

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.840
harder when you're
doing it by hand.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.060
So we published a blog
post about that.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.840
That's pretty great.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.620
And he made that script
available in the script

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.950
gallery if you want to
try it out yourself.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.150
IKAI LAN: He made
a video, too.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.330
ERIC KOLEDA: And a
very nice video.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.580
IKAI LAN: So you can look
for these if you go to

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.830
googleappsdevelo
per.blogspot.com.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.110
Sometimes it's easier just to
go into your favorite search

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.275
engine and search for Google
Apps Developer blog, and

00:08:17.275 --> 00:08:18.060
you'll find it.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.170
Now, notice that I don't
plug Google there.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.050
Because people might have a
different search engine.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.295
Like I have my own
search engine.

00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:25.140
It's called "Ikai's Super
Search Engine."

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.375
ERIC KOLEDA: Oh, I
have to try that.

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:28.760
IKAI LAN: Yeah, it's in
stealth right now.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.880
Also the results are static.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.990
OK, it's a Python web app with
a dictionary that directly

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.554
maps your query string
to a URL.

00:08:35.554 --> 00:08:37.712
ERIC KOLEDA: Sounds scalable.

00:08:37.712 --> 00:08:41.340
IKAI LAN: Don't you have
somewhere to be?

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.929
Just kidding.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.470
We have a lot of fun on this
team, as you can tell.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.250
So why don't we go ahead and
move into the release notes?

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.430
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, man,
did we have a lot of

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.080
release notes recently.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.540
IKAI LAN: Did we?

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.960
I mean, did you cover the
October 26 stuff or--

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.810
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, so the
October 26 release kind of

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.760
happened right around Sandy.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.510
IKAI LAN: Oh, yeah.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.810
ERIC KOLEDA: So the hurricane
put that one on delay.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.040
It did not get out until
early this week.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.360
I think on Monday is when
I got it out there.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.940
IKAI LAN: Well, hold
on for a second.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.050
Why don't we share a
screen real quick.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.090
You know, I just realized
something.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.790
I didn't plug it in.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.780
We we're just talking
about this.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.450
That goes on a blooper reel.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.520
So why don't we just go ahead
and do this without the

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.860
screensharing then.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.030
It'll probably still be
just as effective.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.890
So let's start October 26.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.730
I was caught in a hurricane, as
were you and [? Calian, ?]

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.165
although I think
you had power.

00:09:33.165 --> 00:09:33.990
ERIC KOLEDA: I had power.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.270
I just did not have connection
to the Google server.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.910
So I couldn't log in and
get this published out.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.885
IKAI LAN: You had power
but no laptop.

00:09:39.885 --> 00:09:40.740
ERIC KOLEDA: Yep.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.310
IKAI LAN: I had a laptop
but no power.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:48.210
So it's like together, we have
formed a useful person.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.520
But we did not do that.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.400
It's like Voltron.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:50.920
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, and
I was thinking of

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.110
Voltron in my head.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.480
IKAI LAN: So on October 26, we
pushed out a release where we

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.920
fixed a ton of bugs.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.280
But there's two big things I
want to talk about here which

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.400
are, one is that we pushed out
a class Gmail attachment.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.880
So prior to this, one of the
common use cases for Apps

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.350
Script was to write scripts
that would go through your

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.510
Gmail, look for, say, large
attachments, and say, hey, do

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.670
you want to delete
this, right?

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.430
It would at least list them on
a spreadsheet, maybe it'd

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.210
email it to you, maybe
you'd label it.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:19.660
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, so a
lot of apps like that.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.460
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.640
The problem with the script--
and I was writing one-- is

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.700
that you run into a quota
very quickly.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.236
So there's a quota that you
hit that's really bad.

00:10:30.236 --> 00:10:32.460
OK, well, our producer
is pointing at me.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.350
And so we should really not--

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.042
the fourth wall, like
we're breaking it.

00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:38.270
ERIC KOLEDA: You've got to
shield yourself there.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.690
IKAI LAN: I know.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.640
I'm sorry about the
interruption.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.790
So now it's much easier to write
scripts that do that

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.470
because there's a new API called
getSize via the Gmail

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.100
attachment.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.810
So call that instead of "get
attachments," I believe.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.440
So hopefully, we can get out a
sample that can show you guys

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.410
how to write a script
like this.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.260
ERIC KOLEDA: I think before,
people had to fetch all of the

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.640
bytes and then measure the
size of those bytes.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.630
IKAI LAN: Yes, that
is what I did.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.140
ERIC KOLEDA: Right.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.740
And so instead of fetching the
bytes, which actually causes

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.690
us to do a lot of extra work, we
already have the total size

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.960
stored somewhere, so we can
just give you the size.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.340
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.610
That was a very silly
way of doing things.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.270
The more I thought about it, I
was like, I am reading all the

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.660
bytes of the attachment.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.950
I don't care what's in the
attachment, right?

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:16.250
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.990
That's a cool improvement.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.230
But then there's another
great Gmail

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.420
improvement there, too, right?

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.180
The top one here on
our release notes.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:22.535
IKAI LAN: Oh, GetAliases.

00:11:22.535 --> 00:11:24.140
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, so this was
actually one of our most

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.870
highly rated feature requests.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.700
I think it had in the hundreds
of stars on it, which is how

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.790
we measure how important an
issue is, which is the ability

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.800
to figure out-- you know
how in Gmail--

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.570
I don't know how many people
have set it up.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.240
I have it set up for myself.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.890
In Gmail you can send an email
as a different address.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:39.810
IKAI LAN: Yes!

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.980
ERIC KOLEDA: There's an
authorization process, where

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.780
it sends you an email,
and you confirm it.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.200
But then after that point, there
is a drop-down where you

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.610
can say, OK, send this email
address using this other

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.790
address that I own.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.860
And that was never available
in Gmail App until now.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.850
So with gmailapp.getaliases, you
can figure out all of the

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.670
aliases that you're
approved to use.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.360
And then when you do that "send
mail," you can pass in

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.580
an extra "from" field that will
specify, "send as this

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:02.940
address."

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.910
IKAI LAN: That's a very useful
feature because you don't

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.180
always want to be sending
as yourself.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.760
ERIC KOLEDA: Especially within
an organization.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.510
Sometimes you're Gary, but you
want to send it as a more

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.590
official email address.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.400
IKAI LAN: Yeah, sometimes I want
to send emails as Eric.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.490
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, I'm not going
to approve that one.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.850
IKAI LAN: Like, dear JP Morgan
Chase, please transfer--

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.752
lock your screen.

00:12:21.752 --> 00:12:23.395
That's my warning to you.

00:12:23.395 --> 00:12:25.820
ERIC KOLEDA: It's dangerous
to sit next to this guy.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.570
But, yeah those are two really
great Gmail improvements that

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.940
came out during that release.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.040
And there was some other small
stuff listed here.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.410
IKAI LAN: Oh , that's right.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.740
We did the JavaScript execution
performance stuff.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.850
I totally forgot
about that one.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.220
So we have a lot of really great
users that are always

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.020
benchmarking saying, hey, what's
going on with this.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.640
And sometimes things are
going to be slower.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.550
Sometimes it's going
to be faster.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.800
But when things are like 1,000
times slower, that's usually

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.950
an indication that something's
not working correctly.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.840
So we've addressed some
JavaScript execution things.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.130
So if you're running things in
a very tightly loop, you'll

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.400
see some improvements there.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.700
Now, granted, if you're making
lots of API calls, it's not

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.920
really going to have a big
impact because of the cost for

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.840
a round-trip API call, which is
why we've included batching

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.170
and things such as
spreadsheets--

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.630
ERIC KOLEDA: Right.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.300
IKAI LAN: --to make
things speed up.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.930
Now, an analogy i like to use
here is that sometimes-- and

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.750
you've seen me do this, where
I'll just eat a whole pizza.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.010
And Eric, people have commented,
why are you eating

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.990
a whole pizza and drinking
Diet Coke?

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.630
And that's kind of what's
happening here, is that if you

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.726
increase your JavaScript
execution performance, but

00:13:25.726 --> 00:13:27.900
you're still making tons of API
calls, you're not going to

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.150
get a lot of benefit there.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.240
So this is going to be really
useful if you're doing lots of

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.680
typed calculations, but not
necessarily if you're making

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.730
lots of API calls.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:35.840
ERIC KOLEDA: I never would
have thought that.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.600
That actually would have made
sense, that analogy, but it

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.070
actually did.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.340
So yeah, good to go.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.530
IKAI LAN: Yeah!

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.240
ERIC KOLEDA: So, yeah,
doing math, right?

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.815
Doing loops, those kind of
things are going to be faster.

00:13:44.815 --> 00:13:49.240
I think we saw a 3 to
4x improvement.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.005
If you're calling out to fetch
data from a spreadsheet, that

00:13:52.005 --> 00:13:54.020
has not been touched.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.300
IKAI LAN: And what's
the last one?

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.120
The last improvement is we've
made a really big improvement

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.170
to how you can fetch files
from Google Drive.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:06.120
So previously, you can only
fetch 2,000 items, which was

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.285
kind of bad.

00:14:07.285 --> 00:14:08.820
ERIC KOLEDA: It sounds like a
lot, but with Drive and the

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.302
amount of storage you get
for free, that can

00:14:10.302 --> 00:14:11.620
fill up pretty quick.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.370
IKAI LAN: Now, there's a
new way of doing this.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.110
So instead of saying, get
everything, what you want to

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.290
do, is you want to use this
"get files for paging,"

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.610
because what you get back
is a page token.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.520
And every next iteration of the
call, you want to pass the

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.530
token to the method.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.000
And this is really useful,
because now you have a

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.375
continuation, and you
can keep going.

00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:32.580
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, so this
allows you to do activities

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.562
people had wanted to do, like I
want to back up my drive, I

00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:36.605
want to list everything
in my drive.

00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:37.590
You couldn't do that before.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:38.600
You couldn't get more
than 2,000.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.270
So now you can't get all those
files in one go, right?

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.600
But at least now there's a way
by a page by page by page, and

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.360
you can work your way through
all the files.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.970
IKAI LAN: And we've submitted
a bunch of bugs fixes.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.650
So if you could check those out
by looking for Apps Script

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.300
Release Notes.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.950
It's on our site just click
on Release Notes.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.950
And that's October 26.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.510
November 6, we also had a lot
of really great updates.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.900
So we fixed a couple
of issues.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:06.930
Oh, we updated icons.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.870
That's a big deal.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:14.420
But more importantly, we made
some cleanup changes.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.570
One is to LockService.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.240
We had a problem with the UI
Service where if you built a

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.750
UI app and called
LockService, it

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.800
wouldn't always work correctly.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.620
In fact, I think it would work
correctly some of the time,

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.375
but not all the time.

00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:24.370
ERIC KOLEDA: It was sporadic.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.530
IKAI LAN: Yeah, so we've
addressed that.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.120
So now you should be able to
use LockService service to

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.410
lock sections of you
code so you don't--

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.805
it's called erase condition,
where if you make a change,

00:15:33.805 --> 00:15:36.190
and Eric makes a change, you can
lock something so he can't

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.870
overwrite my change in the
middle of my change.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.680
Now, that doesn't mean he can't
come back later and just

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.390
undo my change.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.350
ERIC KOLEDA: Right.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.390
IKAI LAN: But at least you won't
get things in a weird

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.680
state, which is typically what
you want to use something like

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.540
LockService for.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.800
Like let's say you had to modify
two things, right?

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.800
You want to edit a doc
and send an email.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.870
And you made sure you wanted
those things to happen one

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.900
after the other, and
you didn't want

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.700
anything else to interrupt.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.710
You can use LockService to get
a lock, and lock that so that

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.570
only one script can execute
that at any given time.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.160
ERIC KOLEDA: If you're writing
a script just for yourself,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.050
these problems don't come up.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.940
But with an organization or a
script that maybe has even

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.980
broader usage, you could get two
people hitting the script

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.630
at almost the exact
same second, and

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:15.480
that could cause problems.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.380
So the LockService, it's good
that that's back in action.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.480
IKAI LAN: We've also added a
little bit of syntactical

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.730
sugar, as we like to call it,
to embedded chart builder.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.160
So when you're building an
embedded chart for a

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.860
spreadsheet, it's a
little bit nicer.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.330
I mean, I was fine with the way
before, but I'm sure there

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.930
was a good reason for these.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.890
ERIC KOLEDA: It's like we have
all of these strongly typed

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.760
charts, like area chart,
bar chart.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.110
Before, the embedded chart was
kind of just an ambiguous

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.130
chart with a collection
of options.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.195
Now, you can cast it back into a
chart that you know and that

00:16:42.195 --> 00:16:44.590
you've used before, and then use
some of the native methods

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:45.520
that are there on that chart.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.090
IKAI LAN: That's true.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.440
Although to be fair, there's
no reason set chart type

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.260
couldn't have done that
either, right?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.830
Oh, actually, I think
you're right.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.200
It is better this way.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:55.780
ERIC KOLEDA: I think it
acts as the native

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.920
methods of that chart.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.800
IKAI LAN: Right, right.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.400
Whereas with set chart type,
you might not get

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.390
auto-complete if you needed
another method or something.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.320
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, just a little
syntactic sugar there.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.380
IKAI LAN: Good things,
good things.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:05.690
All right.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.849
So I think those are
the big things.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:09.030
There's a few more issues
that we've addressed.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.089
So if you want to see the full
list of what went out these

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.035
last few weeks, go to
developers.googl

00:17:13.035 --> 00:17:17.690
e.com/apps-script and click on
Release Notes, and you'll see

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:18.940
everything that we've
been doing.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.329
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:24.313
There was something else that
went out that we didn't put in

00:17:24.313 --> 00:17:25.079
the Release Notes.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:25.747
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, that's what
we're going to talk about

00:17:25.747 --> 00:17:25.999
right now, right?

00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:29.430
IKAI LAN: Let's talk
about it right now.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.377
ERIC KOLEDA: And we're for sure
referring to the Cloud

00:17:30.377 --> 00:17:31.240
SQL integration, right?

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.830
IKAI LAN: I am referring to
Cloud SQL integration.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.370
ERIC KOLEDA: So that was just
announced yesterday.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.980
It wasn't on our blog,
but the Cloud SQL

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.120
blog included it there.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.080
Essentially as Ikai mentioned
before, Cloud SQL is a

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.140
Google-hosted MySQL database.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.000
And you're relying on Google
infrastructure, and you don't

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.880
have to worry about security.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.540
Connections are all secured by
OAuth2, so it's really quite a

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.130
nice product.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.030
And while we had the ability to
connect to SQL databases in

00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:00.220
the past in App Script using the
JDBC service, you couldn't

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.690
connect to Cloud SQL.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.600
Because it had that extra OAuth
layer, it just didn't

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.010
work via the normal means.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:09.200
So we now have a separate
method in the JDBC class

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.870
called "get Cloud
SQL connection."

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.310
And what's great about this is
that it uses the user's OAuth.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.420
You just have to click an
"I approve" dialogue.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.280
But then you don't need to worry
about user names and

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.680
passwords if you
don't want to.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.550
There's still the option to pass
in optional user name and

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.120
password to have fine-grained
controls configured within

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.020
your MySQL database.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.350
But just to connect, all you
need to do is to have access

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:34.200
to that Google Cloud SQL
database in the APIs console,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:34.892
and then you're good to go.

00:18:34.892 --> 00:18:36.260
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.090
Cloud SQL has got a lot of
benefits when you want to use

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:39.160
it with something like
Apps Script, right?

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.870
Which is that prior to Cloud
SQL, you might want to have a

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.120
JDBC connection to your
SQL database.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.790
Now, the problem is that you'd
have to put it somewhere which

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.880
is accessible via the
open internet.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.520
And of course, you'd secure it
with a user name and password,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.080
but still, it's like do I
really want to do this?

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.000
I don't know.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.190
Now, that's not say that people
who are doing it now

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.510
aren't doing a great
job because--

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:02.950
ERIC KOLEDA: You just have
to be aware of the risks.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:03.530
IKAI LAN: Exactly.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.400
And with Cloud SQL you can
completely lock it down to

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.450
just Apps Script.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.830
So if you're interested in
looking at this search for

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.945
Google Cloud SQL, you're going
to need to enable the Cloud

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.020
SQL service.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.710
And once you've enabled it,
that's when you can go ahead

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:18.690
and start running Apps Script.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.570
You do need to do this via the
Google API console first.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.280
It's not just going to
work out of the box.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.700
You can't expect to
get Cloud SQL

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.730
connection and have it work.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.310
ERIC KOLEDA: There's a caveat to
the way that the Cloud SQL

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.800
connection works today
from Apps Script.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.440
There's a limitation in that
whoever is the effective user

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.030
of your script, that's the
user whose docs you're

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.120
accessing or Gmail you're
accessing, whoever the script

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.440
is running as, that user
currently today needs to have

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.290
access directly to the Cloud
SQL database instance.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:53.120
That means having access to
that APIs console project.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.180
So if you have a script that's
published, that runs as you

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.380
the owner, and maybe it's
a web app, that's fine.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.190
You are the owner.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.940
It runs as you.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:01.142
You have access.

00:20:01.142 --> 00:20:02.210
We're good to go.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.170
The problem comes when you want
to have a script that

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.810
runs as the user, where let's
say you publish a web app, and

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.470
you want to allow anybody in the
world to sign in, approve

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.090
your script, and then
run as them.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.070
That means that each individual
person would need

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.730
to have access to the database
in order for this to work.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.310
And obviously, you don't know
who these people are sometimes

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.260
ahead of time.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.900
Or even an organization, it
could be difficult to give all

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.430
1,000 people in your
organization access.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.100
So that limitation today makes
it so that it may not be

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.470
appropriate for all use cases.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.870
So we talked a little bit more
about this This in our JDBC

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:30.490
documentation.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.790
You can read about it there.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.020
But it's just a caveat upfront
that the way it exists today,

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.560
it may not work for
all scenarios.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.420
And we are looking at improving
this integration

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.585
going forward so that we can
really open it up to

00:20:40.585 --> 00:20:41.980
even more use cases.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.220
IKAI LAN: But there are
definitely benefits to having

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.040
a SQL database available.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.890
We have a lot of persistence
options right now.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:48.930
We've got SQL.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.050
We've got Cloud SQL.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.230
So if you're going to go with
the SQL family, definitely

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.580
consider Cloud SQL
as an option.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.610
On top of those two, we have
ScriptDb, which it's more so

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.850
much with document database.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.285
And I know we want to talk more
about that at some point

00:21:03.285 --> 00:21:05.200
in a future show.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.000
We also have user properties,
which are good for storing a

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.800
small amount of data, but it's
very, very easy to use.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.940
And we have cache.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.460
Don't store any important
data in the cache.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.300
I cannot stress this enough.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.590
ERIC KOLEDA: It goes away.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.130
IKAI LAN: All the time.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:18.680
ERIC KOLEDA: It's cache.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.130
IKAI LAN: And of course, we have
spreadsheets, which have

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.870
all the benefits to having UI
functions and all the things

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.390
that spreadsheets can do.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.710
So thank you for that.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:27.445
Thank you for introduction.

00:21:27.445 --> 00:21:27.700
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, no problem.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.890
IKAI LAN: So why don't
we go ahead.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:29.750
We have a few minutes left.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.570
So let's move to some of the
Q&amp;A and some of the live

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:33.580
participants.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.666
Is anyone on air?

00:21:35.666 --> 00:21:36.120
We have

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:36.920
ERIC KOLEDA: Some guests.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.880
IKAI LAN: We have a
couple of folks.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.090
Hey, guys.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.510
John, is that you?

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.700
Yup, I see him waving.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.140
This is John Coffman from
Washington, DC.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.860
He's not shy.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.200
He just likes to participate
in the show.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.120
But welcome.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.360
Let's see who else is there.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.710
I can't see who that is.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.060
There's a box blocking
my view.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.620
But if you want to say hi, just
jump in any time and say

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.490
how are you're doing.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.760
Otherwise we're going to
move into the Q&amp;A.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.810
Let me refresh this page.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.370
It looks like we have only one
right now, which is "Does a

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.190
deep integration Apps Script
into Google Docs, such as

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.880
triggers, custom context menu,
like with spreadsheets, is

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.750
this on the road map?"

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.960
Well, we don't publish
a roadmap.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.390
But this is something that we're
thinking a lot about

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.700
because we saw how popular
it is to expose this in

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.710
spreadsheets, right?

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.130
To expose especially
the context menu.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.800
So we're definitely looking
at different ways

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.660
that we can do this.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.140
But this is something we're
thinking a lot about.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.100
We've got nothing to announce
right now, and we don't have

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.370
anything to announce soon.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.660
But keep an eye out
on our blog.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.160
Watch the show every
once in a while.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.380
Watch the show every week.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.910
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, one of the
things that the project

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.030
manager of Apps Script-- who we
know very well-- is always

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.210
mentioning is that he
loves use cases.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.200
Whenever someone says I want
something, he'll always ask

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.200
himself, well, why?

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:56.870
What does that do?

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.790
What does that open up?

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.270
What does that allow that you
can't do today, right?

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.510
So whenever you have a request,
if you want to know

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:03.470
what about this feature?

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.170
What about that?

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.320
Give us more background.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.060
Let us know how that could open
up new possibilities or

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.140
that there's a key script that
your company needs that that

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:11.910
could help you with.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.960
And that'll really help us get
the context we need to decide

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.370
how to build a feature, how
important it is, and those

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.140
kind of activities.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.350
IKAI LAN: One thing, for
instance, that comes to my

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.170
mind, and people have definitely
come to me with

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.890
this question, is well, a lot of
companies do things-- they

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.180
have what's called a workflow.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.200
So you want to work on
something, and I have to

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.870
approve it because I
don't trust you.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:34.420
I'm kidding.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.710
We do have a code review
process here at Google.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.700
So whenever we write code, it
has to be approved by at least

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.940
one more person before
it can be pushed out.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.700
And this is true of
documentation, too.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.590
So we understand
this use case.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.590
So one thing a lot of people
want to do is they might want

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.600
to have a Google Doc.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.045
And when you write a
doc, you might want

00:23:51.045 --> 00:23:52.500
to send it for approval.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.440
Well, right now, how
would you do this?

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.180
Well, you'd probably copy
and paste the URL,

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.240
put it in an email.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.640
I don't want to say
it's clunky.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.100
I mean, this is what probably
100% of people are doing is

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.020
right now, right?

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.050
Or you do share or something,
and there's not

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:04.670
a lot you can do.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.590
Now, wouldn't it be really cool
if you had a menu that

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.172
said send for approval, check
approval status, there's a

00:24:09.172 --> 00:24:12.370
little UI that tells you
what's going on.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.650
Then your manager's manager or
whoever is reviewing has a

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.670
dashboard of all the
approval statuses.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.900
I mean, this is what we talk
about when we say,

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.330
what's your use case?

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.150
What problem are you
trying to solve?

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.840
You let us know, and we will
figure out how to make this

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.150
work for you, if it's
legitimate.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.080
ERIC KOLEDA: We want to give you
the tools you need to do

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:31.650
useful things.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.370
That's why we're here, right?

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.820
IKAI LAN: Exactly.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.490
ERIC KOLEDA: Yes, so I think
this falls in that category,

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.700
and we're going to continue to
look at it, but we don't have

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.950
any road map to announce.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.050
IKAI LAN: Does anyone
on the live

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.310
show want to say anything?

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:49.265
Do you want to say hi, or do you
guys have any questions?

00:24:49.265 --> 00:24:50.370
Uh-oh.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:50.780
Hold on.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.660
We've got to turn
your audio up.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.550
JOHN COFFMAN: Did you
check the chat?

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:53.690
ERIC KOLEDA: Here we go.

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:54.310
IKAI LAN: The chat.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.557
We need to check the chat.

00:24:55.557 --> 00:24:56.690
JOHN COFFMAN: Did you
check the chat?

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.270
ERIC KOLEDA: Unfortunately, we
don't have the chat loaded up

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.570
on our laptops in front of us.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:02.890
IKAI LAN: Maybe we should--
we've got to find a way to

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.240
disable that chat because--

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.540
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, some people
like the chat, though.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.530
We probably should just join.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:09.260
IKAI LAN: It's too many
options, though.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.150
ERIC KOLEDA: Could you read
what's in the chat?

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.400
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:15.496
Hold on.

00:25:15.496 --> 00:25:18.890
I can't hear you right
now, sorry.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:20.970
Oh, I think you're muted.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.340
JOHN COFFMAN: The reason
I don't talk much

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.970
is my mic is crappy.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.470
IKAI LAN: Oh, your mic
sounds fine to me.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.730
JOHN COFFMAN: When you're
talking about the deep

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.290
integration with Word--

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.130
two weeks ago we talked about
that for Forms as well.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.890
So let me just bring
it up again that

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:37.770
that would be super.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.240
IKAI LAN: For Forms
in Google Groups?

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.150
JOHN COFFMAN: Because for
example, in the--

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.170
ERIC KOLEDA: No,
I think Forms.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:41.640
JOHN COFFMAN: --when you
send out the form--

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:41.975
IKAI LAN: Forms!

00:25:41.975 --> 00:25:43.082
I see.

00:25:43.082 --> 00:25:44.360
JOHN COFFMAN: Yeah.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.540
So when I send out the form, and
it's going to 40 different

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.095
people, it would be nice to be
able to check the spreadsheet

00:25:50.095 --> 00:25:54.230
and tell them 20 have
already responded.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.860
Or to send out the form and say,
OK, your particular form

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.370
has to deal with apples, and
so at the top, we have some

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.080
information about apples.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.960
And for another person, their
query on the form has to do

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.210
with bananas, so I'd like to go
to the spreadsheet and put

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.030
my bananas information
at the top of that.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:19.820
So the forms would be somewhat
customized for each person to

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.180
whom they're sent.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:21.710
IKAI LAN: I see.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:22.930
ERIC KOLEDA: That's
interesting, yeah.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:27.540
I do remember talking about
Forms coming up in the past.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.330
And I think one of the issues
there is that the way Forms is

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.980
built today, it doesn't
have any plugs, right?

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.845
There's no dynamic stuff
that happens.

00:26:34.845 --> 00:26:38.320
It's kind of you just get the
form and you fill it out.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.340
I think our answer in the past,
and you've probably

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.470
heard it from us before, has
been you can build your own

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.580
forms like UI apps, text boxes,
labels, submit buttons,

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.335
forms, data storage.

00:26:47.335 --> 00:26:50.600
Obviously you don't want to
build it all from scratch, but

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.300
the ability is there.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.410
And I think it's interesting
maybe to find what are some

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.600
points we can plug into Forms
that are simple and would open

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.110
up a lot of possibilities
without having to make all of

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.590
Forms turn into all
of UI app, right?

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.315
Where everything is
reconfigurable.

00:27:07.315 --> 00:27:09.160
If there's some sort of middle
ground we could find, that may

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.010
be useful to look at.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.150
IKAI LAN: Yeah, I mean, it's
also tough, because I can also

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.480
see why you would want
that ability.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.910
Because on the one hand, anyone
who's a developer can

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.530
easily put together a form with
information they want.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.240
But now, you want to roll this
out to your non-developers and

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.050
give them a tool that's as
easy to use as Google

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:28.780
Spreadsheet's Forms where it's
not exactly drag-and-drop, but

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.410
it's kind of like
click-and-type.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:31.900
So it's pretty good.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.630
It's easy to use,
easy to set up.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:35.560
But I don't know.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.570
I wonder does it get too
complex at some point?

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.550
Forms already has some branching
functionality.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.040
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, there's
like, if you answer this

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.290
question, then go to this
page or skip that page.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.070
IKAI LAN: But I've always
found-- and maybe this is just

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.030
the way my brain works, which is
visual programming is very

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.030
hard, you know, defining
logic like that.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.890
For instance, there's that
Android project that's owned

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.610
by MIT that lets you program
Android Apps like putting

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.280
puzzles together.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.884
And I was doing this, and I'm
going, this is harder than

00:28:02.884 --> 00:28:04.700
actually programming.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.890
Like it didn't make
any sense, but--

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:06.880
ERIC KOLEDA: As a programmer,
I guess.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.460
It's probably harder.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.280
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.250
I can see what-- but there's
a point where it

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.740
does get too complex.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.790
ERIC KOLEDA: Thanks for
the feedback, though.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:19.030
But, yeah, I think we couldn't
just turn on like complete

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.160
manipulation of everything
dynamically, based on--

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.190
I think that could be a bit
challenging to even enable if

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.280
we wanted to, if we made
that a full-time--

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.010
IKAI LAN: What is cool is that
Spreadsheets does have a

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.030
get-form URL, an API call.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.150
So depending on what it is
people need to do, there could

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.100
be multiple spreadsheets,
emailing, different links

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.395
depending on the user, but there
are limitations with

00:28:39.395 --> 00:28:40.310
that solution as well.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.550
But there are ways of creating
this sort of

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.370
thing with Apps Script.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.080
So John, was there anything
else in chat?

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.190
I'm asking because we have
about a minute left.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.180
JOHN COFFMAN: Nope, that's it.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:52.750
Thanks, guys.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.730
IKAI LAN: No problem.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.770
I saw your comment "When are we
going to have a Hackathon

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:58.520
in Washington, DC.?" I've got
to give you the "nothing to

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.530
announce." But we are thinking
about doing some

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:03.800
stuff in New York City.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.875
So hopefully, that's
not too far.

00:29:06.875 --> 00:29:08.260
JOHN COFFMAN: No,
that's great.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.640
IKAI LAN: Yeah, so we'll see
what we can do because these

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.410
are a very popular.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.920
I want to do one in New York
City, but everyone was like,

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.590
oh, we always do them
in New York City.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.060
But that was like two
years ago, right?

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.250
A year ago, two years ago.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.120
I mean, I think we're due.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:20.906
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, why not?

00:29:20.906 --> 00:29:22.790
IKAI LAN: Yeah, we've got
a good office there.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.900
JOHN COFFMAN: You can do it
in my living room, and

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.980
I'll buy the pizza.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.580
ERIC KOLEDA: He'll eat
a whole pie, though.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.465
I don't know if that's
sustainable.

00:29:28.465 --> 00:29:29.430
IKAI LAN: I'm very jealous--

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.660
JOHN COFFMAN: And Diet Coke.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:33.090
IKAI LAN: --you can fit 60
people in your living room.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:33.820
Yeah, OK.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.850
Well, listen.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.690
Just stay tuned and watch the
blog, and we'll definitely

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:37.850
post if we have more
external events.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:38.240
JOHN COFFMAN: Super.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.020
Thanks, guys.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.200
IKAI LAN: No problem.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.610
So I think that's about it.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.430
ERIC KOLEDA: That does
it for today.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:43.760
IKAI LAN: That does
it for today.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.340
Oh, I forgot.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.520
I totally forgot to plug
something that's happening

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.840
next week, and I should have
done this in the beginning.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.090
ERIC KOLEDA: Go for it.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:54.150
IKAI LAN: Which is next
Thursday, we're having a very

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.580
special show, which is we're
going to be talking about

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.210
using Google Analytics
with Apps Script.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.810
I'm going to be back at the
mother ship in Mountain View

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.570
to take care of a
couple things.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.620
But when I'm on the West Coast
I've roped in one of my

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.500
friends who's on the Google
Analytics team.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.570
He wrote the very popular blog
post about using Google

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:13.870
Analytics with Google
Apps Script.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:14.170
ERIC KOLEDA: That's
been so popular.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.330
IKAI LAN: And we're going
to have a show.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:16.410
ERIC KOLEDA: That's perfect.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.380
IKAI LAN: Talk about
doing that stuff.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.440
And we are also going to have
"Office Hours." It's going to

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:26.020
take place next Wednesday
at 3:30 PM Eastern.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.270
Whereas the other show, the
Analytics show is Thursday at

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.150
I believe it's 2:30
PM Pacific time.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:35.130
So if time zones are confusing
you right now, go to

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.780
developers.google.com/live and
just look for the event.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.560
It's called "Making Sense of
your Analytics," or something.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.790
Anyway, it's next Thursday.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:44.100
Look for it.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.690
There's a couple of shows
going on that day.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:46.530
ERIC KOLEDA: It's exciting.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.890
IKAI LAN: And I'm excited to
try doing this show from a

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.030
different studio.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.620
I'm curious-- you know New York
City, West Coast, what

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.180
the differences are there.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:55.620
ERIC KOLEDA: East Coast,
West Coast?

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.530
IKAI LAN: East Coast,
West Coast.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:58.680
ERIC KOLEDA: All right,
we'll figure it out.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.830
IKAI LAN: Anyway, thank you
guys are joining us.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.910
And if not joining us live,
thank you guys for watching

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:04.070
this whole thing.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:06.460
We try to keep it fun
for you guys.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.100
Until next time, I'm Ikai Lan.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:08.900
ERIC KOLEDA: And I'm
Eric Koleda.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.250
IKAI LAN: All right.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:09.960
Bye guys.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.460
ERIC KOLEDA: Bye.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:23.467
