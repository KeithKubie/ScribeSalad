00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.138
- Hi, this is Thomas Lennon.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.539 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is an @Midnight
Masterclass,

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.441
and I love wine.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.577
I'm a wine enthusiast,

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.645 align:start size:94% position:6%
and today, I'm going to
show you just a little bit

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.781
about when you're tasting
wine so you can impress

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.449 align:start size:81% position:19%
your friends at
fancy restaurants.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.118
But also, I thought
it would be fun,

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.753
since I'm already blindfolded,

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.022
to show you how to
escape if your hands

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.523
had been zip tied.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.229
A lot of people smell corks

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.430
when they take wine.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.798
People wanna act
like they're fancy.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.099
So they go like that.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.567
That is absolutely nothing.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.103 align:start position:0%
You're never gonna really
learn much from smelling corks.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.006
What you wanna do with
a cork is look at it

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.708
because you wanna
see if it's wet.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.978
If the cork is dry, the wine
will be positively ruined.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.914
A lot of people in
the world are snobs

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.582
about screw top wines,

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.184
but I'll tell you a thing
about a screw top wine.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:55.655 align:start position:0%
You will never get a corked
bottle of wine with a screw top.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:56.923
I swear to God,

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:57.824
I really felt like
their was a raccoon

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:58.758
sneaking up on me,

00:00:58.758 --> 00:00:59.926
(laughter)

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.161
as this was happening,

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.095
but it was just the
sound of the cork

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:02.929
rolled off the table, right?

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:03.863
Okay.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.065
So a lot of people look at wines

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.366 align:start size:88% position:13%
through, ah, you can
hold it up to the light,

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.002
and you're looking at
what's called the legs.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.371 align:start size:97% position:3%
That means just how much
stays on the side of the glass

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.572
when you hold it up.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.574
And it could indicate

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.142
that if there's like
tannins in the wine,

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.510
or if there's a lot of sugars,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.978
if it's kind of like
a thick wine or not.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.380
It doesn't necessarily
mean if it's good or bad.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.949 align:start size:84% position:16%
It just is what
the legs look like.

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:24.184
And there's the nose,

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:25.185
where you kind of
smell the wine.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.087
I stick my nose way in it.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.721
Ahhh.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.223
Ahhh.

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.524
And I smell it really hard

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.827
because I did a ton of
cocaine in the '90s,

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.397
so I don't have the most
amazing sense of smell.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.199
A lot of people spin it around.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.667
The reason you're spinning it.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.902 align:start size:97% position:3%
One, it's fun to do if
you've got attention deficit

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.938 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it's like a
little fidget spinner.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.573
Two, it just is adding,

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.008
you're getting more
oxygen in the wine

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.078
and the air is opening it
up and letting it breathe.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:55.115
And then, the finish is what
it tastes like on your tongue.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.015
So you kind of get air.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:56.983
What I always do,

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.518
and it looks sort of tacky,

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.187
but I literally just suck air
over the wine on my tongue,

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:03.656 align:start size:88% position:13%
but if you're in a
really fancy restaurant,

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.091 align:start size:94% position:6%
people will assume that
you know what you're doing

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:07.760
and they won't think it's gross.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.831
(slurp)

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.702
Again, I did a ton of
cocaine in the '90s,

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:16.936
so it's taking me a second.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:17.904
Oh, the other great
thing about wine,

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.372
is it gets,

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.474
as you do this and you
kind of be a smarty pants

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:22.408
with your friends,

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.676
it also gets you (beep) up.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.579
There's a (beep) ton of
rules about wine, guys,

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.215
and I'm mostly a comedian.

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.017
Anyway, that's everything
I know about tasting wine.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:31.851
Uhhhh.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.587
Get (beep) up, guys.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.788
Then (boom) get kidnapped.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.290
And when you get kidnapped,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.325
somebody might zip tie
your hands together,

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.393
and when you do,

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:42.095
what you wanna do is,

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.429
from way up high,

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.698
use the force of your body.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.570 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm gonna slam my hands
down across my midsection,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.273 align:start size:94% position:6%
and basically use my
abdomen like a guillotine

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.541
to split me out of these.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:55.808
And they can be as
tight as they want,

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.877 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they can be way
bigger than this, too.

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.345
And three, two, one.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.146
Ahhh!

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.149
That's how to get
out of zip ties.

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:07.020 align:start size:88% position:13%
That's some of the
stuff I know about wine,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.089 align:start size:84% position:16%
and this is an
@Midnight Masterclass.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.094 align:start size:94% position:6%
I feel like the
@Midnight crew just found

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.030
an old napkin that's tied
around my face right now,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.565
which is hilarious,

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.066
but I'm also a major germophobe,

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.335
so we'll see how that goes.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:24.337 align:start size:84% position:16%
But I do feel like
this was just a napkin

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.606
that somebody found, right?

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.541
- [Crew Member] Uhhhhh.
