00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.309
I’m certain my wife would not agree that
I have good listening skills.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.230
It’s human nature: you get preoccupied with
your own thoughts, and when I’m busy thinking

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.160
about something I don’t hear very well,
because my brain is sort of already engaged

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.831
and I don’t necessarily turn noise into
a cogent-enough thought that it gets in and

00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:30.949
I actually acknowledge what somebody is saying—so
I’m just as guilty as anyone of not being

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.550
a good listener.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.890
I think in order to overcome that you have
to deliberately listen, and not just to the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.220
words, not just the text, but what was the
reason behind the text?

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.040
What do those words mean culturally?

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.790
How did the person say them and why?

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.180
Why did they say them now?

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.250
What’s the sense of urgency?

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.379
What is the actual message they’re trying
to get across?

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.760
And so, of course, the best way to verify
all that is to engage in discussion.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.979
Repeat back what you think you heard.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:08.800
A really clinical example is where Mission
Control is calling up something important

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.729
to the spaceship and we know that communication
is lousy—there’s little tiny speakers

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.170
and it’s radios and it’s clipped and it’s
digitized, and so we can’t just count on

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.210
everybody immediately understanding and having
good listening skills.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.350
So we have like, “Houston, station.”

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.329
“Station, Houston, I’m listening.”

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.400
“Okay Houston what I wanted to talk to you
about was—whatever—the carbon dioxide

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.219
removal equipment, and there’s a problem
with the CDRA today and I’m in the checklist

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.789
on page 221 part B, let me know when you’re
there.”

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:43.789
“Okay.

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:44.789
All right.

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:45.799
I’m open to that page now.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.390
Go ahead.”

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.130
So think about how that communication is happening.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.909
You’ve gotten their attention, they’ve
told you “okay you have my attention”

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.979
and “now this is the thing I’m talking
about are you on the same page as me?”

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.979
“Yes.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.140
I am on the same page as you.”

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.140
“Okay.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.009
Now that both of us are on the same page now
let’s actually discuss why we’re trying

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.719
to accomplish this thing.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.719
What are the details?

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:09.719
What do we need to know?

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:10.819
What do you know that I don’t know?”

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.459
And then come to a mutual conclusion of “Okay
this is what I’m going to do.”

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.709
“Yep I agree that’s what you’re going
to do.”

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.180
It’s so incredibly formalized: we’re talking
with the ground, but it’s a microcosm of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.909
a regular conversation between any two people,
we just maybe aren’t quite as rigorous about

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:27.909
it.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.540
But I think you should keep that in mind,
if you’re trying to be a good listener,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.310
picture how the ground listens to a spaceship
and try and be that person.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.180
Truly give them your attention.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.280
Try and get on the same page.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.540
Question, have a conversation.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.280
Make sure you understand the intent.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.730
Repeat it back.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.660
And then get your actions verified after you
do them.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.080
And if you can manage to do all those things,
even quickly, then I think you have the best

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.120
chance of being a good communicator—and
more importantly, a good listener.
