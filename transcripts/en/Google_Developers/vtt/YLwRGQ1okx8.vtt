&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: So to talk a little bit about
how we actually made this all work, I will

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:06.120
pass it over to Vincent who can actually talk
about it.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.730
&gt;&gt;Vincent Dureau: Sure. So the hardware itself
is going to feel very familiar to anybody

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.830
here who watches TV. There is going to be
TV sets, Blu-Ray players, and companion set-top

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.090
boxes. And they are going to be very easy
to install because they are going to work

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.730
with your existing cable or satellite box
no matter who your pay TV operator is.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.339
So what about the spec itself?
There are actually four key components to

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:43.949
the Google TV hardware spec. Number one, Wi-Fi
and Ethernet built in, of course.

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:50.329
Number two, you are going to connect your
existing cable or satellite box to the Google

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:58.940
TV box using a regular HDMI cable.
In addition, the Google TV box comes with

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.850
an I/O blaster built in which is what we are
going to use for control.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.250
By the way, in addition to this, we have also
implemented a special IP protocol between

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.600
the Google TV boxes and DISH Network set-top
boxes, and that's the configuration we are

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.030
using today and it gives us really tight integration
with the pay TV box. In particular, for instance,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.920
that's how I was able to do a one-click recording
schedule.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.670
Number three, plenty of processing power so
that we can browse the entire Web. There is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.500
also going to be a GPU for enhanced 2D and
3D graphics, and a dedicated DSP that can

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.369
do video in high def and audio in surround
sound.

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.109
And then number four, there is the Google
TV input devices. They are all going to include

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:56.619
a keyboard and a pointing device so we can
actually navigate Web pages.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.479
And our hardware partners have come up with
designs that I think you are going to love.
