00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.446
Many argue that this campaign gave birth to

00:00:02.446 --> 00:00:06.130
modern demand advertising. The objective here was not demand

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.360
generation nor branch strengthening. But simply to impress the

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.360
glamor, the sentiment and the emotional charge contained in

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.950
the product, itself. The company gave diamonds to

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.790
movie stars. They sent out press packets emphasizing the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.590
size of diamonds that celebrities gave each other. They

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.250
loaned diamonds to prominent socialites attending events like the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.550
Kentucky Derby or the Academy Awards. And even persuaded the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.780
British royal family to wear diamonds over other gems. Later,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.340
De Beers sought to market diamond rings to couples as

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.029
a status symbol. To reflect quote, a man's success in life.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.700
A 1980's add introduced the famous two month bench

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.690
mark. Isn't two months salary a small price to pay

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.570
for something that lasts forever? By any reasonable measure, Francis

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.110
Geary succeeded. Getting engaged in America means getting a diamond

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.480
ring. Can you think of a movie where two people

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.620
get engaged with out a diamond? When you get engaged

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.920
on Facebook, what icon does the site display? Still think

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.560
this might not be the most successful mass persuasion effort

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.420
in history? I present to you a James Bond film. Whose title bears

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.520
the diamond cartel's trademark. Awe-inspiring and a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.500
little terrifying. Let's open the data set.
