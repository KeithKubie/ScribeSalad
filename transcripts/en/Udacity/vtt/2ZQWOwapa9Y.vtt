00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.252
Let's walk through the tasks
you need to accomplish to take

00:00:03.252 --> 00:00:04.725
GIFMaker to the next level.

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:08.550
You want to be able to save a GIF and
display it in a collection.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.080
So you'll need to implement
a collection view.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.760
You want the user to be able to view the
details of each GIF in the collection.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.090
So you'll also need to set
up a detail view controller.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.870
You want to be able to persist GIFs,
which we'll do with NSKeyedArchiver.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.210
And then in the end, you'll want
to add some finishing touches,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.360
including styling, and
the first time user experience.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.120
Let's start by focusing in
on the first two tasks.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.800
Save a GIF and
view GIFs in a collection.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.760
In order to save a GIF, you'll need to
create the SavedGifsViewController and

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.350
configure the
PreviewViewControllerDelegate.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.730
In order to view GIFs in a collection,
you'll need to implement the necessary

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.400
protocols, starting with the
CollectionViewDatasource protocol and

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.000
the CollectionViewFlowLayout protocol.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.630
You'll also need to create a custom
class for the CollectionViewCell.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.350
Let's get started by creating
the SavedGifsViewController.
