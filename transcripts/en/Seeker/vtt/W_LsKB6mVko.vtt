00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.219
Sunspots are getting bigger and more numerous.

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:05.549
This can only mean the end of the world.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.540
Or, y’know, business as usual.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.230
It’s a toss up.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.500
Hey there stargazers and soothsayers, Julian
here for DNews.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.460
The Sun is a mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic
nuclear furnace, everyone knows that.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.470
But there’s a lot more going on than just
slamming hydrogen together, not that that

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.210
isn’t pretty sweet on it’s own.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.070
The Sun, like most celestial bodies, is also
rotating on an axis.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.070
Big deal right?

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.230
Well the cool part is, it’s not all rotating
at the same speed.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.690
Because the exterior of the sun isn’t a
solid crust like Earth’s, the equator of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.440
the sun is actually spinning much faster than
the poles.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.969
If you were standing on the Sun’s equator
you would make a trip around it in 25 days,

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.760
whereas if you were standing by the poles
it would take 36 days to make a revolution.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.039
That’s kind of like standing on Panama and
surfing it until you’re just south of Russia

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.390
12 hours later.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.030
And when you factor in that the Sun’s plasma
is linked to it’s magnetic field, things

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.569
get twisted.

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:02.710
Literally.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.800
After a while the magnetic field lines look
like your headphones after you left them in

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.800
your pocket.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.360
And then put your pants through the dryer.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.830
The magnetic field in turn has an effect on
the convection layer of the Sun, meaning some

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.460
areas don’t get piping hot 5,500 degrees
celsius plasma from the sun’s interior,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.180
and the stagnating plasma on the surface cools
to a frigid 2,700 to 4,200 degrees celsius.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.500
These areas are still giving off light, but
compared to the rest of the sun they look

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.500
black.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.110
They’re what we call Sun Spots.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.450
And because they’re areas of intense magnetic
twistification, Sun Spots tend to be where

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.250
solar flares and coronal mass ejections originate.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.960
Basically the magnetic field lines snap, and
sling matter and electromagnetic radiation

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.780
and massive amounts of energy off into space.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.940
And pretty soon, a great big sun spot is going
to be pointing right at us.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.840
The sexily named AR2192 has been getting bigger
and bigger as it rotates towards us.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.190
It’s solar flares are crossing the threshold
to the X class, meaning they have the potential

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.730
to briefly knock out radio communication planet-wide
and I bet you anything it happens during the

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.730
World Series.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.190
If you watched the partial solar eclipse yesterday
you could even see it with the naked eye (Side

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.150
note: DO NOT watch a solar eclipse with the
naked eye).

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.330
Surely this is the harbinger of doom!

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.430
Well, not really, sunspots are on an 11 year
cycle.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.760
They get bigger and more numerous for a while
and then the magnetic field untangles itself

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.370
and we do it all over again.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.870
Now if only the same trick worked for those
headphones.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.560
If you want to find out what happens when
the Earth’s magnetic fields reverse, I’d

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.760
like to draw you to Tara’s video down here.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.670
Is there another apocalyptic scenario you
want us to look into?

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.160
Let us know in the comments.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.810
Thanks for watching DNews… or if you watched
the eclipse unprotected, thanks for listening!
