some years ago the grand challenge in

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959
some years ago the grand challenge in
 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.140
some years ago the grand challenge in
computer science or one of them was to

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150
computer science or one of them was to
 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.960
computer science or one of them was to
build a machine that could beat a chess

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970
build a machine that could beat a chess
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.080
build a machine that could beat a chess
grandmaster some may remember with us

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090
grandmaster some may remember with us
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.879
grandmaster some may remember with us
and we built machines that got better

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
and we built machines that got better
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.589
and we built machines that got better
and better at it but finally built a

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599
and better at it but finally built a
 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.720
and better at it but finally built a
machine back in the 90s called deep blue

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
machine back in the 90s called deep blue
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.340
machine back in the 90s called deep blue
and it played against Garry Kasparov and

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350
and it played against Garry Kasparov and
 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.290
and it played against Garry Kasparov and
it beat Garry Kasparov and I think he's

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
it beat Garry Kasparov and I think he's
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.560
it beat Garry Kasparov and I think he's
still quite upset about why did we build

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570
still quite upset about why did we build
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.330
still quite upset about why did we build
that machine well it really wasn't to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
that machine well it really wasn't to
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.479
that machine well it really wasn't to
play chess it was to take a real

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
play chess it was to take a real
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.400

challenge chess and it would force

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410
challenge chess and it would force
 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.560
challenge chess and it would force
advances in computer science and it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
advances in computer science and it
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.549
advances in computer science and it
worked quite well

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
worked quite well
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.610
worked quite well
well that was chess and that was the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
well that was chess and that was the
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740
