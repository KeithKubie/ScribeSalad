00:00:03.034 --> 00:00:05.956
- This circular painting
by Robert Delaunay

00:00:05.956 --> 00:00:08.443
is one of many that takes advantage

00:00:08.443 --> 00:00:11.427
and really responds to the science

00:00:11.427 --> 00:00:13.723
of the beginning of the 20th century

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:15.163
and thinking about the heavens,

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:17.445
thinking about the movements
of the sun, the moon,

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.105
the planets as a kind of model

00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:23.549
for what abstract painting could be.

00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:27.172
You may note Delaunay
dates the picture 1912.

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:31.305
We now know, of course,
that it was painted in 1913.

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:34.197
There was such a kind
of rat-a-tat-tat barrage

00:00:34.197 --> 00:00:37.965
of new ideas that
artists had a great stake

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:40.640
in being the first one
to do what they did.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.085
In this case, something from 1913

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:45.945
is stated to have been from 1912.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.405
It's an era of invention.

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.145
It's an era of discovery.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:51.857
It's not an era of doing
what other people do.

00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:56.092
It's an era of doing what you're
doing before anybody else.

00:00:56.092 --> 00:00:59.125
Delaunay was very
interested in color theory,

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:03.185
and there were very complicated,
conflicting theorists

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:06.925
about complementary colors,
about primaries and secondaries,

00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:08.525
and paintings like this one

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.625
are where he tested out those theories,

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:13.924
the ways in which subtleties of shades

00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:16.804
actually bloom into new colors,

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:19.602
depending on the way the
artist combines them.

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:22.559
This painting has in its
title the word simultaneous,

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:26.144
an idea of movement, an
idea of passing of time.

00:01:26.144 --> 00:01:28.644
You're actually not
seeing something still,

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:30.764
because there are light
waves, there are sound waves,

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:32.244
there are particles.

00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:35.004
Artists at this time
were very conscious of

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.624
the many, many new aspects
of scientific thought

00:01:38.624 --> 00:01:41.364
that were upending the idea of the world,

00:01:41.364 --> 00:01:45.957
of space and of time as
a constant, stable given.

00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:48.291
They wanted to translate
that into their paintings,

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:50.004
and Delaunay did that into this painting

00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:51.484
and all of his paintings.
