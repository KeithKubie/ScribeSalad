00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.770
This hammer here is a fantastic
tool to build stuff.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.990
But in order for it to work, it needs
my immediate attention of energy.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.626
I can't just turn it on and
let it do its thing.

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:10.294
In today's affordable tool shed,

00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:13.196
we've only recently got a few
additions that are different.

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:15.479
These modern high end
tools like this 3D print-

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.083
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] We don't have the budget

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:20.167
for that.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:20.900
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.434
Modern tools like our 3D printer,
that's out for maintenance,

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:28.300
can be given a task that it then
performs autonomously until it's done.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.369
In today's life of a web developer,
we're seeing a similar trend,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.700
a large collection of tools that you
feed tasks and that then automate and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.150
improve many aspects of your workflow.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.060
Let's dive into
the world of build tools.
