I always used to think kind of UX or
interaction design was for people who

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390
interaction design was for people who
 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.799
interaction design was for people who
wore turtleneck sweaters and berries but

wore turtleneck sweaters and berries but
 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.810
wore turtleneck sweaters and berries but
actually turned out that UX is like

experiences on the web so we know
 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.270
experiences on the web so we know
Mobile's huge and if we're developers we

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280
Mobile's huge and if we're developers we
 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.490
Mobile's huge and if we're developers we
like how do we deal with this context

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500
like how do we deal with this context
 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.170
like how do we deal with this context
where we need to define and build for

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180
where we need to define and build for
 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.510

interaction styles so we have obviously

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290
interaction styles so we have obviously
 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.230
interaction styles so we have obviously
voice interaction that's a big thing on

voice interaction that's a big thing on
 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.880

all these things that didn't really
 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.130
all these things that didn't really
exist maybe one two years ago and if you

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140
exist maybe one two years ago and if you
 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.390

we could bridge that gap by how we could
 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.270
we could bridge that gap by how we could
start to use voice interactions how we

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280
start to use voice interactions how we
 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.190
start to use voice interactions how we
could start you swipe gestures and card

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200
could start you swipe gestures and card
 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.350
could start you swipe gestures and card
based interfaces but I looked at like

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360
based interfaces but I looked at like
 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.270
based interfaces but I looked at like
the well the top thousand sites

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280
the well the top thousand sites

originally and I was trying to assess
 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.260
originally and I was trying to assess
like what the common patterns are what

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270
like what the common patterns are what
 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.990

the mobile nosov the sites are and it
 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.310
the mobile nosov the sites are and it
was actually really startling we found

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320
was actually really startling we found
 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.020
was actually really startling we found
some really kind of interest in things

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030
some really kind of interest in things
 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.740

right they don't actually seem to think

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500
right they don't actually seem to think
 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.600
right they don't actually seem to think
that the mobile web is actually

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610
that the mobile web is actually
 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.699
that the mobile web is actually
important and this desktop experience is

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709
important and this desktop experience is
 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.920
important and this desktop experience is
actually pretty bad because basically

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930
actually pretty bad because basically
 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.360
actually pretty bad because basically
the browser way of the browser works is

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370
the browser way of the browser works is

desktop web the web is for desktops at
 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.920
desktop web the web is for desktops at
the moment so we're going to have to

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930
the moment so we're going to have to
 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.110
the moment so we're going to have to
scale everything down to fit on a mobile

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120
scale everything down to fit on a mobile
 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.060
scale everything down to fit on a mobile
device and if you look at some of the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070
device and if you look at some of the
 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.490
device and if you look at some of the
stats where from Nazi and I'll try and

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500
stats where from Nazi and I'll try and
 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.010
stats where from Nazi and I'll try and
share a link later on where users like

experiences this was a survey of a

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300
experiences this was a survey of a
 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.960
experiences this was a survey of a
thousand users at the time and no one is

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970
thousand users at the time and no one is

really catering for that at all in the
 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.220
really catering for that at all in the
mobile web we also find that 25% of

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230
mobile web we also find that 25% of

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160
viewport and this is an example of site
 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.830
viewport and this is an example of site
where basically you could scroll around

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840
where basically you could scroll around
 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.210
where basically you could scroll around
the site you couldn't zoom out from that

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220
the site you couldn't zoom out from that
 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.070
the site you couldn't zoom out from that
view it was terrible you can't zoom out

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080
view it was terrible you can't zoom out
 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.510
view it was terrible you can't zoom out
you have to pan around the user

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520
you have to pan around the user
 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.100
you have to pan around the user

not a great user experience and it's

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209
not a great user experience and it's
 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.570
not a great user experience and it's
quite common in the top 1,000 sites and

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580
quite common in the top 1,000 sites and
 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.500
quite common in the top 1,000 sites and
we found that a whole bunch of

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510
we found that a whole bunch of
 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.930
we found that a whole bunch of
developers I think it was actually 65%

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940
developers I think it was actually 65%
 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.880
developers I think it was actually 65%
of user sorry hated the fact that they

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890
of user sorry hated the fact that they
 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.830
of user sorry hated the fact that they
have to scroll around the content to

have to scroll around the content to

have to scroll around the content to
actually find me a piece of information

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160
actually find me a piece of information
 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.800
actually find me a piece of information
that they want to find

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810
that they want to find
 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.780
that they want to find
and then we found that 83% of sites had

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790
and then we found that 83% of sites had
 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.570
and then we found that 83% of sites had
hard to touch areas on the screen now

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580
hard to touch areas on the screen now
 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.540
hard to touch areas on the screen now
quite a lot of these sites were just

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550
quite a lot of these sites were just
 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.590
quite a lot of these sites were just
like maybe one or two little buttons

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600
like maybe one or two little buttons
 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.030
like maybe one or two little buttons
were kind of quite small but then you

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040
were kind of quite small but then you
 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.380
were kind of quite small but then you
get sites like I can use which I know a

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390
get sites like I can use which I know a
 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.430
get sites like I can use which I know a
lot of people read and love and I

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440
lot of people read and love and I
 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.960
lot of people read and love and I
actually love it as well but it's

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970
actually love it as well but it's
 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.430
actually love it as well but it's
completely not optimized for the mobile

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440
completely not optimized for the mobile
 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.540
completely not optimized for the mobile
experience and then when you actually

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550
experience and then when you actually
 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.730
experience and then when you actually
try and click on link the browser is a

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740
try and click on link the browser is a
 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.050
try and click on link the browser is a
really hard time trying to figure out

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060
really hard time trying to figure out
 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.990
really hard time trying to figure out
what you actually meant to click on and

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000
what you actually meant to click on and
 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.340
what you actually meant to click on and
this is this is actually a really hard

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350
this is this is actually a really hard
 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.260
this is this is actually a really hard
problem to solve at the moment well on a

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270
problem to solve at the moment well on a
 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.700
problem to solve at the moment well on a
desktop type of experience but you when

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710
desktop type of experience but you when
 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.100
desktop type of experience but you when
you build in mobile experiences it gets

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110
you build in mobile experiences it gets
 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.230
you build in mobile experiences it gets
a little bit easier and this is my blog

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240
a little bit easier and this is my blog
 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.380
a little bit easier and this is my blog
from ages ago it's horrible and if you

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390
from ages ago it's horrible and if you
 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.790
from ages ago it's horrible and if you
can see I'm not a graphics designer or

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800
can see I'm not a graphics designer or
 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.960
can see I'm not a graphics designer or
an interaction design or anything but

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970
an interaction design or anything but
 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.150
an interaction design or anything but
basically are the top 1,000 sites 60

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160
basically are the top 1,000 sites 60
 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.620
basically are the top 1,000 sites 60
percent of them had readability issues

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630
percent of them had readability issues
 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.330
percent of them had readability issues
and this actually comes from the fact

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340
and this actually comes from the fact
 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.370
and this actually comes from the fact
that if you're not developing a desktop

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380
that if you're not developing a desktop
 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.659
that if you're not developing a desktop
site and the site has toward not

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669
site and the site has toward not
 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:17.770
site and the site has toward not
developing a mobile site and the site

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780
developing a mobile site and the site
 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.210
developing a mobile site and the site
has to get squished down onto the mobile

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220
has to get squished down onto the mobile
 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.400
has to get squished down onto the mobile
device without zooming in you you have a

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410
device without zooming in you you have a
 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.080
device without zooming in you you have a
real hard time actually reading and

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090
real hard time actually reading and
 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.150
real hard time actually reading and
reading the text and if you see from

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160
reading the text and if you see from
 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.409
reading the text and if you see from
this screenshot actually what's Chrome's

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419
this screenshot actually what's Chrome's
 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.850
this screenshot actually what's Chrome's
tried to do is try to be clever and

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860
tried to do is try to be clever and
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.260
tried to do is try to be clever and
actually boost the font size as well

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270
actually boost the font size as well
 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.360
actually boost the font size as well
using the text auto-sizing that greg

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370
using the text auto-sizing that greg
 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.710
using the text auto-sizing that greg
talked about earlier on and I'm going to

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720
talked about earlier on and I'm going to
 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.600
talked about earlier on and I'm going to
kind of briefly talk about that later on

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610
kind of briefly talk about that later on
 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.670
kind of briefly talk about that later on
but basically text is not readable on

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680
but basically text is not readable on
 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.960
but basically text is not readable on

correct and I'm going to go through a

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090
correct and I'm going to go through a
 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.310

performance but it's also got this whole
area for user experience and what it

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:10.460
area for user experience and what it
 

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.399

the page we've looked at what the
 

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.240
the page we've looked at what the
content looks like and we're gonna tell

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.250
content looks like and we're gonna tell
 

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.740
content looks like and we're gonna tell
you the areas where we think you should

you the areas where we think you should
 

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.330
you the areas where we think you should
improve and if you've got a purely

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:19.340
improve and if you've got a purely
 

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.640
improve and if you've got a purely
desktop experience quite often it tells

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:21.650
desktop experience quite often it tells
 

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.050
desktop experience quite often it tells
you you need to prove everything but if

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:23.060
you you need to prove everything but if
 

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.399
you you need to prove everything but if
you improve everything but if you've got

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:24.409
you improve everything but if you've got
 

00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:25.960
you improve everything but if you've got

interface exactly where the I'd like the

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320
interface exactly where the I'd like the
 

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.170
interface exactly where the I'd like the
identified problem is this is really

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:02.180
identified problem is this is really
 

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.250
identified problem is this is really
cool because if you're trying to find

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:03.260
cool because if you're trying to find
 

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.630
cool because if you're trying to find
different areas of the text on your page

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640
different areas of the text on your page
 

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.580
different areas of the text on your page
which you've got problems then you can

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:06.590
which you've got problems then you can
 

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.080
which you've got problems then you can
actually kind of identify that pretty

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.090
actually kind of identify that pretty
 

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.590
actually kind of identify that pretty
quickly

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600
quickly
 

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.140
quickly
the really nice thing and it's it's kind

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:11.150
the really nice thing and it's it's kind
 

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.400
the really nice thing and it's it's kind
of I think it's there in the API but

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:12.410
of I think it's there in the API but
 

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.750
of I think it's there in the API but
there's an API back-end to this which

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760
there's an API back-end to this which
 

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.640
there's an API back-end to this which
you can actually programmatically run

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:15.650
you can actually programmatically run
 

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.900
you can actually programmatically run
through your own workflow tools which

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:16.910
through your own workflow tools which
 

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.730
through your own workflow tools which
you could then use against your site

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:18.740
you could then use against your site
 

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.490
you could then use against your site
which would analyze UX problems across

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:21.500
which would analyze UX problems across

which would analyze UX problems across
your site automatically so it's pretty

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600
your site automatically so it's pretty
 

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.120
your site automatically so it's pretty
cool like we can find all these

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.130
cool like we can find all these
 

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.700
cool like we can find all these
different areas where everything kind of

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:27.710
different areas where everything kind of
 

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.170
different areas where everything kind of
fails and because it's a desktop site

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:29.180
fails and because it's a desktop site
 

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.120

you can see pretty much everything is a

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.130
you can see pretty much everything is a
 

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.800
you can see pretty much everything is a
little bit rubbish it tells you kind of

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:32.810
little bit rubbish it tells you kind of
 

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.540
little bit rubbish it tells you kind of
roughly how tall it is on the screen at

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:34.550
roughly how tall it is on the screen at
 

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.570
roughly how tall it is on the screen at
that time so that the legible text the

that time so that the legible text the
 

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.690
that time so that the legible text the
other thing is touch targets so we

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:40.700
other thing is touch targets so we
 

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.730
other thing is touch targets so we
identify all the areas on the page where

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:42.740
identify all the areas on the page where
 

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.470
identify all the areas on the page where
there's potential for confusion by the

obviously it's links and its links
 

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.450
obviously it's links and its links
inside text for instance but it's also

input elements form inputs everything

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:54.500
input elements form inputs everything

there was a oh there we go do it again
it's actually identified the fact that

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:17.390
it's actually identified the fact that

which would potentially be too close and
 

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.170
which would potentially be too close and
overlap and actually provide potentially

tool display is about kind of how the

tool display is about kind of how the
 

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.510
tool display is about kind of how the
content is presented on the device and

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:01.520
content is presented on the device and
 

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.160
content is presented on the device and
obviously interaction is about how the

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.170
obviously interaction is about how the
 

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.500
obviously interaction is about how the
user kind of manipulates the screen and

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:05.510
user kind of manipulates the screen and
 

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.790
user kind of manipulates the screen and
manipulates all the content whether it's

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800
manipulates all the content whether it's

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720
so we look at display and I'm going to
 

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.110
so we look at display and I'm going to
go through this pretty quickly and I

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120
go through this pretty quickly and I
 

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.790
go through this pretty quickly and I
really hate doing this slide but the

really hate doing this slide but the
 

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.470
really hate doing this slide but the
most important and critical thing that

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480
most important and critical thing that
 

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.790
most important and critical thing that
you can do for building a mobile web

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:27.800
you can do for building a mobile web
 

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.530
you can do for building a mobile web

essentially the size the content should
 

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.960
essentially the size the content should
be on that area on the screen and this

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:34.970
be on that area on the screen and this
 

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.310
be on that area on the screen and this
is our preferred recommended

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320
is our preferred recommended
 

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.110

because that essentially allows you to

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:44.529
because that essentially allows you to
 

00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:47.079
because that essentially allows you to
ensure that everything size - whether

00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:47.089
ensure that everything size - whether
 

00:13:47.089 --> 00:13:48.790
ensure that everything size - whether

basically means the browser doesn't have

basically means the browser doesn't have
 

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.460
basically means the browser doesn't have
to scale the content down from a

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:54.470
to scale the content down from a
 

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.710
to scale the content down from a
traditional desktop experience into a

traditional desktop experience into a
 

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.840
traditional desktop experience into a
more mobile experience and I think

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:58.850
more mobile experience and I think
 

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.500
more mobile experience and I think
that's a bug in chrome at the top we'll

that's a bug in chrome at the top we'll
 

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.180
that's a bug in chrome at the top we'll
get from there and actually the reason

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:04.190
get from there and actually the reason
 

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.050

why I want to show you why this is

why I want to show you why this is
actually kind of kind of critical is

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:06.620
actually kind of kind of critical is
 

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.370
actually kind of kind of critical is
that I've taken the like the the way

that I've taken the like the the way
that the browser renders content on a on

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.150
that the browser renders content on a on
 

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.820
that the browser renders content on a on
a like a desktop content on the mobile

a like a desktop content on the mobile

and as you can see on the right it's
 

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.130
and as you can see on the right it's
probably little bit hard for you guys to

probably little bit hard for you guys to

probably little bit hard for you guys to
see but that's a 12-point font which

be so a 12-point font in this case reads

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160
be so a 12-point font in this case reads
 

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.640
be so a 12-point font in this case reads
like a four point font Nexus 7 obviously

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:51.650
like a four point font Nexus 7 obviously
 

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.230
like a four point font Nexus 7 obviously
is better bigger screen and all the type

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240
is better bigger screen and all the type
 

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.180
is better bigger screen and all the type
of things but it's getting to the point

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:55.190
of things but it's getting to the point
 

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.800
of things but it's getting to the point
where the text on a default mobile

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:56.810
where the text on a default mobile
 

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.510
where the text on a default mobile
experience or desktop experience on a

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:58.520
experience or desktop experience on a
 

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.220
experience or desktop experience on a
mobile device it's completely unreadable

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:00.230
mobile device it's completely unreadable
 

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.500
mobile device it's completely unreadable
seven points is just at the point of

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:02.510
seven points is just at the point of
 

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.130
seven points is just at the point of
being unreadable

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:03.140
being unreadable
 

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.410
being unreadable
and obviously the Nexus 10 and the kind

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:05.420
and obviously the Nexus 10 and the kind
 

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.630
and obviously the Nexus 10 and the kind
of the iPads as well it's a lot less

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:07.640
of the iPads as well it's a lot less
 

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.550
of the iPads as well it's a lot less
noticeable having not having a viewport

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560
noticeable having not having a viewport
 

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.750
noticeable having not having a viewport
you get to the point where the text

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:10.760
you get to the point where the text
 

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.660
you get to the point where the text
looks like a nine point one kind of

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:13.670
looks like a nine point one kind of
 

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.420
looks like a nine point one kind of
whatever I told you then was really a

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:16.430
whatever I told you then was really a
 

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:20.280
whatever I told you then was really a
lie because basically browsers try to

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.290
lie because basically browsers try to
 

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.510
lie because basically browsers try to
compensate for the fact that they know

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:22.520
compensate for the fact that they know
 

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.579
compensate for the fact that they know
that the desktop web is terrible on a

00:15:24.579 --> 00:15:24.589
that the desktop web is terrible on a
 

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:27.040
that the desktop web is terrible on a
mobile device so in Chrome's case we use

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.050
mobile device so in Chrome's case we use
 

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.110
mobile device so in Chrome's case we use
kind of text auto size and basically

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120
kind of text auto size and basically
 

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.970
kind of text auto size and basically
what happens is when the page just as

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:30.980
what happens is when the page just as
 

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.100
what happens is when the page just as
the page loads an algorithm goes through

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:33.110
the page loads an algorithm goes through
 

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.199
the page loads an algorithm goes through
all the kind of the text nodes and look

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:35.209
all the kind of the text nodes and look
 

00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:36.460
all the kind of the text nodes and look
to see what text is

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:36.470
to see what text is
 

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.470
to see what text is
should resize to make more visible and

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480
should resize to make more visible and
 

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.660
should resize to make more visible and
on some pages like my blog before it's

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:40.670
on some pages like my blog before it's
 

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.580
on some pages like my blog before it's
not too bad the content at the top of

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:42.590
not too bad the content at the top of
 

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.410
not too bad the content at the top of
the page is made bigger because that's

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:44.420
the page is made bigger because that's
 

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.790
the page is made bigger because that's
the primary focus but then you get to

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800
the primary focus but then you get to
 

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.080
the primary focus but then you get to
sites like this which is hacking news

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.090
sites like this which is hacking news
 

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.920
sites like this which is hacking news
which is the same page as we saw before

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:49.930
which is the same page as we saw before
 

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.090
which is the same page as we saw before
there's certain comments which read

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:52.100
there's certain comments which read
 

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.100
there's certain comments which read
really well like the browser's gone yeah

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.110
really well like the browser's gone yeah
 

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.930
really well like the browser's gone yeah
this looks important it's not semantic

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:55.940
this looks important it's not semantic
 

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.510
this looks important it's not semantic
analysis it's just kind of some basic

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:57.520
analysis it's just kind of some basic
 

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.640
analysis it's just kind of some basic
basic heuristic but then there's other

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:00.650
basic heuristic but then there's other
 

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:01.930
basic heuristic but then there's other
bits like in the middle here which you

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:01.940
bits like in the middle here which you
 

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.070
bits like in the middle here which you
can't so you can't read the text you

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:03.080
can't so you can't read the text you
 

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.390
can't so you can't read the text you
can't be the text here you can't read

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:04.400
can't be the text here you can't read
 

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.100
can't be the text here you can't read
the text on the device you have to zoom

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:06.110
the text on the device you have to zoom
 

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.350
the text on the device you have to zoom
in so the algorithm isn't perfect and

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:08.360
in so the algorithm isn't perfect and
 

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.580
in so the algorithm isn't perfect and
the best way to get around that is to

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:09.590
the best way to get around that is to
 

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.920
the best way to get around that is to
start the design for a mobile web based

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:11.930
start the design for a mobile web based
 

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.370
start the design for a mobile web based
experience obviously use a viewport

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:14.380
experience obviously use a viewport
 

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.450
experience obviously use a viewport
there are little hacks to kind of get

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:16.460
there are little hacks to kind of get
 

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.890
there are little hacks to kind of get
around it like by making sure you can't

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:17.900
around it like by making sure you can't
 

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.120
around it like by making sure you can't
end things over a hundred thousand

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.130
end things over a hundred thousand
 

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.610
end things over a hundred thousand
pixels high it's not even worth going

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:21.620
pixels high it's not even worth going
 

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.690
pixels high it's not even worth going
there because that's just one of those

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:22.700
there because that's just one of those
 

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.040
there because that's just one of those
things which might change in the future

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:24.050
things which might change in the future
 

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.930
things which might change in the future
when people kind of get rid of that but

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:25.940
when people kind of get rid of that but
 

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.520
when people kind of get rid of that but
essentially browsers try to compensate

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:27.530
essentially browsers try to compensate
 

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.440
essentially browsers try to compensate
and when the browser tries to compensate

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:29.450
and when the browser tries to compensate
 

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.390
and when the browser tries to compensate
it kind of starts to ruin your design

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:31.400
it kind of starts to ruin your design
 

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.950
it kind of starts to ruin your design
essentially it doesn't represent how you

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:32.960
essentially it doesn't represent how you
 

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.660
essentially it doesn't represent how you
actually intended the user to read your

actually intended the user to read your
 

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.080
actually intended the user to read your
content and obviously fit the content of

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:38.090
content and obviously fit the content of
 

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.890

anything technical that we can say about

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.220
anything technical that we can say about
 

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.770
anything technical that we can say about
this is just make sure everything is

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:41.780
this is just make sure everything is
 

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.210
this is just make sure everything is
sized correctly and there's no kind of

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:43.220
sized correctly and there's no kind of
 

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.060

horizontal scrolling vertical scrolling

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:46.070
horizontal scrolling vertical scrolling
 

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.650
horizontal scrolling vertical scrolling
is fine and horizontal scrolling is

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:47.660
is fine and horizontal scrolling is
 

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.300
is fine and horizontal scrolling is
actually fine by default but if you have

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:49.310
actually fine by default but if you have
 

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.620
actually fine by default but if you have
to have the user pan in multiple

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:50.630
to have the user pan in multiple
 

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.160
to have the user pan in multiple
directions

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:51.170

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.780
directions
that's when users actually start to get

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:52.790
that's when users actually start to get
 

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.220
that's when users actually start to get
frustrated and I'll share the link later

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:54.230
frustrated and I'll share the link later

on where the ads team have done this

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240
on where the ads team have done this

analysis to actually show that users

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:58.100
analysis to actually show that users
 

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.650
analysis to actually show that users
don't like it but the interesting thing

00:16:59.650 --> 00:16:59.660
don't like it but the interesting thing
 

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.690
don't like it but the interesting thing
is that scrolling varies from platform

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:01.700
is that scrolling varies from platform
 

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.610
is that scrolling varies from platform
to platform and iOS at one point I think

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:03.620
to platform and iOS at one point I think
 

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.350
to platform and iOS at one point I think
it probably still does you have a scroll

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360
it probably still does you have a scroll
 

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.730
it probably still does you have a scroll
lock so if you're kind of moving up in

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:06.740
lock so if you're kind of moving up in
 

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.800
lock so if you're kind of moving up in
the vertical orientation you can't

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:08.810
the vertical orientation you can't
 

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.090
the vertical orientation you can't
scroll after right at the same time

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:10.100
scroll after right at the same time
 

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.650
scroll after right at the same time
because it's saying well you know you

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:11.660
because it's saying well you know you
 

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.850
because it's saying well you know you
don't want to pan around you want to

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:12.860
don't want to pan around you want to
 

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.190
don't want to pan around you want to
just look at the content itself we want

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:15.200
just look at the content itself we want
 

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.660
just look at the content itself we want
to get in this situation away from the

to get in this situation away from the
 

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.650
to get in this situation away from the
situation where you have to actually

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:17.660
situation where you have to actually
 

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.380
situation where you have to actually
move around the web like that I'd have a

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:20.390
move around the web like that I'd have a
 

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.410
move around the web like that I'd have a

okay that was really heavy by the way

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.370
okay that was really heavy by the way
 

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:32.590
okay that was really heavy by the way
it's crazy so I'm not gonna tell

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:32.600
it's crazy so I'm not gonna tell
 

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.970
it's crazy so I'm not gonna tell
everyone about this too much like media

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:33.980
everyone about this too much like media
 

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.500
everyone about this too much like media
queries we should be kind of

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:35.510
queries we should be kind of
 

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.850
queries we should be kind of
concentrating on like mobile first

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:36.860
concentrating on like mobile first
 

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.730
concentrating on like mobile first
design responsive design as well

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:38.740

obviously you can kind of orient like

we don't actually analyze that yet and

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:34.920
we don't actually analyze that yet and
 

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.320
we don't actually analyze that yet and
we're trying to work out whether like

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:36.330
we're trying to work out whether like
 

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.549
we're trying to work out whether like
these type of things are important and

00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559
these type of things are important and
 

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:40.160
these type of things are important and
not for for you as a mobile web

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.170
not for for you as a mobile web
 

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.299
not for for you as a mobile web

and obviously things like maintain

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:42.990
and obviously things like maintain
 

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.720
and obviously things like maintain
decent line Heights so that the text is

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:44.730
decent line Heights so that the text is
 

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.520
decent line Heights so that the text is
readable and you don't have to get

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:46.530
readable and you don't have to get
 

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:50.690
readable and you don't have to get
confused between the lines yeah so font

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700
confused between the lines yeah so font
 

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.860
confused between the lines yeah so font
readability is kind of critical that's

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:51.870
readability is kind of critical that's
 

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.210
readability is kind of critical that's
one of the things that we look for when

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220
one of the things that we look for when
 

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.960

we also want to kind of we don't check

00:20:59.210 --> 00:20:59.220
we also want to kind of we don't check
 

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.530
we also want to kind of we don't check
for this but we're trying to get people

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:00.540
for this but we're trying to get people
 

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.150
for this but we're trying to get people
to limit the use of web fonts at the

to limit the use of web fonts at the
 

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.650
to limit the use of web fonts at the

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:03.660
moment especially on a mobile device
 

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.299
moment especially on a mobile device
because if the web font doesn't exist

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:05.309
because if the web font doesn't exist
 

00:21:05.309 --> 00:21:06.500
because if the web font doesn't exist
either in the cache or on the user's

the content to actually appear because
the font doesn't exist so it's not

the font doesn't exist so it's not
 

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.540
the font doesn't exist so it's not
actually kind of it doesn't actually

guidance at the moment and this might

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000
guidance at the moment and this might
 

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.640
guidance at the moment and this might
change once the browser implementations

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:22.650
change once the browser implementations
 

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.590
change once the browser implementations
change essentially it's just to use it

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600
change essentially it's just to use it
 

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.270
change essentially it's just to use it
for headings but critical content like

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280
for headings but critical content like
 

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.190
for headings but critical content like
the text like if it's html5 rocks the

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200
the text like if it's html5 rocks the
 

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.530
the text like if it's html5 rocks the

article body content would just be a
 

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.620

essentially where we're talking about

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:41.670
essentially where we're talking about
 

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.160
essentially where we're talking about
the different implementations between

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:43.170
the different implementations between
 

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.660
the different implementations between
browsers so obviously WebKit and blink

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:44.670
browsers so obviously WebKit and blink
 

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.220
browsers so obviously WebKit and blink
are kind of quite consistent because

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:46.230
are kind of quite consistent because
 

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.020
are kind of quite consistent because
they're both up the same heritage where

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.030
they're both up the same heritage where
 

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.280
they're both up the same heritage where

the content doesn't appear whereas
Firefox is a little bit different

Firefox is a little bit different
I believe the text appears as a system

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880
I believe the text appears as a system

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:57.570
font is downloaded and we're looking for
 

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:58.970
font is downloaded and we're looking for
kind of your feedback about what you

00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:58.980
kind of your feedback about what you
 

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.140
kind of your feedback about what you
think is the most important thing

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:00.150
think is the most important thing
 

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.910
think is the most important thing
because we want to make sure that if

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:01.920
because we want to make sure that if
 

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.820
because we want to make sure that if
we're going to be if we want to be good

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:04.830
we're going to be if we want to be good

we're going to be if we want to be good
web citizens and everyone wants to get

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:06.210
web citizens and everyone wants to get
 

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.130
web citizens and everyone wants to get
this we have the same type of

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140
this we have the same type of
 

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.960
this we have the same type of
implementation across browsers and it

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:08.970
implementation across browsers and it
 

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.370
implementation across browsers and it
might be at some point that the actual

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380
might be at some point that the actual
 

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.840
might be at some point that the actual
Firefox implementation is the preferred

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:11.850
Firefox implementation is the preferred
 

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.460
Firefox implementation is the preferred
one but obviously we need a lot of

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:13.470
one but obviously we need a lot of
 

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.810
one but obviously we need a lot of
feedback from developers so go to that

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820
feedback from developers so go to that
 

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.430
feedback from developers so go to that
post have a look at kind of the

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440
post have a look at kind of the
 

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.200
post have a look at kind of the
suggestions and then let Paul

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:18.210
suggestions and then let Paul
 

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.570
suggestions and then let Paul
and everyone else know how you want the

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580
and everyone else know how you want the
 

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.430
and everyone else know how you want the
how you want to have web fonts presented

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440
how you want to have web fonts presented
 

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.380
how you want to have web fonts presented
to the user I'll tweet this link how

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:24.390
to the user I'll tweet this link how
 

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.140
to the user I'll tweet this link how
because I know it's not exactly visible

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:26.150
because I know it's not exactly visible

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.010
so let's display I want to talk about
 

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.230
so let's display I want to talk about
interactions and I'm going to be really

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240
interactions and I'm going to be really

quick click this ambiguous on is really

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280
quick click this ambiguous on is really
 

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.790
quick click this ambiguous on is really
important because essentially the user

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:34.800
important because essentially the user
 

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.220
important because essentially the user
like this is Chrome when the user clicks

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:37.230
like this is Chrome when the user clicks
 

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.690
like this is Chrome when the user clicks
on an area inside Chrome and it doesn't

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700
on an area inside Chrome and it doesn't
 

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.710
on an area inside Chrome and it doesn't
know exactly where the user is it

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720
know exactly where the user is it
 

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.300
know exactly where the user is it
presents a magnifying glass it's a great

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:41.310
presents a magnifying glass it's a great
 

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.920
presents a magnifying glass it's a great
accessibility feature the problem is

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:42.930
accessibility feature the problem is
 

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.600
accessibility feature the problem is
though that it actually presents a

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:44.610
though that it actually presents a
 

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.930
though that it actually presents a
challenge to users because it's an extra

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940
challenge to users because it's an extra
 

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.640
challenge to users because it's an extra
step before they actually do anything so

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:49.650
step before they actually do anything so
 

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.200
step before they actually do anything so
we want you as a developer to try and

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:51.210
we want you as a developer to try and
 

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.820
we want you as a developer to try and
get away from that and I'm gonna kind of

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:52.830
get away from that and I'm gonna kind of
 

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.710
get away from that and I'm gonna kind of
roughly go through the process for this

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720
roughly go through the process for this
 

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.320
roughly go through the process for this
how this actual disambiguation works

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:56.330
how this actual disambiguation works
 

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.400
how this actual disambiguation works
essentially you use a clicks on the

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:58.410
essentially you use a clicks on the
 

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.320
essentially you use a clicks on the
screen it's roughly a 48 pixel bounding

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:00.330
screen it's roughly a 48 pixel bounding
 

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.020
screen it's roughly a 48 pixel bounding
box works that where the click is ads in

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:03.030
box works that where the click is ads in
 

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.250
box works that where the click is ads in
an area kind of been like an arrow

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260
an area kind of been like an arrow
 

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.260
an area kind of been like an arrow
buffer around the side finds all the

actually meant to click scores each

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:10.770
actually meant to click scores each
 

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.050
actually meant to click scores each
element based on the closeness to the

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:12.060
element based on the closeness to the

original touch in this case finds one

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.010
original touch in this case finds one
 

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.350
original touch in this case finds one
that's the closer to it like that's the

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360
that's the closer to it like that's the
 

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.600
that's the closer to it like that's the
closest element and then it basically

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:17.610
closest element and then it basically
