00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
There's been an advance in a sixty-year-old

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.749
Math's problem, a maths problem which was

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.050
Related to the four color theorem

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.599
Which is something I've mentioned before, perhaps I should do a quick recap of what the four color theorem was.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.159
It's a similar sort of thing really. Before color theorem said, imagine you had a map

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.459
Right, and I'm just going to make up some sort of map here. And the idea was, I want to color in this map

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.749
So that neighboring countries are not using the same color

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:38.009
So if I color this in, it might be kind of this bit here, the idea being that any map can be done

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.089
Using four colors or fewer, or in other words, there aren't any maps that need five colors. So that's true

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.719
That's a fact right, that was proven in the 1970s. But this problem that I'm going to talk about today, comes from the

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.289
1950s and it's not something that's been solved yet. It's called the Hadwiger-Nelson problem, catchy name

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.589
And I'm going to try to quote you what the problem is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.680
How many colors are needed to color the plane?

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.760
So that no two points at unit distance are the same color. That's very formal

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.760
So let me just break that down. What it really means is imagine,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.140
I'm somewhere on this map here. So there I am and I'm going to go for walk

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.140
I'm gonna take a step and my step is going to be one unit

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.470
So these might not be countries anymore because I'm changing the scale of this. So we're taking a walk and I want to go

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.970
One unit. Maybe that's one unit. Whatever that means and then take another step and I'll take one unit step

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.699
But every time I take a step, I want to step on to a different color. I want the color to change each time

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.460
I step so I'm gonna go for a walk. I want to change the color change the color, okay change the color again

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.739
I could step back to here, change the color again

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.828
Change the color again. I could go over here, but then for example

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.189
I couldn't walk this way. Should I take a one unit step over here, I wouldn't be changing the color

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.229
So the question is, is there a way to color the plane. So imagine this as an infinite map

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.949
Is there a way to color it so that I can take a walk always changing the color?

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.230
Can I do it so I can take any walk?

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.579
So any walk that I care to do, I will always be changing the color with each step I take, and that's the question

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.910
brady: No matter what direction you go. 
No matter what direction you pick no matter what walk that I choose to do

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.140
Every step lands on a different color. Well for starts

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.360
There is a solution to this, as seven colors work

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.099
We can do it with seven colors, and we can prove that really really quickly. You take the infinite plane

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.449
We're going to tile it with hexagons. So I've got now a little unit of hexagons

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.540
I got seven hexagons there and I've used seven colors and now I'm just going to repeat this over and over

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.890
So I'm going to repeat this

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.690
So I'm creating a pattern of colors with my hexagons.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.450
Now All I need to do to solve this problem, is imagine the diameter of those hexagons was less than one

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.230
Slightly less than one, that means that every step I take would be on to a different hexagon

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.739
So I could start here, and every step I take would have to be on a different hexagon, which is a different color

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.920
I just add one thing though. We wouldn't want to step from this purple hexagon on to the next purple hexagon

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.860
which means I want this distance to be greater than one, which means the diameter of your hexagons needs to be less than 1,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.460
and greater than .76

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.020
Fine. That's all you need so take the hexagons to be .9 and

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.270
The problem is solved you can walk around that hexagon

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.540
Infinite plane and change the color with each step

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.200
Brady: and even if I wanted to step on one of the same color, couldn't do it

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.649
Even if you wanted to, even if you tried you can't because those hexagons are chosen so that you can't step onto

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.570
The color that you're on. 
Brady: Cool. What's the problem? 
Exactly, What's the problem?

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.779
So we definitely have a solution, and it can be done for seven

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.339
So the question is can it be done for six colors, or can we do it with five colors?

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.709
Four, three, two, right?

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.769
How many colors, what's the fewest colors we can do this with?

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.989
So we can eliminate some of the answers really quickly. You can't do it with two, I'll show you that

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.089
So imagine we try to do it with two, so all I'm going to draw out is the walk

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.750
I'm just going to draw a walk. So I'm walking in a triangle an equilateral triangle. now, let's try and color this walk

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.239
So say I start in the green region, and then take a step and I want it to change color

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.030
So now I've stepped onto a blue region then I want to take another step, and I want to change color now

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.900
I've only got two colors available

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.900
So I'm gonna have to step onto a green

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.839
Region here. But that means if I want to step back to where I started, and there's no reason why I can't do that

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.130
I'm not changing the color

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.369
I'm stepping from green to green, that's not allowed. this is an example of a walk that can't be done with two colors

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.179
It can be done with three colors, but it can't be done with two. What about three?

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.690
Well again, there's an example it shows you can't do it with three

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.639
So same sort of idea. Here's a specific example, every step there in that shape is one unit. So you're walking around that path

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:18.389
Great, but can I do this with three colors? Let's start with green and then I move on to the next step

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.309
Well, it might be blue. Now, I want to step here. This has to be a different color. So let's have a different color

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.889
let's have red, now if I want to step on to the next one

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.780
Where it can't be red

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.760
So let's make it... oh it can't be green as well because I don't want to step back to the green

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.990
So it has to be blue. So that one's pretty okay. Now what if I take another step?

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.990
I think I've got a choice here.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.500
I now think I can choose my color

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.919
I'm gonna choose green here for the middle, now for this if I take one step up, oh it can't be green

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.889
It can't be blue. So it's red. And if I step down to here, it can't be blue, green or red

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.560
So I need a fourth color. I can't do it with three.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.900
It can be done with four and then, that's where we got to. 60 years ago

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.200
That's as far as we got, we showed that it can be done with seven

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.079
It can't be done with two, it can't be done with three

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:14.999
So maybe it could be done with four, five, six, and seven we know is definitely true. And that's where we were

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.310
60 years, until recently.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:24.539
So in 2018 an amateur mathematician found a walk, an example of a walk that can't be done with four

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.979
Which means it can only be done with five, which means four is not a solution. So we've eliminated four colors from this problem

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.970
So I call him an amateur mathematician. I think that's a bit of a disservice

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:42.039
This is a person called Aubrey de Grey who is a biologist who's famous in his own right in his own field

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.679
He works in anti-aging, he's a very interesting guy

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:52.029
Himself, but he does maths for fun. And this was a problem he was trying to do, for fun

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:58.030
And so he came up with a walk that can't be done with four colours and what he did is, he took

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.090
This example, it's got a name

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.639
It's called the Moser spindles, strange name, and he made copies of that which he fused together

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:13.030
So he fused together lots of copies of this, and he created this monster, this monster Network

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.500
20,000 points

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.220
Huge thing, and then he got a computer to show

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.820
that

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.510
Four colours are not enough. It can't be coloured in with four, and it can be coloured in with five

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.270
Fantastic, we eliminate four

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:34.210
For the first time in sixty years. He then improved that, he wanted to find a smaller example

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.100
Smaller than this monster and he got an example that's I think

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:46.140
1581 points so that's much better right so a much smaller example, but it's the same thing

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.780
It's an example that can't be colored with four colours

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.290
Can be done with five

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.290
so then he published this and

00:07:53.690 --> 00:08:01.690
Mathematicians got stuck in they said well, can we do better? Can we find a smaller one the smallest we found so far is

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:08.349
This one here. So this is a walk found by Martin hooli

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:16.030
Who we have mentioned before, we talked about this guy and he colored in the Pythagorean triples

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.780
We did a video about

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.649
Pythagorean triples and coloring them red and blue, it's a similar sort of problem and he found this example

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.360
It's a walk with 533 points that needs five colors

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.840
So we've got red, green, blue and yellow

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.630
And then the fifth color is white, which is used only once, right there in the center

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:43.908
