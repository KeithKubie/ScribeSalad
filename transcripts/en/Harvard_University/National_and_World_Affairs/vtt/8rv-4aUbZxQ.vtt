Funding for this program provided by

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.180
additional funding provided by

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.120
Now we turn, to the hardest

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.640
philosopher that we're going to read in this
course

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.380
today we turn to Immanuel Kant

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.850
who offers a different account

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.840
of why we have a categorical duty

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.870
to respect the dignity of persons

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.539
and not to be use

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:53.150
people

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.180
as means

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.520
merely

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.360
even for good ends.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.520
Kant excelled at the university of Königsberg

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.200
at the age of sixteen

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.760
at the age of thirty one he got his first job

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.340
as an unsalaried lecturer

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.180
paid on commission

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.720
based on the number of students who showed
up at his lectures

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.920
this is a sensible system that Harvard would
do well to consider

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.840
luckily for Kant

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.450
he was a popular lecturer and also an industrious
one and so he eked out a meager living

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.400
it wasn't until 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.530
he was fifty seven that he published his first

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.750
major work

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.549
but it was worth the wait

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.229
the book was the critique of pure reason

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.840
perhaps the most important work in all of
modern philosophy

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.049
and a few years later

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:55.920
Kant wrote

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.080
the groundwork for the metaphysics of morals
which we read in this course

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.540
I want to acknowledge even before we start

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.020
that Kant is a difficult thinker

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.989
but it's important to try to figure out

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.459
what he's saying

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:21.459
because what this book is about

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.629
is well, it's about what the supreme principle of
morality this

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:25.729
number one, and

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.949
it's also

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:29.889
it gives us an account

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.030
one of the most powerful accounts we have

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.249
of what freedom really is

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:35.169
so

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.019
let me start today.

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.779
Kant rejects utilitarianism

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.319
he thinks

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.399
that

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.169
the individual

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.859
person

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.349
all human beings

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.419
have a certain dignity

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.549
that commands our respect

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.459
the reason the individual is sacred or the
bearer of rights according to Kant,

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.209
doesn't stem from the idea that we own ourselves,

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.090
but instead from the idea

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.409
that we are all rational beings

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.859
we're all rational beings which simply means

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.849
that we are beings who are capable

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.379
of reason.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.260
we're also

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.619
autonomous beings

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.019
which is to say

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.319
that we are beings capable of acting and
choosing

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.519
freely

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.040
now, this capacity for reason and freedom

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.259
isn't the only capacity we have.

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.549
we also have the capacity for pain and
pleasure

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.019
for suffering and satisfaction

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.749
Kant admits the

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.439
utilitarians were half a right

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.430
of course

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.299
we seek to avoid pain

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.889
and we like pleasure

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.539
Kant doesn't deny this

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.349
what he does deny

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.360
is Bentham's claim that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.560
pain in pleasure

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.710
are our sovereign masters

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.659
he thinks that's wrong.

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.199
Kant thinks

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.330
that it's are national capacity

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.230
that makes us distinctive, that makes us special
that sets us

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.860
apart from and above mere animal

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.479
existence. 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.430
it makes us something more than just physical

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.089
creatures with appetites. Now

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:58.650
we often think

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.499
of freedom

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:02.699
as simply consisting

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.620
in doing what we want

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.340
or in the absence of obstacles to getting
what we want

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.649
that's one way of thinking about freedom.

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:15.939
but this isn't Kant's

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.220
idea of freedom

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.759
Kant has a more stringent

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:21.879
demanding notion

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.049
of what it means to be free

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:28.079
and though stringent and demanding, if you think it  
through

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:32.259
it's actually pretty persuasive

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.659
Kant’s reason is as follows

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:35.590
when we,

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.389
like animals

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.229
seek after pleasure

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.189
or the satisfaction of our desires of the
avoidance pain

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:49.180
when we do that we aren't really acting
freely.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.389
why not?

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.609
we're really acting

00:05:53.609 --> 00:05:55.879
as the slaves 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.229
of those appetites

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.580
and impulses

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.189
I didn't choose this particular hunger or
that particular appetite,

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:10.509
and so when I act to satisfy it

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.430
I'm just acting according to natural

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.110
necessity

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.850
and for Kant,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.009
freedom is the opposite

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.199
of necessity

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.569
there was an advertising slogan

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:27.430
for the

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.789
soft drink Sprite

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.680
a few years ago

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.259
the slogan was

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.990
obey your thirst

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.259
there

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.169
there's a Kantian insight

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:42.210
buried in that

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.160
Sprite advertising slogan

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.800
that in a way is Kant's point

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.720
when you go for Sprite,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.269
or Pepsi

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:52.759
you're really

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.619
you might think that you're choosing freely
sprite versus Pepsi

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:58.479
but you're actually

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.860
obeying

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.939
something, a thirst, or maybe a desire manufactured
or massaged by advertising

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:08.400
you're obeying a prompting

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.199
that you yourself

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.349
haven't chosen

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:15.159
or created

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:16.649
and here

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:19.349
it's worth

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:20.330
noticing

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.009
Kant’s specially demanding

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:23.729
idea

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:24.669
of freedom

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.240
what way

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.000
of acting, how can my will be determined if not
by

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.460
the prompting sub nature or my hunger or my
appetite, or my desires?

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.490
Kant's answer:

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.550
to act freely

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.259
is to act

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:43.939
autonomously

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:45.880
and to act autonomously

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.219
is to act according to a law that I give
myself

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.169
not according

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.439
to the physical laws of nature

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:57.769
or to the laws of cause and effect

00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:59.119
which include my desire,

00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:01.179
to eat or to drink

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:05.169
or to choose this

00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:07.669
food in a restaurant over that

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:09.649
now what is the opposite

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:11.669
what is the opposite

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:16.650
of autonomy

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.409
for Kant he invest a special term

00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:22.879
to describe

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:25.909
the opposite of autonomy

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:27.430
heteronomy

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.240
is the opposite of autonomy

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.840
when I act

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.680
heteronomously

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.990
I'm acting

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.040
according to an inclination

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.600
or a desire

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.720
that I haven't chosen for myself

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.710
so freedom is autonomy

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.820
is this specially stringent

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.960
idea

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.080
that Kant insists on.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.520
now why is autonomy

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:04.500
the opposite of the acting heteronomously or
according to the dictates of nature

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.360
Kant’s point is that

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.450
nature is governed by laws

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:15.110
laws of cause and effect for example

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.190
suppose you drop a billiard ball

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.720
it falls to the ground

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.890
we wouldn't say the billiard ball is acting
freely

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.090
why not?

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.690
it's acting according to the law of nature

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.550
according to the laws

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.900
of cause and effect

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.230
the law of gravity

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.269
and just as he has an unusually

00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:40.129
demanding and stringent

00:09:40.129 --> 00:09:41.390
conception of freedom,

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.490
freedom as autonomy,

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.250
he also 

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.300
has a demanding conception

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.030
of morality

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.670
to act freely

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.610
is not to choose the best means to a given
end

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:03.670
it's to choose the end itself for its own sake

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.920
and that's something

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.610
that human beings can do

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.830
and that billiard balls can’t

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.030
insofar as we act on

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.920
inclination or pursue pleasure

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.460
we fact as means

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.480
to the realization of ends

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.800
given outside us

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.900
we are instruments

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.010
rather than authors

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.230
of the purposes

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.550
we pursue

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.130
that's

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.600
the heteronomous determination of the
will

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.899
on the other hand

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:40.880
insofar as we act autonomously

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.480
according to law we give ourselves

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.659
we do something for its own sake

00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:47.880
as an end in itself

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.720
when we act autonomously

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.350
we cease to be instruments to purposes

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.970
given outside us

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.890
we become

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.080
what we can come to think of ourselves

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.070
as ends in ourselves.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.610
this capacity to act freely

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.850
Kant tells us

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.309
is what gives human life its special

00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:11.880
dignity.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.790
respecting human dignity

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.119
means regarding persons

00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:18.280
not just as means

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.600
but also as ends in them

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.769
and this is why

00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:25.270
it's wrong to use people

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.790
for the sake of other people's

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.250
well being or happiness

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.750
this is the real reason Kant says

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.600
that utilitarianism goes wrong

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.940
this is the reason it's important to respect
the dignity of persons

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.390
and to uphold their rights.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.310
so even if there are cases

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.370
remember John Stuart Mill said well in the
long run if we uphold Justice and respect

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.790
the dignity of persons

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.990
we will maximize human happiness.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.250
What would Kant's answer be to that?

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.050
what would his answer be?

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.150
even if that were true

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.220
even if the calculus worked out that way

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.579
even if you shouldn't throw the Christians
to the lions because in the long run

00:12:13.579 --> 00:12:17.850
fear will spread, the overall utility will decline, the
utilitarian

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.150
would be upholding Justice and rights and
respect for persons

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.160
for the wrong reason

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.790
for a purely contingent reason

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.620
for an instrumental reason

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:36.210
it would still be using people even where the
calculus works out

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.720
for the best in the long run, it would still
using people

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.570
as means

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.190
rather than

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.990
respecting them as ends in themselves.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.420
so that's Kant's idea of freedom as autonomy

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.390
and you can begin to see how it's connected

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:01.430
to his idea of morality

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.460
but we still have to answer one more question

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.520
what gives an act it's moral worth

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.310
in the first place

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.160
if it can't be directed

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.230
at utility or satisfying wants or desires, 

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.870
what do you think gives an action it's moral worth?

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.839
this leads us from Kant’s

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:23.690
demanding idea of freedom

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.830
to his demanding idea

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.770
of morality.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.620
What does Kant say?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.580
what makes and action

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.370
morally worthy

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:41.350
consists not in the consequences or in the
results that flow from it

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:46.030
what makes an action morally worthy has to do with

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.360
the motive

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.720
with the quality of the will

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.820
with the intention

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.480
for which the act is down

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.770
what matters

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.540
is the motive

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:06.080
and the motive must be of a certain kind.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.330
so the moral worth of an action depends on the
motive for which it's done

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.210
and the important thing

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.390
is that

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.820
the person do the right thing

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.570
for the right reason

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.110
a goodwill isn't good

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.480
because of what it affects or accomplishes,
Kant writes,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.380
it's good in itself

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:32.080
even if by its utmost effort to goodwill accomplishes
nothing

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.610
it would still shine like a jewel for its own
sake

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.980
as something which has its full value in itself

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.250
and so for any action

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.420
to be morally good

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.009
it's not enough that it should

00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:47.320
conform

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.010
to the moral law

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:53.770
it must also be done for the sake of the moral
law.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.139
the idea is

00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:57.550
that the motive confers

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.489
the moral worth

00:14:58.489 --> 00:15:00.650
on an action

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.060
and the only kind of motive

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.190
that can confirm moral

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.720
worth on an action

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.580
is the motive of duty

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.610
well what's the opposite

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.950
of doing something out of a sense of duty
because it's right,

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.240
well for Kant the opposite

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.330
would be all of those motives having to do
with our inclinations

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.970
and inclinations

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.720
refer to all of our

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.779
desires, all of our contingently given

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:30.850
wants

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:31.290
preferences

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.500
impulses

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.490
and the like

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.130
only actions done for the sake of the moral
law

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.260
for the sake of duty

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.300
only these actions have moral worth

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.830
now I want to

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.210
see what you think about this idea

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.540
but first let's consider a few examples

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.830
Kant begins with an example

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.430
of a shopkeeper

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.320
he wants to bring out the intuition

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.570
and make plausible the idea

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:05.470
that what confers moral worth on an action is
that it be done because it's right

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.370
he says suppose there's a shopkeeper

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.280
and an inexperienced customer comes in

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.190
the shopkeeper knows

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.300
that he could give the customer the wrong
change could shortchange the customer

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.610
and get away with it

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.910
at least that customer wouldn't know

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:29.590
but the shopkeeper nonetheless says well if
I shortchange this customer

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.340
word may get out

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.680
my reputation would be damaged and I would
lose business

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.690
so I won't shortchange this customer

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.710
the shop keeper

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.060
does nothing wrong he gives a correct change

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.360
but does this action have moral worth?

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.130
Kant says no.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.290
it doesn't have moral worth

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.629
because the shopkeeper only did the right thing

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:56.150
for the wrong reason

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.560
out of self-interest

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:06.449
that's a pretty straightforward

00:17:06.449 --> 00:17:08.860
case. then he takes another case

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.630
the case of suicide.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:18.150
he says we have a duty to preserve ourselves

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.270
now, for most people

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.820
who love life,

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.509
we have multiple reasons

00:17:24.509 --> 00:17:29.559
for not taking our own lives

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:32.970
so the only way we can really tell

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:37.240
the only way we can isolate the operative
motive

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.280
for someone who doesn't take his or her life

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.680
is to think

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:47.309
to imagine someone who's miserable

00:17:47.309 --> 00:17:49.250
and

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.810
who despite 

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.430
having an absolutely miserable life

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.370
nonetheless

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.640
recognizes the duty to preserve one's self

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.600
and so

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.160
does not commit suicide.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.080
the force of the example

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.050
is to bring out

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.910
the motive that matters

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.770
and the motive that matters for morality is doing
the right thing

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.040
for the sake of duty.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.250
let me just

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.370
give you

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.550
a couple of other examples

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.470
the better business bureau

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.519
what's their slogan, the slogan of

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:33.270
the better business bureau?

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.860
honesty is the best policy

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.230
it's also the most profitable. this is the
better business bureaus

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.570
full page ad in

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.230
the new York times

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.620
honesty

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.080
it's as important as any other asset

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.650
because a business the deals in truth, openness
and fair value

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.500
cannot help

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.220
but do well

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.720
come join us

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.480
and profit from it

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.660
What would Kant say

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.630
about the moral worth

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.710
of the honest dealings that members of the

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.110
better business bureau. What he says

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.720
that here's a perfect example

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.059
that if this is the reason

00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:22.350
that these companies deal honestly with their
customers

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.450
their action lacks moral worth

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.880
this is Kant’s point

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.620
or couple of years ago at the university
of Maryland there was a problem with cheating

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.250
and so they

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.290
initiated

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.560
an honor system

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.650
and they created a program with local merchants

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:45.260
that if you signed the honor pledge
not to cheat

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:52.210
you would get discounts often to twenty five
percent of local shops

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.880
now what would you think of someone motivated

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.490
to uphold an honor code

00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:59.820
with all the discounts

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.460
it's the same as

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.460
Kant’s shopkeeper

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.140
the point is

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:11.320
what matters is the quality of the will the
character of the motive

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.280
and the relevant motive to morality

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.200
can only be

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.030
the motive of duty

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:22.320
not the motive of inclination.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.320
and when I act out of duty

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.900
and when I resist

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.280
as my motive for acting inclinations or self-interest

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.170
even sympathy and altruism,

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.480
only then

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.090
am I acting

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.760
freely.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.230
only then and I acting

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.730
autonomously, only then is my will not

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.460
determined

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.720
or governed

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.679
by external considerations.

00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:52.020
that's the link

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.000
between Kant’s idea of freedom

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.350
and of  morality. now I want to pause here

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.340
the see

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.960
if all of this is clear

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.610
or if you have some questions

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.530
or puzzles

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.340
they can be questions of clarification

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.340
or

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.889
they can be challenges

00:21:08.889 --> 00:21:11.720
if you want to challenge this idea

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.750
that only

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.300
the motive of duty confers moral worth on the action
action

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.240
what do you think

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.570
I actually have two questions of clarification

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:29.380
the first is there seems to be an aspect
of this that makes it sort of

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.299
self-defeating in that

00:21:31.299 --> 00:21:33.920
once you’re conscious of 

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:40.290
what morality is you can sort of alter your
motive to achieve that end of morality

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.100
give me an example

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.880
what do you have in mind

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.320
the shopkeeper example

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.790
if he

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:51.279
decides that he wants to give the person of
money is to do the right thing

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:53.940
and he decides that’s his motive to do so

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.170
because he was the moral then isn't that sort
of defeating

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.290
trying to

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.570
isn't that sort of defeating the purity of his action
if 

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.989
morality is determined by his motive

00:22:04.989 --> 00:22:07.029
is his motive is to act morally

00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:09.020
so you're imagining a case

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.669
not of the purely selfish calculating shopkeeper

00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:15.100
but of one who says

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.030
well he may consider

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.660
shortchanging the customer

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.890
but then he says

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.530
not, while my reputation might suffer if word
gets out,

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.220
but instead he says

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.460
actually  I would like to be the kind of

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.380
honest person

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.400
who gives the right change to customers

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.840
simply because it's the right thing to do

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.330
or simply because I want to be moral

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.960
because I want to be moral

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.970
I want to be a good person

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:49.970
and so I'm going to conform all of my actions to
what morality requires

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.600
it's a subtle point, it's a good question

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.620
Kant does acknowledge

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.130
you're pressing Kant on an important

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.220
point here,

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:08.260
Kant does say there has to be some

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.070
incentive

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.940
to obey the moral law

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.620
it can't be a  self-interested incentive

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.020
that would defeat it

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.740
by definition

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.600
so he speaks of

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:27.700
a different kind of incentive from an inclination
he speaks of reverence for the moral law

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.480
so if that shopkeeper says

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.420
I want to develop a

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.800
reverence for the moral law

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.200
and so I'm going to act, so I'm going to
do the right thing

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.520
then I think he's there, he's there as far as Kant’s

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.630
concerned

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.540
because he's formed his motive

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.720
his will

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.970
is conforming to

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.580
the moral law

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.530
once he sees the importance of it

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:00.830
so it would count

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.560
it would count

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.370
and secondly very quickly

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:09.490
what stops morality from becoming completely
objective in this point?

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.570
what stops morality from becoming completely

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:14.059
subjective, yea, like

00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:14.830
how can

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:20.330
if there's, if morality is completely
determined by your morals then how can

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.010
you apply this or how can it be enforced?

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.380
that's also a great question, what's your name?

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.030
my name's Ahmady. Ahmady?

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.190
all right

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.920
if acting morally means

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.280
acting according

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.560
to a moral law out of duty

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.080
and if it's also

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.149
to act freely in the sense of autonomously

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.490
it must mean

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:51.610
that I'm acting according to a law that I give
myself that's what it means to act autonomously

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.830
Ahmady is right about that 

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.340
but that does raise a really interesting
question

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:04.400
if acting autonomously means acting according to a law
I give myself

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.080
that's how I escape

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.110
the chain of cause and effect and the laws of nature

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.620
what's to guarantee

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.210
that the law I give myself

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:21.910
when I'm acting out of duty is the same

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.660
as the law that Ahmady is giving himself

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:32.200
and that each of you

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.059
gives yourselves

00:25:34.059 --> 00:25:35.710
well here's the question

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.080
how many moral laws

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.960
from Kant’s point of view are there in this
room

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.980
are there a thousands or is there one

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.990
he thinks there's one

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.960
which in a way does go back to this question
all right what is the moral law, what does it

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.480
tell us

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.010
so what guarantees, it sounds like it

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:03.350
to act autonomously is to act according
to one's conscience according to a law

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.940
one gives oneself

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.570
but what guarantees

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:12.059
that we, if we all exercise our reason we will
come up with one and the same moral law?

00:26:12.059 --> 00:26:15.670
that's what Ahmady wants to know.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:20.150
here's Kant's answer,

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.530
the reason that leads us

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.629
to the law we give ourselves

00:26:25.629 --> 00:26:28.010
as autonomous beings

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:33.370
is a reason

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.940
it's a kind of practical reason

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.800
that we share as human beings

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.860
it's not

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.440
idiosyncratic

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.180
the reason we need to respect

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.800
the dignity of persons is that we're all rational
beings we all have the capacity for reason

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.399
and it's the exercise of that capacity for a
reason

00:26:56.399 --> 00:26:58.780
which exist

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.060
undifferentiated

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.310
in all of us

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:06.370
that makes us worthy of dignity, all of us

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.760
and

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:14.760
since it's the same capacity for reason

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.420
unqualified by particular

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:21.620
autobiographies and circumstances it's the
same universal capacity for reason

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.870
that delivers the moral law

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.920
it turns out that to act autonomously

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.040
is to act according to a law

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.840
we give ourselves exercising our reason

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.670
but it's the reason we share with everyone

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.470
as rational beings

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:43.500
not the particular reason we have given
our upbringing, our particular values our

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.750
particular interests

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.549
it's pure practical reason in Kant's terms

00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:53.740
which legislates apriori

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.340
regardless of any particular

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:56.650
contingent

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:00.050
or empirical ends. Well

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.410
what moral law would that kind of reason

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:06.950
deliver?

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.700
what is its content?

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.920
to answer that question

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.760
you have to read the groundwork

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:20.760
and we'll continue with that question next
time.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.040
For Kant, 

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.770
morally speaking suicide is on a par with murder

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:37.590
it's on a par with murder because what we violate

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.360
when we take a life

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.870
when we take someone's life, our's or somebody
else's,

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.460
we use

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.040
that person

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.790
we use a rational being

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.620
we use humanity as a means

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.340
and so we fail to respect humanity

00:28:54.340 --> 00:29:01.340
as an end

00:29:03.059 --> 00:29:09.340
today we turn back to Kant, but before we do

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.390
remember this is the week

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.559
by the end of which

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:15.670
all of you

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:20.039
will basically get Kant, figure out what he's
up to

00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:22.080
you're laughing

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:28.200
no, it will happen

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.000
Kant's groundwork

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.720
is about two big questions,

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.680
first what is the supreme principle of morality

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.880
second

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.220
how is freedom

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.470
possible?

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:54.440
two big questions

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.360
now, one way

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.029
of making your way through

00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:02.610
this dense philosophical book

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.290
is to bear in mind

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:09.880
a set of opposition or contrasts or
dualisms

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:15.149
that are related.

00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:18.820
today I’d like to talk about them

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.090
today we're going to answer the question, what
according to Kant,

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:27.559
is the supreme principle of morality

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:34.559
and in answering that question in working
our way up to Kant’s answer to that question,

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.990
it will help to bear in mind

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.660
three contrasts or dualisms

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.390
that Kant sets out

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.510
the first you remember

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:51.500
had to do

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.870
with the motive

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.580
according to which we act

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.309
and according to Kant,

00:30:59.309 --> 00:31:03.029
only one kind of motive

00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:06.809
is consistent with morality

00:31:06.809 --> 00:31:09.310
the motive of duty

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:14.110
doing the right thing for the right reason

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.940
what other kinds of motives are there

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.180
Kant sums them up 

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.559
in the category inclination

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:24.790
every time

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:25.930
the motive

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.240
for what we do

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.420
is to

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.479
satisfy a desire

00:31:31.479 --> 00:31:36.320
or a preference that we may have, to pursue
some interest

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.050
we're acting out of inclination

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.960
now let me pause to see if

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.850
if in thinking about

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.010
the question of the motive of duty of good
will

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.370
see if any of you has a question

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:53.260
about that much of Kant's claim.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.580
or is everybody happy with this distinction

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:00.430
what do you think? go ahead.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:05.070
when you make that distinction between duty and
inclination is there ever any moral action ever?

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.190
I mean you could always kind of probably find some 
kind of

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.310
some selfish motive, can't you?

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:13.990
maybe very often people do have self-interested
motives

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:16.030
when they act

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.740
Kant wouldn't dispute that

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.320
but what Kant is saying

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.860
is

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.740
that in so far as we act

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:32.390
morally that is in so far as our actions have
moral worth

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.350
what confers moral worth

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:37.030
is precisely

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:43.550
our capacity to rise above self-interest and
prudence and inclination and

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:48.170
to act out of duty

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.630
some years ago I read about

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:53.680
a spelling bee

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.370
and

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.160
there was a young man

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.419
who was declared the winner

00:32:58.419 --> 00:33:00.279
of the spelling bee

00:33:00.279 --> 00:33:04.230
a kid named Andrew, thirteen years old

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.640
the winning word, the word that he was able
to spell

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.059
was echolalia

00:33:10.059 --> 00:33:15.580
does anyone know what echolalia is?

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.710
it's not some type of flower no,

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:28.440
it is the tendency to repeat as an echo, to repeat
what you've heard

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.120
anyhow, he misspelled it actually

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.990
but the judges misheard him they thought
it spelled it correctly and awarded him the

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.889
championship of the national

00:33:37.889 --> 00:33:40.020
spelling bee

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.870
and

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:41.980
he 

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.919
went to the judges

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:45.539
afterward

00:33:45.539 --> 00:33:46.870
and said

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:47.370
actually

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.650
I misspelled it

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.280
I don't deserve the prize

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.469
and he was regarded as a moral hero

00:33:53.469 --> 00:33:54.690
and he was

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:56.640
written up in the new York times

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.429
misspeller

00:33:58.429 --> 00:34:00.900
is the spelling bee hero

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.529
there's Andrew

00:34:07.529 --> 00:34:10.869
with is proud mother

00:34:14.509 --> 00:34:17.249
and but when he was interviewed afterwards

00:34:17.249 --> 00:34:20.289
listen to this, when he was interviewed afterwards

00:34:20.289 --> 00:34:22.129
he said quote

00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:25.369
the judges said I had a lot of integrity

00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:26.619
but then he added

00:34:26.619 --> 00:34:29.509
that part of his motive was quote

00:34:29.509 --> 00:34:36.169
I didn't want to feel like a slime

00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:41.819
all right what would Kant say?

00:34:41.819 --> 00:34:44.139
I guess it would depend on whether or not

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:49.289
that was a marginal reason or the predominant reason
in whether not and why he decided

00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:52.499
to confess that he didn't actually spell the word
correctly

00:34:52.499 --> 00:34:54.939
good and what's your name. Vasco.

00:34:54.939 --> 00:34:59.579
that's very interesting is there anyone else

00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:02.140
who has a view about this?

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.399
does this show that Kant’s

00:35:04.399 --> 00:35:08.140
principle is too stringent too demanding

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.019
what would Kant say

00:35:10.019 --> 00:35:14.329
about this? yes

00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:17.859
I think that Kant actually says that

00:35:17.859 --> 00:35:22.949
it is the pure motivation that comes out
of duty that gives the action moral worth, so it's like

00:35:22.949 --> 00:35:24.829
for example in this case

00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:28.840
he might have more than one motive, he might
have a motive of not feeling like a slime

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.749
and he might have to move of 

00:35:30.749 --> 00:35:32.259
doing the right thing

00:35:32.259 --> 00:35:38.130
in and of itself out of duty and so while there's
more than one motivation going on there

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:43.329
does not mean that action is devoid of moral
worth just because he has one other motive

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:47.869
so because the motive which involves duty is
what gives it moral worth.
goo, and what's your name? Judith

00:35:50.609 --> 00:35:55.089
well Judith I think that your account actually
is true to Kant

00:35:55.089 --> 00:35:59.460
it's fine to have sentiments and feelings

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.030
that support doing the right thing

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.099
provided

00:36:03.099 --> 00:36:04.989
they don't provide

00:36:04.989 --> 00:36:08.369
the reason for acting

00:36:08.369 --> 00:36:12.339
so I think Judith has actually a
pretty good defense of Kant

00:36:12.339 --> 00:36:13.429
on this question

00:36:13.429 --> 00:36:15.999
of the motive of duty, thank you

00:36:15.999 --> 00:36:17.319
now

00:36:17.319 --> 00:36:19.699
let's go back to the

00:36:19.699 --> 00:36:22.380
three contrasts

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.219
it's clear at least what Kant means when he
says

00:36:26.219 --> 00:36:27.439
that

00:36:27.439 --> 00:36:31.899
for an action to have moral worth it must be
done for the sake of duty

00:36:31.899 --> 00:36:34.189
not out of inclination

00:36:34.189 --> 00:36:36.680
but as we began to see last time

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.359
there's a connection

00:36:38.359 --> 00:36:39.909
between

00:36:39.909 --> 00:36:42.429
Kant’s stringent notion of morality

00:36:42.429 --> 00:36:45.430
and especially demanding understanding

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.079
of freedom

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:50.919
and that leads us to the second contrast

00:36:50.919 --> 00:36:52.810
the link between

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:53.619
morality

00:36:53.619 --> 00:36:54.949
and freedom

00:36:54.949 --> 00:36:57.310
a second contrast describes

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.399
two different

00:36:59.399 --> 00:37:03.249
ways that my will can be determined

00:37:03.249 --> 00:37:04.109
autonomously

00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:06.869
and heteronomously

00:37:06.869 --> 00:37:08.640
according to Kant

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.149
I'm only free

00:37:11.149 --> 00:37:13.960
when my will is determined

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.709
autonomously

00:37:14.709 --> 00:37:16.940
which means what?

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.089
according to a law that I give myself

00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:25.369
we must be capable, if we're capable of freedom
as autonomously, we must be capable of acting

00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:26.019
accordingly
0:37:26.0laws that's given or imposed on us

00:37:28.429 --> 00:37:32.619
but according to a law we give ourselves

00:37:32.619 --> 00:37:34.589
but where could such a law

00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:36.219
come from?

00:37:36.219 --> 00:37:43.219
a law that we give ourselves?

00:37:44.499 --> 00:37:46.050
reason, if reason

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.259
determines my will

00:37:49.259 --> 00:37:51.630
then

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.689
the real becomes to power to choose

00:37:54.689 --> 00:37:55.250
independent

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.410
of the dictates

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:58.300
of nature or inclination

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.319
or circumstance

00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:01.709
so

00:38:01.709 --> 00:38:04.099
connected with Kant’s

00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:08.410
demanding notions of morality and freedom

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.810
is especially demanding notion

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:12.410
of reason

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.380
well how can reason

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.269
determine the

00:38:15.269 --> 00:38:17.259
will

00:38:17.259 --> 00:38:21.259
there are two ways and this leads to the third
contracts

00:38:21.259 --> 00:38:22.729
Kant says

00:38:22.729 --> 00:38:25.989
there are two different commands of reason

00:38:25.989 --> 00:38:28.069
in a command of reason

00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:30.719
Kant calls an imperative

00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:34.089
an imperative is simply an ought

00:38:34.089 --> 00:38:41.089
one kind of imperative, perhaps the most familiar
kind, is a hypothetical imperative.

00:38:42.819 --> 00:38:45.150
hypothetical imperatives

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:47.690
use instrumental reason

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:53.549
if you

00:38:53.549 --> 00:38:54.899
want x then do y

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:58.220
it's means ends reason.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:02.229
if you want a good business reputation

00:39:02.229 --> 00:39:03.679
then

00:39:03.679 --> 00:39:06.179
don't shortchange your customers

00:39:06.179 --> 00:39:07.949
word may get out. that's

00:39:07.949 --> 00:39:11.469
a hypothetical imperative.

00:39:11.469 --> 00:39:13.170
if the action would be good

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:17.969
solely as a means to something else Kant writes,
the imperative is hypothetical

00:39:17.969 --> 00:39:21.869
if the action is represented as good in itself

00:39:21.869 --> 00:39:24.369
and therefore as necessary

00:39:24.369 --> 00:39:28.499
for a will which of itself accords with reason

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:31.609
then the imperative

00:39:31.609 --> 00:39:34.169
categorical.

00:39:34.169 --> 00:39:35.949
that's the difference

00:39:35.949 --> 00:39:36.369
between

00:39:36.369 --> 00:39:40.029
a categorical imperative and a hypothetical
one

00:39:40.029 --> 00:39:43.769
a categorical imperative commands

00:39:43.769 --> 00:39:45.109
categorically

00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:48.990
which just means without reference to or
dependents on

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.699
any further purpose

00:39:51.699 --> 00:39:56.180
and so you see the connection

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.140
among these three parallel

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.079
contrasts

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:03.519
to be free in the sense of autonomous

00:40:03.519 --> 00:40:04.420
requires

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.119
that I act

00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:08.089
not out of a hypothetical

00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:09.949
imperative

00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:11.949
but out of the categorical

00:40:11.949 --> 00:40:13.749
imperative

00:40:13.749 --> 00:40:17.309
so you see by these three contrasts Kant

00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:19.390
reasons his way 

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:21.329
brings us up to you

00:40:21.329 --> 00:40:23.069
he's derivation

00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:25.949
of the categorical imperative

00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:27.729
well this leaves us

00:40:27.729 --> 00:40:29.650
one big question

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.949
what is the categorical imperative?

00:40:31.949 --> 00:40:35.190
what is the supreme principle of morality

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:39.559
what does it command of us?

00:40:39.559 --> 00:40:41.440
Kant gives three versions

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.119
three formulations

00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:45.479
of the categorical imperative.

00:40:45.479 --> 00:40:47.040
I want to mention two

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.429
and then see what you think of them.

00:40:50.429 --> 00:40:52.239
the first

00:40:52.239 --> 00:40:54.399
version the first formula

00:40:54.399 --> 00:40:56.529
he calls the formula

00:40:56.529 --> 00:40:59.439
of the universal law

00:40:59.439 --> 00:41:02.319
act only on that maxim

00:41:02.319 --> 00:41:05.949
whereby you can at the same time will that
it should become

00:41:05.949 --> 00:41:07.140
a universal

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.039
law and by maxim

00:41:09.039 --> 00:41:10.829
what does Kant mean?

00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:11.949
he means

00:41:11.949 --> 00:41:15.149
a rule that explains

00:41:15.149 --> 00:41:16.550
the reason for what you're doing

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.469
a principle

00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:20.079
for example

00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:22.359
promise keeping

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:28.559
suppose I need money, I hundred dollars

00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:30.329
desperately

00:41:30.329 --> 00:41:34.979
and I know I can't pay it back anytime soon

00:41:34.979 --> 00:41:36.369
I come to you

00:41:36.369 --> 00:41:40.549
and make you a promise, a false promise, one
I know I can't keep

00:41:40.549 --> 00:41:42.499
please give me a hundred dollars today

00:41:42.499 --> 00:41:46.589
lend me the money I will repay you next week

00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:49.479
is that consistent

00:41:49.479 --> 00:41:54.299
with the categorical imperative, that false
promise Kant says no

00:41:54.299 --> 00:41:55.440
and the test

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.309
the way we can

00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:59.249
determine

00:41:59.249 --> 00:42:02.489
that the false promise is at odds with categorical

00:42:02.489 --> 00:42:03.709
imperative is

00:42:03.709 --> 00:42:06.749
try to universalize it.

00:42:06.749 --> 00:42:10.759
universalize the maxim upon which you're about
to act

00:42:10.759 --> 00:42:17.399
if everybody made false promises when they needed
money

00:42:17.399 --> 00:42:21.660
then nobody would believe those promises there
would be no such thing

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.559
as a promise

00:42:24.559 --> 00:42:27.019
and so there would be a contradiction

00:42:27.019 --> 00:42:32.719
the maxim universalized would undermine
itself

00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:36.059
that's the test

00:42:36.059 --> 00:42:37.890
that's how we can know

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:42.890
that the false promise is wrong

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:44.619
well what about

00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:47.849
the formula of the universal law

00:42:47.849 --> 00:42:54.759
you find it persuasive?

00:42:54.759 --> 00:42:57.599
what do you think?

00:42:57.599 --> 00:43:02.109
I have a question about the difference between
categoricalism and a hypothesis

00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:04.949
that 

00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:09.559
if you're going to act.. Between categorical
in hypothetical 

00:43:09.559 --> 00:43:11.229
imperatives? right.

00:43:11.229 --> 00:43:13.489
if you’re going to act

00:43:13.489 --> 00:43:15.529
with a categorical imperative

00:43:15.529 --> 00:43:18.910
so that the maxim doesn't undermine itself

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:24.009
it sounds like I am going to do X because
I want y

00:43:24.009 --> 00:43:24.940
I'm going to

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.259
not lie in dire need

00:43:28.259 --> 00:43:32.129
because I want the world to function in such
a way that

00:43:32.129 --> 00:43:38.069
promises kept. I don't want to liquidate the practice
of promises. Right.

00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:39.560
it sounds like justifying

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.019
a means by an ends

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:46.339
it seems like an instance of consequentialist
reasoning you're saying.

00:43:46.339 --> 00:43:53.339
and what's your name? Tim.

00:43:53.389 --> 00:43:54.559
well Tim

00:43:54.559 --> 00:43:56.989
John Stuart Mill agreed with you

00:43:56.989 --> 00:43:59.829
he made this criticism

00:43:59.829 --> 00:44:02.259
of Kant

00:44:02.259 --> 00:44:03.959
he said if

00:44:03.959 --> 00:44:07.150
I universalize the maximum and find

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:12.189
that the whole practice of promise keeping
would be destroyed if universalized

00:44:12.189 --> 00:44:14.430
I must be appealing

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:17.299
somehow to consequences

00:44:17.299 --> 00:44:19.449
if that's the reason

00:44:19.449 --> 00:44:23.259
not to tell a false promise

00:44:23.259 --> 00:44:24.150
so

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:27.839
John Stuart Mill agreed with that criticism
against Kant

00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:32.229
but John Stuart Mill was wrong

00:44:32.229 --> 00:44:34.939
you're in good company though

00:44:34.939 --> 00:44:37.339
you're in good company, Tim

00:44:37.339 --> 00:44:38.999
Kant is often read

00:44:38.999 --> 00:44:40.339
as Tim 

00:44:40.339 --> 00:44:43.720
just read him

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.799
as appealing to consequences

00:44:45.799 --> 00:44:48.899
the world would be worse off

00:44:48.899 --> 00:44:54.369
if everybody lied because then nobody could
rely on anybody else's word

00:44:54.369 --> 00:44:57.299
therefore you shouldn't lie

00:44:57.299 --> 00:44:59.959
that's not what Kant is saying exactly

00:44:59.959 --> 00:45:01.599
although it's easy

00:45:01.599 --> 00:45:05.349
to interpret him as saying that

00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:06.900
I think what he's saying

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.359
is that this is the test

00:45:10.359 --> 00:45:14.649
this is the test of whether the maxim

00:45:14.649 --> 00:45:16.640
corresponds with the categorical imperative

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.660
it isn't exactly the reason

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.609
it's not the reason

00:45:21.609 --> 00:45:24.059
the reason you should universalize

00:45:24.059 --> 00:45:26.660
to test your maxim

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:30.299
is to see whether

00:45:30.299 --> 00:45:32.559
you are privileging

00:45:32.559 --> 00:45:36.679
your particular needs and desires

00:45:36.679 --> 00:45:38.539
over everybody else's

00:45:38.539 --> 00:45:40.919
it's a way of pointing to this feature to this

00:45:40.919 --> 00:45:45.319
this feature to this demand of the categorical  
imperative

00:45:45.319 --> 00:45:48.480
that the reasons for your actions shouldn't

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.419
depend

00:45:49.419 --> 00:45:51.369
or their justification

00:45:51.369 --> 00:45:55.850
on your interests, your needs, your special
circumstances

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:57.519
being more important

00:45:57.519 --> 00:45:59.679
than somebody else's

00:45:59.679 --> 00:46:03.749
that I think is the moral intuition lying
behind the universalization

00:46:03.749 --> 00:46:05.089
test

00:46:05.089 --> 00:46:07.479
so let me spell out the second

00:46:07.479 --> 00:46:11.149
Kant’s second version of the categorical imperative

00:46:11.149 --> 00:46:12.449
perhaps

00:46:12.449 --> 00:46:16.789
in a way that's more intuitively accessible

00:46:16.789 --> 00:46:19.869
than the formula of universal law

00:46:19.869 --> 00:46:21.819
it's the formula

00:46:21.819 --> 00:46:23.920
of humanity

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.449
as an end

00:46:26.449 --> 00:46:28.189
Kant introduces

00:46:28.189 --> 00:46:31.380
the second version of the categorical imperative

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.189
with the following line of argument

00:46:35.189 --> 00:46:37.349
we can't base the categorical imperative

00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:41.579
on any particular interests, purposes, or ends

00:46:41.579 --> 00:46:42.910
because then it would be

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:46.429
only relative to the person whose ends they
were

00:46:46.429 --> 00:46:47.999
but suppose

00:46:47.999 --> 00:46:49.509
there was something

00:46:49.509 --> 00:46:51.349
whose existence

00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:52.709
has in itself

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:54.699
and absolute value

00:46:54.699 --> 00:46:57.259
an end in itself

00:46:57.259 --> 00:46:59.640
then in it

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.269
and in it alone

00:47:01.269 --> 00:47:06.450
would there be the ground of a possible a
categorical imperative

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:09.019
well, what is there

00:47:09.019 --> 00:47:15.389
that we can think of as having it's end in
itself

00:47:15.389 --> 00:47:16.779
Kant’s answer is this

00:47:16.779 --> 00:47:18.739
I say that man

00:47:18.739 --> 00:47:21.909
and in general every rational being

00:47:21.909 --> 00:47:24.420
exists as an end in himself

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.749
not nearly as a means for arbitrary use

00:47:27.749 --> 00:47:30.699
by this or that will

00:47:30.699 --> 00:47:32.869
and here Kant distinguishes

00:47:32.869 --> 00:47:35.069
between persons on the one hand

00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:36.279
and things

00:47:36.279 --> 00:47:38.069
on the other

00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:40.709
rational beings are persons

00:47:40.709 --> 00:47:42.979
the don't just have a relative value

00:47:42.979 --> 00:47:45.009
for us

00:47:45.009 --> 00:47:48.099
but if anything has they have an absolute
value

00:47:48.099 --> 00:47:50.059
an intrinsic value

00:47:50.059 --> 00:47:51.269
that is

00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:53.769
rational beings have dignity

00:47:53.769 --> 00:47:56.349
they're worthy of reverence and respect

00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:58.479
this line of reasoning

00:47:58.479 --> 00:48:04.439
leads Kant to the second formulation of the
categorical imperative which is this

00:48:04.439 --> 00:48:06.180
act in such a way

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.909
that you always treated humanity

00:48:08.909 --> 00:48:11.019
whether in your own person

00:48:11.019 --> 00:48:13.949
or in the person of any other

00:48:13.949 --> 00:48:16.289
never simply as a means

00:48:16.289 --> 00:48:17.469
but always

00:48:17.469 --> 00:48:19.329
at the same time

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:21.189
as an end

00:48:21.189 --> 00:48:24.910
so that's the formula of humanity

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:27.219
as an end

00:48:27.219 --> 00:48:30.659
the idea that human beings as rational beings

00:48:30.659 --> 00:48:33.299
are ends in themselves

00:48:33.299 --> 00:48:36.209
not open to use

00:48:36.209 --> 00:48:38.749
merely as a means

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:42.229
when I make a false promise to you

00:48:42.229 --> 00:48:46.549
I mean using you as a means

00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:48.389
to my ends

00:48:48.389 --> 00:48:51.160
to my desire for the hundred dollars

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.269
and so I'm failing to respect

00:48:55.269 --> 00:48:58.699
you, I'm failing to respect your dignity

00:48:58.699 --> 00:49:01.189
I'm manipulating you

00:49:01.189 --> 00:49:03.319
now consider the example

00:49:03.319 --> 00:49:05.689
of the duty of against

00:49:05.689 --> 00:49:09.119
suicide

00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:09.969
murder

00:49:09.969 --> 00:49:12.179
and suicide

00:49:12.179 --> 00:49:17.469
are at odds with the categorical imperative
why?

00:49:17.469 --> 00:49:19.670
if I murdered someone

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:23.739
I'm taking their life for some

00:49:23.739 --> 00:49:26.229
purpose. either because

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:28.149
I'm a hired killer

00:49:28.149 --> 00:49:31.829
or I'm in the throws of some great anger
or passion

00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:34.549
well I have some interest or purpose

00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:35.880
that is particular

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.599
for the sake of which I'm using them

00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:40.149
as a means

00:49:40.149 --> 00:49:42.329
murder violates

00:49:42.329 --> 00:49:46.089
the categorical imperative

00:49:46.089 --> 00:49:48.499
for Kant, morally speaking

00:49:48.499 --> 00:49:50.949
suicide is on a par with murder

00:49:50.949 --> 00:49:55.759
it's on a par with murder because what we
violate

00:49:55.759 --> 00:49:57.519
when we take a life

00:49:57.519 --> 00:50:02.029
when we take someone's life our's or somebody
else's

00:50:02.029 --> 00:50:04.199
we use that person

00:50:04.199 --> 00:50:05.950
we use a rational being

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:09.779
we use humanity as a means

00:50:09.779 --> 00:50:12.500
and so we fail to respect humanity

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.349
as an end

00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:16.470
and that capacity for reasons

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:18.389
that humanity

00:50:18.389 --> 00:50:21.099
that commands respect

00:50:21.099 --> 00:50:23.719
that is to ground of dignity

00:50:23.719 --> 00:50:25.019
that humanity

00:50:25.019 --> 00:50:28.699
that capacity for a reason

00:50:28.699 --> 00:50:30.660
resides undifferentiated

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:32.159
in all of us

00:50:32.159 --> 00:50:35.299
and so I violate that dignity

00:50:35.299 --> 00:50:38.710
in my own person if I commit suicide

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:39.689
and in murder

00:50:39.689 --> 00:50:43.489
if I take somebody else's life from a moral
point of view

00:50:43.489 --> 00:50:45.309
they're the same

00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:47.969
and the reason they're the same

00:50:47.969 --> 00:50:49.069
has to do

00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:51.789
with the universal character

00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:53.229
and ground

00:50:53.229 --> 00:50:56.389
of the moral law

00:50:56.389 --> 00:50:58.739
the reason that we have to respect

00:50:58.739 --> 00:51:01.150
the dignity of other people

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:02.290
has not to do

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:03.349
with anything

00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:06.189
in particular about them

00:51:06.189 --> 00:51:12.289
and so respect, Kantian respect is
unlike love in this way

00:51:12.289 --> 00:51:14.749
it's unlike sympathy

00:51:14.749 --> 00:51:20.049
it's unlike solidarity or fellow feeling
for altruism

00:51:20.049 --> 00:51:25.329
because love and those other particular virtues
are reasons for caring about other people

00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:28.359
have to do with who they are in particular

00:51:28.359 --> 00:51:30.380
but respect for Kant

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.819
respect

00:51:31.819 --> 00:51:34.009
is respect for 

00:51:34.009 --> 00:51:36.059
humanity which is universal

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:38.919
for a rational capacity which is universal

00:51:38.919 --> 00:51:41.159
and that's why violating it

00:51:41.159 --> 00:51:42.700
in my own case

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.519
is as objectionable

00:51:44.519 --> 00:51:45.570
as violating it

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:48.190
in the case of any other

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:55.190
questions or rejections?

00:51:58.129 --> 00:52:01.849
I guess I'm somewhat worried about

00:52:01.849 --> 00:52:04.549
Kant’s

00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:08.619
statement that you cannot use a person
as a means because every person is an end

00:52:08.619 --> 00:52:10.699
in and of themselves

00:52:10.699 --> 00:52:13.229
because it seems that

00:52:13.229 --> 00:52:16.409
that everyday in order to get something accomplished
for that day

00:52:16.409 --> 00:52:20.559
I must use myself as a means to some end

00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:24.489
and I must use the people around me as a means
to some ends as well

00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:25.859
for instance suppose

00:52:25.859 --> 00:52:28.379
that

00:52:28.379 --> 00:52:31.609
I want to do well in a class and I have to write a
paper

00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:34.949
I have to use myself as a means to write the paper

00:52:34.949 --> 00:52:38.399
suppose I want to buy something, food.

00:52:38.399 --> 00:52:41.160
I must go to the store, use the person

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.599
working behind the counters as a means for me to  
purchase my food.

00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:47.909
You're right, that's true

00:52:47.909 --> 00:52:49.849
what's your name? Patrick

00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:52.839
Patrick you're not doing anything wrong

00:52:52.839 --> 00:52:55.629
you're not violating the categorical imperative

00:52:55.629 --> 00:52:58.130
when you use other people as a means

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:03.089
that's not objectionable provided

00:53:03.089 --> 00:53:08.409
when we deal with other people for the sake
of advancing our projects and purposes and

00:53:08.409 --> 00:53:09.049
interests,

00:53:09.049 --> 00:53:11.569
which we all do,

00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:12.329
provided

00:53:12.329 --> 00:53:13.579
we treat them

00:53:13.579 --> 00:53:14.660
in a way

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.690
that is consistent

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:18.609
with respect for their

00:53:18.609 --> 00:53:20.759
dignity

00:53:20.759 --> 00:53:24.180
and what it means to respect them

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:26.119
is given by

00:53:26.119 --> 00:53:31.880
the categorical imperative.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.129
are you persuaded?

00:53:34.129 --> 00:53:38.549
do you think that Kant has given

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.499
a compelling account a persuasive account

00:53:41.499 --> 00:53:48.410
of the supreme principle of morality?

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.899
re-read the groundwork

00:53:50.899 --> 00:53:57.899
and we'll try to answer that question next
time.
