00:00:02.503 --> 00:00:03.403
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.205
SHOW, MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.107
WE GOT A PROGRAM FOR YOU
TONIGHT.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.844
THIS IS-- THIS IS EXCITING,
ANNA KENDRICK, OH SHE'S ONE

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:12.579
OF OUR FAVORITES, SHE IS SO
GOOD. "INTO THE WOODS",

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:14.948
SHE IS GOING TO BE HERE, VERY
TALENTED.

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:18.051
BUT FIRST, YOU MAY HAVE BEEN
NOTICING THE

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:21.889
JUSTICE SYSTEM'S RECENT
CONSISTENT FAILURE TO INDICT

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:25.993
POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE
KILLED UNARMED BLACK MEN

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.561
HAS SPARKED PROTESTS ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.463
THE DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE
BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:30.631
PEACEFUL.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.432
WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT
FOR PEOPLE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.867
THEM.

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:35.903
DIFFICULT, NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:38.038
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO
PROTEST, THEY GO ON THE

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.407
SIDEWALK AND MAKE NOISE AND
HOLD SIGNS AN LET PEOPLE

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.875
KNOW YOU DISAGREE.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.747
BUT WHEN YOU BLOCK TRAFFIC,
THAT'S A FORM OF VIOLENCE.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.849
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES!

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.585
THANK YOU, BLOCKING TRAFFIC
IS A FORM OF VIOLENCE.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:56.723
HOW DARE THESE MARCHERS PUT
OUR STREETS IN SOME KIND

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:59.059
OF-- LET'S CALL IT A
CHOKEHOLD OF TRAFFIC.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.162
HOW DARE THEY!

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:04.231
WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO
DO WITH THE STREETS BEING

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:07.568
BLACK, NOW, DOES IT?

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:11.238
YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE THAT
CONVINCED THAT IMPEDING

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:15.142
MANHATTAN DRIVERS IS A FORM
OF VIOLENCE, WELL, I THINK IT'S

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.979
TIME TO INDICT THE NEW YORK
MARATHON.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:21.915
THE MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY
PARADE, THE PUERTO RICAN DAY

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:25.385
PARADE, THE GAY PRIDE PARADE,
THE ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE,

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:28.455
THE HALLOWEEN PARADE, THE GERMAN
AMERICAN STEUBEN PARADE OR ANY

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:31.925
RANDOM POP-UP STREET FAIR
SELLING MYSTERY MEATS AND

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.029
TUBE SOCKS, AND I HAVEN'T
EVEN GOTTEN TO THE MOST

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:42.002
VIOLENT OF OFFENDERS.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:45.205
PLEASE, THAT TREE IS LIKE A
GLITTERING BERLIN WALL

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:51.245
PREVENTING ANY MOVEMENT FROM
EAST TO WEST.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:52.613
MR. CLAUS, TEAR DOWN THAT
TREE.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:55.949
(APPLAUSE)
BUT IT'S ONE THING FOR

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:58.819
PROTESTORS, IT'S ONE THING
FOR PROTESTORS TO DO

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.622
VIOLENCE TO OUR CITY STREETS
AND TRAFFIC.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:05.425
IT IS QUITE ANOTHER FOR THEM
TO USE EXCESSIVE FORCE

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.393
AGAINST CHRISTMAS ITSELF.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:07.794
&gt;&gt; IT IS CREATING HAVOC.

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:09.730
AND WE'VE GOT TWO WEEKS BEFORE
CHRISTMAS.

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:12.599
DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING
TO HAVE SOME IMPACT-- I MEAN

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:20.407
WHO WANTS TO GO SHOPPING AT
MACY'S WHEN THIS IS GOING ON.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.281
&gt;&gt; Jon: PROTESTORS PREVENTING
PEOPLE FROM SHOPPING AT MACY'S.

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:32.052
I HOPE THESE SHOPPERS SHALL
OVERCOME.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:37.157
NOW THAT'S-- YES, I CAN'T
BUY-- YES, YES, BLACK FRIDAY

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:37.558
MATTERS.

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.960
IT DOES.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:43.597
THE PROTESTS HAVE EVEN
SPILLED OVER INTO

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.665
PROFESSIONAL SPORTS.

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:47.701
&gt;&gt; ATHLETES DONNING T-SHIRTS
EXPRESSING A DESIRE FOR

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:48.635
JUSTICE.

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.771
NOW LAST TIME I CHECKED,
T-SHIRTS DON'T BLOCK

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:51.772
TRAFFIC.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:53.473
THEY DON'T PREVENT FROM YOU
SHOPPING AT MACY'S.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.943
THEY SHOULD BE A PERFECTLY
ACCEPTABLE WAY TO EXPRESS

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.311
ONE'S FEELINGS ABOUT
POLITICAL ISSUES.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:03:00.514
&gt;&gt; I WONDERED TO MYSELF,
WHAT IF LEBRON JAMES INSTEAD

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:03.584
HAD A SHIRT BE A BETTER
FATHER TO YOUR DAD.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:05.652
I MEAN BE A BETTER FATHER TO
YOUR SON.

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.321
RAISE YOUR CHILDREN.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.090
THOSE DIFFICULT ISSUES ARE
NOT BEING DEALT WITH BY THE

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.225
BLACK COMMUNITY.

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.360
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, BE A BETTER
FATHER.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:16.330
LEBRON ACTUALLY LIVES THAT
MESSAGE.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:20.100
AND IF HE WANTS ADVICE ON
SHIRTS I'M SURE HE WILL ASK

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:23.303
SOMEONE WHO WEARS ONE.

00:03:23.337 --> 00:03:25.839
BUT POINT TAKEN.

00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:30.277
POINT TAKEN-- NO, NOW-- WE
HAVE TO RESPECT THE POINT.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.146
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY ONE OF
THESE TWO MEN HAS FIVE KIDS

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.583
IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS BY
MULTIPLE BABY MOMMAS.

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:39.753
AND THE OTHER IS LEBRON
JAMES.

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:44.825
BUT OBVIOUSLY, GERALDO ISN'T
THE ONLY ONE UPSET ABOUT

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:46.527
THE T-SHIRT PROTESTS.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.629
&gt;&gt; THE CLEVELAND POLICE
UNION DEMANDS AN APOLOGY

00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:50.264
FROM THE CLEVELAND BROWNS.

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:53.433
ONE OF THE BROWNS PLAYERS
ANDREW HAWKINS WALKED ONTO

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.536
THE FIELD ON SUNDAY WEARING
THIS T-SHIRT.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.238
IT CALLED FOR JUSTICE FOR
TAMIR RICE.

00:03:58.272 --> 00:04:00.674
THE POLICE UNION SAYS THE
TEAM SHOULD STICK TO WHAT IT

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:03.343
KNOWS BEST AND THAT WOULD BE
FOOTBALL.

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:05.579
&gt;&gt; Jon: WAIT.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.514
STICK TO WHAT THEY
KNOW BEST FOOTBALL?

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:10.184
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE CLEVELAND BROWNS,

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:11.485
RIGHT?

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:16.356
I MEAN--
(LAUGHTER)

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.392
RANDOM CHEAP SHOT AT THE
CLEVELAND BROWNS.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.695
LOOK, IT'S NOT AS IF THERE
ISN'T A CONVERSATION

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.898
WARRANTED ABOUT THE
CLEVELAND POLICE DEPARTMENT

00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:27.301
BY T-SHIRT OR OTHERWISE.

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:29.336
&gt;&gt; CLEVELAND'S POLICE FORCE
HAS BEEN UNDER FEDERAL

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.839
INVESTIGATION SINCE 2013.

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:34.107
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
EXAMINED OVER 600 CASES

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:36.410
&gt;&gt; THE CLEVELAND
DIVISION OF PUBLIC POLICE

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.546
ENGAGES IN A PATTERN AND
PRACTICE OF USING EXCESSIVE

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.581
FORCE.

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.915
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, I GUESS THE
ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WHEN

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.885
FOOTBALL PLAYERS USE
EXCESSIVE FORCE, THEY GET

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:46.687
PENALIZED.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.724
AND IF THAT-- 15 YARDS, AM I
WRONG?

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:54.461
(LAUGHTER)
AND IF THAT FOOTBALL

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:57.831
PLAYER DISRESPECTED THE
OFFICER WHO SHOT AND KILLED

00:04:57.865 --> 00:05:02.736
TAMIR RICE, A 12-YEAR-OLD
HOLD A BB GUN WITHIN 2

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:06.139
SECONDS OF ROLLING UP ON HIM,
YOU SHOULD HEAR WHAT THIS

00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:07.307
OFFICER'S FORMER
EMPLOYER SAID ABOUT HIM.

00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:08.175
&gt;&gt; AT HIS PREVIOUS JOB THE
INDEPENDENCE POLICE DEPARTMENT,

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:09.543
OFFICER LOEHMANN'S PERSONNEL

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:12.346
RECORDS SHOW HE WAS IN THE
PROCESS OF BEING FIRED.

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.082
HIS SUPERVISOR DESCRIBING AN
EMOTIONAL MELTDOWN.

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.584
&gt;&gt; ADDING THAT HE WOULD NOT
BE ABLE TO SUBSTANTIALLY

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:21.255
COPE OR MAKE GOOD DECISIONS
DURING OR RESULTING FROM ANY

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:23.290
OTHER STRESSFUL SITUATION.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.360
&gt;&gt; BUT THE CLEVELAND POLICE
NEVER ASKED TO SEE LOEHMANN'S

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:30.097
PERSONNEL RECORDS.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.399
&gt;&gt; Jon: EVEN WITHOUT READING
HIS RECORD, THEY SHOULD HAVE

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:34.334
REALIZED SOMETHING WAS WRONG
WHEN THEY MET HIM.

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:40.941
&gt;&gt; THESE BABIES CAN GO OFF.

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:43.977
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO WHY SHOULDN'T-- WHY
SHOULDN'T THE CLEVELAND

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.314
BROWNS OR ANY OTHER
CLEVELAND CITIZEN TALK ABOUT

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.083
A HUGE AND ULTIMATELY FATAL
DEPARTMENTAL SCREW UP?

00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:52.486
&gt;&gt; THE CLEVELAND POLICE
UNION HEADS ARGUED ATHLETES

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.222
HAD NO BUSINESS WEIGHING IN
AT ALL SAYING QUOTE IT IS

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:58.959
PRETTY PATHETIC WHEN ATHLETES
THINK THEY KNOW THE LAW.

00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:01.461
&gt;&gt; Jon: I GET WHERE YOU'RE
COMING FROM.

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:02.763
DUMB OLD FOOTBALL PLAYER.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:08.202
I CATCH A BALL WHILE WEARING
A SHELL ON MY HEAD!

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:09.903
I MEAN SERIOUSLY.

00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:13.574
WHAT MAKES THIS GUY THINK
HE'S GOT AN OPINION WORTH

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:15.676
SHARING ON THIS COMPLICATED
ISSUE?

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:20.781
AND THAT HE, THE FOOTBALL
PLAYER, SHOULDN'T APOLOGIZE.

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:24.251
&gt;&gt; MY MOMMA'S TAUGHT ME MY
ENTIRE LIFE TO RESPECT LAW

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:25.352
ENFORCEMENT.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.988
I HAVE FAMILY, CLOSE FRIENDS
WHO ARE INCREDIBLE POLICE

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:29.056
OFFICERS.

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:31.058
AND I TELL THEM ALL THE TIME
HOW THEY ARE MUCH BRAVER

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:34.828
THAN ME FOR IT. UNFORTUNATELY,
MY MOM ALSO TAUGHT ME THAT

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:36.897
JUST AS THERE ARE GOOD
POLICE OFFICERS, THERE ARE

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.000
SOME NOT SO GOOD POLICE
OFFICERS THAT WOULD ASSUME

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:44.071
THE WORST OF ME WITHOUT
KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT ME,

00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:45.372
FOR REASONS I CAN'T CONTROL.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:49.510
TO ME JUSTICE MEANS THAT THE
INNOCENT SHOULD BE FOUND

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:50.577
INNOCENT.

00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:56.917
IT MEANS THAT THOSE WHO DO
WRONG SHOULD GET THEIR DUE

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.285
PUNISHMENT.

00:06:58.318 --> 00:07:01.755
ULTIMATELY, IT MEANS FAIR
TREATMENT.

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:07.861
SO A CALL FOR JUSTICE
SHOULDN'T OFFEND OR

00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:09.062
DISRESPECT ANYBODY.

00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:14.701
A CALL FOR JUSTICE SHOULDN'T
WARRANT AN APOLOGY.

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:20.474
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
