00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.140
(pleasant music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
bipedal, naked, large brain.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
Lone the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.863
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.283
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.410
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.693
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.430
CARTA brings together experts

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.870
from diverse disciplines to exchange

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.703
insights on who we are
and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.723
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:24.524
(pleasant music)

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.990
- Okay, so we're going to move into

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.840
a new space in time right now

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810
we're going to move into the night.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.500
Some 3,500 years ago,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.080
humans engineered control of fire.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.873
It's actually quite complicated.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.640
There was a huge caloric gain from food

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.030
because cooked food makes
many more calories available.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.480
Protection from predators, but what's

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.670
most interesting about it is humans

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.370
extended the day by four or five hours

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.703
to become the shortest
sleepers of all primates.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.560
And the time that it gained
was economically unproductive.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.520
No more calories were going in

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.600
nothing was happening economically.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.260
And yet, the physical
changes in circadian rhythms

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.620
were enormous to extend the day.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.050
And there was some very major impacts

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.610
on health from reduction in melatonin

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.360
and other things, so there were costs.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.875
So the question is why?

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.320
Why was this selected for?

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.310
Why didn't we just go to sleep?

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.940
So what I'm going to suggest here

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.570
is that firelight opened
a new time in space

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.130
for the imagination and for the arts.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.977
There's the wonderful
quote from a German writer,

00:02:59.977 --> 00:03:02.117
"Nobody sees anything in the night;

00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:04.547
"everybody sees something in the night."

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.630
So this is the night is often

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.330
the time of the imagination.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.010
If I would define the
imagination for this talk,

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.350
as the ability to form mental images

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.130
of something not present to the senses

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.693
and never wholly perceived in reality.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.060
So what transpires by day and night?

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.990
Why do firelight hours matter?

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.350
Well this is not so easy to find out,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.420
but I became very interested among this

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.890
among the Ju/'hoansi bushmen
of Botswana and Namibia.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.050
These are a group of people

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.960
who live by hunting and gathering.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.240
They utilize about 100 plant species,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.470
30 animal species, and
in the hard times of year

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.150
they even have to gather water.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.470
The only water they get is

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.283
from melon or from roots.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.630
And they live in very small camps

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.630
of 25 to 40 people with
egalitarian structure,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.313
age hierarchy, and
recognized camp leaders.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.150
So the interaction, scale of interaction

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.050
every day life is very very small.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.480
And yet, they have these incredibly

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.310
sophisticated social institutions.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.270
And the question is,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.400
when you live on a postage stamp

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.460
how do you see the big picture?

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.200
So that was my question to see

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.530
what happens in the day and the night?

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.780
Here are some of the cultural
institutions that they have.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.200
Complex kinship systems defining both

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.820
biological and imaginary or fictive kin.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.440
These systems are so complicated

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.300
that I after 30 years of working there

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.100
I'm still trying to figure them out.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.360
Rules for widespread food sharing.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.260
They have arranged marriage
and elaborate marriage rites.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.400
Sophisticated systems of land tenure.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.360
Trance healing and an unbelievable

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.910
communication with the spirit world.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.230
And then, networks of hxaro exchange,

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.390
widespread access to
the resources of others

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.620
people move around, we'll see this.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.150
So what happens at day and night?

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.413
That was my question.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.150
And with data in 1974 I collected

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.870
information on day and night conversations

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.130
with groups of five or more adults

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.800
longer than 15 to 20 minutes.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.120
And then, 2011 and 2013,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.960
I collected the full stories

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.330
and had them transcribed and translated

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.630
by a team of Ju/'hoansi who are now

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.550
working with laptops and sending me

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.653
the most amazing emails.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.085
All of the gossip comes
through by email now.

00:05:40.085 --> 00:05:42.120
(audience laughing)

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.900
So the day talk which
is really interesting

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.180
is the topics of conversation

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.370
are largely practical,
economic issues, and planning

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.060
and an enormous amount of
complaint and criticism

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.490
as people get on to each
other's case, gossip.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.560
And people say, well gossip
maintains social norms.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.150
But in fact I found 30 to 40%

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.485
of the gossip was just total bull.

00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:08.318
(audience laughing)

00:06:08.318 --> 00:06:11.810
It was constructed for social strategies.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.380
And so you can see that, that was the day.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.970
And then there's the switch to the night.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.730
All day long as an anthropologist

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.790
people are on to my case to give me

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.500
things to give them things
to help with things.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.180
At the night that's off limits,

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.973
everything mellows off and
I don't get a single demand.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.687
Isak Dinesen, or Karen Blixen, wrote,

00:06:32.687 --> 00:06:34.757
"At times I believe that my feet have been

00:06:34.757 --> 00:06:38.007
"set upon a road which
I shall go on following,

00:06:38.007 --> 00:06:40.367
"and that slowly the center of gravity

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:42.127
"of my being will shift over

00:06:42.127 --> 00:06:43.827
"from the world of the day,

00:06:43.827 --> 00:06:45.607
"from the domain of organizing

00:06:45.607 --> 00:06:47.478
"and regulating universal powers,

00:06:47.478 --> 00:06:50.367
"into the world of the imagination,

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:52.037
"with the coming of the dusk,

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:54.107
"with the lighting of the first star

00:06:54.107 --> 00:06:56.140
"and the first candle."

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.580
And that's the transition you feel.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.180
So I'd looked at nights of 36 nights

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.670
in four camps, eight nights were singing,

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.080
music, singing, gathering together,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.710
six nights were trance healing dances,

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.080
and most nights were
conversation and story telling.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.260
And that's where I
recorded the conversations.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.270
And the results were quite astounding.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.890
All you really need to do
is look at the orange here.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.130
Oh actually, the print is pretty big,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.800
but you can see in the day

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.670
there are few stories, economic complaint,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.590
at night people get off each other's cases

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.150
and they mostly sit around

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.883
and tell stories and come together.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.370
And so the moods mellow when the sun set,

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.730
and I can tell you it's
very harsh in the day,

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.360
because it's a sharing economy

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.820
and people are always mad that

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.500
he gave that to her and not to me.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.560
And people gather around single fires

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.830
to talk and to story.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.580
They talk about their own experiences

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.270
or those of others in a very

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.970
entrancing, compelling rhythmic language.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.710
The listeners are stunned with suspense,

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.850
rolling with laughter, close to tears,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.520
and emotions are synchronized

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.463
because everybody is
relating to the same story.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.520
And the people they talk about

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.030
are often people who
are 200 kilometers away.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.170
And they bring that
person right to the heart

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.213
so delicious are the details of the story.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.402
And but the storytelling what I'm

00:08:31.402 --> 00:08:33.340
going to suggest here is that

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.310
it gives the big picture of society.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.600
Good storytellers transmit visions

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.700
of social institutions that are imaginary

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.000
like kinship system, exchange systems.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.450
And they're not present to the senses,

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.330
they're never wholly perceived in reality.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.040
But the people, the few people

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.520
like this old lady who
can put stories together

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.370
to imagine the big picture of society

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.890
and tell about it they
become very influential.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.650
These are the organizers and the mediators

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.520
who have this skill.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.950
And this is example of hxaro exchange.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.654
This is an exchange of gifts where people

00:09:11.654 --> 00:09:14.660
choose partners up to 200 kilometers away.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.060
That longest line there is 200 kilometers.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.930
And this is a social security system.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.360
So they keep exchanging gifts

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.780
and the underlying relationship is when

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.030
you're in trouble I'll help you,

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.340
you can come live with me,

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.460
and when I'm in trouble
you can come live with me.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.960
So that is the exchange,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.450
the average person has about 15 to 16

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.760
of these partners and the Ju/'hoansi

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.620
spend about two to three months a year

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.760
living with these partners.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.060
This old lady is wearing all her gifts

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.030
to advertise herself because

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.350
she's trying to marry off her grandson.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.550
And she's showing how
well connected she is.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.900
And then, there are stories that give

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.610
the big picture of regional gatherings,

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.550
hxaro exchange, and kin relations,

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.870
and the one story I collected

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.140
it was from the 1940s of six bands

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.770
coming together at a particularly

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.020
good time of year to harvest morama beans.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.030
And this story goes on for pages

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.790
and the relations between
the bands are described.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:25.520
And the complex kinship
relations are described.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.750
Everybody named would tell how they're

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.200
related to so and so, and
so and so, and so and so.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.440
And this gives you an idea of the area

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.810
from which people came for this gathering.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.250
The whole thing would be about

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.960
oh 200 or 300 kilometers, north south.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.140
And this is sort of an excerpt

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.450
from the story, different
people were there,

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.977
some were there from the

00:10:49.977 --> 00:10:51.610
(speaks foreign language) Eiseb Valley

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.060
and some Nharo from the further south.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.720
And some from the
(speaks foreign language)

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.500
where there is a forest with

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.340
lots of combretum trees.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.320
The northern people were there also,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.750
they were called (speaks
foreign language) also came.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.900
The owners of (speaks
foreign language) also came.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.760
So they, and then they tell how

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.770
everyone is related.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.150
And this is a story put together

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.520
from many that she had heard

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.280
because she was a little
girl when this happened.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.520
And then they described what
happened at the gathering.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.167
This goes on for pages.

00:11:21.167 --> 00:11:23.127
"She got the other skin apron and gave it

00:11:23.127 --> 00:11:25.347
"to my late grandmother
(speaks foreign language).

00:11:25.347 --> 00:11:27.127
"She took out another skin apron

00:11:27.127 --> 00:11:28.067
"and gave it to her aunt,

00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:29.447
"the late (speaks foreign language).

00:11:29.447 --> 00:11:31.197
"And then she gave out more gifts.

00:11:31.197 --> 00:11:33.347
"And then it was a
beginning of gift giving.

00:11:33.347 --> 00:11:35.957
"He (speaks foreign language)
tried to pull the beaded

00:11:35.957 --> 00:11:38.497
"headband on his head but it didn't fit.

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.047
"So he took it off his head and gave it

00:11:40.047 --> 00:11:42.429
"to my granny (speaks foreign language)

00:11:42.429 --> 00:11:43.650
"and gave other things to her."

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.300
And this goes on, and on, and on.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.340
And you don't only have stories,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.760
but for the other form of arts

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.850
you have gifts so that these partnerships

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.610
of mutual obligation are
marked by gift exchange,

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.380
beautifully made, artistically made gifts.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.730
And these gifts represent relationships,

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.530
but they also carry stories

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.090
of who gave them to whom.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.070
They go through long chains of giving.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.730
So they create these huge networks,

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.890
so each gift would have
a history in stories.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.840
And then another example
would be in marriage.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.500
You don't see many marriage.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.900
When you live in a
small band of 25 people,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.430
you may see a few in your lifetime.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.580
And they're infrequent, but the procedures

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.600
are elaborate, they're arranged.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.970
And usually the girl is married

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.220
around 13 and rejects the man

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.000
and makes a big fuss.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.550
And these stories are hilarious

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.090
of old ladies telling about how

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.140
they rejected their husband and ran away

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.950
and destroyed the wedding gifts.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.980
And this prepares young
people for marriage

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.420
knowing that the first years

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.209
are going to be kind of rough.

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:57.362
(audience laughing)

00:12:57.362 --> 00:12:59.870
And that they'll get used to them.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.880
And then parents also learn

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.360
of all the case studies of marriage

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.040
told the stories and they
know how to manage them.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.820
Okay, the other thing which is people

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.520
the Ju/'hoansi do trance healing

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.410
in which the women sit and clap

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.730
all night and sing.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.210
And the men, the trance healers,

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.740
travel to the spirit world where they

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.730
negotiate with the spirit
asking the spirits not,

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.610
asking them not to take people away,

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.970
to leave them on Earth
that they love them.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.440
Giving everyone preventive medicine.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.760
And in these stories the trance healers

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.880
at night will tell about
how far they traveled.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.670
I mean I was once telling people

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.830
how about we're sending men to the moon

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.707
and there's an old guy
who looked at me and said,

00:13:45.707 --> 00:13:46.732
"Been there."

00:13:46.732 --> 00:13:49.732
(audience laughing)

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.100
This is, you could imagine the trancers

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.000
then in telling the stories

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.350
connect people with a shared cosmology,

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.710
or shared sense of the spirit world,

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.763
shared sense of what causes misfortune.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.570
So sort of to wrap up,

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.290
then day, night, and the imagination.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.090
So the day you have economics,

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:18.033
technology, nitty-gritty
of social relations.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.770
The night the stories are about

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.900
imagined roles, rules, communities

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.440
that are not tangible or physically

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.770
coherent in time and space.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.840
So they're imagining society

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.830
in their social institutions.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.900
They also imagine as change comes

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.980
they can also imagine they can innovate

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.813
and imagine changes as well.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.210
And then, stories stimulate imaginations

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.710
to construct the big picture

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.630
of social institutions and relations.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.660
And very very importantly,

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.330
because we have theory of mind,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.020
because we can read what
other people are thinking,

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.420
they really make people imagine

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.750
the thoughts and the feelings of others.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.190
That you can really understand that people

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.120
feel differently about things,

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.880
and it brings a lot of understanding

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.990
into it and people put themselves

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.180
in other people's shoes in the stories

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.330
because they're so emotionally
laden it's incredible.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.960
So essentially what I found in this study

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.000
is that the evening hours provide

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.433
a space for the arts
and for the imagination.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.300
And the arts would include also

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.630
music, dance, and stories.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.540
And does this happen beyond the Kalahari?

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.333
We moved up to the Arctic now.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.270
Yes, these kinds of stories are told

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.100
in all hunter-gatherer societies at night.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.360
If you look through the
human relation area files,

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.360
there are 38 mentions
of sanctioning gossip,

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.640
none of them is at night,
they're all in the day.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.650
For 60 hunter-gatherer societies,

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.430
information on stories, songs,

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.320
healing, and ceremonies is in the files.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.730
And of course, as we all know,

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.120
we too hunt and gather stories through

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.030
theater, film, recording, literature

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.800
to feed our imaginations.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.440
I mean, we really are
as addicted as anybody.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.440
So to end then, I just
want to ask this question.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.850
I often think about that what is

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.590
in our society the impact of checking

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.360
the phone, flipping off the light switch,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.240
with no time for the
imagination to explore,

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.580
to ponder, and to position events

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.940
and relationships of the day

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.093
in the past, present, and future?

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.442
And so, and these are
thanks to my coworkers.

00:16:53.442 --> 00:16:57.127
(audience applauding)

00:16:57.127 --> 00:16:59.877
(pleasant music)
