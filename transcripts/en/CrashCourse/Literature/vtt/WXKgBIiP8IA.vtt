00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature,

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:08.259
and today we’re on a raft, floating down the great American river, reading the great american novel.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.400
That’s right, today we’re going to be discussing Mark Twain’s the “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.”

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.480
Ernest Hemingway once said,
“It’s the best book we’ve had.”

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.720
“All American writing comes from that,” he added, and then threatened to punch anyone who disagreed.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.800
He was such an American Ernest Hemingway!

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.600
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! No, no, no, Hemingway
lived like half his life in France!?

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.880
Well played, Me from the past, and he spent much of the rest of his life in Key West, which I also don’t think is really America.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.940
But anyway, Me From the Past, it doesn’t
matter where you hung out with F Scott Fitzgerald,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.740
it matters where you died, and Hemingway died
in Idaho, which is proper America!

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.760
I’m sorry, what are we talking about today?
Huck Finn?

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:48.260
[Theme Music]

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.500
So, today we’ll look briefly at the creator of Huck Finn, Samuel Langhorne Clemens. A.K.A. Mark Twain.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.820
We’ll talk through the plot and what makes
the book so important in American literature,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.660
and why it’s still quite controversial.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.140
In our next video, we’ll explore some of the metaphors — the river, the raft —

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.060
and talk about why when people call Huck Finn
the Great American Novel, they generally mean,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.800
“well, but not the last 50 pages.”

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.140
So, Sam Clemens was born to a not especially prosperous family in Missouri in 1835, the sixth of seven children.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.870
His father died when he was 11.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.080
He quit school in the fifth grade.
He then became a printer’s apprentice.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.880
He would later go on to squander the fortune
he made writing by trying to reinvent printing.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.260
But by the age of 15, Clemens was writing funny articles and essays for the paper his brother owned,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.380
and he was hanging out in public libraries, reading whatever he could, still trying to give himself an education.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.680
And then, in 1859 he got a license to pilot steamboats, which is basically his boyhood dream,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.980
and that’s how he came to know the Mississippi River, which he wrote about in “Life on the Mississippi”,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.900
and again with passion and precision in “The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.”

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.060
Apparently, a steamboat needs a certain depth
of water to run safely

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.760
and so a sailor called a leadsman would throw a weighted rope over the side to measure the depth.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.600
That’s how he got his pen name. So right, Clemens got his license to pilot steam boats in 1859.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.680
Careful students of American history will know that, you know, something big was about to happen.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.859
In 1861 the American Civil War broke out, and Clemens volunteered for the Confederate side.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.840
That’s right, the man who wrote one of the great anti-slavery, anti-racist novels in American history was a Confederate soldier.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.960
For two weeks.

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.109
He then decided war wasn’t for him, and
followed his brother West to the Nevada territory.

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.940
You can read about all of this — the boats, the weird ragtag confederate militia he was in, Nevada.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.320
Twain never had an experience as a boy or
a young man that he didn’t mine for literature.

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.799
Twain had his first great success in 1865
when he was 30 years old,

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.790
with "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras
County"

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.800
and his writing career just hopped on steadily
after that I’m sorry.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.380
“Huckleberry Finn” though, was published
in 1884.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.300
It was a sequel to the “Adventures of Tom
Sawyer.”

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.780
I have to say that although I am a huge fan of Mark Twain, “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” is not a great novel.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.280
In fact, I think it’s read today, mostly only for two reasons: One. Because it’s the prequel to Huck Finn,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.920
and two, because it’s considered somehow
less controversial than Huck Finn.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.230
Which it is, but it is also much less interesting.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.590
Right, so Huck Finn is one of those rare examples
— like Aliens or The Empire Strikes Back —

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.730
where the sequel outclasses the original.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.139
At first, Twain had a hard time writing the
book.

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.180
He began work in 1876 and wrote to a friend,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.660
“I like it only tolerably well…and may possibly pigeonhole or burn the manuscript when it is done.”

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.860
And he did pigeonhole it for about six years, but then he returned to it in a frenzy of all-day, every day writing.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.300
Huckleberry Finn, the son of the town drunk, is the sidekick character in “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.”

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.660
He lives rough and never has to go to school and is pretty much the envy of all the other boys.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.720
But at the end of that first book he agrees to go and live with the Widow Douglas and become “sivilized” so that he can join Tom Sawyer’s gang.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.760
The question of what constitutes “getting sivilized” is at the very center of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.”

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.809
And so it begins right there, some time in the 1830s, a few decades before the Civil War.

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:56.620
With Huck going to live with the widow.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.040
Huck, who narrates the book himself and is maybe 14 years old, doesn’t take well to what he’s told constitutes civilization.

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.500
Nice clothes are itchy, table manners are
confusing,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.060
he doesn’t understand why the Widow is always trying to tell him Bible stories about dead people.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.620
He’s lonely in the house and his only fun
is sneaking off with Tom Sawyer.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.109
But all of that changes when his father, Pap,
kidnaps him and locks him in a shack.

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.489
After an evening in which his drunken father
nearly kills him,

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.749
Huck fakes his own death, escapes in a found
canoe, and paddles to a nearby island.

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:27.889
Quick pause here to note that in the beginning of the novel, there are just these two ways of being and adult.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.229
The civilized way embodied by the widow.

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.039
Which involves, like, clean clothes, and religion,
and institutional racism.

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.449
And then the uncivilized way of being, embodied
by Huck’s father --

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.120
which involves, like, terrible alcoholism, trying to kill your children, and institutional racism.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.440
But on the river island, away from both of
these models of adulthood,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.740
Huck encounters Jim, a slave who ran away when he learned that his mistress, the Widow’s sister,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.620
planned to sell him down the river, away from
his family.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.640
Now it’s critical to the novel to understand
that Huck believes that the right thing to

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.440
do in this situation is not to assist an escaped
slave.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.930
He believes that the ethically correct thing
to do, the civilized thing to do,

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.379
and also, by the way, the legal thing to do,
is to turn that escaped slave in.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.569
But in Jim, Huck finds a companion and, in
a lot of ways, a surrogate father.

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.460
And so there’s an immediate tension between
what Huck calls his conscience,

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.229
which is the social order, telling him that
he ought to turn this escaped slave in,

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.620
and his actual conscience, which is saying,
“hmmm maybe not.”

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.460
But when Huck learns that Jim is suspected of Huck’s murder and that men are hunting him for a reward,

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.610
he says to Jim: “Git up and hump yourself,
Jim! There ain’t a minute to lose.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.400
They’re after us!”
And that "us" is really important.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.780
It’s only Jim they are after, but this makes
it clear Huck has decided to team up with Jim.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.460
From that moment they set out on the raft,
and their adventures really begin.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.060
They face all kinds of dangers and meet all
kinds of people — some nice, some sinister —

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.800
and get into all sorts of trouble before they
team up with Tom Sawyer again

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.880
and Tom devises an elaborate and cruel plan
to win Jim his freedom.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.300
What Tom knows, but Huck don't, is that Jim is already free, his mistress freed him on her deathbed.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.340
So, in the end, Tom forces Jim to undergo an ordeal that’s just Tom’s nasty idea of a good time.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.460
The adventures of Huckleberry Finn was not
immediately recognized as a great novel.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.340
A lot of the early reviews weren’t terrific

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.560
and there were several attempts to ban it on the grounds that it would corrupt any young person who read it.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.160
The Concord Public Library called it “trashy
and vicious.”

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.860
But pretty soon there was widespread recognition
of the novel's importance.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.710
Some of this has to do with plotting, and
some of it has to do with style and language.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.030
Like, Lionel Trilling, in one of the most
famous essays on Huckleberry Finn,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.310
argued that it was the language that really
sets the book apart.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.259
Before Huckleberry Finn pretty much all the
American writers thought that

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.660
if you were writing an important book it had to be formal and high-flown, like James Fennimore Cooper.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.240
Twain, by the way, hated James Fenimore Cooper’s
books.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.469
If you ever want a good read, you should look
up “Fenimore Cooper’s Literary Offenses.”

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:53.849
It’s a Twain essay that includes lines like:
“Cooper’s art has some defects.

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:57.740
In one place in ‘Deerslayer,’ in the restricted
space of two thirds of a page,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.750
Cooper has scored 114 offenses against literary
art out of a possible 115. It breaks the record.”

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.889
But, unlike ‘The Deerslayer,’ the language of Huckleberry Finn is deliberately down to earth.

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:12.219
It's casual, it's ungrammatical, it's frequently
and deliberately misspelled.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.260
The genius of the book, Trilling wrote, “has something to do with the ease and freedom of the language.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Most of all it has to do with the structure of the sentence, which is simple, direct and fluent,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.000
maintaining the rhythm of the word groups of speech, and the intonations of the speaking voice.”

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.740
Right. At its best, Mark Twain’s writing
sounds like talking.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.740
Which is, of course, much harder than it seems, and it signaled a real watershed moment in American literature.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.340
Let’s Go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.300
What makes the book truly significant is its treatment of the relationship between Huck, a poor white boy,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.100
and Jim, an enslaved African-American man.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.819
Twain may have written this book after the
Civil War and the abolition of slavery,

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:53.499
but America was and of course, is a nation
deeply shaped by racism,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.680
so the friendship between the two characters and the emergent moral intelligence that it foists upon Huck

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:00.840
are what really makes the book unusual.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.360
As we saw, Huck first throws in his lot with
Jim when they’re still on the island,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.340
but throughout their journey Huck struggles with the idea of what it means to help a runaway slave,

00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:12.449
and what it means to treat Jim as a comrade
and a friend.

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:16.189
This is partly due to Huck’s conscience,
which is telling him over and over that he’s

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:18.919
going to go to actual Hell for helping Jim.

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:21.659
But in the beginning of the book, Huck can
be quite cruel to Jim.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.960
Early in the book, he and Tom Sawyer play a trick on Jim, hanging his hat in a tree so that Jim,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.000
who is very superstitious, thinks that witches
have taken it, which Jim is very proud of.

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:32.099
But later in the book, Huck tries to pull
another prank,

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:35.690
making Jim think that his fear that Huck was
lost in the fog was only a dream.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:41.019
But Jim knows it's a trick he tells Huck that people who try to make others feel ashamed are trash.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:44.320
Now, of course, Huck is an expert at tricks
and telling lies.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.780
Through the book he never uses the same name or the same origin story with any two people he meets

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.519
and the people almost always believe him.

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:53.279
Well, except for when he dresses up as a girl.
He’s really bad at being a girl.

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:57.230
But on the raft Huck learns that you can’t
trick the people you care about.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:02.480
So Huck feels ashamed for trying to trick
Jim, and eventually works himself up to apologize.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.720
He says, and I’m quoting selectively here, "I done it, and I weren’t ever sorry for it afterwards neither."

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.800
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
And on the topic of me selectively quoting,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.340
we now need to take a short break to talk about the language that Twain uses to describe Jim.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.480
You know what?
Let’s just do this as an open letter.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.510
Let’s see what’s in the secret compartment
today.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.440
Oh! It’s Mark Twain.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.080
I like your suit, buddy. Hi Mark Twain, it’s
me, John Green. First off, big fan.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.339
Secondly, in your novel, ‘The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn,’

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:33.500
Huck and other characters use the n-word,
to describe Jim many, many times.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.750
This is the reason most often cited for the
banning of your book here in the 21st century,

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.209
so it’s important to talk about.

00:09:39.209 --> 00:09:44.160
And it’s important to understand that when you were writing the book, it was already an offensive term.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160
Like, abolitionists had been arguing that we should use the term person of color as early as 1825.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.740
And since your work is no longer protected
by copyright,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.300
editions have been published of Huckleberry
Finn in which that word is changed.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.360
But whether or not you, personally were racist,
Mark Twain, your book, I would argue, isn’t.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.660
According to the scholar David L. Smith, the
word, quote,

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:09.620
“establishes a context against which Jim’s specific virtues may emerge as explicit refutations of racist presuppositions.”

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.600
It’s really important to understand that
although Huck seems like a pretty good kid,

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.590
the social order has taught him to dehumanize
Jim.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:24.040
To treat him as property, rather than as a person, but Jim’s humanity forces Huck to contend with him as a person.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.340
And that’s what makes your book so, so good.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.980
Best Wishes.
John Green.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:34.620
It’s this recognition of Jim’s humanity that leads Huck, in the climactic scene in Chapter 16,

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.060
to break with all the morality and religion
he knows.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.160
When he learns that Jim’s plan is to gain his freedom and gain the freedom of his wife and children,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.140
Huck writes a letter informing his mistress,
but then he tears it up.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.380
Huck has been taught to confuse social law
with divine law.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:56.060
And he sincerely believes that helping a slave
is a terrible sin that will lead to damnation.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.519
And he has been with the Widow long enough
that Hell is a real place for him,

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:02.589
but he ultimately decides that it doesn’t
matter.

00:11:02.589 --> 00:11:05.250
He will risk damnation if it means he can
help Jim.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.860
He tears up the letter, saying,
“All right, then, I’ll GO to hell…

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.389
It was awful thoughts and awful words, but
they was said.

00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:15.639
And I let them stay said; and never thought
no more about reforming.”

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:21.880
Huck rejects what he has been told is civilization, while also rejecting his father’s version of uncivilization,

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.480
and for me at least, that’s why he’s a
hero.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.430
As Twain said in his lectures, Huckleberry
Finn is a book

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:33.139
“where a sound heart and a deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat.”

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:36.139
And that’s where we’ll leave Huck and
his sound heart for today —

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:42.060
unreformed, unrepentant, realizing that he has to follow his own moral path, whatever the risks.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.520
And maybe that’s where Twain should have
left it, too.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.860
But instead, we get a jumbled mess of an ending
that is often criticized,

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.660
but which I will do my best to defend next
week.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.949
