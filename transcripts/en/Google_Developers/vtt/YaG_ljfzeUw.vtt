00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.430
Hi, I'm Rich Fulcher,
a designer and manager

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.920
on the Android design
team here at Google.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.880
At this year's
Google I/O conference

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.610
we introduced material design.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.550
A new visual
language for creating

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.870
bold graphic interfaces driven
by typography, scale, color,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.500
and position.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.310
For me, one of the most exciting
things about material design

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.950
is how it takes these classic
principles of print design

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.580
and brings them to life.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.030
The materials take energy from
the user, from their finger,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.810
from their mouse click, their
touch and they take that energy

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.730
and use it to transform
and to animate.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.440
Today, I'm going
to talk about how

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.610
these virtual materials
of paper and ink

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.850
pack much more power
than their real world

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.570
meatspace counterparts.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.190
Now every pixel
drawn by an app is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.080
a dot of ink on
a piece of paper.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.600
Paper has no color, but
ink can be any color,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.770
and ink coloring is how
all content is displayed,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.190
whether that's the
controls of your app,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.740
an image, or even a
video that's playing.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.370
Paper can be a variety
of widths, the x-axis,

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.460
and heights, the y-axis.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.660
It can even fill the
entire display, such

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.900
that you can't see the
edges of that paper,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.230
or it could shrink down to just
be the size of a single button,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.300
you know, no larger than a 48
by 48 dpi square touch target

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.770
or standard target sizes.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.870
Ink doesn't have any
of those restrictions.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.660
It can be any size, so long
as it fits within that paper.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.470
You've got to have something
to actually apply that ink to

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.780
so that it can be seen.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.700
Paper has an absolute
fixed thickness of 1 dpi.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.260
That's equivalent to a 35
pound weight piece of paper,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.450
so kind of a light card stock.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.955
Now when you add ink, you're
not changing that thickness.

00:01:57.955 --> 00:01:59.330
This isn't a kind
of paint that's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.455
building up layer and layer
and layer and making it

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:02.850
thicker and thicker.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.610
The paper itself is always that
1 dpi thick, it's never zero.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.169
That would be a hologram.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.669
And this isn't hollow,
this is material.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.380
That sense of
tactility is vitally

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.600
important to the system.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.910
In terms of shapes, paper wants
to be a rounded rectangle,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.020
whether that's a
rectangle, or a square,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.210
or even a circle, which
is just a really, really,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.080
really rounded rectangle.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.020
It doesn't want
to be a triangle.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.050
It doesn't want to be a
concave shape, like a star,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.370
or the shape of your app icon.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.440
Now ink doesn't have
these restrictions.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.150
It can be any shape
and it can cover

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.290
all those things
you want it to be.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.330
Those are the basic
principles, but how

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.310
do all these materials
live and move

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.940
within a more complex structure.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.740
Well, we need to start
by talking about depth,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.180
and that means
embracing the z-axis.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.730
Now every device has
a physical z-depth.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.790
For a handheld device,
it's that distance

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.770
between the glass on the front
and the back of the device

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.950
that rests on the
palm of your hand.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.960
Now that depth controls
how paper can behave,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.700
so paper wants to respect
that devices depth.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.230
It doesn't want to
be able to flip over

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.189
because if it were to do
a move like that well,

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.688
that paper is going
to start to move

00:03:17.688 --> 00:03:19.910
it's going to bonk against
that glass on the front

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.080
of the device or against
the metal on the back.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.020
You can't execute that move
and maintain that sense

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.710
for the user that it's
inside that device.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.190
Just between those
front back slots.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.250
That's why we don't
do paper flips.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.970
When we have paper
it casts a shadow

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.420
and that shadow is based
on its position within z.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.840
Now paper is generally
presented as square to the user.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.300
Just like I'm moving my
hand back and forth in front

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.290
the camera here.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.560
Paper moves to the users
eye in the same fashion.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.660
Now paper will cast a shadow
when two pieces of paper

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.490
slightly overlap, like that.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.130
One in front has a light
source in front of it,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.300
the paper behind it isn't
getting all of that,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.600
so it's getting a
shadow on the back.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.480
We like to keep
the paper square.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.840
We like to make sure that the
shadow isn't something that's

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.030
being drawn as ink, that's
being printed on the paper.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.690
It comes about because of
the physical relationship,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.810
because of the lighting model
that the system gives you.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.020
When we have paper, it's solid.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.180
When the user reaches
out and touches it,

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.100
the user can never
press through the paper.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.990
It just kind of makes
contact and it's there.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.740
Now we do respond to the user
in a couple of ways though.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.042
One is that as the user
approaches the paper

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:39.500
and they make that
touch, the paper

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.320
will rise to kind of meet them.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.940
So there's this illusion of the
glass here, your finger comes

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.640
down on the glass and the paper
completes that motion by coming

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.680
forward to meet
the user's finger.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.870
You might think about it
as imagine your finger

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.100
kind of pointing down on a
reflecting surface of water

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.950
and as you get closer and
closer it sees it's reflection,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.100
and those two touch together.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.310
The way that ink responds
is like the ripples that

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.040
would happen on
the water, as I hit

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.480
that surface I break the
surface tension of the water,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.610
I get this pleasant circular
rippling that occurs out of it.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.119
That's what we do in the ink
to kind of communicate that

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:14.160
not just that you've made
contact with the paper,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.740
but which of the particular
elements, ink elements

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.010
on the paper you've touched.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.120
Now motion is all about
establishing and emphasizing

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.800
the continuity of
important elements,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.350
and the paper to move across
any of those three axes.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.690
We can move along x, it can
move along y, even along the z.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.720
Now material can
do more than move.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.040
Part of the magic of the
experience comes from a way

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.950
that materials can change.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.810
The ways that they're not bound
by these boring physical laws

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.070
of the known universe.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.470
So paper can change its size
in both the x and y position.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.930
And ink can do its
own thing, it doesn't

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.250
have to do exactly
what the papers doing.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.580
So you can do things like to
have a piece of paper resize,

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.990
and have the ink remain the same
size but just re-flow to take

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.490
advantage of that new
spacious real estate.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.740
Or you could expand and have
the ink expand at the same rate.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.680
Or you could leave the
paper at a fixed size

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.439
and have the ink just grow
or shrink within that.

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:15.730
They're completely independent.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.490
Now you can change the width
and height of paper differently.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.890
They don't have to be symmetric,
they can be asymmetric.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.610
And that's really important
for when we do transformations.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.050
We strongly encourage this.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.880
So in the example over
here that you're seeing,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.970
you are seeing tall objects
be made to feel taller.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.120
Your seeing wide
objects made more broad.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.740
Now why is this
asymmetry important?

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.170
Well it helps the
user understand

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.090
the difference between something
that's resizing and staying

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.550
in that place, and something
that's moving within z.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.610
If I move within z, that's kind
of the same as symmetric scale,

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.760
as you get closer is growing in
both aspects at the same rate.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.307
By doing re-sizes
asymmetrically,

00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:03.640
we're letting the user know
OK, that content is actually

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.560
staying up at that same z level.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.820
The movement is a
different signal to them.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.560
Now paper can change
between its shapes,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.920
but it does like to kind
of start at and return

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.130
to those core shapes
we talked about

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.330
before, those
rounded rectangles.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.550
And like some kind
of x mutant paper,

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.810
paper can split or can
join, those materials can

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.790
heal together, they
can regenerate,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.830
they can kind of
connect back up.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:37.410
Creating or destroying paper is
always associated with motion.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.810
Now paper can enter and
exit in different ways.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.290
Those can be independent.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.830
There's three main styles.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.280
You could just kind of
create paper in place

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.060
and destroy it in place, you
can have it enter one way

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.140
and exit a different
way, or you can actually

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.520
have paper kind of
clone, so there's

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.880
one piece of paper clones and
creates a second one which

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.140
can then move, and then
it can rest back down

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.810
and heal and just become
one piece of paper again.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.490
So how do multiple pieces of
paper interact with each other?

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.420
There's two key types
of arrangements.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.360
The first are seams,
which are created

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.520
when two pieces of paper share
the full width of an edge.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.730
It's like they're stitched
together at a common side.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.100
Now when papers meet at a
seam and joins in that way,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.410
it moves together.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.360
They're actually connected
so they'll move as one.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.780
The other is a step.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.549
When we have two pieces of paper
with different z positions that

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.230
overlap and you get that
shadow we talked about, then

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.659
you've created a step.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.169
These two papers don't have
a relationship to each other.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.659
So they can move independently
one of the other.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.320
A very common way
that we'll see a step

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.790
is for a toolbar, where you have
a step above a larger, usually

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.280
a larger, sheet of paper
the can slide under it.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.990
Now there are variants to this.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.750
You might start with the toolbar
and the other piece of paper

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.870
seamed together and have the
toolbar just rise within z,

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.540
just as it needs to accommodate
the motion underneath,

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.770
so it could lift to make room.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.540
Or you can reverse that, it
could move backwards in z

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.600
and the other piece of paper
could come up and cover it.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.540
Or finally, you could just kind
of leave them seamed together.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.970
The other piece of paper
pushes a toolbar up

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.860
and it just pops off
and then you only

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.290
see the other piece
of paper present.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.680
When paper passes
over a toolbar,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.770
it's important
that you not split

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.370
any of the actions
the toolbar might

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.921
contain with a piece of paper.

00:09:30.921 --> 00:09:32.670
You want to make sure
that the actions are

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.640
on one side or the other.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.280
And one last note
about toolbars,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.010
just like any piece of
paper, they can resize.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.210
So they can start
tall and as the user

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.530
scrolls they can shrink up,
or you can reverse that motion

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.980
as they move the other way.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.688
The one thing you'll
want to keep in mind

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:50.310
is that it's best have the
toolbar snap between those two

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.330
positions.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.530
Instead of just getting
stuck in that middle ground

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.720
between them, you want
to kind of crisply move

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.790
to the smaller or larger sizes.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.380
Another signature
element in paper

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.350
is the floating action button.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.700
We nickname it the FAB.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.340
A FAB can straddle a seam if it
relates to the content of both

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.330
of the pieces of paper that
are meeting at that seam,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.860
or it can straddle a step if it
relates to the piece of paper

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.540
that's creating the step, the
one that's more forward in z.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.940
Now, you don't have
to put in a FAB,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.250
a straddle point
like that, it doesn't

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.670
have to be on a seam or step.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.370
It could just be on
a piece of paper,

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.320
conveniently tucked away in
a corner, or really anywhere

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.040
within that paper surface.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.000
And you want to avoid
doing things like,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.240
artificially creating
a seam or step,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.460
just to give your
FAB a place to live.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.030
Those seam and
step relationships

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.810
should be about the structure
in the inner-relationship

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.960
of those pieces of material.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.710
Not about just having
a decorative point.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.690
If you want to learn
more, our guidelines

00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.930
are a great place to start.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.840
If you go to
www.google.com/design

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.694
or specifically /spec, you can
read about all of our material

00:11:07.694 --> 00:11:10.110
design guidelines, and you'll
see a bunch of examples that

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.140
can help you get
started with this.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.680
There are also a ton of
resources there waiting

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.160
for you to download them,
sticker sheets, templates,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.410
icons, even fonts are available
for you from that side.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.840
Thanks for watching
and I hope you

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.599
have a lot of fun
designing with material.
