00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.532
- [Instructor] About some
strategies subtracting decimals

00:00:02.532 --> 00:00:04.287
that involve hundredths.

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:08.454
For example, if I have 0.69, or 69/100,

00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:14.782
and from that I want to
subtract 0.34, or 34/100,

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:18.176
what is that going to be?

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:21.742
Pause this video and see
if you can compute this.

00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:24.697
There's a bunch of ways to think about it.

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:28.819
One way to think about
it is this is 69/100.

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.555
Hundredths.

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:35.390
And from that we are subtracting 34/100.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.307
Hundredths.

00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:40.743
And so this boils down to,
I have 69 of something,

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:43.469
in this case hundredths,
in this case hundredths,

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.514
and I'm gonna take away 34 of them.

00:00:45.514 --> 00:00:47.207
So what am I left with?

00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:49.207
Well what's 69 minus 34?

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:54.309
Well nine ones minus, or I
should say nine minus four

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.119
is gonna be five.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.952
And 60 minus 30 is going to be 30.

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:04.555
So I'm left with 35/100.

00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:05.472
Hundredths.

00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:09.119
Which I can write as 0.35.

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:12.716
Now another way I could think about it

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:14.988
is I could break up the tenths,

00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:17.542
and then the leftover hundredths.

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:21.082
So I could view this as 6/10,

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:22.767
let me circle that a little bit better,

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:25.669
6/10 minus 3/10.

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:29.002
So 6/10 minus 3/10

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.382
plus...

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.850
Plus 9/100 minus 4/100.

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:43.116
So plus 9/100

00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:47.113
minus 4/100.

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:50.885
And we're gonna get the same answer,

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:53.551
so that is 6/10 and I
take away three of them.

00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:56.041
That's gonna give me 3/10,

00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:59.011
or I could just write that as 0.3.

00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:03.178
And then two that I
would have to add 9/100

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.390
minus 4/100 is 5/100.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.223
So 0.05.

00:02:11.468 --> 00:02:15.635
So 3/10 and 5/100 is going to be 35/100,

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:18.204
or we could just write it this way.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.677
We could write it as 3/10.

00:02:20.677 --> 00:02:22.361
We have a three in the tenth's place.

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:24.445
And 5/100.

00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:26.436
Let me do that blue color.

00:02:26.436 --> 00:02:28.677
And 5/100.

00:02:28.677 --> 00:02:31.561
Or we could view that as 35/100.

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:33.213
However way, these are different ways

00:02:33.213 --> 00:02:37.130
of thinking about
subtracting these hundredths.

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.122
Let's do another example.

00:02:42.156 --> 00:02:44.573
Let's say we want to compute.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.714
We would like to compute,
and this actually

00:02:49.714 --> 00:02:51.971
will probably be a little
bit more straightforward,

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:55.221
three and 43/100, minus two.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:58.751
What is this going to be equal to?

00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:01.554
Pause the video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:03:01.554 --> 00:03:04.758
Well it might jump out at you
that this is the same thing

00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:08.341
as three plus 43/100, minus two.

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:12.504
And so you can just look at the ones.

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:13.337
You could look at the wholes.

00:03:13.337 --> 00:03:16.446
We have three wholes, and we're
gonna take away two of them.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.019
So we're gonna be left with one whole,

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.404
and we still have this 43/100.

00:03:20.404 --> 00:03:22.988
So we still have this 43/100,

00:03:22.988 --> 00:03:25.175
so it's gonna be one and 43/100,

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:27.758
or we could write that as 1.43.

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.580
That one maybe was a little
bit more straightforward.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.647
Now let's kind of combine the ideas

00:03:36.647 --> 00:03:37.760
of these last two examples,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.809
and do one that might seem
a little bit more daunting.

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.611
Let's say that we want to subtract,

00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:46.278
we want to figure out what 65.79

00:03:47.781 --> 00:03:49.031
minus 42.58 is.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.673
Pause the video and see if
you can figure this out.

00:03:57.673 --> 00:03:59.652
Multiple ways to do this.

00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:02.590
You could separate the whole numbers,

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.135
so you could say this is 65 minus 42.

00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:07.635
65 minus 42, plus,

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:12.998
and then think about the,

00:04:12.998 --> 00:04:14.827
and then think about the hundredths.

00:04:14.827 --> 00:04:18.577
Plus 79/100, so 79/100,

00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:22.545
minus 58/100.

00:04:23.494 --> 00:04:25.807
Minus 58/100.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.833
And I just, I'll rewrite this
in words just to reinforce.

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:31.583
This is 79 of something, 79/100.

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:34.006
You could say it's 7/10 and 9/100,

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:37.756
but it's the same thing as 79/100.

00:04:39.293 --> 00:04:40.126
Hundredths.

00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:43.126
This is 58/100.

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:44.752
Hundredths.

00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:46.335
And so 65 minus 42.

00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:50.794
Five minus two go in the ones.

00:04:50.794 --> 00:04:52.135
We're gonna get three.

00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:55.634
And then 60 minus 40 is equal to 20.

00:04:55.634 --> 00:04:57.384
So we have 23 plus...

00:05:00.338 --> 00:05:04.349
Now 79/100 minus 58/100,

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.849
70 minus 50 is 20.

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.362
And nine minus eight is one.

00:05:11.362 --> 00:05:15.291
So this is gonna be 21/100,

00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:19.124
which we can write as 0.21, 21/100.

00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:23.860
And so when we compute this it'll be 23

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.693
and 21/100.

00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:30.669
This is just one way to tackle it.

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.611
There are multiple ways
that you could try to tackle

00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:37.278
a subtraction problem like this.
