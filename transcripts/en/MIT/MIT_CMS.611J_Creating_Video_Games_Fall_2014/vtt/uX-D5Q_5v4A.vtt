00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.860
STUDENT: I'm Matt Susskind.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.660
And for this game, we are a
team of eight people working

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.150
on forecast-based financing,
which is a technique using

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.830
forecasts in order
to make decisions

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.020
about what to do in response
to incoming disasters.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.180
Currently, a lot
of techniques are

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.920
we're going to build long-term
protection for cities

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.800
in terms of dams or
disaster preparedness.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.460
Or, after disaster happens,
we will react to the disaster.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.270
But there's not a lot of
work done in terms of we

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.450
see that there is a
50% chance of disaster

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.340
within the next week.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.944
Let's start mobilizing
to prepare for that.

00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:47.360
And part of the
reason for that is

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.470
because if the
disaster doesn't happen

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.370
you end up wasting money.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.040
But if you actually
do an analysis,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.590
you'll realize that the
money that you waste

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.360
is actually way less
expensive than trying

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.745
to make up for your lack of
preparedness after the fact.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.090
So Paolo had come in from the
Red Cross Red Crescent Climate

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.100
Center.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.440
And he pitched a couple
of different concepts

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.310
that they wanted
games around in order

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.714
to educate either members
of the Red Cross or people

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:21.380
out in the world who
they wanted to show

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.000
these different ideas to.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.430
And so what he showed us was
actually just a PowerPoint

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.680
with a couple of different
slides, where on each slide

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.190
was a different concept.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.810
Ours was forecast-based
financing.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.260
But then, there were also
ones like cholera, or Ebola,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.610
or preparing for heat
waves, things like that.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.370
And so he gave us a
quick pitch of this

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.910
is what the concept is, this
is who we want to educate

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.270
with this, and these are
some of the characteristics

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.490
that we think are
really important.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.862
And we actually weren't
assigned to any topics.

00:01:53.862 --> 00:01:55.320
He put those topics
up on the board

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.440
and let teams form
around them, depending

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.110
on what you're interested in.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.560
And so beyond just
the idea of this

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.480
is forecast-based financing,
and this is how it works

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.160
and who we want to teach it to,
we got no further instructions.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.789
Paolo did come in
throughout the class

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.820
to teach us a little
bit more about who

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.110
we would be talking to,
or to work over the ideas

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.720
that we had been exploring.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.390
But on the whole, we just
got the general topic,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.970
and came up with the
game ideas on our own.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.920
One of our biggest
challenges was

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.910
with forecast-based financing,
it's an understandable topic,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.940
but it's sort of abstract.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.950
And it doesn't quite
lend itself to a game.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.660
It's very easy to
come up with we're

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.570
going to take
forecast-based financing

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.240
and hide it as a game.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.980
But that's not a
fun game to play.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.970
So a lot of our
challenge is figuring out

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.460
how are we going to work?

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.050
How are we going
to create a game

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.080
around forecast-based financing
that explains the ideas that we

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.190
want, that teaches
people something new,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.040
and is a game that
we're actually proud of?

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.710
Another compounding factor
was that originally our target

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.341
audience was policymakers, which
was a very difficult audience,

00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:14.840
because they don't generally
play games, which meant that we

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.581
were starting with
trying to teach them

00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:17.580
everything from scratch.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.010
Whereas when you're
creating for somebody

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.700
who has experience
with video games,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.449
you can take a lot of
things for granted--

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.776
that they're going to
know how to drag and drop

00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:28.150
things in order
to change things,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.000
or what the various design
ideas you're using actually

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.410
mean to them.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.360
So that was a big
challenge for us,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.420
was designing for
this new consumer.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.220
And we also had a lot
of design challenges

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.420
with getting the forecast-based
financing game to work.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.460
And the way that we
approached it at first

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.140
was by creating a whole bunch
of different prototypes of lot

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.260
of different types of games,
and trying them out with people,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.593
seeing what they understood,
what they liked about them,

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:02.320
what didn't work, what they
learned from them, which

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.770
was really good in terms of
exploring different ideas

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.060
and learning more
about the subject area.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.312
But it created a new
difficulty in that

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:12.270
we were all over the
place for the first couple

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.900
weeks of the project.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.940
We got to the
point about halfway

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.810
through-- we had about eight
weeks to do this project,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.380
I think, and halfway
through, we still

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.752
didn't end up with
our final idea yet.

00:04:24.752 --> 00:04:26.960
Instead, we were exploring
all these different ideas,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.750
and pulling in various parts of
them in order to make our game.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.789
And then, we realized that our
game lacked a coherent vision.

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.580
We had been working on
a couple prototypes.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.480
We didn't like any of them.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.990
It didn't feel like players
had a connection to them,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.790
both in terms of what was
happening in the game,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.270
but also a mental
connection of I

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.120
understand exactly
what's happening here.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.639
So we decided to take
everything we had learned

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.180
and some of the
systems we had built,

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.230
and package them
into a new UI, which

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.810
was this side view of the rising
water, which everybody just

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.020
understood intuitively.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.199
You see a village.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.490
You see someone standing there.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.190
You see the water
rising toward it.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.650
And it doesn't
matter who you are.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.914
You understand that this is
something that's in danger.

00:05:08.914 --> 00:05:10.580
And you're going to
need to do something

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.620
about the rising waters.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.870
And once we hit on that idea,
everything became much easier.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.010
Of course, there were still
ideas we had to explain,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.600
concepts we had to
design into the game

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.390
in an understandable way.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.110
But for the most part, the
game was actually there.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.590
The mechanics themselves
didn't change very much

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.365
between the prototype we
had before and this idea

00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:35.240
of the rising waters.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.020
But just packaging
it in a new design

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.240
changed the game, the
feel of it, completely.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.730
So I had game design
experience beforehand.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.354
So I like game design a lot.

00:05:50.354 --> 00:05:51.770
I was hoping to
work more on that.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.320
But also to get some
interesting games made.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.860
I think I did get some of that.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.230
But probably the thing
I learned the most

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.230
that I didn't expect
coming in was just how

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.580
to work with a team.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.980
We're all busy MIT students.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.570
And so we would have weeks
where all of a sudden, everybody

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.320
would have a test.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.650
And we had no time
to do anything else.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.170
And so it was a
lot of learning how

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.270
to work with people
who are extremely busy

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.769
and who have a lot
on their plate.

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:21.560
And so it's really easy
for things to slip,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.710
for things to get forgotten,
fall through the cracks.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.080
So it taught me a lot about
project management, basically,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.190
and solving problems
as a team, and learning

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.462
how to get everybody-- I don't
want to say herding cats,

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:37.170
because it's not like
people didn't care.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.628
But it's just that
we were so busy.

00:06:38.628 --> 00:06:42.220
It taught me how to work
with these busy people

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.870
to get to where we need to be.
