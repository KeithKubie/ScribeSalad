00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.495
- [Voiceover] Is the function given

00:00:01.495 --> 00:00:04.695
below continuous slash
differentiable at x equals three?

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.269
They've defined it piece-wise,

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:07.923
and we have some choices.

00:00:07.923 --> 00:00:09.453
Continuous, not differentiable.

00:00:09.453 --> 00:00:11.002
Differentiable, not continuous.

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.476
Both continuous and differentiable.

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:14.310
Neither continuous not differentiable.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.617
Now one of these we can knock
out right from the get go.

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:19.973
In order to be differentiable
you need to be continuous.

00:00:19.973 --> 00:00:23.623
You cannot have differentiable
but not continuous.

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.571
So let's just rule that one out.

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:28.070
And now let's think about continuity.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.040
So let's first think about continuity.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.612
And frankly, if it isn't continuous,

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:36.105
then it's not going to be differentiable.

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:39.108
So let's think about it a little bit.

00:00:39.108 --> 00:00:42.674
So in order to be continuous, f of ...

00:00:42.674 --> 00:00:44.133
Using a darker color.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.716
F of three needs to be equal to

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:51.935
the limit of f of x as x approaches three.

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:55.815
Now what is f of three?

00:00:55.815 --> 00:01:00.038
Well let's see, we've fallen
to this case right over here,

00:01:00.038 --> 00:01:03.704
because x is equal to
three, so six times three

00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:07.287
is 18, minus nine is
nine, so this is nine.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.460
So the limit of f of x
as x approaches three

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.379
needs to be equal to nine.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.161
So let's first think about the limit

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:18.827
as we approach from the left hand side.

00:01:18.827 --> 00:01:21.822
The limit as x approaches three.

00:01:21.822 --> 00:01:25.950
X approaches three from the
left hand side of f of x.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.377
Well when x is less than three

00:01:27.377 --> 00:01:30.044
we fall into this case, so f of x

00:01:30.044 --> 00:01:33.544
is just going to be equal to x squared.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.124
And so this is defined and continuous

00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:40.780
for all real numbers, so we can just

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.280
substitute the three in there.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.323
So this is going to be equal to nine.

00:01:44.323 --> 00:01:48.190
Now what's the limit of as we approach

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.607
three from the right hand side of f of x?

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.183
Well as we approach from the right,

00:01:54.183 --> 00:01:57.457
this one right over here is f of x

00:01:57.457 --> 00:01:59.799
is equal to six x minus nine.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.392
So we just write six x minus nine.

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:04.092
And once again six x minus nine is defined

00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:06.262
and continuous for all real numbers,

00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:07.872
so we could just pop a three in

00:02:07.872 --> 00:02:10.086
there and you get 18 minus nine.

00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:11.863
Well this is also equal to nine,

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:14.658
so the right and left hand, the left

00:02:14.658 --> 00:02:17.356
and right hand limits both equal nine,

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:19.218
which is equal to the value
of the function there,

00:02:19.218 --> 00:02:21.821
so it is definitely continuous.

00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:25.821
So we can rule out this
choice right over there.

00:02:26.953 --> 00:02:29.619
And now let's think
about differentiablity.

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.618
So in order to be differentiable ...

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:36.535
So differentiable, I'll
just diff-er-ent-iable.

00:02:39.483 --> 00:02:42.234
In order to be differentiable the limit

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:46.401
as x approaches three of
f of x minus f of three

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:52.772
over x minus three needs to exist.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:55.042
So let's see if we can evaluate this.

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:57.292
So first of all we know
what f of three is.

00:02:57.292 --> 00:02:59.500
F of three, we already evaluated this.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.371
This is going to be nine.

00:03:01.371 --> 00:03:04.071
And let's see if we can
evaluate this limit,

00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:06.147
or let's see what the
limit is as we approach

00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:07.844
from the left hand side
or the right hand side,

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:09.140
and if they are approaching the same thing

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.856
then that same thing that they
are approaching is a limit.

00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:14.706
So let's first think about the limit

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:18.279
as x approaches three
from the left hand side.

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:22.446
So it's over x minus three,
and we have f of x minus nine.

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.761
But as we approach from
the left hand side,

00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:28.195
this is f of x, as x is less than three,

00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:29.830
f of x is equal to x squared.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.030
So this would be instead of f of x minus 9

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.628
I'll write x squared minus
nine, and x squared minus nine.

00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:39.534
This is a difference of squares,

00:03:39.534 --> 00:03:43.063
so this is x plus three
times x minus three,

00:03:43.063 --> 00:03:46.063
x plus three times x minus three.

00:03:47.337 --> 00:03:50.413
And so these would cancel out.

00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:52.824
We can say that is
equivalent to x plus three

00:03:52.824 --> 00:03:54.557
as long as x does not equal three.

00:03:54.557 --> 00:03:56.389
That's okay because we're
approaching from the left,

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.846
and as we approach from the left

00:03:57.846 --> 00:04:01.460
x plus three is defined
for all real numbers,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.943
it's continuous for all real numbers,

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:04.941
so we can just substitute
the three in there.

00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:07.529
So we would get a six.

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:09.015
So now let's try to evaluate the limit

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:12.348
as we approach from the right hand side.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.531
So once again it's f of
x, but as we approach

00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:21.293
from the right hand side,
f of x is six x minus nine.

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:22.495
That's our f of x.

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:25.634
And then we have minus f
of three, which is nine.

00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:28.344
So it's six x minus 18.

00:04:28.344 --> 00:04:29.844
Six x minus 18.

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:35.601
Well that's the same thing
as six times x minus three,

00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:37.965
and as we approach from the right,

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:41.465
well that's just going to be equal to six.

00:04:42.858 --> 00:04:46.912
So it looks like our
derivative exists there,

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.345
and it is equal to limit
as x approaches three

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:51.033
of all of this because
this is equal to six,

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:52.608
because the limit is
approached from the left

00:04:52.608 --> 00:04:54.447
and the right is also equal to six.

00:04:54.447 --> 00:04:55.975
So this looks like we are both

00:04:55.975 --> 00:04:58.475
continuous and differentiable.
