00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.570
NARRATOR: Back in South
Carolina, Eustace and Joseph

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.530
angle to bring down a 200-foot
pine without crushing anything

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.830
or anyone on the ground below.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.230
[chainsaw]

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.100
There she goes!

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.000
At least you had enough
cut there that it isn't swing

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.100
it around into that building.
- Thank goodness.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.370
That was about where
we want it to fall.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.270
This was the easy one.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.970
[laughter]

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.100
NARRATOR: With one down,
it's on the tree number two.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.970
We could use that
leaning one to kind

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.070
of catch this one
as it fell down,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.070
and cradle it off
of the building.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.530
NARRATOR: But this
one is already

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.000
dead and more dangerous.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.670
What controls the falling of a
tree is the center of the tree.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.730
If that part is rotten, you
don't have any influence.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.830
It just could fall anywhere.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.570
And so taking out a dead
tree is pretty risky.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.400
And so we're going to put the
extra precaution of putting

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.730
a rope on it with
a block and tackle,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.430
and that hopefully will
give us the influence

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.330
to put some serious
pull on it to pull

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.700
it away from the building.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.170
Are you going to
have enough to make it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.600
over our anchor
point over there?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.670
Maybe.
I don't know.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.730
Here, you pull on
that and I'll walk it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600
NARRATOR: The block and tackle
is anchored to a more stable

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.830
tree to provide added leverage.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.000
Get slow, but keep going.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.000
- One foot.
- Keep trying.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.230
Yeah, that looks good.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.730
By the time it's the top
of that Magnolia tree,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.400
you can just forget about it.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.100
Turn around.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.670
Abandon ship.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.200
Whatever you need to do.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.600
Just get out of there.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.200
Because it's going to go where
it's going to go by that point,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.400
regardless.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.600
But until then, you'll
have enough power that you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.670
can, like, start running.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.730
Like you can get
pretty far over there.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.300
The further you get away,
the safer you are anyway.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.530
If he doesn't pull it hard
enough and continuously enough,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.730
or if he lets go too soon,
it can just fall right back

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.630
towards the building.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.130
So it's a real dance.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.570
And success is on the line.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.630
If we don't do it right,
we lose the building.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.700
Or get hurt.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.730
Oh my gosh.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.400
let's just do it.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.530
Ready?

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.730
Yeah.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.100
[chainsaw]

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.030
Keep pulling it if you can.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.500
Whoa!
Whoa!

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.470
Hold it steady just a second.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.000
[inaudible] get it rocking.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.330
Rock it back and forth.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.170
Pull and release.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.270
Pull and release.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.070
One, two, three.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.300
NARRATOR: The goal is to
pull it down without taking

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.470
the other tree with it.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.800
There's vines holding it.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.130
There's limbs holding it.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.470
There we go. there we go.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.300
[laughter]

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.830
NARRATOR: Now it's on to
the third and final tree.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.000
A 200-foot pine that's
leaning precariously

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.070
above the farm building
they're trying to protect.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.000
Wow.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.800
Now the worst one.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.030
Yeah, that one's scary.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.230
The stakes are a lot
higher on this one.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.900
It's leaning right
towards the building.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.830
It's going to be
really hard to control.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.000
I mean, it is right over it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.470
This wind seems
like it's picking up.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.970
You never know when you're
going to get an unfortunate

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.900
gust the wind that's going
to catch the top like a sail,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.430
and push it in the wrong way.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.170
So we're going to
use the same block

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.070
and tackle that we used
on that other dead tree.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.900
But this is a really
dangerous tree,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.000
and so I want every bit of
power that we can muster.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.270
So we put two more
pulleys in the system.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.830
The more pulleys you have,
the more exponential power

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.370
you gain.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.730
[chainsaw]

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.630
- Ready?
- Yeah.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.000
We were able to pull
that tree probably

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.530
20 or 30 degrees better than
we thought was even possible.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.100
And I'm so glad this
is on the ground.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.200
I don't have to worry
about this anymore.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.170
Oh my gosh.
