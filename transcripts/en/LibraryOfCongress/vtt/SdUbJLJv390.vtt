00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.110
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So panel
two is called the Rulemaking

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.480
Process-Evidentiary
and Procedural Issues.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.530
So if this is what you're here
for, you're in the right place.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.030
I'd like to start for us
briefly introducing ourselves.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.070
First from the Copyright
Office, I'm Regan Smith,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.120
Associate General Counsel.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.320
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Kevin Amer,
Senior Counsel for Policy

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.620
and International Affairs.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.810
&gt;&gt; Andrew Moore: Andrew
Moore, Ringer Fellow.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.320
&gt;&gt; Jason Sloan: Jason Sloan,
I'm an Attorney Adviser

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.180
in the General Counsel's Office.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.130
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: And of the parties
we'd like to introduce, you know,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.030
your names and organization
you represent.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.150
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: Krista Cox, the
Association of Research Libraries.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: Peter Decherney
from the University of Pennsylvania.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.500
&gt;&gt; Robyn Greene: Robyn Greene,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.840
from New America's Open
Technology Institute.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.700
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Chris Mohr, SIAA.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Matt Williams from
the MSK law firm for the Association

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.760
of American Publishers, the Motion
Picture Association of America,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.180
and Recording Industry
Association of America.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.880
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: Rebecca
Tushnet, the Organization

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.580
for Transformative Works.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.200
&gt;&gt; Bruce H. Turnbull:
Bruce Turnbull,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.700
representing the DVD
Copy Control Association

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.850 position:56%
and the Advance Access Content
System Licensing Administrator, LLC.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.530
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: Raza
Panjwani, Public Knowledge.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.830
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Great.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.160
So this panel is to explore
the general operation

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.120 position:56%
of the triennial rulemaking process.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.540
I see that many of the panelists
are participants in the process.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.120
And so, they're probably aware

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.720
that last October concluded
the sixth process

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.930
where the Office received
44 petitions.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.040
We grouped this into 27
categories of exemptions.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.550
The Register recommended

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.310
and the Librarian adopted
the granting of 22.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.610 position:56%
But through that process, the Office
received nearly 40,000 written

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.660
comments and we understand that
the comments written in support

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.460
of this study, you know,
for many participants,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.750
it was seen as taking a lot of time

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.780
and perhaps a disproportionate
amount of time.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.080
The comments and testimony

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.490
that we received during the last
session reflected considerable

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.610
efforts from individual
participants,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.780
nonprofit organizations, law firms,
legal clinics and industry members.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.330
And we're interested in
hearing your thoughts

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.970
about the procedural aspects
of the rulemaking as well

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.050
as the evidentiary
standards that are applied.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.250
And keep in mind, some of you
will also be on panel three.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.400
But that topic is whether or
not there should be some sort

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.160
of presumptive renewal or
streamlining for renewals

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.460
of exemptions that are granted.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.430
So we're going to try to
respect that that's the topic

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.410
of the next panel, as
opposed to this panel.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.300
So I think to start out, I'll
just ask a very broad question.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.830
For those that have
participated in the process,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.970
how do you find it's
working for you?

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.200
And in the answers, please
just tip your placards

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.250
up if you wish to speak.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.380
And if you could please try to
keep your response to maybe two

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.780
to three minutes, we'd
appreciate it.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.080
Thank you.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.300
Professor Tushnet?

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.780
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: So not so well.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.820
So we dedicated really
probably 500 to 600 hours,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.450
if I'd look at my time,
which I don't keep

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.960
with the same regularity
you would at a law firm,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.100
and several other people,
other lawyers volunteering

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.760
for my organization also
dedicated significant time as well

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.820
as conversations with technical
people and other people and some

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.360
of our members who take
advantage of the exemption.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.150
So it was a big deal.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.980
And there are significant
problems with the requirements

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.750
that the Office currently imposes.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.940
I think the Cyberlaw Clinic's
comments go into great detail,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.250
and I'm largely in agreement.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.580
So I won't run through there.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.700
I would say one specific issue in
particular that doesn't work well.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.180
So for three rounds, we
have made the argument

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.130
that the Copyright Office
should consider actual knowledge

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.190
and behavior among potential
users of an exemption

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.170
when interpreting whether there
are alternatives to circumvention.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.520
That is, it should consider
whether these alternatives are

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.010
in fact known and used.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.000
And frankly, it's quite frustrating

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.480
that the Copyright Office has
not even addressed this argument,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.540
much less given a reason why
it has rejected this argument,

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.960
which we could actually
then talk about.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.810
It's also contrary to the
due process principles

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.290
and the notice-and-comment
practice of rulemaking.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.070
And, you know, I'd just
like to hear something

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.400
from the Copyright
Office about that.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.700
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.000
Mr. Turnbull?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.050
&gt;&gt; Bruce H. Turnbull: My clients
have participated, DVD CCA,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.710
in all of the prior rulemakings,
and AACS in the last couple

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.130
and I would say in general, we
actually find that it works well.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.050
I think the basic approach
is correct that there--

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.730
that those who seek the exemption
have the information that's

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.840
necessary to bring forward and
that's how it has been put forward.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.780
I think the-- and the notion
that the basic presumption is

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.810
that the prohibitions are to stand
unless there is evidence brought

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.990
forward sufficient to
demonstrate the need

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.000
for the exemption is
the correct approach.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.270
I think that there are
details about how many rounds

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.320
of submissions there are,
whether the initial round

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.920 position:56%
in the last rulemaking was necessary
or additionally burdensome.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.170
I think from the responding
parties' point of view,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.100
we wound up with one response--
you know, one opportunity,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.440
whereas other participants,
the proponents had multiple.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.900
And so, again, in the details,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.580
I think there are places
that could be improved.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.380
But as an overall matter, I
think we find that it works well.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.420
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: If I could ask if
you could turn off your microphone

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.180 position:56%
when you're done speaking, that will
just help prevent feedback noise.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.370
And also, a follow-up
to Mr. Turnbull,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.780
did you feel as participating
in the second cycle of comments

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.850
and there not being a
fourth that, you know,

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.780
there was something you had
left unsaid or did you feel

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.080
that you had the opportunity

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.520
to express your viewpoint
on all issues?

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.750
&gt;&gt; Bruce H. Turnbull: Well,
the concern largely was that--

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.720
I mean, I understand the
inclination of proponents

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.850
to bring forward evidence
or information

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.380
in response to what was submitted.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.320
But we really-- other
than through the hearings,

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.210
which was an imperfect
way of doing it,

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.080
partly because of the time
limitations and the questions

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.500
and that sort of thing, there were
things in the responding round

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.160
from the proponents that
one would have liked

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.830
to have had an opportunity
to respond to.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.050
I mean, there are different
ways that that could be handled.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.160
I mean, the Copyright Office could
be more vigilant in saying no

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.770
to submissions of new evidence

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.250
or giving another round
or, you know, other ways.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.800
But I would say that there were,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.780
particularly in this last
proceeding, there were times

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.090
when we would have responded
if we had the opportunity.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.390
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.690
Thank you.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.990
Mr. Panjwani?

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.030
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: There are a
number of aspects of the proceeding

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.350
that we've been involved in that
we've highlighted as problematic.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.100
In fact, we've filed general
comments at the outset

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.520 position:56%
of the last triennial process to
highlight some of the issues we had,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.780 position:56%
beginning with the identification of
classes of works under section 102

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.060
for the exemption process,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.290
the standard of identifying
non-infringing uses

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.060
as well as adverse effects.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.270
I particularly want to focus on
the first two, in part, because,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.090
as Professor Tushnet mentioned,
the Cyberlaw Clinic's comments

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:10.450
on the adverse effects I think
were very appropriate and sort

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.390
of addressed that very thoroughly.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.540
Currently, the approach
to identifying classes

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.240
of works results in-- as
alluded to in the prior panel,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.120
some distinctions that
don't quite make sense.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.470
So, for example, the difference
between tablets and phones

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.040
that involve the same
exact software,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.940
thus bifurcating the docket and
require filings in both cases.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.740
The differentiation between users,

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.850
educators by differentiating
the classes of users as either K

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.350
through educators or
higher education educators,

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.700
which it's unclear where these
distinctions in terms of classes

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.410
of works come from or
the differentiation

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.810
in granting an exemption
between a Blu-Ray disc

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.390
and a DVD disc as a user.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:01.870 position:56%
Beyond that, in terms of the burden
that we find as problematic in terms

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.230
of filing-- identifying
non-infringing uses is

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:11.860 position:56%
that the expectation that proponents
must identify affirmative precedent

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.070
affirming a non-infringement
whereas the dearth

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.230 position:56%
of precedent identifying an
infringing activity does not satisfy

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.530
the burden.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.620
This is particularly problematic
because without an exemption,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.920
a party cannot engage
in the activity,

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.050
which means that there is a lack
of an opportunity for case law

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.600
to develop in that space.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:38.460
In fact, I would characterize the
lack of an exemption in some areas

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.890
as effectively denying courts of
jurisdiction to define the contours

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.320
of infringement in
that particular area.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.350 position:56%
If you cannot circumvent for
purposes of engaging in an activity,

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.650
there's no way of defining one way

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.570
or another whether that's actually
infringing in a court's eyes,

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.790
if there is no case
law on that point.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.040
I have other areas, but
I'm going to stop there.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.340
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.640
I think you've raised a
lot of issues and some

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.940
of those we'll begin
to drill deeper into.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.340
But I do want to give
everyone an opportunity

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.030
to speak a little bit at opening.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.790
And I think one of the things to
consider maybe as we continue going

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.690
around is to what extent
are some of these issues

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.970
that you're raising sort
of dictated by the statute,

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.900
which requires a finding

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.880
that an activity is likely
to be non-infringing.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.180
So Ms. Cox?

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: So the Association

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.350
of Research Libraries
has participated

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.760
in the rulemaking process as part
of the Library Copyright Alliance.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.660
And it-- the process is just--
it takes an extraordinary amount

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.020
of time, as Professor
Tushnet mentioned, you know,

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.050
took like 500 to 600 hours.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.720
We're very lucky to have the
assistance of some of the clinics

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.410
that we've worked with and joined
in some of their filings because,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:54.700
otherwise, it really does take
an extraordinary amount of time

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.220
and resources where you have
to assemble the evidence,

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.330
you have to submit the
proposal, including the text.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:05.310
You have to basically write a brief
on why your use is non-infringing

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:12.490
and you have to then respond to
any opposition to those proposals,

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.010
prepare a written reply,
participate in the hearings

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.170 position:56%
and then do the follow-up questions.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.510
And you know, this whole
process can take a year or more,

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.970
which is just an extraordinary
amount of time for something

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.150
that is proposed by
public interest groups

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.600
that often don't have the time
and resources to invest in this.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.090
And this is why we are very
grateful to the clinics.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.960
Just on Raza's point
about that the lack

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.410
of exemption denies courts
these opportunities, you know,

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:44.070 position:56%
it really does make putting together
this evidence very, very difficult.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.160
It makes writing these briefs on
why it's a non-infringing use--

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.010
it can make it-- make
it more difficult.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.680
And as Mr. Turnbull said, you
know, he believes that those

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.650
who want the exemptions
have the opportunity

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.000
and the information necessary.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.330
And I would disagree
just to the extent

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.470
that this process really
provides an asymmetry of interest

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.310
where these corporations
are usually the ones

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.110
that are proposing these
exemptions whereas it is

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.410
like these public interest groups

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.720
that don't have these
resources needed to walk

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.320
through this very complicated
and burdensome

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.920
and very formalistic system.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.220
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr. Mohr?

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.720
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: A couple of--

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.630
just I guess a couple
of preliminary points.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.800 position:56%
The first thing is I think there's--

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.930
I want to be clear in
distinguishing between, let's say,

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.640
problems with the statute and
problems with the rulemaking.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.550
There are-- from our mind-- in
our mind, there are areas where,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.920
in fact overall, the statute
is working quite well.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:05.320
And I think in the comments from
AAP and the MPAA and also in ours,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.880
we've tried to give some examples

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.980
of how new business models
have been encouraged.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:15.240
This was designed to be a failsafe.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.030
And it was designed to
operate in a certain way.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.660
And I think you hit on that.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.460
And that is specifically
with respect to the statute,

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.810
that the statute has to be a
source of causation of the harm.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.820
It can't be alternative
distribution models.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.560
It can't be the fact that
something is inconvenient.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.570
It has to be the statute that
is causing the adverse effect.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:43.230
And I think, to the extent that the
rulemaking has gone off the rails a

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:52.950
bit, it might be useful to examine
how closely the library is hewn

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.420
to that particular standard.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.720
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can you elaborate,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.960
if you think that the
rulemaking has gone away

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.530
from the standards set
out in the statute?

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.740
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Well,
initially, I mean it--

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.610
it's, you know-- it's changed.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.250
The library has changed
its position.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:14.170
I mean the initial-- the initial
rulemaking, the very first one,

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.910
there was a fairly
large fight over whether

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.140
or not an exemption
should issue to a class

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.060
of users or to a class of works.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:35.530
And the initial rulemaking tried
to stay pretty close to that line.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.230
And I think later, it got much
more into the class of user

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.210
and then it got a lot fuzzier.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:48.730 position:56%
I think there are places where there
are-- there may be other statutes,

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:54.050
for example, that prohibit a
particular course of conduct.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.040
And so, if assuming
both statutes are valid,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.890
assuming both statutes
prescribed the same conduct,

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:04.940
the section 1201 can't
be prescribed as a cause.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.870
It's a way the proceeding
is being used

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.530
of validating some other policy
goal that they would like to have

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.730
but has nothing to
do with copyright.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.110
In that particular instance,
I'm not sure that issuance

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.130
of an exemption is appropriate.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.470
In other words, tie
goes to no exemption.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.570
That's-- those are the
sorts of things I mean

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.400 position:56%
by statutory causation, if you like.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.420
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr. Williams.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.570
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thank you.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.870
Thank you.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.180
I like to reiterate first what--

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.370
what Mr. Turnbull said in
the sense that, you know,

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.540
the comments by their very nature
kind of contain a lot of criticism

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.160
of what the Office has done

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.240
but I think you guys also
deserve a good bit of phrase

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.200
for taking a tricky statute

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.100
and making a proceeding that's
overall worked quite well.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.400
I think we're in kind of a-- it's
not broken, so you had to be very,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.350
very careful trying
to fix it scenario.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:06.420
Again, it's functioning
as it was intended to.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.510
We're not always happy
with the outcomes.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.970
We're frequently unhappy with some
of them and we've got a few things

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.600
in our comments that we
think could be improved.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.330
One important one I think is
we would love to see a draft

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.740
of the regulatory language in
advance of it being published just

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.480
so that everyone who
participated in the hearings

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.820
at least can comment on
the drafting choices.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.830
But some of those things are
relatively minor improvements

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.490
that we think could be made.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.640
And overall, we think-- we think
things are working pretty well.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.350
On Bruce's point about the
one filing versus three

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.400
from the last cycle, we also felt

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.320
that there were some
things left unsaid.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.160
Part of that was because of the
hearing, I think, as you should,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.350
you gave the proponents a lot of
opportunity to explain their cases.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.030
And then as who were sitting
at the end of the table,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.400
ended up running out
of time sometimes.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.940
So having one more written
filing might have been helpful.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.500
I just have a very few
brief things in response

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.130
to some of what's being said.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.480
I think Public Knowledge
raised the issue

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.010
of why should we be distinguishing
between different types of users

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.540
and I think that's
something that grew

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.930
out of what Mr. Mohr
was talking about,

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:30.280
which is that we've altered the
approach somewhat and that a class

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.150
of users was not something that
was initially being looked at.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.190
But overall, I think my
clients have come to find

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.440
that that change has been helpful.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.740 position:56%
It's not perfect and we do have some
concerns about-- about how it works.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.880
But overall, I think we
have found it to be helpful.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.090
And so in the previous panel,

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.030
Jonathan Band was raising
the issue of, well,

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.310
this is going to keep growing
and growing and growing

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.560
and eventually the whole building
is going to have to work on it.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.870
But I think that is in large part
the result of the Office trying

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.170
to be accommodating to
the proponents and trying

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.830
to let them make their case and--

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.860
and expanded the approach
to allow the class

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.730
of works definition to be altered.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.130
And so, sometimes you
have to take a little bit

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.400
of bad with a lot of good.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.300
And so that I think is kind

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.540
of why the proceeding
has grown the way it has.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:30.230
The last point I wanted to
respond to was this issue

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.740
that 1201 supposedly
inhibits the development

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.530
of normal copyright case
law or fair use case law.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.300
I don't-- I've never
understood that argument

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.790
and I still don't understand
that argument.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.590
I understand that there are two
different types of liability

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.170
and that in counseling a
client, you have to address both.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.310
On other hand, if there
are the number of threats

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.990
that people claim there are of
1201 liability, there are lots

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:06.290
of ways to-- to pursue declaratory
relief actions without connection

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:11.530
to the 1201 threat and still
pursue your copyright arguments.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.360
There are lots of fair use
cases going on out there.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.380
I'm involved in a lot of them on
both sides, often on the defense.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.590
There are a lot of other types of
exemptions, related cases going

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.480
on that have nothing to
do with 1201 so I just--

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.280
I don't believe that the
case law is being inhibited.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.580
Thank you.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.180
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK, well, we did
open up with a broad question.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.090
I think now we've got a
lot of issues to unpack.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.440
So I think that I might be
hopping around a little bit

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.960
but on the question of how
to define a class of works,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.120
it is true as others have mentioned
that in the first rulemaking,

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.600
the Office did not define a class
of works by reference to the users

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.000
but subsequently from the
second rule making on, it has.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.230
And my question is if this were
to be taking an opposite approach

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:02.100
and not allow refining it by
the types of users or uses,

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.040
would this be likely to result
in perhaps less exemptions.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.010
What effect does this have in the
rulemaking if you need to look

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.270
at sort of a wide approval in terms

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.530
of whether an activity is
likely to be non-infringing?

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.690
So Professor Decherney?

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: Yeah, thank you.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.620
So I've been participating in the
rulemaking since 2006 when it was--

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.640
when the use and users were added
to the definition of class works.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.340
I think it's not a question
of whether or not the--

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.950
it becomes larger or smaller as
a class but it brings the idea

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.050
of a class much more
in line with fair use

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.750
which is about use and users.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.370
And of course, all non-infringing
uses aren't about fair use.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.780
There are plenty of kinds of
non-infringing use which are

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.840
about exemptions like the 110,

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.850
but fair use is obviously
is really important one.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.470
So I think it actually makes the
logic of the arguments much--

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:55.140
much cleaner and brings them
in the line with fair use.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.360
We're not talking about video games

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.140
that can only be played
on obsolete technology.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.350
But it's about use by
archivists, which is really what

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.170
that exemption was meant to be used

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:10.300
for going all the way
back to 2003 and 2006.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.090
Could I add a few other
comments from the first round?

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.390
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Sure.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:15.690
Go ahead.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.990
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: So
I mean, in some ways,

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.680
the rulemaking has I think
really been effective and,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.290 position:56%
from my own perspective, many, many,
you know, thousands of educators

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:23.850
and students have been
able to engage

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.920
in non-infringing uses as a result.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.860
And there are so many
changes that have helped that,

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.540
including the added
addition of use and users

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.080 position:56%
and the streamlining of the process.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.020
So I'm happy we see that
you're open to new changes.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.270
I mean to-- just to bring up
two small issues, two issues,

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.760
not so small, one is the
emphasis that we place

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.460
on the next three years
in each rulemaking.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.350
Often we end up debating things
that end to be vaporware,

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.510
technologies that never
materialize, licensing agreements

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.830
which are still being negotiated
even 16 years after we first heard

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.290
about them and if there's a
way to keep that to things

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.550
that are tangible and real
and that there's evidence

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.020
that they exist would be terrific.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.030
The other is what we're going
to talk about this afternoon,

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.740
which is the renewal process.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.280
And so, I'll put that aside.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.710
But you know, I'd love to rethink
what de novo may mean and whether

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.910
or not we need to use
that standard at all.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.090
But also, maybe something more
appropriate for this, you know,

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.280
part of the hearing is how
evidence is preserved and used

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.190
and then maybe reused
for the future.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Yeah, and keeping
in mind that the next panel is going

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.870
to talk about renewals, like if
there were some type of reform

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.400
for renewals, it seems
like it might take some

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.880
of the pressure off the
participants in each

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.750
of the rulemakings going anew.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.050
But Mr. Panjwani?

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.140
I think I might-- am
I saying that right?

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.500
OK. Panjwani.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.940
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: I'd also like to
just respond very briefly to some

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.100
of the points made previously.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.220
It was already mentioned in amount
of hours that have to be put

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.850
in by proponents, ranging from
500 by a few of the clinics

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.650
to as high as, I believe, 2000
hours was the number listed

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.720
in the reply comments
by the filmmakers,

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.040
by the UC Irvine Law Clinic as
well as their Pro Bono Counsel.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:12.120
I don't think a system that
relies on Pro Bono Counsel

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.320
and the availability of
clinics is sustainable.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.290
And Mr. Williams doesn't
believe that we're going

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.030
to have necessarily
this proliferation.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.520
But one example that came
up was consumer appliances

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.650
and the software embedded in
them are not covered by any

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.950
of the exemptions and
we're going to have

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.250 position:56%
to wait two years to deal with that.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.430
And that's going to be an
additional class that's going

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.470
to require addressing an
additional proponent work.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.930
In terms of the specifics of the
comment periods of the process,

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.960
I will note that in my limited
experience as a litigator

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.200
in motion practice, typically
the party with the burden

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.410
of proof is allowed to file
in favor and a reply brief,

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:49.130
and a sur-reply brief the fourth
round is typically not given

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.430
as of right.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.520
I would also note that
it's important to realize

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.620
that the burden, as we often
hear from the Copyright Office,

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.840
the burden is on the proponents
to the point that there is no

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.510
such thing as a default
judgment in favor of proponents.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:05.150
It is possible to have
your exemption denied

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.880 position:56%
without anyone actually opposing it,

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.500
as the Register recommended
the denial

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.760
of 24 the e-book reading
exemption back in 2010

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.320
without any substantive opposition.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.260
I would also note that the
problems with the process in terms

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.350
of the accessibility of the public
in understanding what's going

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.330
on were delineated in the Cyberlaw
Clinic's comments that pointed

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.270
out that there are effectively nine
factors that the Office considers.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.950
And you cannot find those nine
factors listed in one place.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.420
But rather, one must parse both
the original NOI requesting classes

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.530
being identified and then the NPRM
calling for the rulemaking process.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.230
And in combination, one
gets this multifactor test

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:45.530
that is highly technical

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.940
and requires all these
hours to actually meet.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.620
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Again,
I'm just going to move

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.920
on so we can facilitate this.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.320
Again, I think these issues
end up being a bit intertwined.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.620
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: Right.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.920
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: But I'm
trying to focus it--

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.220
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: Sure.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.520
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: -- to narrow it.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.820
I wonder if we can get
back to the question

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.120
of the definition of
the class of works.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.770
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: So I understand
the difficulty the Office has

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.240
in that they're asked to
define classes of works.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.510
But exemptions must be granted
for non-infringing uses.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.920
And then, connecting those
two perhaps leads to some

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.930
of the difficulties that we have.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.910
I would say that there
is a middle ground though

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.740
between the atomization that
currently occurs in the defining

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.250
of classes and the
section 102 classes.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:28.610
I believe that we've veered too
far in terms of where we are.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:33.840
I think motion pictures for
classes of fair uses as opposed to,

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.550
you know, particular types
of formats I think is

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.020
where we start running
into sort of shallow waters

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.130
and fear of running aground.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.950
I think software also presents some
difficulties in terms of tying it

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:50.100
to a particular type of device,
whereas perhaps software needs

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.660
to be treated as its
own class that is

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.590
in fact a narrower subgroup
than literary works.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:59.400
So I would urge perhaps a
movement away from the level

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.480
of specificity currently in
the definition of classes.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.780
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.440
Professor Tushnet?

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:12.920
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: So what was
just said is exactly what I think

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.100
about the classes too, especially

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:22.430 position:56%
since the burden placed sometimes
doesn't inform us exactly, you know,

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.530
how specific we have to be.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.570
There's not-- and right now,
we have no reason to think

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.310
or understand why, you know, the
exemption isn't for the University

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:35.030
of Pennsylvania instead of for
college professors because,

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.890
you know, it's somebody
from the University

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.800
of Pennsylvania who's
coming and asking.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.250
And we-- so from our perspective,
it is hard to understand, you know,

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:47.420
what the distinctions are when we,
you know, see someone testifying

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.540
about the need of teachers
across all disciplines.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.290
Then, it turns out because they
are actually from media studies,

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:58.520
you know, we only get an
exemption for media studies.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:04.000
And so, part of the reason
you've seen such an explosion is

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.490
that we have learned the lesson
that we have to bring sort

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.670
of a kindergarten teacher
and a first grade teacher

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:14.140
and a second grade teacher and
this is, you know, because--

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:19.150
because in the past, the Office
has rejected, for example,

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:23.030
when I bring in remix videos,
they've rejected the relevance

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.660
of the National History Day
people, who do make remixes,

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.260
but they make it in an
educational context.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.340 position:56%
So they don't count apparently for--

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.980
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Well, I do want to
push back a little bit on the idea

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.670
that you need to bring in
a kindergarten teacher,

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.550
a first grade teacher and
a second grade teacher.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.440
I mean, what would
be the alternative?

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.420
Would it be that Professor
Decherney, you know,

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.620
shows and the Office has said this
is a great example of fair use

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.340
in cinema studies, and so
he testifies about his need

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.720
and an exemption is
granted and it is

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.550
for fair use for all
motion pictures.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.520
Where would the line be drawn?

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.760
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: So motion
pictures in educational context,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.880
absolutely, because
what he testifies

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.660
about is pedagogical practice.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:06.900
And certainly, the people that we
have-- so Renee Hobbs, for example,

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.260
she's actually not just a media
educator, she actually works

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.940
in the pedagogy of education.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.220
And so, that's the kind of thing
where the evidence in front

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.520
of you actually supports the
generalization being offered

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.950
because it's about how pedagogy
works, not about how media studies

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:29.020
in particular works or language
studies or film studies.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:34.680 position:56%
And we think that a similar level of
generality, similar to what you see

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.980
in fair use cases, right.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.330
So people in fair use cases,

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.210
they list education,
criticism, commentary.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:44.080
They don't say media studies
and there's a reason for that.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.090 position:56%
And I think that that kind of change
could really help decrease the

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:53.390
burden on you as well as
align it, as Raza was saying,

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:57.480
more with the needs-- the statute.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.280
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr. Turnbull?

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.240
&gt;&gt; Bruce H. Turnbull: Well,
far be it from me to advocate

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:09.850
for exemptions, but I really think
that the focus on K through 12

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:15.650
or particular types of higher
education has enabled the Office

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:19.520
to make recommendations
for exemptions,

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:26.120
whereas a much broader category,
as had been in the early rounds,

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:31.440
resulted in no exemption
recommendation and that if you--

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.540 position:56%
if you, again, if you start out with
the proposition that the default is

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.960
that the prohibition on
circumvention shall apply,

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.180
which is what the statute and
the legislative history tell you,

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.580
unless there is a particular
body of evidence saying

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:52.230
that a particular use
is being frustrated

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:56.280
by the particular technology
involved,

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.670
then if you have a broader
category, you're much more likely

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.160
to find that, no, in
the broader category,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.580
there is not the frustration
of the use.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.290
Whereas if in a narrower category--

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:10.990
I mean, Professor Decherney
did a really superb job in 2006

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.260
of explaining why it was that
he needed what he needed.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.450 position:56%
And I think that the evidence that's
been presented in other cases--

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.170
while I, again, with Mr. Williams,

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:21.970
I'm not always happy
with the result.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:26.010
I think there has been a
reasonable outcome based

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.020
on what's been presented.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.710
And if there are ways to make
that a little easier for some

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:35.130
of the proponents, I'm
not opposed to that.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:39.760
But I think that the-- the way
the categories are defined has

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.710
in fact enabled the granting
of certain exemptions

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:46.120
that in a broader category
would not have been granted.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.080
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr. Williams?

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.380
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thank you.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.860
Yeah, I agree with Bruce.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:57.340
I think your question was if the
approach to class of works changed,

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:02.000
would that end up resulting
in fewer exemptions.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.880
And I think if you followed
the approach as you have

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:13.800
and only altered that portion that
it would, because you, as you said,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.370
need to decide that the use
is likely non-infringing.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.870
I actually think you have
to go farther than that.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.950
You have to actually decide
that it is non-infringing

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.870
because the statute says
likely adverse impact.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:27.190
It doesn't say likely
non-infringing use.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.360
But that's a disagreement I have.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.850
But in order for you to
make that conclusion even

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:35.810 position:56%
that it's likely non-infringing use,
you have to start engaging in some

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.680
of the line drawing that
is being criticized.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.000
So you've done things like focus
on use of short portions of a works

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.150
for criticism and commentary
in noncommercial sectors.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:50.170
Those things help you
get to the conclusion

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:53.410
that what the proponents
want to do is a lawful use.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:54.710
And you have to get

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.190
to that conclusion before
you can grant the exemption.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:58.890
You also have to get
to the conclusion

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:02.130
that there are not reasonable
alternatives available.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.200
So you have to draw the lines
that were being criticized

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:10.030
between different formats because
just because someone who's engaged

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.970
in a certain activity wants
to use DVD-quality footage,

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.770
that doesn't mean that they have
to have Blu-Ray quality footage.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:20.400 position:56%
And so, the line drawing that you've
engaged in I think has allowed you

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.870
to craft exemptions that comply
with the statutory requirements

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:30.490
and that also give the proponents
a lot of what they're asking for.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.970
So I would be careful playing
around with doing away with some

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.220
of this-- this line drawing.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.860
A couple of very quick responses.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.530
On the burden of proof
issue, I think, you know,

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.980
this was heavily debated in the
2000 rulemaking and then all

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.410
over again in the 2003 rulemaking.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.720
There were a lot of disagreements
at that time between NTIA

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.940
and the Office as to
how to read the statute.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.330
One thing they both agreed on
though was that the burden is

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.820
on the proponents and
that that's a requirement

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.600
in the legislative history.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:11.940
And Federal Register
65, page 64558 goes

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.740 position:56%
through the office's initial
reasoning as to why the burden needs

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:20.620 position:56%
to be on the proponents, and I think
it's sound reasoning even to today,

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.490
citing case law and other
sources that basically say

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:28.620
that when you're dealing with
an exception to a general rule,

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:32.490
the burden is on the proponent of
the exception to make its case.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:36.000
So I'd urge you to go back to that.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.250
I think I'll end there.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.550
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.850
Ms. Cox?

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.500
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: So I agree
with a lot of what Raza

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.250
and Professor Tushnet said, that
I think-- and Professor Decherney,

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.630
that defining based on uses
really does make a lot of sense,

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.200
that it does put it
in line with fair use.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.100
And, I think that distinguishing

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.890
between the different educational
uses, between K through 12 or,

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:07.540
you know, media studies
or other disciplines

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.160
in college really doesn't
make a lot of sense

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.050
because we are talking
about pedagogy.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.650
We're talking about
educating students.

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:17.110
And, I would just say
that trying to draw all

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:22.040
of those distinctions
actually makes the actual text

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.370
of the exemptions not as
usable, not as friendly.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.830
For example, in the most
recent rulemaking process,

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:32.570
the exemption for film
clubs was 1055 words long.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.920
The 2006 exemption
was 44 words long.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.670
A 44-word exemption is a lot easier
for the average teacher or person,

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.130
user to understand versus having
to really parse through the statute

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.540
and really understand what is
allowed or what's not allowed.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:52.210
So I think if you went back to
looking at the uses instead of,

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:56.120
you know, the classes of users, I
think that it would make it easier

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.530
for us to understand
it and you wouldn't go

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.350
through such a long
and drawn out process.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.650
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:03.950
Thank you.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:05.250
Ms. Greene?

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.550
&gt;&gt; Robyn Greene: Thank you.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.850
I just wanted to respond.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:09.360
This is a little bit off-topic
from your question directly,

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.810
but to what Mr. Williams was saying
about the proper interpretation

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.470
of whether or not something
is infringing.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:20.500 position:56%
And it is our position that the
Copyright Office should be uniformly

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.480
applying a standard that
they merely have to find

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.760
that a proposed exemption
is likely non-infringing.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.260
We think that this emanates
directly from the statute,

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:34.340
as the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard
stated as well in its comments.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.560
Our view is certainly
in line with that.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.470
And we would also urge a narrow
interpretation of the question

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:44.610
as to whether the proponent

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:50.070 position:56%
of the exemption experiences adverse
effects as a result of the TPM.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.720
We think that both of these would
be in keeping with the intent

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:58.440
of the statute and would allow
for a better implementation

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.830
of the rulemaking process.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Professor Decherney?

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.410
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: Just to
quickly set the record straight,

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:09.620 position:56%
when I'm criticized by Professor
Tushnet and praised by Mr. Turnbull.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:15.730
In 2006, we did actually apply for
an exemption for media professors.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:18.690
Immediately, we were criticized by
everyone who said, what about us,

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.810
we also need an exemption.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:25.520
And as a result, had evidence from
people across the academy and lots

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.440
of stories from people in many
different fields, but also support

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.690
from many different
professional organizations,

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.930
including the American Association
of University Professors,

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.950
the largest organization
of academics.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.000
And so, that-- who
are all represented

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.170
by me normally during the
rulemakings, not today,

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.870
although they have
submitted comments actually.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.480
So it is a broad exemption.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.010
I just-- a one quick point

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:55.190
about what Mr. Williams was
calling the line drawing

00:36:55.190 --> 00:37:00.160
and I think this relates to
Ms. Cox's comments as well.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.000 position:56%
But we are often talking about these
distinctions between DVD and Blu-Ray

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.200
and it's not about non-infringing
uses versus non-- non-infringing--

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.900
the infringing uses, but about
the level of need, of quality,

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.230
when and what constitutes something
that's useful for education

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.750
or for archiving purposes.

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:24.840
And it's not clear exactly
what the standard is there.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.940
I mean, I don't know, if you
want to be convinced by us

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.320
that it is something we need.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.480
But I think some kind of
clearer understanding of what

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.670
that bar is would be terrific.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:35.970
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.220
So the next area I'd like to
tee up is the burden of proof,

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.030
which some have already
sort of spoken about.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.430
Mr. Williams has quoted what
the Office said in the statute.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.050
It says the librarian
needs to make a finding

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:50.570
of something that's
specifically going

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:51.870
to happen in the next three years.

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.720
So, I think there's two
sides to this question.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.500
First is the Office has said
that the burden of proof is

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.480
on the proponent and
we've also heard

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.190
that it's taking legal
clinics hundreds of hours.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:06.350
So there's both a substantive and a
procedural angle to this question.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.930
Should the Office institute reforms

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.720
that give people less
opportunities to submit evidence?

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.350
Would that hurt the ability for
proponents to obtain an exemption

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:17.720
or are there specific
reforms we should consider?

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.640
Mr. Mohr?

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:26.970
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: I think there
are certain things-- I'm sorry.

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:33.520 position:56%
I think there are certain things you
might be able to do through concepts

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:37.010
of administrative notice that
would streamline the proceeding.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:43.030
I think it's totally reasonable for
someone who has proven an exemption

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.290
to provide information in
abbreviated form, for example,

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:50.390
that they have used the exemption.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:54.260
It would certainly be helpful
to say, yes, we've used this,

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.010
and here's a couple of
brief examples of the kind

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.870
of thing that we've done.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:02.510
I'm not talking about a, you know,
300 page, thousand-footnote filing,

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:07.230
this is what I did with my summer
vacation, that kind of thing.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:13.540 position:56%
And provided that's all that's being
sought is the exact same exemption

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:17.090
from the year before,
that should be enough,

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:21.400
unless somebody else comes forward
and says, no, things have changed,

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.090
the exemption is being abused,
there is some other evidence that,

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.290 position:56%
you know, there is someone-- there
was some flaw in the case beforehand

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.540
that warrants a revisiting of
this or something, you know,

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.290
a rebuttal basically, a
rebuttal of that evidence.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:34.590
But the burden-- you're right.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.620
The burden has to be
on the proponent first.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.310
But after that, I think you as an
administrative agency as opposed

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:44.560
to a court have more flexibility
in how you handle the rulemaking

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.700
from that point as it goes forward.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:51.250
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Just to sort of
focus a little bit on this question

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.920
of what we as the Office can do

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.350
versus what might require
statutory change

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.080
on this question of
the burden of proof.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:04.600
We have said that the proper
showing is a preponderance

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.640
of the evidence standard,

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:12.030
which requires a more
likely than not showing.

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:19.180
Is there agreement that that is the
proper sort of baseline framework

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:24.400
that we should be applying
or do people have a view

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.420
that we have some latitude
in that area?

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.060
Mr. Panjwani?

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.190
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: I
don't think we take--

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.250
or at least speaking for
public knowledge or take issue

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:41.140
with the idea of a
preponderance of evidence standard

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.300
for meeting the burden
of proof as a proponent.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.020
I think, however, where our
disagreement enters in is what

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.550
that mean with respect
to each of the elements.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:53.230
What is showing non-infringing use
by a preponderance of the evidence

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:57.270
and what are the adverse effects
that the statute contemplated

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.950
that proponents would be
required to demonstrate in order

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:04.710
to meet a preponderance
of evidence standard?

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:07.520
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Professor Tushnet?

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.620
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet:
So I was just going

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.120
to say exactly what-- exactly that.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.660
Don't-- we should definitely
not change the process

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.310
to give us less opportunity
to make our case.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.760
You know, I think there would
be serious due process problems

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.200
with that, among other things.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.260
But the real-- the reason these
submissions are 150 pages long is

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.880
because of this question,
burden of proof

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.330
and the preponderance
of evidence as to what.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:35.150
And again, I'd direct you
to the Cyberlaw Clinic.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.880
You know, the burden of proof
should be about non-infringing use,

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.910
adverse effects, not the
nine different things

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:46.600
that the Copyright Office
has come up with over time,

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.740
which do contribute to the
fact that we feel like we have

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:56.120
to meet the burden on
other considerations

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.280
that may be added into
the process later.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.770
And I think adhering

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:05.150
to the statutory text could
really solve a lot of that.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.860
Actually, could I actually
respond to something earlier?

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.030
Because I feel like I
don't want to let it go.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:14.280
In terms of the question of 1201
interfering with the development

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.570
of case law, so we heard that
that didn't really happen.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:23.740 position:56%
Let me offer you two pieces of
evidence that it does, first of all,

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.510
as my own experience and
that of the OTW as a whole.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:31.090
So we counseled remixers
before the exemption happened.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.380
Remixers often-- well, not often,

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.930
but occasionally would
receive DMCA notices.

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:38.970
We'd talk to them about whether
they wanted to counter-notice.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.550
And we always had to ask
them before the exemption,

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:42.850
how was this footage made?

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:47.240
And because nobody knows about the
DMCA, almost all of them made it

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:52.220 position:56%
by DVD ripping because that's what
gives you the most effective source.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:57.770
And nobody that I counseled
thought, oh yeah, I should go ahead

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:00.570
and make my fair use argument
even though I would be willing

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:04.260 position:56%
to go ahead and do that, because
I'm definitely going to lose, right?

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.560
You have to tell them, look,

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.530
if you made it the wrong
way, you're going to lose.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.690
It doesn't matter that you
have a good fair use case.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.180
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So in
that example, I mean,

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.570
what is-- what is the alternative?

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:19.850 position:56%
It seems like it may be statutory
reform, since the statute requires--

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.150
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: No--

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: -- the
non-infringing uses exist as opposed

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:25.250
to proponent case law, right?

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:28.720 position:56%
I mean, the earlier panel, we talked
about Congress making the decision

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.340
to protect access to
copyrighted works separately.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: Well, I'm sorry.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.940
Maybe I wasn't clear.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.650
Before we succeeded the first
time in getting the exemption,

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.280
that's how I had to counsel people.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.270
Now, I can counsel
people, saying go ahead.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.200
I don't have to ask them
how the footage was created.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.460 position:56%
Go ahead. Do your counter-notice and
if they sue, we'll represent you.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.770
And I tell you, no
counter-notice that I've worked

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:55.370
with has ever proceeded to a case
because remixers get takedowns

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:58.730 position:56%
that are unjustified, something that
we have talked about in other fora.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:04.230
But at the very least, the
copyright owners have decided not

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.860
to pursue claims when we thought
there was a very strong fair use

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.410
case and we were willing
to make that,

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.760
which we couldn't do
before we had our exemption.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.060
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.360
So it sounds like the
exemption in this case

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.660
and process was working and--

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.690
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: Well,
so in terms-- right.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.070
Now we are ready to make-- right?

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:24.340
We're ready to litigate some of
the issues that before we existed.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.480
There was really nobody who
would represent a non-commercial,

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.850
you know, most non-commercial
cases don't end up in court

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:33.320
because the defendant
can't find a lawyer, right?

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.150
We're now there to do that.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:38.850
And you know, we're
waiting for the right case,

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.880
which we just couldn't do before.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.870
And then, the other thing I
would mention is the dicta

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.350
in the Corley case which
has already come up opining

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:51.100 position:56%
on stuff that's not before it, about
the question of quality, like what--

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.900
you know, does fair use
require a particular quality?

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:57.600
So that's something that
has been a real problem.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.880 position:56%
It's explicitly disavowed by
subsequent Second Circuit precedent.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.420 position:56%
But it still haunting us, as you can
see by the fact that it's brought

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:08.060
up 16 years later about whether
you actually do have an entitlement

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.790
to the right quality for,
you know, your fair use.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.090
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.930 position:56%
Mr. Williams, I think, if you wanted
to respond to the initial question

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:19.250
about burden of proof and
preponderance of evidence?

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:20.550
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Yes.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:21.850
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: On preponderance
of the evidence, I think I saw a lot

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:29.000
of confusion in the comments
on what the standard means.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.890
And as you said, it means
more likely than not,

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.990
which is not a terribly
difficult standard.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:36.860
It's the standard you're
usually dealing with at trial.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:40.890
So if you show 51% and
the other side's got 49,

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:43.780
that's a close call,
but you still win.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.260
So a lot of the comments seem

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.110
to think it meant something
quite different

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.110
and I think you could clear
that up just by clarifying.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:57.320
You've repeatedly done that
in your NOIs every cycle.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.500
You've explained what it means.

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.220
But there seems to
still be come confusion.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.040
And I think that might be
because people get troubled

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.700
by the substantial
adverse impact standard,

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.420
which is the burden they
have to meet is to show

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:15.670
that substantial adverse impact by
a preponderance of the evidence.

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:19.200
And you've also gone out of your
way in every cycle to explain

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:26.360
that substantial is not
something that requires proof

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.630
that something absolutely
terrible has happened to you.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:33.600
It's-- It comes out of the
legislative history that calls

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.280
for distinct, verifiable
and measurable impacts

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.380
or that says mere inconvenience
is not enough.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:45.720
All of those things were worked
through in the 2000 cycle.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.410
And then, in 2003,
the Office reiterated

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:52.500
that it's not imposing any
burden that isn't already

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.190
in the legislative history
by saying substantial.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:58.490
It's just saying don't come
to us with a hypothetical.

00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:59.790
Don't come to us

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:02.020
with a philosophical
objection with the law.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.180
Tell us about a real-world issue

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.940
and we'll consider
granting the exemption.

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:10.500
So I think the burden
has been handled properly

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.860
and it's not something
that should be changed.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.160
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.990 position:56%
I think we'll go to Ms. Greene next.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.960
But one question, does anyone
want to specifically comment,

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.920
thinking ahead on the Breaking
Down Barriers to Innovation Act,

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.270
which would change statutorily
and impose a totality

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:26.570
of the circumstances test?

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.660
So, Ms. Greene?

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:34.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robyn Greene: So I just wanted
to respond to Mr. Williams' citation

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.850
to the Manager's Report and
dependence on that as sort

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:43.110
of the best source of
legislative history.

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.060
I would call into question whether

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.010
or not those are actually
appropriate standards.

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:51.100
I mean, when you look at
the actual statutory text,

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.800
it does not impose any kind of
substantial burden requirement.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:59.580
It says merely, as Mr.
Williams was citing earlier,

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:06.090
that the person be adversely--
sorry, that someone is likely to be

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:08.540
in the succeeding three-year
period adversely affected

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.960
by virtue of the TPM.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:16.570
And so, I do think the appropriate
standard for inquiry is whether

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:20.070
or not someone's proposed
use is likely non-infringing,

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:23.400
which would also be in
keeping with the preponderance

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.280
of the evidence standard,
right, more likely than not.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.630
And then, also, seek to
determine just whether

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:35.560 position:56%
or not quite simply something does
impose an adverse effect as a result

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.050
of the TPM, not imposing some
type of heightened standard

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.220
as to the level of
that adverse effect.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:46.510
It's not clear in the statutory
language or in the majority

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:48.760
of the legislative history,
as opposed to the sort

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.730
of minority report by a
single member of Congress

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.110 position:56%
that there was contemplated any kind

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.820
of like a substantial
adverse impact.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:03.980
It seems more likely in fact that
the intent was to determine whether

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:08.610
or not there is any adverse
impact, and then to err on the side

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:11.360
of granting the exemption,
as this was, of course,

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.950
meant to be a failsafe
for people whose fair uses

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:19.390
and other non-infringing uses
would otherwise be made impossible

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.500
as a result of 1201.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.800
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.100
Thank you.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.400
And I know a lot of the
written comments do expose a lot

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.240
of viewpoints on the legislative
history too and, obviously,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.790
we're taking those into account.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:34.910
And so, on totality of the
circumstances test, Mr. Panjwani,

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.210
if you'd like to respond?

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.510
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: Sure.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:42.880
The Breaking Down Barriers
to Innovation Act--

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.850
as best as I can recall it
offers a number of amendments

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:51.130
by explicitly placing
into the statutory factors

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:53.640
for granting exemptions,
a lot of the things

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.940
that we've talked about here.

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.460
It is still our position
at Public Knowledge

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:59.940
that the statute can be
interpreted to allow for many

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.850 position:56%
of those things, if not all of them.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:06.540
We can disagree on some of that.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:09.220
To focus again on the example
you asked for about development

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:13.490
of case law, one of the exemptions
that we originally asked for

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:16.480
and this is a bit of-- sort of a
Sisyphean gag between ourselves

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.870
at Public Knowledge and Mr.
Turnbull and Mr. Williams,

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:20.560 position:56%
is the DVD space-shifting exemption,

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.520
which we apply for
every three years.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:27.200 position:56%
I will note that while the Copyright
Office disagrees with our analysis

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.950
of the case law as to whether
that is a non-infringing activity,

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:33.020
NTIA in its report, looking
at the same case law,

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.840
comes to a differing conclusion.

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:40.020
They also reach, I believe,
a disagreeing opinion

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.320
with the Copyright Office

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.360
as to whether narrative filmmakers
are more likely than not to be able

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.140
to make fair uses of video clips.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.760
And I think this highlights the
problem that I talked about earlier

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.060
of a bad jurisdiction sort of thing

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:56.290
that we have two competent agencies
reaching opposite interpretations

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.670
of the copyright law and that the
appropriate authority to settle

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:01.260
that dispute is a federal court.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:04.400
And the only way that gets to a
court is if there is an exemption

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.050
that allows us to settle the
copyright issue because--

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.350
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So--

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:09.650
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: Sorry.

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:10.950
Go ahead.

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:12.250
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can I ask
how would you reform that?

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:13.550
Would it be statutory reform

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:14.850
and the statute contemplates the
librarian makes a determination

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:17.070
based on the recommendation
of the Register of Copyrights

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:21.970
who in turn consults with NTIA and
so takes all that into account and,

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:25.170
you know, puts into a final
rule granting of exemptions?

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:27.640
Would you-- what would
the reform be for that?

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.480
Would you tip the scales
in the case of disagreement

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.150
or what would you propose?

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.130
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: I think the
appropriate interpretation is

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.990
that a preponderance of
evidence standard applied

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:42.030
to the non-infringement element is

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:45.440
that barring affirmative case
law saying that that activity is

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.890
in fact infringing, that the
tie goes to determination

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:51.200
of non-infringing as
to that element.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.020
Because if the Copyright
Office is wrong,

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.310
rights holders have the ability to
bring a case in court and settle

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.560
that question and thus
close off that exemption

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.580
by finding of infringement.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:03.970
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So I
mean, just to be clear,

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:06.300
it sounds like you're
disagreeing with the outcome

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.650
but perhaps not the process.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:11.370
Is that right or?

00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:14.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: In this particular
example, I'm disagreeing with both.

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:16.830
I think that if the process
had worked appropriately,

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:18.890
that the fact that
there's a disagreement

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:20.870
between the two agencies
and the fact

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:22.410
that there was no affirmative
precedent

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:25.400
that that activity was
infringing should have resulted

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.640
in that element coming out
in favor of an exemption.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.940
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:31.240
Mr. Mohr?

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.560
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: A couple of things.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:37.100
The first thing is that-- sorry.

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:40.660
The first thing is that and I think
it goes, you know, it does go kind

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:45.800
of to this proof question, is-- and
the legislative history is that,

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.130
my friend to my right
must have misspoken

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:52.240
because the statute says nothing
about being affected by TPMs.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.690
That's what it said in
the Commerce Committee.

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.550
It was changed when it
went to the House floor.

00:52:57.550 --> 00:52:59.490
And now, it says prohibition.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:01.690
And in conjunction with
that, that's when--

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:05.460
that was the circumstances
surrounding the issuance

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.250
of the Manager's Report.

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:11.050
Now, it's interesting
that in its submission,

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:15.640
that textual change was something
that was I don't think mentioned

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.410
in the Harvard submission.

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:19.930
And that is a-- in
my mind, at least,

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:22.080
was a fairly significant omission.

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.570
The-- WITH respect to the--

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:30.830
with respect to the influence
of the Manager's Report itself,

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:41.090
I would refer you to Sutherland
on statutory construction, 4814,

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:47.320
which has a nice summary and case
law and so forth, of the statements

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.960
by the managing committee
member and the deference

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.270
that is ordinarily applied.

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.610
Obviously, it's statutory
construction, so that's not,

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:57.160
you know, it's not absolute rules.

00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.790
But the general rule that, in my
mind, the Office properly applied

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:07.260
in this case is contained there
and you may find it useful.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:08.560
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.860
Mr. Turnbull?

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.430
&gt;&gt; Bruce H. Turnbull:
A couple of things.

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:17.430
First, I'm also puzzled on the
statutory background because--

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:20.060
and recognizing that there
were changes made later on.

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:25.080
And it was just mentioned, the
core of sort of what are the--

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.100
what are the-- what are
supposed to be the elements

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:33.180
of the regulatory proceeding came
out of the Commerce Committee.

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.480
And the Commerce Committee--

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.220
I think what Mr. Williams
quoted before was straight

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:40.870
from the Commerce Committee report,
not the statement of managers.

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:44.510
And so, I think the, you
know, the distinct, verifiable

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:50.380
and measurable impacts that the
repeated emphasis in that report

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.490
on the need for evidence is--

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:56.810
that was the Committee
that created the process.

00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:58.620
Now, the process was
changed a bit and moved

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.020
from the Commerce Department
to the librarian

00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.840
and the Copyright Office
and that sort of thing.

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.830
And in that regard, it seems to
me that Congress actually spoke

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:10.550
and said that the Commerce
Department role was to be advisory

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:14.070
and the librarian, upon the
recommendation of the Register

00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:16.580 position:56%
of Copyrights, was to be definitive.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.700
And so, the fact that
NTIA may disagree

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:23.710
about something is not dispositive
of anything other than the fact

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:26.360
that they're an advisor,
not the decision-maker.

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:33.240
And on the-- so yeah, I think that
was the point I wanted to make.

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.540
Thanks.

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:35.840
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.910
Just to-- to Ms. Cox.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:40.380
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: So I just
want to talk a little bit

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:47.000
about the preponderance of the
evidence and what that means

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.700
because in the-- in past
rulemaking cycles, when the groups

00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:55.670
that represented blind
organizations, blind individuals

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:58.240
who wanted an exemption,
they went for it--

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:02.890 position:56%
I think this was the 2006
rulemaking cycle and said, you know,

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:07.190
these are the number of
books that we have looked at

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:10.580
and that we are unable to access
via text-to-speech or, you know,

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.200
transforming into some
accessible format.

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:18.840 position:56%
And the joint reply comments from
rights holders like AAP, MPAA, RIAA,

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:22.260
SIIA and others, Authors Guild,
you know, they basically said

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:27.280
that the submissions did
not give any indication

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.190
that the exemption had already
been used and that it was difficult

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:34.470
to evaluate in the absence of
any evidence about the extent

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:36.560
to which the exemption
had made things better.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.320
And I think that some
of the difficulty

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:43.640
around bringing forward
this evidence and meeting

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.810
that evidence burden
is the confusion

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:48.300
on what evidence is needed.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.450
Like do you need to show that the--

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:52.280
that by preponderance
of the evidence

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.700
that the past exemption
has made things better,

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:58.370
because it's extremely
difficult to get that evidence

00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:01.420
in certain circumstances
such as for the blind.

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:06.310
I think it should be enough to show
that there are a significant number

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:09.300
of literary works out there,
that there are literary works

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.210
that blind people wanted
to be able to access

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:13.080
and they were unable to do so.

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:17.080
So that touches both on what
the evidence standard should be

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:20.490
but also just going back to this
process that it's extremely long

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:22.890
and hard to get all
of the evidence needed

00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:25.660
to put these submissions forward.

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.220
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: And in
the example that you gave

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.710
for assistive technology
for the blind, I mean,

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:34.250 position:56%
this might be something where if you
had a separate or a different track

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:37.010
for renewals, that might
resolve that, correct?

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:39.330
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: Absolutely,
and the Breaking Down Barriers

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:41.850
to Innovation Act would, you know,

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:46.190
grant renewal of these previously
granted exemptions without--

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:48.340
unless there's some showing that
things have changed and I think

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.460 position:56%
that makes a lot of sense and I know
will be discussed in the next panel.

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.370
So I'm going to try to
stay away from that.

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:54.670
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:56.500
I'm going to let Mr. Williams
get a chance to respond

00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:00.120
to the responses to him, so.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.420
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thank you.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:04.970
I'm not going to respond
on everything, just Bruce

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:09.290
and Chris are right
that I quoted both

00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:11.930
from the Commerce Committee Report
and from the Manager's Report.

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:15.470
And I think the Manager's
Report is completely valid

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:16.770
legislative history.

00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:20.100
But even if you don't like that
report because it disagrees

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:23.610
with your position, there are other
reports that take the same position

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.370
as the Manager's Report and
the Office has noted that.

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:32.670
On this issue of likely
non-infringing, it's two issues.

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:36.840 position:56%
One, I've already mentioned, which
I think the modifier in the statute,

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.880
it says likely to be

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:41.810
in the succeeding three-year
period adversely affected.

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:44.810
And then, it doesn't
again say in their ability

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:46.740
to make likely non-infringing uses.

00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:50.520
It says in their ability to
make non-infringing uses.

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:55.410
And, you know, a judge doesn't tell
you this is likely what the law is.

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:57.760
The judge says this
is what the law is.

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.330
And I think that's the standard
that was called for here.

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:02.780
The Office has taken
a different approach.

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:06.970
But I don't think there's anything
for the proponents to criticize

00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:08.910
because the Office is
already interpreting it

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:11.270
to say likely non-infringing.

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:15.780
To take it a whole step further and
say that the copyright owner needs

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:19.630
to come in and show that there
is an adverse judicial precedent

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:23.550
against their position
in order to succeed

00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:28.050
in the rulemaking just
completely upends copyright law

00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:31.910
because the default in section 106
is that if you're making a copy,

00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:33.890
if you're adapting
a work, et cetera,

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:35.370
you're committing an
act of infringement.

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:39.600
You then have an affirmative burden
to prove a defense such as fair use

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.310
or one of the other exceptions.

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:46.520 position:56%
And so, I don't see why the standard
would differ in this context.

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.410
That's all I needed to say.

00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:49.710
Thanks.

00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:51.010
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:52.310
Thank you.

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:53.610
I think we'll call on Professor
Tushnet, then Professor Decherney,

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:55.270
and then move on to a new question.

00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:56.570
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: So, thanks.

00:59:56.570 --> 01:00:00.120
I just want to make a comparison to
the statutory interpretation issue.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:04.130
Consider copyright
preemption in section 301.

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:07.560
So there, the statute was
changed after the report came out.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.840
And courts have again and
again and again agreed

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.160
that the legislation is not helpful

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.390
because of the material
way the statute was changed

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:19.610
between the time the report
came out and its enactment.

01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:22.080
And it's actually exactly
the same here.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.900 position:56%
When you say that Commerce became an
advisor and not the decision-maker,

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.360
it's not a trivial change.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.440
It's actually a complete
change in not only, you know,

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.300
what branch of the government is
making the law, but also, you know,

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:39.200
the fundamental underlying
orientation of the decision-maker

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.810
and what it's trained in doing.

01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:49.090
So I do not think that
reports about the statute

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:51.730
that isn't the statute we have
are actually helpful either way.

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:55.050
I think we end up with
the text of the statute.

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:59.130
And then, also just in terms
of what Mr. Williams just said

01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:00.870
about upending copyright law,

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:04.400
I feel like we spent the last
sessions saying, "But wait,

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.720
you know, this isn't
about copyright law.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.110
This is about access."

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:13.620
So if in fact the question is,
you know, will making access--

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:18.210
or not making access,
getting access allow me

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:22.040
to make a non-infringing use,
there's nothing upending about that

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.470
at all because at least
some of these accesses,

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:28.410
like the ones that my-- that
the people I represent have are

01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:30.300
completely authorized.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.390
You know, they bought the stuff.

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:35.770
They have, you know, they
can play it, you know.

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:40.620 position:56%
And so, I don't think that this is
a question of upending copyright law

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:45.380
when the whole point is this
extends far beyond copyright law.

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.680
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.980
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: Yeah.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.410
Back to the preponderance
of the evidence standard,

01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:52.870
this is about the question
about whether

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:55.050
or not is a measurable
preponderance of the evidence.

01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:57.430
And I think we just want
to acknowledge that often,

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.670
what we're talking about are
things that are not measurable.

01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:02.700
And so, we have anecdotes, but
we're talking about the degree

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.030
to which someone needs one media

01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:07.490
versus another for
the same activity.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.870
We might all agree that
making a remix video

01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:12.480
or noncommercial video
is non-infringing,

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.360
but what is the level
of quality that's needed

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.050
for that non-infringing use.

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:20.670
I'm not always convinced that
it's something we can measure.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.460
It's something we can argue for.

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:25.260
But I don't know that
it's ever measurable,

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.010
except with a lot of anecdotes.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.380
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So a new
question I want to just take

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:35.410
in a different direction is
whether or not the triennial nature

01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:39.460
of the rulemaking is something
that should be reexamined.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:43.210
Is three years too long, too
short, any opinions on that,

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:44.910
is it working for everyone?

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:48.740
Mr. Panjwani?

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.400
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: So
I'm going to go ahead

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.380
and have my cake and eat it too.

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.120
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.420
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: I will point

01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.010
out that it's both too
short and too long.

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:04.530
In the case of advancing or dealing
with advancements in technologies

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:07.460
and new issues, as I mentioned
earlier, someone had brought

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:11.050
up to me the point that, you know,
consumer appliances aren't covered

01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:12.840
and they discovered a
bug and they weren't sure

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.140
if they were legally
allowed to fix the bug

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.260
in this consumer appliance
based on the current rulemaking

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.480
and they'd have to wait for two
years to bring an exemption.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.810
On the flipside of it, as a
proponent, having to come back--

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:26.320
and this again is going
to necessarily came

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.290
to the renewability
discussion in the next panel--

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:33.090
is that three years, you
end up having two years

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:36.070
to use your exemption, one year
to then deal with the cycle.

01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:39.130
And I understand that that places
a similar burden on the Office,

01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:42.470
that every-- one out of every three
years, a large number of staff have

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:44.300
to be devoted to this
one particular project.

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.330
And, you know, I recognize that.

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:51.190
But you know, how you square
that circle, I'll leave that up.

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:54.610
I would point out that it is
both too long and too short,

01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:57.130
depending on the particular
problem you're trying to address.

01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:59.490
So I don't think that there's
a one-size-fits-all necessarily

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:01.340
solution here of a particular term.

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:02.640
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.940
Mr. Williams?

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.240
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thank you.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.550
Yeah. I mean, it's a hard
number to come up with

01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:12.500
if you're looking for
something perfect.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:16.090
But if you're looking for something
that's good that makes sense,

01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:18.170
I think three years
works pretty well.

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:20.240
A lot can change in
that period of time,

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.860
especially in this
current environment

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.900
of rapidly evolving technology.

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.930
But it also doesn't mean that
you're ending the proceeding

01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:33.130
and starting it again the next day.

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:37.380
So I think three years
has worked pretty well.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:44.840
And I wouldn't shorten it certainly
because it really would just mean

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.770
that we are all constantly
working on the proceeding

01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:52.050
and there's no time for the
exemptions to take hold, settle in

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:54.520
and let us look at them and
see how they're working.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.820
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.120
Mr. Mohr?

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.670
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Just the
current statutory term is--

01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:02.940
from our perspective, is fine.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:08.990
And I would just resist the
premise that just simply

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:12.000
because a change has occurred,
that there is some need to tinker

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.460
with the premise of the statute,

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:16.950
because I think that's
lurking a lot behind the scenes

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:18.510
in a lot of these discussions.

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:20.730
There are lot of folks who don't
like the premise of that statute.

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.030
And that's fine.

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:25.260
We do and we think it's
worked exceptionally well.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.340
There is a safety valve
that's this rulemaking

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:30.220
and we think the statutory
term is an appropriate way

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.340
to examine any problems
that might arise.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.640
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.340
Ms. Cox?

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:41.160
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: Once again,
I agree with Mr. Panjwani that,

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.090
you know, it can be both
too long and too short.

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:46.210
But I think a way to
kind of resolve this is

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:47.860
that when there is a need for--

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.400
you could have a shorter period
for a new exemption, for exemptions

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.380
that haven't been considered before
or haven't been granted before

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:58.430
so that you can keep up with
the advances of technology,

01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:00.300
all of these new technologies
where you find

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.840
that you actually do
need a new exemption,

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.020
and it wasn't considered previously

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:09.740
or there wasn't enough evidence
to grant that exemption.

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:15.210
But if you had permanent
exemptions or you had this--

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:18.110
a streamlined process
where you didn't need to go

01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:24.070
through these huge, you know, de
novo proceedings every three years

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:28.570
for educational uses,
for assistive technology,

01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:31.140 position:56%
for persons with visual impairments.

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:33.530
I think that shortening that period

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:36.590
for new exemptions would
make a lot of sense.

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:37.890
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:06:37.890 --> 01:06:39.190
Professor Decherney?

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:40.490
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: Yeah.

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:41.790
So that really sounds
really appealing--

01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:43.090
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can you
turn on your microphone?

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:45.280
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney: That sounds
really appealing if there's--

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.010 position:56%
I don't know what it would look like
but if there's a different timeframe

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:50.540
for new exemptions versus renewals.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:54.770
I just know towards the
end of the last rulemaking,

01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:58.330
bibliographic scholars came
to me with a great problem.

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:00.070
And I said, you know, I'm
sorry, it's actually four years

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:01.700
until we can-- till
that can be addressed.

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.090
But it's an important one.

01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:05.380
And in an educational context,
that can be a long time.

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:07.920
You know, it's the entire
education of a lawyer, right?

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.370
Three years, or at least
the school education.

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:14.640
Yeah, so if I can just suggest
something that's really,

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.360
really practical, but I think
would be helpful, is to recognize

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.980
that it's law school
clinics which do a lot

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.560
of the representation
for the proponents.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.100
And if there were just ways of
thinking about that calendar,

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.910
the academic calendar in the
context of the rulemaking,

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:29.450
I think would really help.

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:31.820
You know, many, many
times I've had--

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.830
I work with the American
University Law Clinic.

01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:37.020 position:56%
But then, the questions we get
after the hearing or some other part

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.030
of it falls outside of
the academic calendar,

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:40.790
and that complicates things.

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.090
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Yeah.

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:43.390
And that actually was the
next line of questioning.

01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:45.130
I wanted to bring up and open it
to everyone what are, you know,

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:47.390
sort of if we stay
within this sandbox,

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:50.420
we've obviously talked about, you
know, ways to change the sandbox.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.860
If we stay within the sandbox, what
are reforms that the Office can do

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.800
to make the process work better?

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:59.770
Believe it or not, we tried to be
cognizant of the academic calendar.

01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:03.040
But academies are not
always on the same schedule.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.820
But so how would it work
for law clinics' schedules?

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.610
What about issuing
post-hearing letters?

01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:11.350
Are the hearings themselves
that we conduct helpful?

01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:12.880
Should there be in more cities?

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.060
Should it be handled differently

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.440
because it creates travel
expenses, et cetera?

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.100
So if you-- if you I
think originally, we--

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:23.180
last rulemaking, we
started it in July was

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.310
when the petitions were due.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:26.610
And then-- is that right?

01:08:26.610 --> 01:08:29.580
And then-- or at least if you
wanted to suggest a timing

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.280
that you think would work
with the academic calendar,

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.750
we would be grateful.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:35.050
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney:
Sorry, just anecdotally?

01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:36.570
So if this were one week earlier,

01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:38.770
the AU students would
have been in session.

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:40.070
But now they're not.

01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:42.370
They're still helping with--

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:44.790
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Right.

01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:46.090
Mr. Williams?

01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:47.390
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Sure.

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.300
So I think there were
kind of two parts to that.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:54.480
First, on the academic calendar,
I think it would be great

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.070 position:56%
if the hearings could take place
when the students who worked so hard

01:08:58.070 --> 01:09:02.140
on this hearing could
appear and make their case.

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:06.740
I know we've heard a good bit today
about how burdensome the process is

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:09.240
and I don't mean to
make light of the amount

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.540
of work that goes into it.

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.060
But I think it's fantastic
that a lot

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.730
of really great young
copyright lawyers are getting

01:09:15.730 --> 01:09:19.350 position:56%
to sink their teeth into this during
law school and if they got to show

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:24.300
up and do some oral advocacy at
the hearing that would be great.

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.620
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: And would that be
spring or would that be summer?

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.430
I mean, even more specific--
practically, what does that mean?

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:32.410
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Sure.

01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:37.520
I think the problem now and I'm not
currently teaching, although I have

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.220
in the past, is that
the hearings come just

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:44.390
after the students have left for
the year I think is the problem.

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:50.020
But I'll let the professors
speak to that.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:54.310
The other issue that I think you
raised is, are there any other ways

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:57.680
to improve either the
hearings or the process

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.290
through post-hearing letters.

01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:04.240 position:56%
And I mentioned earlier we'd love to
see some kind of drafting approaches

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.540
at the end of the process.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:09.720
And in the past, when I've
raised that, I've been told

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.610
that there's just no time.

01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:13.890
And I do understand
that's a real concern.

01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:16.440
But I think, given there
is already a period

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.810
for post-hearing letters
built into the process,

01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:24.380
that if the drafting issues
were just presented to hearing,

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:29.310
people who appeared at the hearing,
it could fit into that window,

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:32.340
we could have a chance to
give you some feedback.

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:34.730
And I think that would
be really helpful.

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:38.460
And then, on the hearings, I think
they are often very, very helpful

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:42.160
and I think they really
run quite well.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:47.710
One issue that we do run into is,
as we've said in our comments,

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:51.640
if we're preparing a fact witness
to come in and give testimony

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:55.900
on one issue but it relates
to, you know, every way really

01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:00.050
that a movie studio uses access
controls on their content.

01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:04.070
It's relevant across all
of the different proposals.

01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:08.390
And so, last cycle, I think in
an admirable attempt to kind

01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:13.200
of make sure that each proposal
was its own record, it was unclear

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.620 position:56%
to us whether the Office could look
at the testimony from this proposal,

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:20.020
the hearing from that
proposal and then use it

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.790
when considering a
different proposal.

01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:26.830
And I think that harm goes both
to our side and the other side

01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:29.550
where the proponents
shouldn't necessarily have

01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:32.260
to have the same person who
might be a small business owner

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:35.470
or whatever else show
up at multiple hearings.

01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:38.530
So I think that would be a
helpful change across the board.

01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:42.330
And then, just a little
bit of additional clarity

01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:46.400
on exactly what type of evidence
can be presented for the first time

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:52.980
at a hearing, I've never quite
understood what the rule there is.

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.770
And it would be helpful
to clarify it I think

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:59.390 position:56%
because sometimes during a hearing,
a witness will pull out their laptop

01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:01.320
and say, well, I'm
looking at this new website

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.390
and isn't this a great
piece of information.

01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:06.070
Other times, it's been a little
more like, well, if you didn't put

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:09.670
that in your comments, you
shouldn't be bringing it to us now.

01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:12.800
I think both approaches
have ups and downs to them,

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.460
but it would be helpful to
know just which rule applies.

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.760
Thanks.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.060
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.360
Professor Tushnet?

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.970
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Tushnet: So
I would again in terms

01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:27.940
of how you can make this better
within the current sandbox,

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.010
again point you to the
Cyberlaw Clinic's suggestions,

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:31.310
which I think are quite detailed.

01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:35.860
I also want to pick up on something
that came up in the first panel,

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:39.060
again talking about
how access is special.

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:42.780
So I think we have to
recognize that at this point,

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:45.320
access and rights controls
have been merged

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:49.760
by actors making strategic use
of 1201 so that the balance

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.310
that Congress did intend
in distinguishing access

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:55.070
from rights controls is now gone.

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.060
So remixers, for example,

01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.130
and educators have
lawful, paid-for access.

01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:03.750
What they need is the ability
to make their fair uses.

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:07.110
And the problem of the
merged access rights control,

01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:09.440
which the Copyright Office
has repeatedly acknowledged

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.820
in these proceedings, you
actually could recognize

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:15.040
that as another factor.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.690
So in the statute, it says other
factors that can be considered.

01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:24.030
The deliberate merging of a rights
and access control should count

01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:26.720
as another factor justifying
exemption.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.480
And this would work both within the
traditional copyright categories

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.780
and outside them.

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.760
And I will point out
just here, you know,

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.350
Congress was envisioning
perhaps the celestial jukebox.

01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:39.110
It was definitely not
envisioning the celestial fridge

01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:42.870
or the celestial tractor.

01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:44.170
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:45.470
Ms. Greene?

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:50.720
&gt;&gt; Robyn Greene: So one suggestion
that we have at OTI that might help

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.160
to make the rulemaking a little
bit more accessible would be

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.230
to create a process
whereby proponents

01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:58.530
of exemptions would be able

01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:01.190
to submit confidential
versions of their comments.

01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:05.070
Oftentimes, particularly in the
context of security research

01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:11.150
but also in the context of other
proponents seeking exemptions,

01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:14.120
the proponents of the exemptions
will withhold certain critical

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.740
information because they
either fear legal liability,

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.450 position:56%
they fear that they may be divulging
confidential business information

01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:23.670
or, as is the case
with security research.

01:14:23.670 --> 01:14:27.710 position:56%
They fear that they may be divulging
information that could lead others

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:30.850
to identify and then
exploit vulnerabilities.

01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:34.360
And so, by instituting a process

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:37.360
that would enable confidential
versions of comments

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:43.400
to be submitted, it would not only
make that process more accessible

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.410
and ensure that the Copyright
Office had all of the evidence

01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:48.790
that they needed to make
a complete decision,

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:51.820
it would also institute a
process that's in fact in keeping

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:55.220
with other federal
agencies such as the FCC.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:58.270
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: And so,
would your proposal be

01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:01.970
that confidential information
was entirely just delivered

01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:06.110
to the Office or would, you know,
sometimes you'll see dual versions.

01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:08.090
You'll have the public version
and the private version.

01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:10.860
The public version may
describe in broad terms

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:13.560
but not disclose specifics, or how
would you envision that working?

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.860
&gt;&gt; Robyn Greene: Yeah.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.190
I think that it's important for
there to be full public discussion

01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:21.470
about sort of the broad parameters
of what some of this type

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:24.170
of confidential information
would touch upon.

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:28.190 position:56%
But in order to really respect the
need to maintain certain information

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:32.190
as confidentiality, you would
have sort of that public version

01:15:32.190 --> 01:15:36.550
that might be more general and
then the very specific confidential

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:40.180
version that could be submitted
directly to the Copyright Office.

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.480
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.780
Mr. Turnbull?

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:44.080
&gt;&gt; Bruce H. Turnbull: Yeah.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.380
I wanted to comment
on a couple of points.

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:48.500
One, on this last one, on the
confidentiality submission,

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:51.290
I don't think we'd have
any problem with that.

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:57.010
We would want to urge the Office
to institute something that's done

01:15:57.010 --> 01:15:59.850 position:56%
in other agencies, an administrative
protective order or something

01:15:59.850 --> 01:16:02.990
so that counsel and
potentially expert witnesses

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:07.440
for the other side could get
access to the confidential version.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.460
But again, it's done in
recognition of the kinds

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:12.820
of concerns that were expressed.

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:16.410
So it doesn't sort of
expose it to the public.

01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:21.260
But it does allow a response,
potentially confidential, as well

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:23.830
and there are a number
of precedents for that.

01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:27.640
In my former life, I was a trade
lawyer and that happened regularly.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.690
I did want to comment and if
you're going to get to this later,

01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:34.530
I'll hold, but on the access point

01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:37.260
that Professor Tushnet has
made a couple of times--

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.560
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Sure.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.860
Go ahead.

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.160
&gt;&gt; Bruce H. Turnbull: A
couple of things about that.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.180
First, the access that is granted,
for example, thinking of DVD

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:51.390
or in a Blu-Ray context, is to that
content in a particular context,

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:54.370
in a particular form,
in a particular format

01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:57.400
and under the rules of the
system that are operated.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:00.020
So although the content
is, if you will,

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:02.900
in the clear when it's
presented on the television set,

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:07.340
it is not in the clear in
a usable way in the system

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:09.600
that it is made available to.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:15.810 position:56%
So to say that, oh, we own it and
we have access to it is correct only

01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:20.160
in the sense that it's
visually accessible.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.990
And if you want to use
a camcorder or something

01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:25.860 position:56%
at the television screen, go for it.

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:27.160
But that doesn't--

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.460
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:33.640
In the-- in a couple
of the prior panels,

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:39.930
that was used as an alternative
for the particular proposals

01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:47.920 position:56%
that were made and we represented
for the fair uses that were alleged.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.640
But that's-- so that's one point.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.600
So the access that's granted
is not-- is not generic.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.420
It is particular.

01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:03.590
The second point is that
in the statutory structure,

01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:09.810 position:56%
it's clear that Congress
contemplated this rulemaking to deal

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:13.380
with the uses of the content once--

01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:16.160
in the context of the
access control.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.300 position:56%
I mean, that's why the rulemaking is

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:22.790
in the 1201(a) context
and not in 1201(b).

01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:28.960
And so, the-- it seems to me that
the comments that were submitted

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:33.930
and you may hear more about in San
Francisco, but are raised, I think,

01:18:33.930 --> 01:18:37.260
in Professor Tushnet's
comments, are--

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:41.560
mischaracterize the
nature of this proceeding.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:47.990
This proceeding is about uses and
in the context of access control.

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:50.590
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Matt Williams?

01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:53.360
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thank
you, excuse me.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.830
Thank you.

01:18:54.830 --> 01:19:02.060
I agree completely with what Bruce
just said and I think it's wrong

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:05.150
to think that Congress
did not anticipate

01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:10.290 position:56%
that some TPMs would constitute both
access controls and copy controls.

01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:14.440
And that's why we're here
for these proceedings.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.100
But Congress did not
conclude that in every case,

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.920
that means that an
exemption should result.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.600
Congress created the proceeding to
say that if there is an instance

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.010
where something is both an
access control and a use control

01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:32.090
and a question is raised about
whether that inhibits a lawful use,

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:34.930
you go through the process
that's laid out in the statute.

01:19:34.930 --> 01:19:36.230
You apply the factors.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:39.360
You see if there are available
alternatives, et cetera.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.920
And so, I think it's a bit of a
red herring to say that some merger

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.140
of access controls and use
controls has created problems

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:48.440
that were unanticipated.

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.740
I think they were anticipated

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:52.340
and that's what the
proceeding was created to do.

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:57.340
I also, like Bruce, would not have
a problem with the confidentiality.

01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:01.730
I think we might also at times
benefit from filing some things

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:04.040
that we'd like to keep
out of the public eye.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:07.520
But I would also urge that counsel

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.140
and maybe even certain
in-house counsel be allowed

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:11.690
to see the submissions.

01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:12.990
Thank you.

01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:14.290
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: I will say
on the confidentiality,

01:20:14.290 --> 01:20:15.740
that's something we're
certainly going to take a look

01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:18.420
at in the study, especially since
it seems there's not an objection

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:19.720
to it.

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.020
But one thing I will say on behalf

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:24.060
of the Copyright Office is the
three-year rulemaking is a much

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.810
quicker pace than what some of
the other federal agencies do.

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:29.760
So we would want to avoid
recommending some change

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.710
that would cause a year of
fighting over the protective order.

01:20:32.710 --> 01:20:39.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: I'd just like to
switch gears and raise another topic

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:43.950
that was the subject of a lot
of discussion in the comments.

01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:48.920
And that's the statutory language
referring to such other factors

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:53.970
as the librarian may wish
to consider and the role

01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:59.030
of non-copyright issues
as part of the rulemaking.

01:20:59.030 --> 01:21:03.150
You know, we heard from
several commenters arguing

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:08.090
that the Copyright Office should
not properly consider these types

01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:10.870
of issues and should leave
them to other agencies.

01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:15.880 position:56%
I think-- and we also had some
discussion about sort of the process

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:19.740
that that should involve,
whether it's within our authority

01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:23.390
to affirmatively reach out
to other agencies or whether

01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:30.450
under the statutory language we're
limited to consulting with NTIA.

01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:34.610
So we'd appreciate
your views on sort of--

01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:39.740
on the proper role of other
agencies and how we should go

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:44.620
about consulting with them on
issues within their jurisdiction.

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:45.920
Mr. Mohr?

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.190
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Again, I
would go back to the concept

01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:54.040
of the administrative
record and the breadth.

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.080
And I think that so
long as the things

01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:00.150
on which you rely are
publicly disclosed,

01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:04.670
I think you have a
fair amount of leeway

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:07.620
to amass information
from different sources.

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:11.950
But when you issue the rule, you
have to explain, yes, we saw this

01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:14.770 position:56%
and I think there probably has to be
some opportunity for public comment

01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:16.450
on whatever was received.

01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:21.200
But outside of that, I think that
was exactly the right approach was

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.970
to get information from
people who are experts

01:22:24.970 --> 01:22:28.740
in particular subject matter that
the Copyright Office is not and,

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.360
you know, weigh their views,

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:34.050
even if you didn't completely
agree with them all the time.

01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:36.730
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Mr. Panjwani?

01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:42.660
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: It's been our
perspective that the other factors

01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:47.780
that the librarian shall consider
factor is directed at the fact

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:52.020
that the proponents of an exemption
must prove something beyond

01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:54.950
copyright itself, which
would be non-infringement,

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:58.940
in order to justify adverse effects
and that allows the librarian

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:03.560
to consider additional harms
experienced by proponents

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.610
in determining whether or not
an exemption is warranted.

01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:09.610
In the last proceeding, we had of
course this interagency process

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:11.670
and it's consideration
of many other factors,

01:23:11.670 --> 01:23:16.590
and it's been our perspective
that this is not really necessary

01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:19.510
in the process of determining
whether an exemption is warranted.

01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:22.950
This is a question of whether
copyright liability will attach

01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:24.860
for certain activity.

01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:28.610
And I don't think that, you know,

01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:31.180
the technological protection
measures were considered

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:35.440
as a policy panacea for any
consideration under the sun,

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.500
whether that be product safety,
whether that be emissions,

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.230
whether that be medical devices.

01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:45.970
I think there's often a conflation
of, you know, there's software

01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:47.660
in here that implicates copyright.

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:49.250
Therefore, there's
something different now,

01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:51.190
whereas a lot of these
devices have existed

01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:54.910
and these concerns have existed
in the mechanical, non-software,

01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:57.670
non-copyright-implicating way.

01:23:57.670 --> 01:24:01.590
And law and policy has developed to
address those issues historically.

01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:04.970
I think the car example is a
great one in which, you know,

01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:07.230
there's concerns about, will
people could modify the software

01:24:07.230 --> 01:24:10.070
on their car to allow them to
violate emissions standards.

01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:12.300
People have been modifying
their cars for a century,

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.660 position:56%
for as long as there have been cars.

01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:16.560
And there have been
rules against that.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.410
We have annual inspections
of cars to check

01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:20.710
for emissions and things like that.

01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:24.030
I think most areas of law have
already responded to the concerns

01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:26.200
that we have brought up in a while.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.670
I admire the Copyright Office
for thinking afar and realizing

01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:33.310
that a lot of these things are
implicated by software now,

01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:35.850
I don't think that this
proceeding is the appropriate venue

01:24:35.850 --> 01:24:37.240
for addressing those concerns.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.280
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So just to be
clear, taking the last rulemaking

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:43.570
as an example, we got a
petition that referenced--

01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:45.690
I think this was sort of more
broadly to the internet of things

01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:49.970
and it wasn't a lot of specifics
as to what they wanted to do,

01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:53.280
but examples of I'd like
to hack the subway system,

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.940
I'd like to hack the nuclear power
grid, I'd like to hack automobiles.

01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:00.590
I mean, should the Copyright
Office entirely ignore whether

01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:03.410
or not there is a potential
public safety concern?

01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:05.840
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: I believe hackers
will hackers will hack those things

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.580
if they are malicious,
regardless of whether

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:10.000
or not there's a 1201
exemption for it.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.300
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Sure.

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:14.470
Mr. Williams.

01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:15.770
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thanks.

01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:20.480
I just quickly wanted to reiterate
what Allan Adler and Troy Dow said

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:26.500
in the last panel, that you have
to be really, really careful

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:31.020
about what constitutes a
core copyright concern.

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:35.950
That term, it would have to
be very carefully defined

01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:45.070
to have any real benefit and
that there is this distinction,

01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:47.810
as Professor Tushnet articulated,

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.030
between access controls
and copy controls.

01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:54.280
And it's clear that Congress did
intend to protect access controls

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.430
for their own purpose
as access controls

01:25:57.430 --> 01:26:01.370
to prevent unauthorized access
to works that are available

01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:06.100
for subscription or
on-demand availability.

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:10.870
And one fact pattern that I
think demonstrates the importance

01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:15.880
of that clearly is if you've
got a work that is available

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.700
and it's protected by an access
control and it's also protected

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:21.430
by a completely separate
copy control,

01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:24.840
if you were to hack the
access control and gain copy--

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.580
and gain access to the copy,
you could watch the movie,

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.860
you could listen to the song,
you could read the book.

01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:31.670
If the copy control
remained in place,

01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:36.460
theoretically there's no nexus
to even a possible infringement.

01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:38.380
And then, there would
be no violation.

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:41.800
I think Congress clearly
intended to prohibit that conduct.

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.180
So I'd just urge you
to be careful not

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:48.680
to undo the current statutory
construction if you start thinking

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:53.970
about ways to address so-called
not core copyright issues.

01:26:53.970 --> 01:26:55.270
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:56.570
Thank you.

01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:57.870
I think we have about
two more minutes.

01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:59.170
So this will be sort of last call.

01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:01.150
Professor Decherney?

01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:02.450
&gt;&gt; Peter Decherney:
Really quick point.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.890
The one that was made in
the last panel is that all

01:27:04.890 --> 01:27:07.760
of these determinations
often will cut both ways.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.910
When talking about public health,

01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:12.440
we thought that hacking your
own devices was the issue

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.350
about public health during one
of the hearings last round.

01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:18.030
And it turned out later we found
out right briefly afterward,

01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:20.860
that actually it was the
companies that made the cars

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.790
that may have been
causing the public health

01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:25.040
by not allowing hacking.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.140
The same thing's true
about fair use.

01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:28.860
We always think commerce is going

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.630
to favor the people
that want stronger TPMs.

01:27:31.630 --> 01:27:34.370
But actually, there's a tremendous
amount of commerce which is enabled

01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:39.800
by fair use and hacking T
forever, bypassing TPMs, yeah.

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.100
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:42.400
Mr. Turnbull?

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.700
&gt;&gt; Bruce H. Turnbull: Yeah,
I just wanted to say quickly

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:49.150
that as the representative of
two of the TPMs in wide use,

01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:52.680
our interests-- and I think the
Copyright Office has taken those

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.110
into account under
this other factor--

01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:59.200
have to do with the integrity
of our licensing system,

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.920
which is not necessarily copyright,

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:05.780
whether the particular thing
is a copyright infringement

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.270
or fair use or whatever it is.

01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:12.590 position:56%
It has to do with whether the
overall system can continue to exist

01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:17.170
and the benefits from that
are to the copyright system

01:28:17.170 --> 01:28:19.310
and the user-- using
public as a whole.

01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:25.710 position:56%
And so, as a more generic point, I'd
say that as you address the things

01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:29.260
which are sometimes
called not core copyright,

01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:32.760
you need to be really
careful because, again,

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.820
sort of eliminating other factors
would potentially eliminate things

01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:39.300
that we think are important
for you to consider

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:43.960
in the context of expressive works.

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.260
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:46.560
Mr. Panjwani?

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.810
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: I just wanted to
return very quickly to something

01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:50.900
that Ms. Greene and
Mr. Mohr were talking

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.290
about earlier regarding
the importance of the role

01:28:53.290 --> 01:28:55.980
of legislative history has played
in the interpretation of how we go

01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:59.020
about this rulemaking,
which is that--

01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.300
well Mr. Mohr is correct that
there are certain approaches

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:04.020 position:56%
for interpreting legislative history
more generally, in the specific case

01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:06.770
of the House manager's
report for the DMCA,

01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:12.220
there have been specific criticisms
as to how or what value it adds

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:13.750
to the interpretation of the law.

01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:15.720
Her use of the word substantive
I think was a reference

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.980
to the substantive diminution
language from that report.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.410
And in particular, I would just
point out that Professor Nimmer,

01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:26.060
in his law review article
generally on the importance

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:29.490
of legislative history, taking
the DMCA as an important case,

01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:32.010
specifically calls out the
Manager's Report as a report

01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:35.200 position:56%
that does actually offer very little
from his perspective in terms of how

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:39.370
to appropriately interpret
section 1201.

01:29:39.370 --> 01:29:40.670
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

01:29:40.670 --> 01:29:41.970
Thank you.

01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:43.270
I think with that, we're concluded.

01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:45.130
We'll take a break for lunch and
come back at 1:30 for panel three.

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:46.660
Thank you very much.

01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:50.530
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
