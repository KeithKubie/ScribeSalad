00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.000
The World Health
Organization, WHO for short,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.820
is the authority for health
within the United Nations

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.000
system.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.330
It is responsible for providing
leadership on global health

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.460
matters, shaping the
health research agenda,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.960
setting norms and
standards, articulating

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.540
evidence-based policy options,
providing technical support

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.710
to countries, and monitoring
and assessing health trends.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.820
WHO communicates information
about global health in order

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.430
to inform citizens, donors,
policymakers, and organizations

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.850
around the world.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.150
Their primary publication
is World Health Report.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.190
Each issue focuses on a specific
aspect of global health,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.770
and includes statistics
and experts' assessments.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.660
WHO also maintains an
open, online repository

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.010
of global health data.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.810
WHO provides some
data visualizations,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.620
which helps them
communicate more

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.310
effectively with the public.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.690
As an example, the graph shows
the World Energy Consumption

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.120
during 2001 to 2003.
