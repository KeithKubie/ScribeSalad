You've probably heard people say that if
your mother's father was bald you're more

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.410
likely lose those beautiful locks of
hair down the road.  But what truth is there

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.059
to this?  It turns out that one of the major
contributors to hair loss is sex linked.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.140
Humans have forty-six chromosomes of
DNA, of which two help determine your

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.970
sex, the "X" and the "Y" chromosome.  If you're
a female you have two "X" chromosomes, but

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.140
if you're a male you have an "X" and a "Y" chromosome.  Studies show that the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.529
most influential hair-loss gene is
located on the "X" chromosome only. What

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.650
does this mean?  Well if you're a male you get an "X" chromosome from your mother, but must

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.910
receive a "Y" chromosome from your
father.  Because if you got your father's

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.450
"X" chromosome you would be a female. So if one of your mothers "X" chromosomes has this hair loss

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.110
gene

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.199
you have a 50/50 chance of getting it from her.  In this way, hair loss is

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.789
partially hereditary and passed through the
maternal side for males.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.929
Females, on the other hand must get two
copies of this gene, one on each "X"

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.119
chromosome in order to physically
express it.  So if your mother does

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.899
express these traits it means you will
be passing an affected "X" chromosome to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:01.540
you.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.070
But why do we say to look at your
mother's father? Well, if he has visible

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.180
male pattern baldness then your mother
has at least one copy of the affected "X"

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.720
chromosome from him, because in order to
have a daughter he must have passed on

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.680
his "X" chromosome, not his "Y".  The thing
to note here is that this is just one of

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.350
the contributors to hair-loss and while its thought to be the most significant, many

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.970
studies have found other hair linked
genes which aren't sex linked at all.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.909
Including some on the "Y" chromosome,

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.619
meaning they can be transferred from
both the mother and the father.  

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.009
On top of this, some studies have shown
correlations between age, exercise

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.689
nutrition and even stress levels.  So
while a quick check of your mom's dad's

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.319
hair maybe an indicator for future hair
loss, a head full of hair on Grandpa's head

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.660
does not guarantee you are in the clear.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.060
