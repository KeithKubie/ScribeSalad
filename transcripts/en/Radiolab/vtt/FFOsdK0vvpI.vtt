00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.680
Hello, this is Lynne. Someone on the other side of this. Hey [inaudible].

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.790
So a couple months ago, our producer Lynn Levy,

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.390
did an interview with this woman. Yeah, her name is Margaret. Love it. Yes.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.840
And this was Margaret's first time doing a radio interview.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.960
Magic voice. This is so fun.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.760
But this was definitely not her first time talking into a microphone. One, two,

7
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:27.630
three, four. This is the yellow mine. Two, three, four.

8
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.900
This is the orange mark almost exactly right.

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.100
<v 1>50 years ago. The following recording was made on November,</v>

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.400
1919 64 at 2100 hours.

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.880
Margaret was at the center of this amazing, weird experiment.

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.370
Yeah. Who were you at bedtime like? What were you like? Well,

13
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.730
I've always had a bit of, if everybody's going left, I'll go right.

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.610
She Tried College for Awhile, Tulane University for a year,

15
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.030
but she dropped out and I was 20 or 19 or something at that point and moved to

16
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.680
St Thomas in the Caribbean. Had never been turned Ireland,

17
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.190
got a job at this hotel, did menus, checked people in and out.

18
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.610
And one day she hears about the strange research facility on the other side of

19
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:10.860
the island. And I thought, I wonder what that is about.

20
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:12.660
And I asked a few people and they said, oh no, no,

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.130
<v 0>they don't like people there can't go there. And I was told not to go there.</v>

22
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:18.120
So I went there

23
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.510
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

24
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.360
<v 0>and that's how it all started.</v>

25
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.270
<v 1>That's how we're going to start this show. I'm Jad Abumrad.</v>

26
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.370
I'm Robert Krulwich today on radio lab,

27
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.090
a producer Lynn Levy brings us a couple of close encounters.

28
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.440
Although not with aliens. No, it's not.

29
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.350
It's not an outer space cause it's much closer to home in this case.

30
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.360
Although they are kind of alien like yes, but alien life, uh, not Lynne,

31
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.090
a dolphin that's shows about dolphins.

32
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.100
<v 0>Hey, we're calling this hour. Hello.</v>

33
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.010
So when Margaret got to this mysterious place,

34
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.920
there were dolphins there and uh, the,

35
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.980
what happened was she ended up becoming roommates with a dolphin.

36
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.640
Do you mean in the like Bed-Stuy one bedroom apartment sense? Sort of. Yeah.

37
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:04.450
She did end up living with a dolphin for,

38
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:06.710
for many months in this,

39
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.750
apart by a department partner,

40
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.170
had a little desk,

41
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.100
had a little kitchen area with a stove and it was a little tube burner stove or

42
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.260
something and a pot and a tea kettle.

43
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.770
But the thing that's a little bit weird about the apartment is that whole

44
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:22.510
apartment,

45
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.800
<v 1>it was filled with water was completely fill in. Well I wasn't a submerge,</v>

46
00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:30.020
but I was in water up mid thighs, sort of is flooded

47
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.930
<v 0>with water just about there so she could share it with this dolphin.</v>

48
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.860
A young male, Peter, Peter.

49
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.850
Peter was a 10 foot long bottlenose dolphin, young adolescent male.

50
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.630
And he lived there with Margaret and like he would, um, you know,

51
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.870
he could like swim under the desk and uh, there was a balcony,

52
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.830
like swim out onto the balcony and balcony was flooded to the balcony was also

53
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:54.350
flooded. Yeah, it's really cool. And what was the idea? I mean,

54
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:58.820
to try and study the dolphin to study the dolphin, um, first of all,

55
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.010
and take a lot of notes, extensive notes. Did you have waterproof paper? No,

56
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.160
I had a typewriter on this board hanging from the ceiling or they also had

57
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:11.530
microphones everywhere. And specifically the tasks she was given.

58
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.940
I was to teach Peter to speak English.

59
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.150
I she was supposed to teach the dolphin English. Yup.

60
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.140
Really? Well, I mean this was John Lilly's project.

61
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.190
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

62
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.300
<v 0>just for some context,</v>

63
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.360
you know how people get all like a little bit crazy these days about dolphins.

64
00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:34.111
They have like, you know,

65
00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:37.230
shirts with dolphins and necklaces with dolphins and everybody has like dolphin

66
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:39.210
hairbands, dolphin, black light posters, right.

67
00:03:39.211 --> 00:03:43.590
So this all kind of sort of comes from this Guy John Lilly,

68
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.920
who was a a scientist, a researcher starting in the forties

69
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.060
<v 4>total rights stuff, physics major kind of guy out of cal tech,</v>

70
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.520
<v 0>a man's man. According to Grand Burnett, I'm a historian of science.</v>

71
00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:59.240
But then according to Graham, John Lilly has this epiphany

72
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.040
<v 4>during the second world war.</v>

73
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.600
<v 0>At the time people just weren't thinking that much about dolphins in general.</v>

74
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:10.930
Like there was not this idea that they were sort of extraordinary beings.

75
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:14.620
They were just like big dumb fish, know they were shot for sport.

76
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.580
So John Lilly is doing this, um,

77
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.880
research about brain mapping and he ends up working with dolphins.

78
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.200
And one the,

79
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:28.201
the story that he's told goes that he was experimenting on these dolphins and as

80
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:33.580
he's working with them, you know, kind of like shoving things into their brains.

81
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.190
They make noises as would anyone.

82
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.000
And when he listens back to the noises which he's recorded,

83
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.330
it sounds to him like the dolphins are trying to speak to him to say something

84
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:50.500
to him in not in a non, in a dolphin any way,

85
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.330
but in a human way. Like trying to speak English to him. Really. Yeah.

86
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.760
What did he say the Dolphin was trying to say to him?

87
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.530
I don't think that we know that,

88
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.650
but it sounded to him enough like human speech that he,

89
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:07.990
he thought like something's going on here. This is important.

90
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.690
According to Graham, he's said later that it made him realize like women, not

91
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.850
<v 4>the only intelligent organisms out there,</v>

92
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.710
like we have company that maybe humans are what happens when high intelligence

93
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:25.711
evolves in an animal that also has hands and dolphins are what happens when

94
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.680
comparably if not still more extravagant intelligence evolves in an animal

95
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.010
without hands. What do hands get you? Well,

96
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.700
hands basically get you an appetite for uh, punching people in the head.

97
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.570
Know it, it makes us tool users, but the distance between, uh,

98
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.130
you know, the hammer that you use to uh,

99
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.020
knock open your coconut and the hammer that you use to knock open the head of

100
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.710
that other cro-magnon you were never that keen on is um, in fact, zilch.

101
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.640
There's no difference at all.

102
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.900
<v 5>By the time you get to the 60s with, you know, like peace and love.</v>

103
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.960
<v 4>It was exciting to think that the dolphins and the whales have these huge</v>

104
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:10.780
brains, but they don't, like, they're not after anything.

105
00:06:10.781 --> 00:06:13.180
They're not doing anything with it. They're not trying to hurt anybody.

106
00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:16.460
They're not building cities. They're just being,

107
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.223
<v 1>and keep in mind,</v>

108
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.800
this is on the verge of the Vietnam War where you have all this anxiety about to

109
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.710
the overpopulation, environmental destruction.

110
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.500
What have they done to our system?

111
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.580
So very quickly the dolphins become like this vision.

112
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.050
<v 4>We might ourselves be so different than we'd come to feel we were tragically.</v>

113
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.453
Does that make sense?

114
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.520
<v 5>So John Lily was one of the first people to get swept up in all this.</v>

115
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:50.960
He quits his government job, moves to the Caribbean and sets up this lab,

116
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.920
John Lily's communication research institute to try to talk to dolphins,

117
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.990
which is where Margaret ended up. And my feeling was this or that.

118
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.950
Everybody was talking about how bright they were and how smart they were.

119
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:04.220
And it was often Stauffers dolphins. And then it was, it was the hot topic.

120
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.290
And yet every day everybody at that building would get in their car and go home.

121
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.690
Yeah, on a foot. What is that? So she volunteered to stay. Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.990
Her bed was on this kind of wooden platform. In the middle of the apartment,

123
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.360
I was maybe two and a half,

124
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:25.361
three inches above the water and Peter was right there and Peter could flip me a

125
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.570
little water and wake me up at any point. And that was the whole point of it.

126
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:32.810
I mean, this wasn't just sleep all night and then, excuse me,

127
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.050
work in the day and then sleep again all night and then do some work in the day.

128
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:39.770
I might as well go home. Yeah. So I eventually, um,

129
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.200
I didn't really shave my head, but I buzzed it,

130
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.280
whatever it's called now really close because any, you know,

131
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.760
the hair getting wet thing in the middle of the night was very annoying. Yeah,

132
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.060
of course. So I just got rid of her hair and that was helpful.

133
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:56.390
And then when Peter would come and squirt some water or want to play or throw

134
00:07:56.391 --> 00:07:57.224
something at me,

135
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.500
then I could just roll off this elevator into the water and be with him and do

136
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:04.190
whatever she says. He was fascinated by the things she brought with her,

137
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.260
a piece of cloth, a teabag. Teabag was a fascinating thing.

138
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.113
I drank,

139
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:15.190
I drink tea and the tea bag would fall into the water and he would come and get

140
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:19.780
it. And Sonar it a,

141
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.070
this creaking noise they make on their sonar.

142
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.180
You need look at it and take the string over his beak and sort of whim around

143
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.030
very proudly with this teabag.

144
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.390
And then he'd throw it up against the wall and it would stick.

145
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.800
And then he'd squirt water on it and it would come back down into the water and

146
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.630
he would play with his teabag. Eventually,

147
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:42.140
of course he would bite it is very sharp teeth. Yeah. And it would break.

148
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.860
And that was a very exciting thing when the teabag finally broke open,

149
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.190
it had babies, as it were,

150
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.890
zillions of tea leaves floating around and he was sonar them all and want to

151
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.570
count every single one of them.

152
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.393
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

153
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.090
<v 5>and what did you think you would find out? I didn't know.</v>

154
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.410
You know,

155
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:08.410
I was not coming out at this from a science point of view that that's not what I

156
00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:13.370
was bringing to the table. Yeah. I just, I just, I just, I had no idea. I,

157
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.720
I was, uh, programmed by, by John to work on the speech,

158
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.130
a I all, he had sort of declared that,

159
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.550
that they could probably speak

160
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.673
<v 7>hi.</v>

161
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.290
<v 5>Look when, when you're trying to have a conversation with someone.</v>

162
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.323
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

163
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.003
<v 5>You do listen,</v>

164
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.320
one person speaks and the other one listens and then you're speaking and I

165
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:52.200
listen. And people sort of normally do that back and forth.

166
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.860
But when you start with a dolphin making airborne sounds,

167
00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:58.630
once they get the idea, this alumnus really, it goes off

168
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.190
every show offy and they want to override you.

169
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.310
Okay. So you have to spend a lot of time getting it down to,

170
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.570
I'm talking now and now it's your turn.

171
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.750
<v 7>Huh?</v>

172
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.550
<v 5>Now have you had a Fuze upset about something? He'll overnight</v>

173
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.900
paid her and it's annoying.

174
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:32.990
<v 8>Yeah. Listen again.</v>

175
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.483
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

176
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.920
<v 8>Hey, what's this? Come on Peter. One, two,</v>

177
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:39.783
three.

178
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.370
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

179
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.780
<v 8>that started me in one, two, three.</v>

180
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.510
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

181
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:55.310
<v 5>yes, but he learned very quickly to listen to me. One, two, three,</v>

182
00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:56.144
four.

183
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.643
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

184
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.143
<v 8>good.</v>

185
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.670
<v 5>And not to pick up my instructions if I would say no, no, no,</v>

186
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:13.020
Peter, I don't want you to do that. I want you to do this, this,

187
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.190
this, Huh? He would give me back this, this,

188
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.970
this parrot will often say, no, no, no, probably want to crack her.

189
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.250
They will Pete, the whole thing of whatever you said. Huh.

190
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:29.200
But Peter Wood would pick up what I wanted when he was being a good student and

191
00:11:29.201 --> 00:11:31.150
he was a good student. There seemed to be

192
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.230
with this one dolphin anyway, can be for all of them. An interest in,

193
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.190
in what we were doing. He wanted to practice, he wanted to get it right.

194
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.980
He a, there was a mirror and he would spend long periods of time by himself.

195
00:11:47.981 --> 00:11:49.810
Didn't want me to be part of it.

196
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.580
And he would practice whatever it was we had been doing in the lesson that day

197
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.260
over and over and over and over. He wanted to get it right

198
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.270
out. Ah, ah, ah,

199
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.930
sorry. Oh, and he,

200
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.000
he would work at that for no reason. He's not getting fish.

201
00:12:12.001 --> 00:12:14.680
I'm not interacting with him and nothing. He just wants it. Right.

202
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.640
Like doing homework, like homework. Exactly.

203
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.260
And after a few months of this, why

204
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:23.840
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

205
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.930
<v 0>Peter did start to sound really different.</v>

206
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.340
<v 8>One, two</v>

207
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.503
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

208
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.590
<v 8>one, two, three.</v>

209
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.573
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

210
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.703
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

211
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.743
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

212
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.083
<v 8>Hello.</v>

213
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.610
<v 5>He kept getting better. It's extremely difficult for them though.</v>

214
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.450
<v 7>Hello?</v>

215
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.670
<v 5>They just have a blow hole. They,</v>

216
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:53.240
they do not have the apparatus to the SS are almost impossible.

217
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.580
Uh, I would feed him my name all wet and m is very hard.

218
00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:03.581
He would eventually roll over almost into the water with the blow hole to muffle

219
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:05.783
called Grit.

220
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:07.403
<v 7>Okay.</v>

221
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.820
<v 0>I love the thing. Really. You're saying he would,</v>

222
00:13:10.821 --> 00:13:13.580
he would use the water as a way to help him make the sound.

223
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.360
<v 5>Yes. All work with that word.</v>

224
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.403
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

225
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.690
<v 8>oh, and,</v>

226
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.840
<v 0>and we knew that was your name.</v>

227
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.443
<v 3>Aw.</v>

228
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.780
<v 5>I don't know. But nevertheless, we were a pretty good match.</v>

229
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:37.280
He, I, I, I knew his mood, his temperament, and he, and he knew mine.

230
00:13:37.281 --> 00:13:40.240
He knew when I was sick and I would get sick. I mean,

231
00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.700
you were in the water all the time. You're bound to get a cold or something. He,

232
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.660
he just loved my anatomy. He wanted to know what my knees were doing.

233
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.440
He would go behind my knee and sonar and look at it and feel it and push it and

234
00:13:53.811 --> 00:13:58.790
find out which way it would go. He just, and I gave him the time

235
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.350
cause I wasn't going home, uh, to, to look at my knee,

236
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.680
to look at my feet. He was enormously interested,

237
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.540
oddly enough in the space between my fingers.

238
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.820
Really not the fingers so much, but he would, I mean, you know,

239
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:20.350
his be could just barely fit there,

240
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:25.351
but he wanted to put in between each finger and see what that was all about.

241
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:30.120
The same with the toes. He didn't have any spaces anywhere. He, you know, he,

242
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.970
he had solid flippers but no space in between them.

243
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.770
<v 0>Do you think he was so interested in your fingers and toes because he didn't</v>

244
00:14:37.771 --> 00:14:39.420
have any? Yes, I do.

245
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.160
Margaret and Peter ended up spending about nine months living together,

246
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:52.670
but towards the end things kind of started to, first of all,

247
00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.650
there weren't really results from this experiment.

248
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:59.000
They never were able to publish any scientific papers and there were other

249
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:03.350
problems. Lily got very involved in drugs, especially

250
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.390
<v 5>LSD. He did bring it down.</v>

251
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.100
He did a give LSD. He says he did.

252
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:12.230
I believe him to, to, to have that all his,

253
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:14.690
I would not let him give LSD to Peter. I wouldn't allow that.

254
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.180
<v 0>Why would he give him lst?</v>

255
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.240
Well it's not a hundred percent clear but it seems like he was trying to find a

256
00:15:21.761 --> 00:15:24.700
way to get the dolphins to open up to connect,

257
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.140
maybe to talk in any case by 1965 66,

258
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.650
his funding had started to dry up. And when people heard about Margaret's work,

259
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.490
they tended to focus on like one particular part of the story.

260
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.310
You don't have to answer, but a lot has been made of your, uh,

261
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.060
sort of sexually engaging with Peter. And I just want to ask,

262
00:15:45.061 --> 00:15:47.280
cause you don't seem like a shrinking violet. I just want to ask,

263
00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:48.870
is there anything you want to say about that?

264
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.620
<v 5>Um, what would I like to say about that? I think</v>

265
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.150
the sensational side of it is, yeah.

266
00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.490
<v 0>Is, here's what Margaret told me. Peter was a young dolphin,</v>

267
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.440
he was horny and he would hump her leg a lot, kind of like a dog might do,

268
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.820
which was getting in the way of their work.

269
00:16:06.821 --> 00:16:11.800
So eventually I just said the heck with it and she used her hand to, you know,

270
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:12.191
<v 5>and,</v>

271
00:16:12.191 --> 00:16:15.190
and it would quickly satisfy them and then we could go back to doing what we

272
00:16:15.191 --> 00:16:18.970
were doing. And I, I never really gave it another thought. I never thought, Oh,

273
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.670
don't let anybody know. I never thought, oh, this shouldn't be.

274
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.390
<v 0>But because of details like this and the drugs,</v>

275
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.420
this experiment became extremely controversial,

276
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.280
<v 1>almost untouchable. People didn't want to be associated with Lilly.</v>

277
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.890
Nobody wanted to fund anything that sounded like Lilly.

278
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.500
It just got this like aura of don't go there,

279
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.363
don't go there.

280
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.970
Even people who wanted to do really rigorous work with human dolphin

281
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:49.580
communication had a tough time getting any funding.

282
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.540
And that lasted for a long time.

283
00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.560
And the thing is, even though there are so many reasons to disapprove of

284
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.100
<v 0>this experiment, when you talk to Margaret,</v>

285
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.840
you can't read each other's company,

286
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.500
but want to be in that apartment with them.

287
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.440
<v 5>He would come over and when he was in what I call his sweet mood,</v>

288
00:17:13.441 --> 00:17:16.140
and Peter had a lot of very, very sweet mood to him.

289
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:22.190
He would sink to the bottom and take my foot in his mouth.

290
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.430
And he wasn't sonar aring and he wasn't looking at anything.

291
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.640
It was almost like a little kid comes and just wants to hold your hand.

292
00:17:29.641 --> 00:17:33.120
And he would just sink to the bottom and close his eyes and just hang onto my

293
00:17:33.121 --> 00:17:33.954
foot.

294
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

295
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.910
<v 5>And then you'd have to come up and breathe and then you'd go back down and he</v>

296
00:17:41.131 --> 00:17:42.560
just grabbed my foot

297
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.470
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>
