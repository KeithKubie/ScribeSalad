00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.570
 Number 5: Vikings. 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.290
 What would a Viking be without his faithful combat helmet, with those impressive horns? 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.650
 The answer is simple: a more historically correct Viking. 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.440
 Just think of the usefulness of wearing a helmet in combat. Through the horns 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.090
 on the helmet it is very easy to remove the head protection. 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.150
 Or, if you have a strap on your helmet, your opponent has a good hold on you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.590
 throw it on the ground and then cut your throat. 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.330
 Helmets with horns is a terrible idea. That is also the reason that archaeologists have never found such helmets 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.010
 at Viking battlefields. And there is also no evidence that they wore this. 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.280
 They were poets and artists - people who don't care about the actual facts - 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.820
 who gave Vikings a stupid helmet at the end of 1800. Long after the Vikings made this mistake 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.170
 could not straighten out. 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.089
 Number 4: Lady Godiva. 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.999
 The story of this English noble lady from the eleventh century is that her husband, also the count, raised taxes 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:50.819
 in the town of Coventry. Lady Godiva found this too high and, not surprisingly, the residents thought it too. 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:54.460
 She teased her husband with the promise that she would ride naked in the city for in exchange 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.749
 that he would lower taxes. He agreed, annoyed, without knowing that she would do this, but the opposite was true. 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:01.129
 Because people don't like taxes, even though it pays for life, 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.089
 the story of Lady Godiva is continued by incorporating it into logos and music. 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.760
 While Lady Godiva has really lived and Coventry is a real city, there is none 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.300
 only proof that naked riding really happened. So we can assume that the story is incorrect. 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 Just like with the Viking helmet, it is again the fault of the poets and artists who made this story 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.980
 made up after the death of Lady Godiva. 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.100
 Number 3: Napoleon. 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.750
 This famous tiny general, perhaps it was to compose his height, 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.790
 took control of France, expanded the influence of the empire, and appointed himself emperor. 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.020
 The official length of Napoleon was 5'2 inches (1.58 m). But in this time the French inches were longer 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.410
 than the English inches. So actually Napoleon's height should be indicated in England 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.590
 are as 5'7 inches (1.70 m). What is fairly small today, 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.930
 but in early 1800 this length was average. 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.660
 Anyway, England, with his eternal love for everything that is French, it didn't matter 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.540
 and made their own "Napoleon-is-so-small-HAHA" story in newspapers and cartoons. 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.870
 In the meantime, Napoleon was busy introducing the metric system in France and the rest of the world 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.120
 and standardize it so that such mistakes would no longer be made. 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.390
 Fortunately, the whole world uses this system. Almost the whole world, sort of ... 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.590
 Number 2: Roman vomit 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.380
 Aah, the Roman Empire. Large and powerful. Only decayed by the decadence from within. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.090
 And what could be a better example of this decadence than the vomitorium? Here where the Romans, after themselves 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.230
 crammed full of good food, could vomit to eat themselves completely around again. 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.560
 Vomitoria really existed, but the idea behind it is not true. It is understandable 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.150
 that confusion arises. The name "vomit-orium" ("vomit" is vomiting) seems to clarify the purpose. 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.060
 Even though you can do Latin for some reason - probably because you live in a country that 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.319
 necessarily want to waste hundreds of hours learning a dead, useless language - this knowledge 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.340
 won't help you. "Vomitum" means "spit out". 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.880
 So what's real? If you ever went to a big stadium, say, 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.190
 that of the Romans. Then you have already used the vomitorium. This is what the vomitorium is. 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.780
 A large entrance and exit that allows a large amount of people through. The people are emerging 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.020
 be spit. Not the content of the people. 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.380
 Number 1: Columbus. 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.830
 There is so much wrong with the story being told about Christopher Columbus, 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.740
 it's hard to start where. But the biggest misconception is that everyone thought 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.240
 that the world was flat instead of round. Columbus was the only smart guy who knew the earth was just around. 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.890
 It's a good story. Only people have known since about 5,000 BC. that the earth had a spherical shape. 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.750
 6,500 years before Columbus goes on a sailing trip. And this knowledge has never been since 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.500
 lost in the West. In 200 BC. Eratosthenes calculated the perimeter 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.440
 of Earth and this calculation were still used in the time of Columbus. 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.520
 The discussion between Columbus and Queen Isabella was not about the shape, but about the size of the earth. 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.500
 Columbus estimated the earth to be much smaller than Queen Isabella and her scientific advisors. 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.830
 That's why Columbus thought he could easily sail across the empty Atlantic to India. 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.630
 But Columbus' estimation was incorrect, just like Napoleon's length, this was due to different units of measurement. 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.430
 However, with his mistake he came to the west. Where he was the first European to discover America, 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.960
 as long as you ignore the hornless Vikings that were him 500 years ago. 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.000
