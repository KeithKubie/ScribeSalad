00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.790
You have all these ideas and

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.180
at this point, you should be wondering,
which idea should I choose?

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.420
Well, to answer that question,
you have a lot to think about.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.160
Here are some of the considerations
you should keep in mind.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.740
First, is your idea a painkiller or
vitamin?

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.170
Pain killers address an obvious and
functional need for users,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.380
while vitamins address user's emotional
needs and are really nice to have.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.910
Now, both types, but

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.770
especially painkillers,
can lead to successful companies.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.200
For vitamin type ideas,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.340
you'll need to figure out how to
get your users to be sticky, so

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.520
that way they continue to come back and
use your product over time.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.990
The second thing you should look for
is how easy it is to monetize the idea.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.010
Now you don't need to
monetize an idea on day one.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.330
But understanding how to make
money out of the service or

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.120
product is essential to
building an enduring business.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.000
Next is the idea simple?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.336
Can you explain your idea
in just a couple sentences?

00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:59.590
For example, bagborroworsteal.com
is like Netflix, but

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.290
instead of renting movies, you can rent,
buy, or sell designer items.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.080
Law enforcement and judges might say
the simplest explanation is usually

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.630
the right, or truthful, one and this
should also be true of your product.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.760
Users should be able to
describe the product and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.140
its benefits to other
potential users easily.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.170
And here's where we get to
the heart of the matter.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.440
Is your idea personally relevant?

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.330
For example, you might be a diabetic and
want to develop affordable and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.030
convenient blood sugar monitors for
other diabetics.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.380
Now, don't underestimate this one.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.480
This is of great importance,
as it relates to how likely you are to

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.400
persevere in the face of challenge,
uncertainty, or worse, looming failure.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.690
You'll be more likely to see an idea
come to life if you care about the idea

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.080
in the first place.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.800
Now another consideration for
an idea is whether or

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.620
not you can follow through on it.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.600
Think about your ability
to organize a small team or

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.800
a large team to execute on that idea.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.400
Can you get from a to b?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.740
Next you should wonder if you have
a large enough size of the market.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.200
You want a really big slice of the pie.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.020
The market just refers to your
number of potential customers.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.750
You should be able to calculate a lower
estimate as well as an upper estimate

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.240
for your market size.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.620
If you're unfamiliar with market sizing,
refer to the Instructor Notes.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.640
There's a resource link there.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.920
And finally, does your idea
have a legitimate secret sauce?

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.100
Does your idea leverage technology or
patents in a unique way?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.860
Or do you have talent and capital
that no one else would ever have?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.230
For Google, the secret sauce
was the page rank algorithm.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.110
The secret sauce has grown over
the years to include many features

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.880
that bring millions of page
results in fractions of a second.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.785
Now that you have some considerations
for what makes a great product idea,

00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:45.485
I'd like you to evaluate the idea for
the SuperDuper Shopping App.

00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:49.095
You can find a survey that's
linked in the Instructor Notes.

00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:50.625
Once you've taken the survey,

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:52.485
you can check this box to
continue when you're done.
