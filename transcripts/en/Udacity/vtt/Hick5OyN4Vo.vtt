00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is this one, the ball is moving down to the right and just think if we were throwing

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a real ball up a tower, its path would look something like this.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In any instant we can approximate the direction it's moving, a straight line like this

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and yeah sure enough it goes down to the right.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Remember, whenever you ask a qualitative answer like this one in physics,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
well, physics describes reality.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You should never provide an answer that disagrees with what you think would actually happen.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Okay, so how do we get this answer.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
With this blue arrows are what we call components of the balls velocity.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We've already mentioned the horizontal component and this one we'll call the vertical component.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Those two together create the balls resulting velocity but they have to be added appropriately.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The way we do that is we imagine sliding this horizontal vector down,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
so its tail matches with this guy's tip and we can also slide this vertical one over here.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now we've created this nice rectangular shape where those meet we draw our line

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we have our resulting velocity.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is going to come in handy when we wanted to do some trigonometry later,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and just to give you a hint we can already see the right triangles forming.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now this has been talked about in a very abstract sort of way.

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's actually solve a problem so we know what's going on.
