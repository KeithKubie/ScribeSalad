00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.690
Jun Ye: “The reason we get very excited
talking about clocks is not just really making

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.950
time, but really about exploring the frontier
problems of quantum physics.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.080
Clock, is, I feel, one part of the human endeavor.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.339
You can actually turn that into a quantum
physics playground.”

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.749
Inside this basement lab a team of physicists
are wrangling atoms at super high speeds and

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.179
suspending them in optical traps to measure
atomic ticks.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.300
“When you walk into our lab, the first thing
comes to your mind is like, "Oh man, that's

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.390
crazy.”

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.760
On this table top, Jun Ye and his team at
the University of Colorado have built the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.899
world’s most precise atomic clock.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.929
And it gets its ticks from the vibrations
of 10,000 atoms.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.910
Time is a universal constant in our lives.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.160
GPS navigation, power grids, financial networks,
whether you get to work before your boss...

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.510
all of this depends on reliable timekeeping.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.030
But have you ever stopped to think about what
time actually is?

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.720
It's a very precise measurement of ticks,
and thanks to the march of technological progress,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.020
that “tick” has gone from the movement
of the sun, to a pendulum swing, to the vibrations

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.080
of a quartz crystal.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.960
And ever since the 1960s, we’ve been on
atomic time.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.880
“Inside the atom, electron is moving around
nucleus and that has very periodic oscillation,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.510
and we say we want to use that as our fundamental
unit of time.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.000
We want to measure those energy level structure
extremely precisely because that's a constant

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of nature.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.860
If you can measure extremely precisely, it
should be a universal value and that's what

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.460
the atomic clock is all about.”

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.350
This is the NIST F-2, an atomic clock at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.520
in Colorado.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.750
It’s one of the world’s master clocks
and is designed to measure the very specific

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.040
oscillations of a silvery atom on the periodic
table: cesium.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.720
Inside it, a gas of cesium atoms enter the
clock's vacuum chamber, microwave laser beams

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.229
push the cesium atoms together into a ball,
the lasers toss the ball up, then it falls

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.640
back down, emitting photons.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.390
The time it takes for the cesium ball to move
between two different energy levels is 9,192,631,770,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.450
and that is the definition of a second.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.110
That sounds pretty precise, but a new generation
of atomic clocks are on the horizon, which

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.720
use laser light instead of microwaves to divide
time into even finer slices.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.890
“The reason why we want to move from microwave
to optical frequency is given by one simple

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.740
fact is, the light frequency oscillates much
faster than a microwave.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.990
In a blink of an eye, you can have a million,
billion cycles go by if you're dealing with

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.540
optical frequencies, while if you're dealing
with microwave frequencies, you might be dealing

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.090
with only one billion cycles per second.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.370
The more cycles you can measure per fixed
time, the less fractional mistakes you will

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.670
be making.”

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.430
Creating an optical clock is an incredible
change.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.620
And while this looks like a labyrinth of wires,
everything has a purpose.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.910
“It's like if you're little, if we can shrink
your size down by a factor of 10 and you walk

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.400
along those mirrors, it would be like...Complete
black forest of mirrors.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.680
Every single mirror on that table has its
sole purpose which is allowing us to steer

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.210
all kinds of colorful lasers to interact with
the strontium atom.”

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.140
Instead of cesium, Ye and other teams at the
NIST are building optical clocks based on

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.849
other elements, like strontium and ytterbium,
that can tick at higher frequencies.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.650
“Strontium sits at the second column of
the periodic table and it's characterized

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.520
by two valence electrons.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.080
When you have one electron, it's very volatile.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.220
When you have two, it’s much less volatile
compare to cesium atoms.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.010
The strontium atom, when you liberate it,
they're moving at the speed of 300 meters

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.270
per second which is essentially like a bullet
train.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.360
So if I ask, "What time is it strontium atom?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.720
I wouldn't be able to tell you the time.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.770
The first thing we need to do is slowing them
down so they're standing still in front of

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.770
you.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.340
So we need a bunch of lasers//we take a few
tens of milliseconds to finally prepare them

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.800
to very low temperatures, and we load them
into an optical trap.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.250
How we do that is by using another laser coming
in, it's almost like a tweezer made of light.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.439
So this laser light coming from outside the
vacuum window focuses its light down to a

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:39.909
little focus spot, and polarizes the atom
and hold them in the middle of the vacuum

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.889
chamber so you can actually look at the atom.”

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.800
Ye's team was able to cool the strontium atoms
to below a microkelvin, turning it into a

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.939
quantum gas that allowed the atoms to spread
out and organize into an optical lattice.

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:56.659
“Once the atoms cool down and trapped, then
you need to turn on the clock laser, finally

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:02.020
try to match your laser color to the transition
of the atom you're trying to interrogate as

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.020
a clock signal.”

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.110
The tick for this 3D gas clock is the exact
frequency that prompts the strontium atoms

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.009
to switch energy levels, which is 430 trillion
cycles per second.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:18.770
It’s so precise that it can keep time without
losing or gaining a second for 15 billion

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.770
years.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.050
“We all know that these optical atomic clocks
are now performing hundred times better than

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.870
the microwave clock.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.029
Time is something that's been discussed very
actively right now.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.860
When will be the good time to replace the
current cesium clock with the strontium clock,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.120
or some other atom.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.139
But defining time is a human enterprise.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.520
It requires international cooperation.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.999
It requires a universal time where every country
should agree upon.

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.910
And this is really, a very serious matter.”

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.749
But Ye’s pursuit in making an ultra-precise
atomic clock isn’t just about refining the

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:56.689
standard of time.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:00.610
Because atomic clocks are measuring the interplay
between electrons and elementary particles,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.629
they are a unique tool to investigate why
our universe is the way it is.

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:10.342
“We are building more precise and more sensitive
scientific instruments to be allowing ourselves

00:06:10.342 --> 00:06:15.680
to be able to detect gravitational waves or
detect the presence of dark matter, because

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.339
in the end, if you are the master of the space-time
fabric, you got to be able to figure out that

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:26.509
dark matter is bending the space-time a little
bit, and the one way to figure this out is

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.279
just to measure time.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:35.349
There's a symphony going on, and time, remember,
is not something unique.

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:41.270
Time is related to space, so if there are
all kinds of bodies moving around, merging,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.659
separating, rebirth, and so on, the time's
changing everywhere.

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:47.659
And so that's at the very tiny scale.

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:53.300
If you build clocks so well, eventually you
get to the point where you will not help but

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.949
hear all these microscopic noise that's going
on in the universe.

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.990
I'm optimistic, within the next 30 years we
might get to the point where we can measure

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.729
the gravitational effect on quantum physics
and maybe just keep going to the point where

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.789
the universe says ‘guys, all the times are
different and here's the final limit.’”
