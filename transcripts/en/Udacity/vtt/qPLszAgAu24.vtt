One thing about Blinn-Phong specular highlighting is that the drop off is

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.155
always gradual around the fringe. Even if you turn the highlight power up to

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:11.180
1000, you'll still see some drop off fringe. You also can't control the width

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.844
of the highlight. Your task is to threshold the basic Blinn-Phong specular

00:00:15.844 --> 00:00:19.660
term. What this means is that after computing the Specular contribution, test

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.180
it against the variable uDropoff. If Specular is less than uDropoff, set it to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.450
zero, else set Specular to 1. When you're done, the solution should look like

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.220
this. Note that there's a slider for drop off that allows you to change how

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.040
wide the highlight is.
