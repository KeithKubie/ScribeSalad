What will happen,
the Joe Rogan experience,
I would have never,

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.620
I knew what it meant.
I've done ADR.
Yep.
I did it like fear factor.

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:12.420
Like every episode I had to do ADR,
it was the worst.
Why'd you,

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.980
because you were just mispronouncing names or you weren't,

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.270
it was usually because they wanted a titan segments.
I'd like,
you know,

6
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:22.980
we would film for three days and we'd have to slam that down to 44 minutes.

7
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.981
And so sometimes you needed brevity or sometimes they needed clarification for

8
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.030
certain things.
Like,

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.840
like we would explain the rules to them like very specifically and they would

10
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:36.000
have to read these rules and it took a long time.

11
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.410
But then like sometimes in the moment,
like on television,

12
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:44.040
you wouldn't explain it as clearly.
Like while we're filming like we would,

13
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.350
we'd show them like this is what you have to do,

14
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:48.480
this is what you have to start here.
You go from here to there.

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.160
But sometimes when you would want to put it on TV,

16
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:55.580
you want to be more precise or more concise.
Yeah.
So I would,

17
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.340
every fucking week I have to do ADR.
I hated it.
You did.

18
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.930
It seems like it would be fun,
like fear factor,

19
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.860
but just ADR seems like easy.
It's relaxed.
You're just in the booth.
Yeah.

20
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:10.430
It was boring.
No,
no,
I didn't like it.
No,
no.

21
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.100
The Fun thing about fear factor was when the checks came,
that was a fun time.

22
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.270
And then when Nice people,
one,
that was fun too.
Yeah,
those things were fun,

23
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.100
but really that was,
that was a great job,
but it was a job.

24
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.640
It was like a job,
but like,
you know,
if you had a great,
like,
yeah,

25
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:31.360
I really like working here,
whereas you don't really say that about stand up.
No,

26
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.710
I don't think about it as a job.
It's just fucking fun.
It's awesome.
Oh,

27
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:38.880
absolutely.
Absolutely.
It's a get to do.
Yeah.
I get to do.
Yeah.

28
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.880
That's my new thing is like get to do versus have to do.

29
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.010
Yeah.
