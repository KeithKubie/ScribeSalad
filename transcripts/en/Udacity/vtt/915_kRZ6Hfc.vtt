Hi I'm Andy, and this Sarah, and she would speak for

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.250
herself, if she weren't totally engrossed in this game of 2048.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.125
&gt;&gt; Sorry, guys.

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:10.230
&gt;&gt; And if you've never played it, it's incredibly addictive, and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.250
it's open source, which means in about 30 minutes,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.320
you can have your entirely own version of this game.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.660
Sara, do you want to pause for a second and show them the thing you made?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.160
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.220
&gt;&gt; So ,we made a version of the game using US presidents.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.850
You can really do anything, and it doesn't take very long.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.960
If you're a novice programmer or have no programming experience you can,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.410
in ten minutes, understand how, at a very high level, this code works.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.350
That's pretty cool and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.797
if this sounds interesting, can't wait to see you in class.
