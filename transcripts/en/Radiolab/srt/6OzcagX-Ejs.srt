1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,810
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab, our topic today,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,840
choice and human destinies. Yeah.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,700
With the way we are is that the way we're
going to stay are very nicely put in

4
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:16,140
the last section we were talking about
baboons and their propensity to serious

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,860
change, which is a maybe or maybe
not. We don't really know. Yeah.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,930
We'll known a thousand years.
Well let's switch our ape.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,200
We'll go to Oregonians or just a rare
subset of human beings to set it up.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,400
We were thinking a lot about um,
small groups on this show. You know,

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,470
cause that's what we are. We
are a small group primates.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,400
That's the phrase that sometimes you use
to describe as humans and it's a phrase

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,490
that can carry some negative connotations.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,120
As in we evolved in these small groups
that we are predisposed to be small

13
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,850
minded. No small is
not always a bad thing.

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,300
I'm gonna tell you a story now
that's a small group story. It's a,

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,020
just as a warning contains a moment
or two that's a tiny bit graphic,

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,170
but we hope you'll stick with it
because it's a really cool story.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,030
Takes place in a small
town, like really small,

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,270
the kind of town where you can dial
the wrong number and still have a

19
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:09,720
conversation cause you know everybody.
So tell me where we are and,

20
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:13,370
and uh, downtown Silverton.

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,770
Essentially our downtown has not changed
since the late forties, early fifties.

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,310
Oh yes it has. But we'll get
to that. This is Stu Rasmussen.

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,480
He is our main character.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,530
And a little while back stu gave
myself and producer Aaron Scott a tour,

25
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,590
the theater on the corner of the
old hardware store on this corner,

26
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,500
this tour of his favorite
place on earth. Silverton,

27
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:35,630
Oregon roots is about
40 miles from Portland.

28
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,180
It's about 40 years from
Portland actually, you know,

29
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,770
it's the town I grew up in and this is
my image for what I want silver to be.

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,150
You know,

31
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,490
I rode my bicycle down the street and
came to the hardware store to get going.

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,890
We're doing good. Vince,
is that happened to you?

33
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:52,250
A lot of people just honk and wave all
the time. Oh yeah. It's a small town.

34
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:53,450
Everybody knows, man,

35
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,260
if it were up to to this
town would never change.

36
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,290
It would stay frozen in that quaint Norman
Rockwell candy coated image from his

37
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,120
boyhood. The weird thing though is that
that image in his head would probably be

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,980
[inaudible] never have
included a guy like stu,

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,440
at least do as he is now and
if this is a show about change,

40
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:17,050
here is a story money pretty radical,

41
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:20,380
but it changed where you wouldn't
expect to find. Speaking of which,

42
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,930
can you describe where we are and what
we're looking at while we're standing in

43
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:26,050
front of the palace theater on the
corner of Oak and water street,

44
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,290
this is one of those gun with the wind
theaters with the big marquee and the

45
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,970
bulb lights and everything built in
1935 and then continuous operation ever

46
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:38,560
since steeples out some keys and opens
it up, but starting to get really cold.

47
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,470
He suggested that we do the interview
here in the towns only theater.

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,260
Even smells like a gilded age theater,

49
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,860
which at 1:00 PM still smelled like
popcorn from the previous night and was

50
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:51,310
filled with nothing but
200 empty red velvet seats.

51
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,610
Not what you expected in a small
town theater. Oh, this is beautiful.

52
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,720
Yeah. Okay. See you later. Okay,
thank you. You've left ourselves.

53
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,693
Sit right here. What do you think?

54
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,870
[inaudible] seats in the
house right in the middle.

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,240
Sit and pretend we're watching
the movie of your life

56
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,340
while there is a dull movement. Hardly.

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,360
So the movie of Stu begins in 1975 he's
27 and he's in a theater just like the

58
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:20,560
Seminole moment in my life was when
the rocky horror picture showcase

59
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,573
[inaudible]

60
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,660
stu is in the projectionist
booth cause that's his job.

61
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:30,200
He's changing the rails and at some
point during one of the musical members,

62
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:35,640
he glances at the screen and it was
like, oh, what was the, what was the,

63
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,570
Oh here was this movie with a
guy drag on screwed justice.

64
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,900
Triam is the best guy who is
the sweet trends fest. State

65
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,050
suction friends, sexual Transylvania.
Those are words that I've never heard.

66
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,680
Watch that again and again.

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,500
Fast forward 10 years. Do
you now owns the theater?

68
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,740
Just like his dad had beforehand.
He's an upstanding member of the town.

69
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,950
He's on the Silverton city
council. Then on the library board,

70
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,220
and then he starts to transform and
everyone will tell you it began with the

71
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,501
nails.

72
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:19,501
I think I probably started having my nails
done in 94 95 and it started out with

73
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:24,120
very masculine nails without Polish and
square ends and then slowly grew them

74
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,550
out. And then I went into what I
considered a masculine nail color of blue.

75
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,240
And then he says he gradually started to
paint them red and then he put acrylic

76
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,300
tips, which got longer and longer. This
was the first test. Did the community,

77
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,690
Hello Laurie? Who Do you
mean sir? How are you?

78
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,640
I could be at the theater taking tickets,

79
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,850
be dressed as usual and
his plaid shirt and jeans,

80
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,010
his hand would come out for their
tickets. And what is the healer?

81
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,770
Oh are those, you can't miss it. And you
know he had a long fingernail. Hello,

82
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,990
that's Dennis Bean.
Long Time Silver Tonia.

83
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,790
One time when I had to give him my
ticket and Megan to salvo, she's 17.

84
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,080
And he rips it and like his nails like
went down the palm of my hand and just

85
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:05,390
gave me the chills. Yeah.

86
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,730
For I think probably his nails were
the first thing most people notice.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,700
Cal Palmer veterinarian and
city councilman born and
raised here and SilverTech

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,500
was their talk was oh, people
sitting, oh, definitely talk.

89
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,100
But it happens so gradually, which is
something you hear again and again.

90
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:24,660
It happened gradually, you know, first
it was the nails and, and then, uh,

91
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,040
at some point in time he changed the
focus of the movie theater and was really

92
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,670
making a game attempt to get new
releases and down in the theater.

93
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:36,300
And frequently, you know, when
there was a theme kind of movie,

94
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,700
he would get into costume.
My name is Ken Hector,

95
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,620
former mayor of short in Oregon.

96
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,370
And very often the costume
would be female attire.

97
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,820
This is step two of Steve's very careful
transition according to everyone we

98
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:51,000
spoke with for years after
the nails. He would quote,

99
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:56,001
promote that week's movie by dressing up
or one of the new star wars movies was

100
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:58,030
out and it a coincidence he

101
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,450
was dressed as queen on
the dollar. I love you.

102
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,080
Whatever name is from the movie.
Years ago you remember, uh,

103
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,390
some years ago there was a movie
called my big Fat Greek wedding.

104
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,470
That's John Bach, also
a lifelong silver Tony.

105
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,200
And that whole day he wandered
around town in a wedding dress.

106
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,250
The complete with the veil. That of
course got everybody talking. You know,

107
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:24,040
a lot of people laughed about it. I don't
think people put it together with um,

108
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,273
this is the, the web.

109
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,070
She's a registered nurse, sexuality,
transgender or any of those things.

110
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:34,190
I think we thought he was just dressing
up to go along with this. Uh, yeah,

111
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,040
with his movies. There was clearly a,

112
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,250
let's go by the movie theater tonight
cause we've got to know what Stew's

113
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:43,550
wearing for stu. This was just the
beginning of something. He was,

114
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,200
he wasn't just clowning around. When
did your gender complexities begin?

115
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,330
In probably 14 or 15.

116
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,010
I think I was a shy young man
and interfacing with girls.

117
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:59,120
My mother was a bit strange on on that
in the girls who are evil and they would,

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,800
no girl was good enough for her
son and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah Dah.

119
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:05,870
So did you date at all? Not
until I was out of high school.

120
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,260
So girls were kind of scary. It
sounds like girls were scary. Yeah,

121
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,120
well everybody else went on dates.

122
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,120
He says he would build computers from
scratch and even today in his basement

123
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,220
you'll find an entire electrical
shop like God, fun stuff,

124
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,720
RF generators, spectrum analyzer, logic
analyzer or the logic, analyze it.

125
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:31,721
In any case do says the best that
he can explain himself gender wise.

126
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,320
It's just to say that when
he looks in the mirror,

127
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:36,680
he likes himself better when
he's dressed as a woman.

128
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,630
I don't know how to describe it.
It's just, um, I can't understand it.

129
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:46,310
I mean, some people like to dress up
and look like a cowboy or a lumberjack,

130
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:47,660
whatever, you know,

131
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,750
it's your mental image of yourself that
you look in the mirror and you like.

132
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,450
So after the nails,

133
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,200
after dozens of episodes of
socially acceptable cross-dressing,

134
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,070
Stu took the next step. He began
to perform some experiments,

135
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:04,070
like he would go to the lumber
yard just to get some stuff,

136
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:05,570
a couple of pounds in nails or something.

137
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,200
All the while he would
be wearing a padded bra.

138
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,660
There is flannel shirt just to see
what would happen. So this for you,

139
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,310
it was like a test. It was like a
calculated test to absolutely age.

140
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,110
If it was possible, if I could
survive with breasts. Okay.

141
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,360
So when he was 52 he drove into
Portland, visited a doctor,

142
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,460
put him to sleep and the doctors
made two small incisions,

143
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:32,190
one under each breast, about an
inch and a half or two inches long.

144
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,930
And they pulled back
the skin on each side,

145
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,130
slid in an uninflated balloon and then
pumped it up with water until the skin

146
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:41,000
was stretched to the point that
it was almost transparent. Hmm.

147
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,360
That sounds very painful. Was it?
Well, I was asleep at the time,

148
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,250
but when he woke up he was a different
man because he now had several pounds of

149
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:53,160
new stuff hanging off his chest. What
were you thinking at that moment?

150
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,330
I was thinking what I done, it was like,

151
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,920
there's no going back.

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,880
I can remember being in a Max
place downtown at a table and uh,

153
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,810
he was coming across the street with
his breasts prominently showing,

154
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:12,380
and it was the first time any of us
realized that he had actually had surgery

155
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,780
and one lady was going, Oh look, look.
And the other lady was going to look

156
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,260
across the street and Oh my God, look,
it's too, my God, what is he doing?

157
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,640
It just sort of shocking.
There was a buzz around town.

158
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,550
This is a situation where he'd
walked by and then heads would turn,

159
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,120
hushed voices would ensue. Yes. Basically,

160
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,120
this is Victoria sage
Stew's longtime girlfriend.

161
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,130
They've been together for 36 years.

162
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,040
So we would be walking in our local
goodwill and we'd be a few miles away from

163
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:45,210
each other. And I would hear that
used to be [inaudible] Rasmussen,

164
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,480
like he had changed somehow [inaudible]
trying to fulfill that body image.

165
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,260
He's gotten his head but he's also going
to in way asked you to adjust to your

166
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,090
body image of your mate. Has
that been difficult? Hmm.

167
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,590
No. Okay. No, I'm sorry.

168
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:14,210
If you, if want to get kinky about
it, a man would is kind of cool,

169
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,143
Huh?

170
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,430
Okay. Did, uh,

171
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,570
was there ever any concern there
was for me? Um, not so much for Stu.

172
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:28,571
I think partly because he didn't hear
as many whispers as I felt I did,

173
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,560
but I was concerned for the theater
business. Not without reason.

174
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,850
A lot of kids in the town stop coming
to the theater cause their parents

175
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:38,570
wouldn't let them.

176
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,530
Ticket sales took a hit and it wasn't
long before pickup trucks full of teenage

177
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:45,080
boys would drive by the
theater yelling slurs.

178
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,180
Oh I don't know that I go so far
as well. Yeah, I guess I guess

179
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,753
[inaudible]

180
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,700
in fact it is a slur I guess.

181
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,690
And so you get to this point in
the sped up movie narrative of Stu.

182
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,750
This point right here where even though
he took it so slowly and was so careful,

183
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,840
it's still easy to imagine things
turning ugly. I don't know.

184
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,150
What was that movie about?
The boy that was a, you know,

185
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,100
drug and beat to death because he was
gay in a small town in the Midwest.

186
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:16,040
You know what a waste of your shepard.
Yeah. Might be a little extreme.

187
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,630
But according to Linda Web Silverton's
not so different from Laramie, Wyoming.

188
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,780
We are Matthew Shepard lift. It's
a small town, very traditional,

189
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:24,740
very conservative. You know,

190
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,000
you got a lot of rednecks in silver and
so Dennis beam puts it so it's not crazy

191
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,730
to expect the worst.
But here's the surprise.

192
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,860
[inaudible] call. Right. And the whole
reason we came here to Silverado my page,

193
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,150
January 5th, 2009 the
worst did not happen.

194
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,820
[inaudible] there was no
redneck rebellion. In fact,

195
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:50,770
the opposite happened right the right
hand. Something historic it after me. Hi.

196
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,280
Hi. On January 5th
thousand and nine the town

197
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,980
of Silverton elected stu mayor.

198
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,980
How did the city of Silverton
Marion County for congratulate

199
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,130
has elected the nation's first openly
transgender mayor nation's first openly

200
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:12,790
transgender mayor. This is a real
turn off here. This election take,

201
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,940
do revenues slide as openly transgendered
as he runs his hometown in heels.

202
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,730
Speaking of heels, this is
in fact the sound of stews.

203
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:32,750
Four inch heels pounding on linoleum
as he goes to a city council meeting.

204
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,000
Hello Harold. Couldn't be better.
How are you? Good. Yeah, no.

205
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:41,360
Call Us, you know, city
elitist or whatever.

206
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,360
But a mayor in a plunging v-neck
sweater and a black miniskirt.

207
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,350
Not what you would expect. Any
tiny conservative Republican town.

208
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,580
So we wanted to know, you know,
why did this happen here? Wow.

209
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,550
So producer Aaron Scott and I walked
around town for a couple of days and we

210
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:59,400
interviewed dozens of people, including
gentleman, guy named Ken Hector,

211
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,110
who stu beat out for mayor.
He's a conservative Republican.

212
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:05,000
Definitely not one of Steve's big fans.

213
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,860
It was just a difference in philosophy
about, I don't want to sound pretentious,

214
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:10,820
but you know, as a mayor,

215
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:15,170
I think there's certain expectations
about professionalism that you should

216
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:15,800
exhibit.

217
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,800
He would come in with a tight clinging
top with cleavage down to here that

218
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,990
you're almost pointing at your belly
button there a little bit higher. Come on.

219
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:26,090
You know when you're
at the council meeting,

220
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,120
show some dignity here and just dress
in the appropriate attire for the

221
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:36,230
occasion. Can't even try to get the city
council to impose a dress code on Stu.

222
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,060
But when we asked them, you know,

223
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:42,350
are you surprised that the town has
embraced stu and even gone so far as to

224
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:46,580
elect a mayor? He said, uh,
no, not in this case. You know,

225
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,010
is a rarity in that. You know,

226
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:51,950
there's a lot of people in this
town who are extremely religious,

227
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,720
very conservative people were at a
stranger who came into town suddenly,

228
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,510
I'm sure that the support and
perception might've been different.

229
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:02,450
But you're talking about a
native son who grew up here

230
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,010
and he said, still runs
the only theater in town.

231
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:10,940
So he's out there every weekend standing
out in front of the palace or taking

232
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:13,330
tickets. Everybody knows
him. Not only that anymore,

233
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,770
back in the day he used
to be the cable guys.

234
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,960
So he's literally been
in everybody's homes.

235
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:20,240
He's still the guy you call if you
have trouble with your computer.

236
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,120
So it might sound strange
to you, but it's really not.

237
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:29,170
And that is when it hit me actually
under the right circumstances.

238
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,050
A small town can be like the
most progressive place on earth.

239
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,300
Oh. [inaudible]

240
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,910
and it's exactly because
everyone's all up in your grill.

241
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,900
You were forced to know people. Like for
instance, how long have you known sue?

242
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,090
Oh my goodness. I grew up with
Stu. I mean we, um, I read,

243
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:53,270
everyone's do is like an alter boy.
The church is my brother. This is Suzy.

244
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:57,020
Seamless retired t-shirts. Yeah, his
parents and my parents were friends.

245
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,780
Like a lot of folks in Silverton,
she has known stu for so long and,

246
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:04,010
and in so many different contexts that
you can't do that New York thing with

247
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:04,401
him. Where are you?

248
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:07,390
Like you see someone on the sidewalk
and you size them up instantly and think

249
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,210
freak no to her. He's way too
complicated for that, you know,

250
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:15,290
to her he's do the alter boys
do the computer games? Yeah,

251
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:20,210
I probably would call McGee to do the
city council man is do the mayor or he's

252
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,040
just do just do, just, just do whatever.

253
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,340
That's him. You know, go on about
your business. You have to be clear.

254
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:30,890
A lot of the people we
talk to these facts,

255
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:33,710
some of the same folks
who said yes dues just to,

256
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,980
are still not happy about
the situation. No. I mean,

257
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,520
I don't think that's across dresser.
They either felt it was morally wrong.

258
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,110
As in the case of this minister
Tom Smith and Genesis one 27 says,

259
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,710
so God created man in his
own image. In the more,

260
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,970
some folks like Linda Webb's husband
John just felt like he takes it way too

261
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:57,950
far. It's right there. It's in your face.
He dresses Kinda like a streetwalker.

262
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,410
You feel that that's
confrontational? I do,

263
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,200
but most of the people who had objections,

264
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,930
it was a little more nuanced and
it went something like [inaudible].

265
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,860
Yes. Well, I,

266
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,280
my personally did not vote for him for
mayor because I didn't feel it was a good

267
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:15,660
idea to have someone that looked
like that representing us.

268
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:19,980
But on the other hand, he is a good
man and he's got this town at heart.

269
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,480
In other words, according to John Bach,

270
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,380
the problem really isn't stu or the
town or the way he gets the outside.

271
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,230
All those people out there who
are going to hear about stu

272
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,960
and then judge them,

273
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,910
which is what makes November 25th,
2008 such an interesting day.

274
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,980
Steve had just been elected mayor,

275
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,450
he'd squeaked it out by about 400 votes
but he hadn't yet been sworn in when a

276
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:48,470
group of Christian extremists from Kansas
showed up in town and started marching

277
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:52,550
up and down main street yelling at people
and at one point they even unfurled

278
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,020
and American flag put it on the ground
and stepped on it just to show how

279
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:57,440
offensive

280
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,280
they found students. It's our duty
to not here and preach to everyone.

281
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,750
Man is disgusting.

282
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:10,310
These folks hate stu cause they will
not by any means warn him about to send

283
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:11,964
this, taking him to hell

284
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,090
closet and then bringing up signs and
key things like a god hates overtake.

285
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,020
God hates your mayor. God
hates fags. Your pastor,

286
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:27,070
it's an abomination for a man put on a
woman's clothes and to be the opposite

287
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:31,570
sex. If he folks from the town decided
it's to start a counter protest,

288
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,190
we stood across the street from these
people by and large, just a few guys.

289
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:37,540
At first, no earlier,

290
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,930
someone had suggest all the guys ought
to dress up as girls and all the girls.

291
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:45,280
I did dress up these guys. Jase Davidson
said, isn't this a reaction? Was here,

292
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:49,740
right there? He was in a dress
every time. You Bet. Impressed.

293
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,390
[inaudible] but that really actually
was the first time he says it. At first,

294
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:57,300
he and the two or three other
guys who had on women's clothing,

295
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,240
it felt a little weird, but then

296
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,260
people just started coming.
It was just amazing.

297
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,350
Of a couple of hundred people.
I mean men dressed like women,

298
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,250
women dressed like men.

299
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:18,251
Some of the people that I sat down there
were surprising because I had labeled

300
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:23,531
them in my head as conservative and
people drive by people signs God loves.

301
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:28,970
So to God's love, Stu costumes,

302
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,080
the town was really alive when the crowd
just kept getting bigger and bigger.

303
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,200
Who were you? What were you thinking
at that moment? From what I understand,

304
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:38,870
you were standing off to the side just
watching what was going through your

305
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:39,641
mind. Yeah,

306
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:43,150
well honestly I tried to discourage people
from even giving them the time of day

307
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:46,990
saying, don't give them any attention.
I couldn't get that to happen.

308
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,440
They were so angry and

309
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,370
they came out 200 people, men in dresses,

310
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,300
grandmothers, babies. That's,

311
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,940
it's just amazing that that
was the town. That wasn't me.

312
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,600
Sorry, I get a little emotional.

313
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,320
That must've been a turning point for you.

314
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,020
The biggest one? Yeah.

315
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,290
[inaudible]

316
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,830
perhaps to Aaron Scott who did a huge
chunk of the reporting for that piece in

317
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:41,630
co-produced it with me.
We'll be right back.

318
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,050
Okay. So that story with,
we did that about six,

319
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,080
maybe seven years ago and it just
feels like the world is different now.

320
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,680
Like with regards to transgender
issues, even the language we use,

321
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:58,150
I mean has changed it.

322
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:02,680
Back then we said transgendered and
now we would just say transgender,

323
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,100
but with Caitlyn Jenner in
the news and all this stuff,

324
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:11,101
we just thought wondered like how things
changed for stew in these last six,

325
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:12,364
seven years.

326
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,483
So

327
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,660
hello all the time on time

328
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,760
we decided to send producer, reporter
Aaron Scott back to Silverton,

329
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,240
sit down with stu and with
students, partner Victoria,

330
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,700
the headset just to catch up.

331
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,860
I mean it's been seven years since
our, we'll be going on seven years,

332
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,990
six years since we ran
the story the first time.

333
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,110
What has been going on in your world?

334
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,090
Well, since the election
that's been about it. So

335
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,810
the first thing you told me was that he
got reelected after two years and then

336
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:48,280
he was reelected again. And
then after years is mayor, he's,

337
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,670
he's no out of the game.

338
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,580
Hallelujah. I am truly
enjoying my vacation.

339
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,000
And he did tell me that back
when the story first aired,

340
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,370
things did get kind of nutty.

341
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,200
Well, you know, it's probably the most
unusual phone call we've ever received.

342
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,340
Worst Victoria and I were sitting at home,

343
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:09,880
the phone rang and it was as a
fellow from New York City who said,

344
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,890
I was bicycling on Manhattan listening
to the original radio lab piece,

345
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,630
and you thought it would be really
fun to do my life story as a musical.

346
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,690
I don't know what I feel, but I know
it's a big deal. Then they reveal

347
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,850
and he did. That fellow is Andrew Russell.

348
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,330
He put on a big production up in
Seattle. It got standing ovation.

349
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,950
It's the most surreal and
bizarre experience in my life.

350
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,980
Sitting in an auditorium with 400
strangers watching as in song and dance.

351
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,580
My life goes by.

352
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,670
He can call me, she and she can
call me. He and he can call me.

353
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:49,600
She and she can call me.
He and he can call me.

354
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,200
He and she can call me. She when you

355
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,440
refer to me by Jan.

356
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,730
So there was this musical
which seemed to do pretty well.

357
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,240
And then a movie producer
called him up and said that he,

358
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,070
he wanted to option Stew's life for a
movie and now Victoria says those whispers

359
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:10,790
that they used to get those have turned
into people wanting autographs or

360
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,640
stopping them in the shoe store
and saying, aren't you stew?

361
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:19,040
Aren't you that bear? Can I get a
picture with you? Sure, there's Israeli,

362
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,000
no, what's the big deal? God Woo.

363
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,640
But one of the most interesting things
for me was that a lot of that attention

364
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:28,760
was at the beginning these
days to says that, you know,

365
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:31,400
his transgender issues have grown in,

366
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:34,760
in the national news and on TV shows.

367
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,260
Stu says that back in Silverton,
the fact that he's transgender,

368
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,540
it's become pretty much passe.

369
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,210
So here we are,

370
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,790
Woo.

371
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,390
He says it's just kind of routine
now for him and everyone else,

372
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,950
except he did say there's this one
thing every time the story airs or re,

373
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,100
which it does from time to time

374
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,100
when it, when it goes, the phone starts
ringing and we can tell where it's from.

375
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,770
He says he gets these calls from people
who are struggling with their own gender

376
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:09,610
issues or trying to figure out how to
come out to their families and people

377
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:11,040
actually call your home phone.

378
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,890
Yeah. Usually anonymously.

379
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,640
They won't identify themselves necessarily
because they're still either closeted

380
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:18,440
or not really ready to come
out, but they're saying,

381
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,940
thank you so much for being yourself
and for telling your story to others so

382
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:26,390
that I can, you know, I can validate
my life from that. Thank you.

383
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,350
Does that ever get old? Hm. No. Um,

384
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,900
for somebody who was in
the position that I was in,

385
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:39,460
made the change and then to have other
people either following along or,

386
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,490
you know, emulating it
in one way or another,

387
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,610
it's very gratifying because it validates
life and it says why you weren't a

388
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:51,250
complete waste of time. A lot more
than a lot of people get. Yeah.

389
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,320
[inaudible]

390
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,170
special thanks to producer Annie Mcewen
for helping us on all the tough day

391
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,020
parts of this year.
