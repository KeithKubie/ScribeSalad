a hundred and seventy five thousand
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.649
a hundred and seventy five thousand
dollars so twenty five thousand dollars

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
dollars so twenty five thousand dollars
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.870
dollars so twenty five thousand dollars
higher than the previous one but this

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880

time you know that other people like you
so peers and graduates from your same

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
so peers and graduates from your same
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.270
so peers and graduates from your same
program are being offered similar jobs

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
program are being offered similar jobs
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.789
program are being offered similar jobs
for a hundred and eighty five thousand

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
for a hundred and eighty five thousand
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.219
for a hundred and eighty five thousand
dollars what the data suggests is that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
dollars what the data suggests is that
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.569
dollars what the data suggests is that
if you were presented with this

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
if you were presented with this
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.639
if you were presented with this
situation you would tend to choose the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
situation you would tend to choose the
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.889
situation you would tend to choose the
first job the one that has a lower

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
first job the one that has a lower
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.819
first job the one that has a lower
salary and the reason is that the social

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829
salary and the reason is that the social
 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.410
salary and the reason is that the social
comparison that is triggered by the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
comparison that is triggered by the
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.590

second job is making you feel uneasy and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
second job is making you feel uneasy and
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749
second job is making you feel uneasy and

less but knowing that you fare as well
when comparing yourself to your peers so

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
when comparing yourself to your peers so
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.240
when comparing yourself to your peers so
social comparison can really come in the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
social comparison can really come in the
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.429
social comparison can really come in the
way of good decision making and can be

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
way of good decision making and can be
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.729
way of good decision making and can be
realized as we implement our plans so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
realized as we implement our plans so
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.589
realized as we implement our plans so
what should we do about that

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599
what should we do about that
 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.630
what should we do about that
once again the solution is in a sense

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640
once again the solution is in a sense
 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.390
once again the solution is in a sense
intuitive but difficult to apply as

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400
intuitive but difficult to apply as
 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.489
intuitive but difficult to apply as
we're making decision we should ask

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:19.499
we're making decision we should ask
 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.099
we're making decision we should ask
ourselves questions about the

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109
ourselves questions about the
 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.379
ourselves questions about the
information that we are using to make

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389
information that we are using to make
 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.539
information that we are using to make
those decisions and whether it's

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549
those decisions and whether it's
 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.030
those decisions and whether it's
information about ourselves only or

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040
information about ourselves only or
 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.610
