00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.010
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So did you realize that Harry Houdini was the

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.070
first person to fly an airplane in Australia? I didn't either, that's crazy.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.170
In fact this guy's whole life was interesting because he lived it out daily cheating death

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.220
in front of thousands of people. Now this eventually caught up.. What's in your ear?

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.260
Oh, it's a rock in your ear. Magic.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.310
So this is convenient because Harry Houdini was Jewish, and it's a Jewish custom

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.370
if you're going to honor the dead to go and lay a rock on top of their tombstone. Why don't we do that?

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.430
Let's go to Queens New York where he has a really cool tombstone and we'll lay this rock

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.450
there and I'll explain to you how Harry Houdini died.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.490
Houdini was a genius. He became famous by putting himself in seemingly impossible situations

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.530
and then he would miraculously appear as though he had just cheated death.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.610
So what put him in the ground here in New York? Since many people had a fear of drowning

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.670
Houdini often did tricks that involved being chained up under water. His most famous

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.740
trick was called the Chinese water torture trick. For some reason I thought that he had drowned

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.760
when this trick went horribly wrong, but in actuality it was only a punch to the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.810
gut that did him in. Houdini was famous for being able to take a punch but on

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820
October 22nd 1926 while he was laying on a couch backstage in

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.870
Montreal, a man punched him several times before he had a chance to brace himself.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.890
According to his death certificate he died on Halloween from something called peritonitis.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.900
So how could a punch in the stomach lead to Houdini's death when he had done it before?

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.980
OK we're back in Alabama. To figure this out, we have come to the hospital.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.030
We're gonna meet a surgeon that I've known for a long time. He's known for his steady hand

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.060
and his good bedside manner. Let's go meet Dr Gilbert. Long time no see.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.140
How you been?
(Dr Gilbert) Hey it's been a long time. You look good man. You look like you've put a bit of weight on.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.210
- Oh thanks I appreciate that. [laugh]
- Looks like she's fattened you up. [laughs]
- OK so clearly

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.250
I've known Dr Gilbert for a long time, he let me in his O.R. So I've asked you

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.270
to tell me about Houdini's death, and we know it's, how do you say it?

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.320
Periton..
- Peritonitis.
- Peritonitis, OK. So let's say he got punched in the guts,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.380
Houdini's laying on this table right now, and uh, what do you do?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.440
- Well, Houdini, once he gets to this table he's already

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.490
consented to surgery. The first thing you have to do is get him..

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.540
we have to examine him, say you do have peritonitis, you have

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.600
an irritation of your abdominal lining, you clearly have a surgical problem.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.620
It could have been appendicitis, but appendicitis typically doesn't happen because

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.640
of trauma. It would have been a serendipitous occasion

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.680
after the trauma. What he might very well have had is

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.720
a rupture of his intestine.
- So when you take a punch in your guts, what's happening

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.770
there? I know muscles have something to do with it.
- If you're prepared you're gonna tense up your

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.840
muscles and they are absorbing almost all of the energy of the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.840
punch, and your internal organs are seeing much less of

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.870
that energy.
- So it's like distributing that load around your abdomen.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.890
- That's right. Now, if he's caught off guard, and somebody who really knows how

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.980
to throw a punch, and really prepare for..

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.010
he could be hurt.
- [laughs] I punched a guy in the stomach and I recorded

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.130
on high speed. Now I was trying to figure out how to transition to it, but you kind of alluded to the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.160
fact that I don't know how to throw a punch.
- Well no I wasn't saying that. [laughs]
- [laughs]

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.240
(Destin) OK this is Mike from SixPackShortcuts
- I guess you have to hit my stomach right?
- I gotta hit your stomach.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.270
So Mike, he's that sexy guy you always see in the side bar that really

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.330
irritates people like me, because I don't look like that. [crowd laughs]

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.390
- [punch to skin] Oh-hhhhhaww.
- Alright. I think we got it. Are you good?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.440
- I'm good.
- You can take that?
- Yes.
- OK alright, let's see.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.450
Now watch Mike's muscles absorb this punch at 3200 frames per second.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.490
[music]

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:58.700
 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.750
- He just socked me in the stomach, and we just

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.790
watched in slow mo and it was awesome.
(Destin) And now we're about to watch

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.820
your boobs bounce right?
- Yes.
- Moobies are about to bounce in high speed. [laugh]

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.840
Alright. OK, before you go watch Mike's boobs bounce, which is something I hope I never say again,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.900
and before you see Dr Gilbert teach me how to throw a punch I figured I'd mention this book,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.970
which was instrumental in making this video. Go to audible.com/smarter

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.030
and you can download The Secret Life of Houdini. It's a pretty cool book and it's one of the more expensive

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.060
audio books, so you can use your free trial at Audible.com to download this

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.100
thing. It's probably worth it. Anyway it taught me about how Houdini's personality played a

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.130
factor into his death because initially he refused surgery.
- His personality

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.170
had to be a very strong personality, and a man that obviously

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.180
takes risk.
(Destin) He actually refused treatment and that was part of the problem right?

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.270
- That was the problem, but he needed it framed

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.350
in the proper way.
- So you're saying that the bedside manner,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.360
how a patient and a doctor interact is very important, that's what you're trying to tell me.
- Yes, yes,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.410
and depending on the personality of the physician with a very strong patient

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.460
such as Houdini, I could see that it may have been very difficult

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.500
for the physician to have made his point.
- That's pretty crazy isn't it? Anyway, check out this book

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.550
The Secret Life of Houdini at audible.com/smarter. Listening to audio books

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.600
is probably something you should be doing anyway. You might as well help Smarter Every Day out by downloading one at

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.620

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.660
you wanna watch. OK I must admit this is the first time I've ever focused on a man's

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.710
nipple. Go.
[laugh]

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.760
(Destin) This is messed up! Put your shirt on, now! [laugh]

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.800
[music]

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:51.920
 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.940
- This is Master Burwell. He is our

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.990
Tae Kwon Do master.
(Destin) That's fancy. Tell me what you think.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.980
 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.040
- No hit reaction.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.090
Your wrist caved. Earlier when you did it you did this. You collapsed because

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.140
you didn't lock your wrist. Wrist maintained straight. [shout]

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160
(Destin) So your wrist didn't fold.
- Not at all.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.220
[shout]
- So there you have it. Houdini was killed by a punch, and possibly

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.260
just a little bit of his own ego.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.290
 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.340
