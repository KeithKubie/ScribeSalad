00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.160
Agustín Da Silva is from Misiones, a province in northeast Argentina
that’s known for its yerba mate.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.960
More than 700,000 tons of yerba mate are harvested here each year.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.720
90 percent of the workers are indigenous Guaraní and underage.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.960
Agustín was exceptional.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.360
He could pick 650 pounds of yerba mate in 10 to 12 hours. For that, he'd take home $8 a day.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.480
But his fate changed the morning he met Irma Silvera.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.200
While in school, Agustín fell in love with running.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.660
Agustín's living conditions did not go unnoticed.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.860
A newspaper story questioned his future as a runner because of his poor nutrition.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.760
Agustin used that article to find a food sponsor.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.360
Private sponsors give Agustín money when he wins a race.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.340
And it's much more than what his family make picking yerba mate.
