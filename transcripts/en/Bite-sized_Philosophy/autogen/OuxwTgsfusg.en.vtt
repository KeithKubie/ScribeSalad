hopping on this boat and I'm getting as
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.729
hopping on this boat and I'm getting as
far away from that city as I possibly

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
far away from that city as I possibly
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.579
far away from that city as I possibly
can and so he does that and then the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
can and so he does that and then the
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.770
can and so he does that and then the

well you all know that you / you know

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
well you all know that you / you know
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.480
well you all know that you / you know
that perfectly well it's how all you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
that perfectly well it's how all you
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.609
that perfectly well it's how all you
have to do is not study for an exam that

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
have to do is not study for an exam that
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.410

you know that's coming up to see

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
you know that's coming up to see
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359
you know that's coming up to see
everything start to the storm water

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
everything start to the storm water
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.069
everything start to the storm water
start to rise and everything start to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
start to rise and everything start to
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.499
start to rise and everything start to
rock it's pretty bloody obvious so

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
rock it's pretty bloody obvious so
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.120
rock it's pretty bloody obvious so
anyways he's on this boat and there's a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
anyways he's on this boat and there's a
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.630
anyways he's on this boat and there's a
storm and all of the people on the boat

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
storm and all of the people on the boat
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.810
storm and all of the people on the boat
who can't quite discriminate chaos from

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
who can't quite discriminate chaos from
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.399
who can't quite discriminate chaos from
weather because they haven't

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
weather because they haven't
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.260
weather because they haven't
differentiated the world to that degree

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
differentiated the world to that degree
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.500
differentiated the world to that degree
think oh the boat wouldn't be about to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
think oh the boat wouldn't be about to
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.730
think oh the boat wouldn't be about to
be swamped if we had

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
be swamped if we had
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.070
be swamped if we had
some of us had done something stupid and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080
some of us had done something stupid and
 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.040
some of us had done something stupid and
wrong and there's logic in that you know

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050
wrong and there's logic in that you know
 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.990
wrong and there's logic in that you know
you might think well God has nothing

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000
you might think well God has nothing
 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.520
you might think well God has nothing
personal against you because of the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
personal against you because of the
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.470
personal against you because of the
storm so you're confusing levels of

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
storm so you're confusing levels of
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.970
storm so you're confusing levels of
analysis but you got to give these

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
analysis but you got to give these
 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.130
analysis but you got to give these
people some credit it's like maybe they

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
people some credit it's like maybe they
 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.450
people some credit it's like maybe they
did do something stupid

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460
did do something stupid
 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.010
did do something stupid
maybe they didn't caulk the damn boat

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020
maybe they didn't caulk the damn boat
 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.320
maybe they didn't caulk the damn boat
properly maybe the ropes aren't in as

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330
properly maybe the ropes aren't in as
 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.910
properly maybe the ropes aren't in as
good a shape as they might be maybe they

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920
good a shape as they might be maybe they
 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.380
good a shape as they might be maybe they
weren't paying attention to the weather

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
weren't paying attention to the weather
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.540
weren't paying attention to the weather
when they went out on the ocean you know

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550
when they went out on the ocean you know
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.880
when they went out on the ocean you know
or maybe they haven't made peace with

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890
or maybe they haven't made peace with
 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.380
or maybe they haven't made peace with
their brother and so their hearts are

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
their brother and so their hearts are
 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.330
their brother and so their hearts are
bent twisted out of shape so they don't

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
bent twisted out of shape so they don't
 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.610
bent twisted out of shape so they don't
make particularly good sailors it's like

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
make particularly good sailors it's like
 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.350
make particularly good sailors it's like
the idea that you encounter a storm

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360
the idea that you encounter a storm
 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.880
the idea that you encounter a storm
because you're stupid and wrong is a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890
because you're stupid and wrong is a
 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.280
because you're stupid and wrong is a
really good idea even though it's not of

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290
really good idea even though it's not of
 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.040
really good idea even though it's not of
infinite applicability anyways they draw

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050
infinite applicability anyways they draw
 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.100
infinite applicability anyways they draw
a lot it's a primitive thing to do it's

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
a lot it's a primitive thing to do it's
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.380
a lot it's a primitive thing to do it's
like well it's one is someone's fault we

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390
like well it's one is someone's fault we
 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.090
like well it's one is someone's fault we
don't know who we're going to throw

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100
don't know who we're going to throw
 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.180
don't know who we're going to throw
someone overboard the worst sinner

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190
someone overboard the worst sinner
 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.380
someone overboard the worst sinner
obviously that's what God wants some

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390
obviously that's what God wants some
 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.210
obviously that's what God wants some
kind of sacrifice so they all draw lots

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
kind of sacrifice so they all draw lots
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.490
kind of sacrifice so they all draw lots
and someone loses and then Jonah stands

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
and someone loses and then Jonah stands
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.620
and someone loses and then Jonah stands
up and says well sorry guys like I know

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630
up and says well sorry guys like I know
 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.480
up and says well sorry guys like I know
that I've got a problem with God at the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490
that I've got a problem with God at the
 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.310
that I've got a problem with God at the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320
moment so it's probably me you better
 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.990
