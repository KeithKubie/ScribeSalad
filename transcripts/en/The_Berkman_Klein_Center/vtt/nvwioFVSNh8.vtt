00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.480
My name is Kathy Pham and I am a Harvard
Berkman Klein Fellow for the 2017-2018

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.420
year. Having worked with both a
large tech company, as well as within the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.550
federal government, I constantly think
about how do we build products that are

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.439
responsible and ethical and take into
account our users? Another focus is the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.109
intersection of government and technology.
How do we get policy folks interested in,

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.000
but also understanding technology, as
well as getting technologists, whether

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.280
they're engineers, or product managers, or
designers, interested in public service

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.500
or working in the federal government. In
my early days as a software engineer the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.640
topics around users and the user
experience of something, or even the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.789
broader social impact of what we build
wasn't always there, either. One of the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.289
things that has come up here at
Berkman is attacking it from the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.619
curricula level of really teaching our
computer scientists and engineers how to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.700
critically think about the effects in
the long term, or even short term effects,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.610
of what we build. Think about some of
the implications of collecting data.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.159
Think about what happens when the data is
stored long term. Think about how

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.540
something can be misused or not used the
way we intended for it to be used.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.579
What can we do in the policy space that
makes sense? You know, it gets tricky

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.570
because we we get into the free speech
realm of we don't want to restrict the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.920
ability to build products or people's
freedom of speech on different platforms,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.170
but what is the responsibility of tech
companies in looking at their users? How

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.939
can we use technology to really provide
better government services for people,

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.090
people who can't go in-person to
different government service locations

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.759
to get care, whether they're veterans, or
people who need to get services. How can

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.500
we use technology to really make their
lives a lot better? I constantly think,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.509
I'm very excited about different ways
that technology can be used to provide

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.000
care services to maybe our most
vulnerable populations or people who

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.080
need help the most.
