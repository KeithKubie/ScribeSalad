00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.370
Hi!

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.370
I'm Trace!

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.370
And I'm a clone of Trace.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.370
We're exactly the same.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.530
Or not really at all.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.290
Howdy Islanders, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.589
Yes, it's really me.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.130
Cloning has come a long way since the famous
sheep clone of 1996.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.640
Now, for only tens of thousands of dollars,
you too can clone your pet so you'll never

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.470
have to learn to love again.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.480
But c'mon.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.330
Cher would be disappointed in you.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.800
Cloning pets has been going on for years.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.440
The first reported cloned pet was a cat named
"Little Nicky" born to a Texas woman in late-2004.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.460
It set her back fifty grand, but she claimed
she got her friend back.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.770
Now, only 12 years later, firms are promising
to clone dogs for twice that price, but can

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.129
also clone cows, pigs and horses!

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.640
How it works is simple: DNA is taken from
a cell of your deceased Fido, and inserted

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.100
into a donor doggie egg cell which is then
in-vitro fertilized into a surrogate mom dog.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.440
Two months later, (if all goes well) you have
a puppy Fido clone!

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.149
The thing is, it's not actually Fido…

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.870
Sure, Fido (or Fluffy's) genes would be exactly
the same, but genetics are not 100-percent

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.870
of an organism -- especially when it comes
to personality.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.800
A lot of who we are is shaped by our life
experiences!

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.540
So, the discussion is really about nature
versus nurture.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.690
According to the FDA's advisories on cloning,
"Temperament is only partly determined by

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.690
genetics."

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.400
So, a dog, cat, horse, or whatever... has
learned to love or be afraid of things based

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.650
on experiences -- the same as you!

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.840
A clone of you might not see Arachnophobia
at your Aunt's house when you were six, so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.750
wouldn't develop a fear of spiders!

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.160
Like… some people did.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.530
Or to bring it back to pets, if your original
dog say, injured itself on a merry-go-round,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.800
it might learn to avoid them in the future;
the clone would not have learned that lesson

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.480
and thus would maybe love merry-go-rounds!

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.060
Cause who doesn't?!

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.810
As the FDA put it, a clone of a calm horse,
"would have to have exactly the same life

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.880
experiences as [the] original horse in order
to have the same temperament."

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.590
The thing is, there aren't really any studies
with cloned pets, because more people clone

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.450
livestock, but these issues definitely play
out.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.819
For example, a couple who got two clones of
their dog Melvin told NPR, "[one of the clones]

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.099
is more of a loner."

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.599
I.E. -- it’s not exactly the same, but similar.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.980
The clone of a famous Brahmin bull named Chance
(the clone was named Second Chance) looked

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.000
the same, slept in the same place, and had
similar quirks when eating, but was not nearly

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.090
as docile -- it threw and gored it's owner,
putting him in the hospital twice!

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.030
And in a 2003 study of cloned pig behavior,
they found cloned pigs raised in the same

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.280
environment didn't have the same behaviors.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.970
And in a 2010 study that looked at the behavior
of cloned cows, they found discrimination

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.260
in the herd, clones favored each other's company
over cows produced by artificial insemination…

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.360
creepy.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.580
Ultimately, cloned pets will never have the
exact same experiences with the exact same

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.900
results as your original pet.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.400
So sure, you can clone Dagger Thunderfang,
but he's not going to be the same little guy.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.019
And, honestly, in part that's probably because
of us too!

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.879
If you spent years training your dog as a
teenager, then replaced that dog with a clone

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.670
when you're 30, the clone would need years
of training as well, but because you're not

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.989
the same person you were then the clone would
get trained differently.

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.329
It's a different animal!

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.249
Even if Dagger looked the same (and there's
no guarantee that he will) you can learn to

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.769
love him again, or just save 100,000 dollars
and go get a rescue.

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:33.849
They need love too.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.739
If you love the cutest animals, even pandas…

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.819
Animal Planet has a great show called Panda
Republic, I've been watching it on Animal

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.239
Planet Go, and they're damn cute.

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.530
You can watch it too, or any other Animal
Planet show -- just download Animal Planet

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.849
GO at your app store, or use the link in the
description.

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.629
Have you ever wondered how they make new dog
breeds?

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.629
I'm sure you have.

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.129
Don't worry, we have a video about that here.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.129
Would you clone your pet?
