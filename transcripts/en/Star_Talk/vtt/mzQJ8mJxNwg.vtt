00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:02.637
- This is StarTalk.

00:00:02.637 --> 00:00:04.413
I'm your host, Neil deGrasse Tyson,

00:00:04.413 --> 00:00:06.419
your personal Astrophysicist,

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.432
and I'm here today with
comedian extraordinaire

00:00:09.432 --> 00:00:10.580
Russell Peters.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.783
Russell, dude!
- Neil.

00:00:11.783 --> 00:00:13.166
- First time on StarTalk!

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.393
- First time, first time
caller, longtime fan.

00:00:16.393 --> 00:00:19.652
- Oh, well thank you, for
your enthusiasm, and--

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:20.596
- It's real.

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:22.084
- I believe it's real.

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:25.251
I heard rumors that you
were on some other show

00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:27.133
and said who'd you want
to have dinner with,

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.370
and I came up in the list.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.173
- You were the number one person.

00:00:30.173 --> 00:00:31.733
- [Neil] Okay, well we're
testing you on the show first

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.779
before we make the dinner plans.

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:33.854
- Okay, go ahead.

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:34.687
(laughing)

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:35.520
Go for it, yeah.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.349
Yeah, before I invite you out.

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:38.494
- So thanks for doing this.

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:41.773
Today is an episode of Cosmic Queries.

00:00:41.773 --> 00:00:44.229
Every now and then, we gather questions

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.478
that we've either solicited or trickled in

00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:47.978
from our fan base,

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:52.982
and the topic today is
Everyday Astrophysics.

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:55.693
You didn't know there
was such a thing, huh?

00:00:55.693 --> 00:00:58.454
- Well, I mean, would this
be astrophysics for dummies?

00:00:58.454 --> 00:00:59.994
(laughing)

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:00.946
- I don't know, actually.

00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:02.763
You've been handed the
question, I haven't seen them.

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:03.650
- Oh, I've got the questions.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.532
- You've got all the questions.

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:05.543
- These are actually really good questions

00:01:05.543 --> 00:01:06.655
from what I can see so far.

00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:07.488
- Okay.

00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:08.321
Well that...

00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:09.154
- I'm impressed and I'm like

00:01:09.154 --> 00:01:10.864
oh good that's a question I
would like to know as well.

00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:11.922
- Well that's good.

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:13.146
You can pick 'em that way.

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:15.003
But before we get into that, remind me.

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:18.245
You're on the road all the time touring.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:19.078
- Constantly.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:20.014
- Constantly.

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:21.613
- It's all I know, 30 years of this.

00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:23.012
- Where is home?

00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:25.692
Or is it in some bus somewhere?

00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:27.537
- Well, technically, home is...

00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:29.443
Well, I guess technically home is Toronto.

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:30.406
- [Neil] Born and raised in Toronto.

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:31.624
- Born and raised in Toronto.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:32.457
- [Neil] Okay.

00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:33.594
- But I've been living in
'Merica for 13 years now.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:34.427
- [Neil] 'Merica.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.656
- 'Merica, 13 years now.

00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:36.558
- 13 damn years.

00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:37.610
- I'll tell you what boy.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.443
- Tell you what.

00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:40.672
- I'll tell you what, you
need the H in front of it.

00:01:40.672 --> 00:01:42.151
(laughing)

00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:43.720
- Boy.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.740
So no, it's great to know
that you're out there

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.402
and you've been doing this a long time.

00:01:48.402 --> 00:01:50.069
So just trying to...

00:01:51.087 --> 00:01:53.489
Make comedic sense of the world for us

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:55.148
'cause we need some laughs.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.132
- Lemme tell you something,

00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:57.686
this world definitely needs some laughs.

00:01:57.686 --> 00:01:58.519
(laughing)

00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:59.540
It needs something.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.089
It needs laughs before
that asteroid hits us.

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:02.575
(laughing)

00:02:02.575 --> 00:02:03.408
- And when you're done with this,

00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:04.592
get the hell back out there.

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:05.425
- That's right.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.507
- Get back to work.

00:02:06.507 --> 00:02:07.557
So what do you have for us?

00:02:07.557 --> 00:02:08.526
- All right, you ready?

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:09.411
- Yeah.

00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:10.617
- Renee Douglas--

00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:12.582
- We are duty-bound to make sure

00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:14.005
the first question is from a Patreon.

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:15.116
- Oh yeah, absolutely,
that's what I'm reading.

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:16.218
- That's what are you reading, okay.

00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:18.937
- Renee Douglas from
Patreon would like to know

00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:22.585
why do you think Mercury
and Venus don't have moons?

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:24.236
- Ooh.

00:02:24.236 --> 00:02:25.570
Ooh.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.736
Hmm, well Mercury's pretty small.

00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:28.819
Mercury is...

00:02:32.403 --> 00:02:35.828
Mercury is, I forgot whether
it's just slightly bigger

00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:38.509
or just slightly smaller than our moon,

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.502
but it's small.

00:02:40.502 --> 00:02:43.088
It's much denser, it has a huge iron core,

00:02:43.088 --> 00:02:44.636
so it's much heavier than the moon.

00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:48.386
So it's got planet mass
but its size is small

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:52.447
and it's hard to have
something else orbiting you

00:02:52.447 --> 00:02:53.805
when you're small.

00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:57.165
Jupiter is huge, has more mass
than all the other planets

00:02:57.165 --> 00:03:01.050
in the Solar System and it
has 60 plus moons orbiting it.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.883
- 60 plus?

00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:05.408
- It's own mini planetary
system, if you will.

00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:09.814
But the act of being small
doesn't preclude having moons,

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:11.437
it's just harder when you're that small

00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:13.492
and orbiting that close to the Sun

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:17.575
because then you have a
gravitational tug of war.

00:03:18.623 --> 00:03:19.751
Who's your daddy?

00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.739
Who's your gravitational allegiance?

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:22.748
- Who's your gravity daddy?

00:03:22.748 --> 00:03:23.759
- Who's your gravity daddy?

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.811
(laughing)

00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:27.635
So by the way, Pluto and is all so small.

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:30.928
They're like six moons in the
Solar System bigger than Pluto

00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:32.794
but Pluto has multiple moons.

00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:35.163
The point is that far
out in the Solar System

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:38.758
there's very little sort of
gravitational disturbances

00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:39.837
from other objects.

00:03:39.837 --> 00:03:44.170
So you can sustain orbits
however delicate they are.

00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:48.542
- I always thought was
thought sizes indicative

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:52.268
of whether it was allowed
to be a planet or a moon.

00:03:52.268 --> 00:03:53.171
- No.

00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:55.099
Well sort of, okay.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.145
So it's turns out if
you're really, really small

00:03:57.145 --> 00:04:00.598
your gravity loses to
the structural integrity

00:04:00.598 --> 00:04:02.054
of the object.

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:05.363
So the rock will take
whatever shape it wants.

00:04:05.363 --> 00:04:07.873
So below a certain size
stuff in the Solar System

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:09.755
looks like Idaho potatoes.

00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:10.851
- Yes, I've seen those.

00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:11.684
(laughing)

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.084
I've seen the pictures.

00:04:13.084 --> 00:04:13.917
- You've seen the pictures?

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:14.750
You've seen...

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.991
in fact I used to have one here.

00:04:15.991 --> 00:04:17.320
Yeah, in fact right up there.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.954
Can you reach up and grab that.

00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:20.082
You can reach up.

00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:20.915
You get it.

00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:22.119
- [Russell] Lemme grab your potato.

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:22.952
(laughing)

00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:25.226
- Just grab that, this is a precise model.

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:29.143
Anyhow so this is a model
of an actual asteroid

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.512
and this is sufficiently small,

00:04:32.512 --> 00:04:36.520
that it takes whatever shape
the rocks demand of it.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.518
Rocks take their own shape
based on the chemistry

00:04:39.518 --> 00:04:40.816
and how they formed.

00:04:40.816 --> 00:04:43.812
But if this object were larger

00:04:43.812 --> 00:04:45.594
then the gravity of the object says

00:04:45.594 --> 00:04:49.244
I'm trying to get everything
as close to the middle as I can

00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:51.113
and there's only one shape you take

00:04:51.113 --> 00:04:53.370
if everybody tries to
get close to the middle

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.525
and that's a sphere.

00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:57.556
So to be a planet you got to be big enough

00:04:57.556 --> 00:04:59.938
and have enough mass to be a sphere.

00:04:59.938 --> 00:05:01.698
But that's not the only rule.

00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:03.657
Pluto is big enough to be a sphere.

00:05:03.657 --> 00:05:08.654
Now we say in your orbit
we want you to be dominant.

00:05:08.654 --> 00:05:12.168
We don't want anything else
competing with your orbit.

00:05:12.168 --> 00:05:16.265
So Pluto it's orbiting what
we call the Kuiper belt,

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:19.122
there's thousands of other
objects orbiting out there

00:05:19.122 --> 00:05:19.955
with Pluto.

00:05:19.955 --> 00:05:21.188
- It's littered, right?

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:22.422
- [Neil] It's littered, great word,

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.129
just like the asteroid belt.

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.962
- Correct.

00:05:24.962 --> 00:05:28.059
- Littered, so nobody in
the asteroid belt owns

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:32.137
the space of objects so
they're all asteroids

00:05:32.137 --> 00:05:33.302
even though one of the asteroids is

00:05:33.302 --> 00:05:34.827
big enough to be a sphere

00:05:34.827 --> 00:05:36.219
and Pluto's big enough to be a sphere.

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.944
So the rules are are you
big enough to be round

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:40.535
and significant enough in your--

00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:42.384
(laughing)

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.293
- I'm a little sensitive, but thank you.

00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:48.091
- Big enough to be round
and are you dominant enough

00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:50.278
in your orbit to have cleared it out

00:05:50.278 --> 00:05:53.011
so basically you're the only game in town?

00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:55.031
And you have to satisfy both of those

00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:57.296
then you're a legit planet
in the in the rules.

00:05:57.296 --> 00:05:58.946
- Are we...

00:05:58.946 --> 00:06:02.531
could we effectively be
seen as all our planets

00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:04.240
as moons for the Sun?

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.347
- I don't see why not

00:06:06.347 --> 00:06:09.552
except because the Sun
is alive with energy

00:06:09.552 --> 00:06:12.803
we have a different designation
for it because it's hot.

00:06:12.803 --> 00:06:13.788
(laughing)

00:06:13.788 --> 00:06:14.992
- It's warm.

00:06:14.992 --> 00:06:17.028
Hot's a little overrated,

00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:18.352
but it's a little warm, it's warm.

00:06:18.352 --> 00:06:19.185
- Yeah you would vaporize.

00:06:19.185 --> 00:06:20.164
- It's muggy.

00:06:20.164 --> 00:06:21.178
(laughing)

00:06:21.178 --> 00:06:22.951
- I could take the heat, it's
jUst the humidity on the Sun

00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:24.199
that I can't handle.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.712
So you can think of it that way

00:06:26.712 --> 00:06:29.479
and not to like over run this answer,

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.171
but people wondered a
hundred years ago or more,

00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:36.047
you know the turn of the previous century,

00:06:36.047 --> 00:06:37.438
wait a minute,

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:41.388
if the Solar System has a
star and planets that orbited

00:06:41.388 --> 00:06:43.911
and planets have moons that orbit them,

00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:47.911
atoms have nuclei and
electrons that orbit them,

00:06:49.628 --> 00:06:52.919
maybe it's that all the way down?

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.039
- That's fair.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.867
- Or all the way up, right?

00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:58.307
So we have a galaxy, there's
a center of the galaxy,

00:06:58.307 --> 00:07:00.329
and our whole Solar System
is orbiting the galaxy,

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:04.246
maybe it's just Solar
Systems all the way down.

00:07:05.114 --> 00:07:06.705
But you get to the size of the atom

00:07:06.705 --> 00:07:08.297
and there's nothing smaller than that,

00:07:08.297 --> 00:07:09.615
there's nothing smaller than the particles

00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:10.979
that make up the nucleus.

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:11.812
So.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.488
- Except for antimatter.

00:07:14.488 --> 00:07:15.513
- No there's a--

00:07:15.513 --> 00:07:16.621
(laughing)

00:07:16.621 --> 00:07:17.454
You wish.

00:07:17.454 --> 00:07:18.287
- See what I did there?

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:19.120
- Yeah.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.345
(laughing)

00:07:21.345 --> 00:07:26.012
So there isn't some other
structure of the natural world

00:07:27.525 --> 00:07:30.991
that we have yet discovered
nor that we think is there.

00:07:30.991 --> 00:07:33.490
If you probe the atom
and look at the nucleus

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.602
and say oh, there's another
layer right on down.

00:07:35.602 --> 00:07:37.109
No, we ain't finding that.

00:07:37.109 --> 00:07:38.879
- Well that was Renee
Douglas from Pittsburgh.

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:39.712
- Okay.

00:07:39.712 --> 00:07:40.844
- You want this one, you ready?

00:07:40.844 --> 00:07:42.143
- [Neil] It's up to you.

00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:43.475
You don't even have to go in order.

00:07:43.475 --> 00:07:45.558
- Okay, well that's good.

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:50.362
What would the climate be like on Earth

00:07:50.362 --> 00:07:52.319
if it wasn't for the axial tilt?

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:54.215
That was from Michel Grote.

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:55.301
- Oh, yeah.

00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:56.436
So that's a good one.

00:07:56.436 --> 00:07:59.935
So this is someone who
knows that earth is tipped

00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:03.199
on its axis relative to
our orbit around the Sun.

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:04.561
So it tips like this.

00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:06.622
Tipped 23 and 1/2 degrees.

00:08:06.622 --> 00:08:10.284
In fact, this is tipped
at exactly that angle.

00:08:10.284 --> 00:08:12.359
- That's an Asian one.

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:14.798
- In case you were wondering.

00:08:14.798 --> 00:08:16.177
Got Earth back there.

00:08:16.177 --> 00:08:17.453
Let me get Earth, hold on.

00:08:17.453 --> 00:08:19.391
- [Russell] That's the one I remember.

00:08:19.391 --> 00:08:21.266
- Yeah so this is...

00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:23.495
so I'm holding in my lap for
those who are only listening,

00:08:23.495 --> 00:08:24.732
a map of Earth--

00:08:24.732 --> 00:08:26.207
- Actually a globe.

00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:27.468
- [Neil] Thank you.

00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:28.665
(laughing)

00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:29.835
- Let me help you out with this there.

00:08:29.835 --> 00:08:31.094
- [Neil] Thank you, thank you.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.422
- Hang on there astro fella.

00:08:32.422 --> 00:08:33.402
(laughing)

00:08:33.402 --> 00:08:37.411
- It's a globe and it's
the kind of globe we see

00:08:37.411 --> 00:08:39.105
in social studies class

00:08:39.105 --> 00:08:41.478
because all the countries are color-coded,

00:08:41.478 --> 00:08:45.085
but of course Earth from space
shows no such color coding.

00:08:45.085 --> 00:08:46.630
- I know, it's weird how they did that.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.496
(laughing)

00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:50.759
I tend to believe this globe much more.

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:54.096
- So we're tipped on our
axis and it turns out

00:08:54.096 --> 00:08:57.856
that because of that tipping
for one part of the year

00:08:57.856 --> 00:09:00.545
the Northern Hemisphere
is tipped towards the Sun

00:09:00.545 --> 00:09:03.594
and six months later that same hemisphere

00:09:03.594 --> 00:09:04.984
is tipped away from the Sun.

00:09:04.984 --> 00:09:06.776
And if you tip towards the Sun

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:08.912
your rays are much more intense

00:09:08.912 --> 00:09:10.748
and there's much more
heating of the ground

00:09:10.748 --> 00:09:12.577
and you get summertime.

00:09:12.577 --> 00:09:15.596
And around the other side,
we're tipped away from the Sun,

00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:19.140
their Sun angles are low,
angle of rays is low,

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.718
and we experience winter.

00:09:21.718 --> 00:09:23.122
Now since we're part of the same Earth

00:09:23.122 --> 00:09:25.428
as the Southern Hemisphere,

00:09:25.428 --> 00:09:28.013
if we're tipped towards
the Sun in the north,

00:09:28.013 --> 00:09:30.325
they're tipped away from
the Sun at the same time.

00:09:30.325 --> 00:09:34.103
So we experience summer when
Australia experiences winter,

00:09:34.103 --> 00:09:35.028
that's all.

00:09:35.028 --> 00:09:36.440
So that's all that's going on.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.246
- So then how does the equator
stay warm all the time?

00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:39.163
- Oh! Well!

00:09:40.522 --> 00:09:43.759
If the equator is exactly
between the Northern Hemisphere

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:45.205
and the Southern Hemisphere

00:09:45.205 --> 00:09:49.202
then they are switching always
between summer and winter

00:09:49.202 --> 00:09:52.520
then the equator has no seasons.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.695
- Interesting.

00:09:53.695 --> 00:09:54.757
- It can't.

00:09:54.757 --> 00:09:56.089
- Wouldn't it...

00:09:56.089 --> 00:09:57.185
- It can't have seasons.

00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:58.638
- When it's even on the other side?

00:09:58.638 --> 00:10:00.261
- It can't have seasons because it is

00:10:00.261 --> 00:10:02.926
always exactly between all other seasons.

00:10:02.926 --> 00:10:05.249
The only way to be that is
to have no season at all

00:10:05.249 --> 00:10:07.893
and what they do is they say
oh, it's the rainy season

00:10:07.893 --> 00:10:10.399
or it's the the stormy season.

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.493
- To make them feel good about it.

00:10:11.493 --> 00:10:13.038
- Just so they think
they're having a season,

00:10:13.038 --> 00:10:15.977
but temperature-wise the
equator has no seasons.

00:10:15.977 --> 00:10:18.384
And it's largely true for all the tropics,

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:19.940
but might want to be precise,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.392
the equator does not go through seasons.

00:10:23.392 --> 00:10:25.529
So if you want to undo the tilt

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:28.702
and have Earth's just
pointing straight up and down,

00:10:28.702 --> 00:10:29.619
no seasons.

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:32.209
- But it would still rotate, right?

00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:33.634
- We would still rotate on our axis

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:35.121
and still revolve around the Sun,

00:10:35.121 --> 00:10:38.858
we'd still have years
but there be no seasons.

00:10:38.858 --> 00:10:40.096
- For anyone?

00:10:40.096 --> 00:10:42.990
- Again, unless it's just
rainy season versus not.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.879
There'd be no temperature based seasons

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:47.129
of any significant measure.

00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:51.039
- Would we still have
cold and warm and hot?

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:52.217
(laughing)

00:10:52.217 --> 00:10:54.222
That's what I'm trying to figure out here.

00:10:54.222 --> 00:10:56.473
- Yeah, hot water out of the faucet.

00:10:56.473 --> 00:10:59.137
- No, no, I mean cold weather
and hot weather or just?

00:10:59.137 --> 00:11:00.873
It would just be warm all the way around?

00:11:00.873 --> 00:11:02.297
- Well no, so you would have...

00:11:02.297 --> 00:11:04.219
Oh sorry, so the farther
away from the equator you go

00:11:04.219 --> 00:11:05.387
the cooler would get.

00:11:05.387 --> 00:11:07.177
Right, now the whole earth
is not the same temperature

00:11:07.177 --> 00:11:10.741
but a given latitude
you don't get seasons,

00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:11.789
that's all I'm saying.

00:11:11.789 --> 00:11:13.049
So the hottest part would be the equator

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:15.558
and then you move away from
the equator to the poles

00:11:15.558 --> 00:11:17.081
and that would be the coldest spot.

00:11:17.081 --> 00:11:18.753
- I don't think you should
blame the Polish for this,

00:11:18.753 --> 00:11:19.886
but whatever.

00:11:19.886 --> 00:11:21.244
(laughing)

00:11:21.244 --> 00:11:24.292
The poles have done nothing to you.

00:11:24.292 --> 00:11:25.540
Let's see.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.370
- If the poles are people from Poland

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.220
then the Polish are people
that are sort of from Poland?

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.245
- Yeah, their kind of.

00:11:31.245 --> 00:11:32.344
Their from Chicago.

00:11:32.344 --> 00:11:33.795
(laughing)

00:11:33.795 --> 00:11:36.021
- I'm pole-ish, yeah.

00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:37.615
All right, what else you got?

00:11:37.615 --> 00:11:40.390
- Let's see, if we were just
plopped onto a gas giant,

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.997
such as Jupiter, like they
needed to explain that one to you

00:11:42.997 --> 00:11:44.675
(laughing)

00:11:44.675 --> 00:11:47.693
what would happen to us
assuming we could survive?

00:11:47.693 --> 00:11:49.366
Well if you...

00:11:49.366 --> 00:11:50.582
All right, I will just keep reading

00:11:50.582 --> 00:11:52.574
but I'm not an astrophysicist obviously

00:11:52.574 --> 00:11:54.359
but even I'm looking
at this going come on.

00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:56.385
Come on Jeremy Small,
you're better than this.

00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:57.732
- The word assuming I think carries--

00:11:57.732 --> 00:11:59.985
- Assuming we could survive,

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:02.744
there isn't a solid
surface we could stand on,

00:12:02.744 --> 00:12:04.252
so where would we go?

00:12:04.252 --> 00:12:06.158
- Good question.

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:08.201
So if I plunk you down on Jupiter

00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:10.560
you would just descend through the clouds.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.774
Okay?

00:12:11.774 --> 00:12:14.649
Jupiter gets denser and denser
and denser as it goes down,

00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:18.952
if you have a pressure proof
suit that you're wearing

00:12:18.952 --> 00:12:21.762
you will continue to fall until

00:12:21.762 --> 00:12:25.625
you are about the same density
as the surrounding area

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:28.148
and then you just sort
of bob there and float.

00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:29.469
That's what would happen.

00:12:29.469 --> 00:12:30.813
- So you would find your floating point.

00:12:30.813 --> 00:12:32.310
- Your floating point.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.463
But if you didn't have your pressure suit,

00:12:33.463 --> 00:12:36.972
you'd be crushed by the atmospheric
pressure that was there.

00:12:36.972 --> 00:12:38.187
- [Russell] But don't they...

00:12:38.187 --> 00:12:39.709
- And you would vaporize

00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:41.918
because it gets very hot very quickly.

00:12:41.918 --> 00:12:45.031
But ignoring the vaporizing
and avoid getting crushed,

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:47.864
you'll find your place, your zone.

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:51.254
Yeah.

00:12:51.254 --> 00:12:53.014
- So is that what happened to Cassini?

00:12:53.014 --> 00:12:55.298
- Oh, so Cassini, oh, you did...

00:12:55.298 --> 00:12:56.718
my boy did some did some homework.

00:12:56.718 --> 00:12:57.797
- I'm a nerd for this stuff.

00:12:57.797 --> 00:12:58.641
- [Neil] Oh, very good.

00:12:58.641 --> 00:13:00.230
- And just a quick side note so you know,

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.397
in 2017 I went to Chile...

00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:05.895
- Get that he's pronouncing
that all like he knows Spanish.

00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:07.311
- Like I'm a professional and stuff.

00:13:07.311 --> 00:13:08.144
- Chile.

00:13:08.144 --> 00:13:08.977
- Chile.

00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:09.810
- I'm a Chileno.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:10.643
(laughing)

00:13:10.643 --> 00:13:12.215
I went to...

00:13:12.215 --> 00:13:13.295
- They have observatories there.

00:13:13.295 --> 00:13:15.158
- The European, the European Space, ESO.

00:13:15.158 --> 00:13:16.213
- Yeah, European Southern Observatory.

00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:17.961
- Yes, I went there
and I spent two nights,

00:13:17.961 --> 00:13:19.220
three nights there.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.190
- [Neil] How?

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.023
- I have a friend.

00:13:21.023 --> 00:13:21.864
- [Neil] You knew somebody?

00:13:21.864 --> 00:13:22.892
- I'm friends with Nile Rogers.

00:13:22.892 --> 00:13:24.600
- [Neil] Okay, all right, you know people.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.297
- And Nile, this guy
had invited us all down

00:13:27.297 --> 00:13:29.980
and last minute Nile bailed
but the rest of us all went.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.909
- Isn't it magical?

00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:32.007
- It is ridiculous.

00:13:32.007 --> 00:13:34.200
- It is ridiculously magical
at the top of a mountain

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.987
when it gets dark and you see out

00:13:35.987 --> 00:13:38.122
and it's just you and the cosmos.

00:13:38.122 --> 00:13:40.890
- But I thought that I was
gonna look through telescopes

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.367
and see things 'cause
they've those giant--

00:13:43.367 --> 00:13:45.089
- There's no lenses.

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:47.221
- Yeah, no, they just
shoot lasers and I'm--

00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:48.999
- Lasers another thing we can do.

00:13:48.999 --> 00:13:50.024
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:50.024 --> 00:13:52.070
The two reasons why
you would shoot lasers,

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.109
but we can save that for another question

00:13:54.109 --> 00:13:56.678
if it ever gets asked,

00:13:56.678 --> 00:14:00.961
but it is truly magical to
be on a mountaintop at night.

00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:02.149
- It is pretty wild.

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:05.146
They did pull out like a little
rinky-dink telescope for us.

00:14:05.146 --> 00:14:06.523
- [Neil] Well 'cause we don't look through

00:14:06.523 --> 00:14:07.383
telescopes anymore--

00:14:07.383 --> 00:14:08.574
- No, apparently not.

00:14:08.574 --> 00:14:09.753
(laughing)

00:14:09.753 --> 00:14:10.724
I found out.

00:14:10.724 --> 00:14:12.953
- You thought there'd
be this giant eye piece

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:14.154
waiting for you to walk up to it.

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:15.579
- Yeah, like I thought like this--

00:14:15.579 --> 00:14:17.511
- [Neil] And you see the
gates of heaven through it.

00:14:17.511 --> 00:14:19.210
- I saw the pictures and
I was like oh my god,

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.369
I'm gonna look through those

00:14:20.369 --> 00:14:21.938
and like you don't look through those.

00:14:21.938 --> 00:14:22.880
(Neil laughing)

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.274
It just sends us data and I'm like well,

00:14:24.274 --> 00:14:25.591
how's that help me?

00:14:25.591 --> 00:14:26.717
(Neil laughing)

00:14:26.717 --> 00:14:29.255
I could have read the data at home.

00:14:29.255 --> 00:14:30.088
- All right.

00:14:30.088 --> 00:14:31.303
- Can I sneak mine in?

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:33.095
- Oh sneak, go on.

00:14:33.095 --> 00:14:34.231
- Lemme sneak the one I wrote last minute.

00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:35.287
- You got your own question?

00:14:35.287 --> 00:14:36.120
- I do.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.103
- Is that allowed?

00:14:37.103 --> 00:14:37.936
- I don't know, I'm doing it.

00:14:37.936 --> 00:14:39.254
- Engineers is that allowed?

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.087
- I'm doing it.

00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:40.984
I brought a question.

00:14:40.984 --> 00:14:42.076
- Okay go, go for it.

00:14:42.076 --> 00:14:46.648
- Is the Big Bang Theory only
for the observable universe

00:14:46.648 --> 00:14:50.956
or does it encompass like
the entirety of everything?

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:52.063
- Ooh.

00:14:52.063 --> 00:14:55.297
So first it's a TV show
finishing it's last season.

00:14:55.297 --> 00:14:56.130
- Highly successful

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.531
and I've never watched
one episode in my life.

00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:58.364
- Really?

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.888
Yes, one of the most
successful shows ever actually.

00:15:00.888 --> 00:15:03.772
So if you type the Big
Bang Theory into Google,

00:15:03.772 --> 00:15:05.328
the show comes up first.

00:15:05.328 --> 00:15:06.705
- Right, it's a far more important.

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:07.771
(Neil laughing)

00:15:07.771 --> 00:15:08.692
Far more important.

00:15:08.692 --> 00:15:10.284
- And then next I think
there's a K-pop band

00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:11.651
called Big Bang.

00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:12.546
- Is there?

00:15:12.546 --> 00:15:13.927
- Yes and then they come up next.

00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:16.298
Then the origin of the universe.

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:18.058
These are our priorities.

00:15:18.058 --> 00:15:19.690
- Is it still considered a theory?

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.940
- So a theory is the modern word we use

00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:27.089
to describe successful
understandings of the operations

00:15:27.089 --> 00:15:28.098
of nature.

00:15:28.098 --> 00:15:31.259
So quantum theory, relativity
theory, evolutionary theory,

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:34.815
so people will say oh, it's just a theory.

00:15:34.815 --> 00:15:38.188
That's the word we use to
describe stuff that works.

00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:40.432
If you have an idea that
hasn't been tested yet,

00:15:40.432 --> 00:15:41.995
it's a hypothesis.

00:15:41.995 --> 00:15:43.431
Okay?

00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:45.603
So it's Einstein's theory of relativity,

00:15:45.603 --> 00:15:49.106
it's Russell's hypothesis if
you an idea about something.

00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:50.722
- I have no idea.

00:15:50.722 --> 00:15:51.950
(laughing)

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.298
- Until it's put out and
then it gets fully explored

00:15:55.298 --> 00:15:58.249
and investigated and tested
and has other predictive value

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.779
then we're good to go with it.

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:04.196
So the Big Bang is our
understanding of the existence

00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:09.661
and expansion of the
universe in which we live

00:16:09.661 --> 00:16:12.585
and it goes not only to the
edge of the observable universe,

00:16:12.585 --> 00:16:16.876
but it would include the
universe beyond that.

00:16:16.876 --> 00:16:18.621
It's just that it's hard to get answers

00:16:18.621 --> 00:16:21.275
to that which is beyond our horizon.

00:16:21.275 --> 00:16:25.508
So colloquially we say it is the theory of

00:16:25.508 --> 00:16:27.829
our understanding of the
of the visible universe,

00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:30.153
but technically the whole
universe came into existence

00:16:30.153 --> 00:16:34.565
even the parts you can't see
in what we call the Big Bang.

00:16:34.565 --> 00:16:38.148
- So from nothingness
comes something-this.

00:16:39.986 --> 00:16:40.819
- Yes.

00:16:41.929 --> 00:16:44.245
And by the way just to
put you at ease with that,

00:16:44.245 --> 00:16:46.554
because the way you said
that was all pejorative,

00:16:46.554 --> 00:16:47.605
just want you to know.

00:16:47.605 --> 00:16:49.174
- It was, it had a
little pejorative to it.

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:51.632
- [Neil] You copped a
little attitude on that.

00:16:51.632 --> 00:16:53.008
- I did and I was like and
I wasn't really excited

00:16:53.008 --> 00:16:53.905
with the answer.

00:16:53.905 --> 00:16:55.030
(Neil laughing)

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.678
I was like it didn't really
answer anything for me.

00:16:56.678 --> 00:16:57.949
- How do you get something from nothing?

00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:59.650
So let's say you have, oh you know,

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.410
let me save the answer to
that for after the break.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.635
- The answer this Mr. Bender, next week.

00:17:06.635 --> 00:17:08.005
(laughing)

00:17:08.005 --> 00:17:09.746
- When we come back on StarTalk,

00:17:09.746 --> 00:17:11.622
we'll find out how you
get something from nothing

00:17:11.622 --> 00:17:16.372
on this edition of Cosmic
Queries, Everyday Astrophysics.

00:17:19.295 --> 00:17:20.463
(upbeat music)

00:17:20.463 --> 00:17:21.741
We're back on StarTalk,

00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:24.635
Cosmic Queries Edition,
Everyday Astrophysics.

00:17:24.635 --> 00:17:27.571
And helping me answer is my co-host today,

00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:30.035
visiting for the first
time, Russell Peters.

00:17:30.035 --> 00:17:30.868
Russell.

00:17:30.868 --> 00:17:32.149
- Hey, I'm back.

00:17:32.149 --> 00:17:34.366
- I can't go to Netflix
without seeing your face.

00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:36.995
They're trying to get me
to watch all your stuff.

00:17:36.995 --> 00:17:38.435
- Yeah, don't waste your time.

00:17:38.435 --> 00:17:39.268
(laughing)

00:17:39.268 --> 00:17:41.180
Listen, you're an astrophysicist,
you're smarter than this.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.844
- I love your rapport with the audience,

00:17:42.844 --> 00:17:43.856
it's great, it's great.

00:17:43.856 --> 00:17:47.076
You just make them all feel
like they want to be there.

00:17:47.076 --> 00:17:48.630
- Well hopefully.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.940
(Neil laughing)

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.957
I'm not holding them captive, you know.

00:17:51.957 --> 00:17:53.900
Unless they have Stockholm Syndrome

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.650
and I don't know about it.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.038
- So you've got questions?

00:17:57.038 --> 00:17:57.911
- [Russell] I've got questions.

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:00.435
- And it's on everyday
astrophysics, bring it on.

00:18:00.435 --> 00:18:03.164
- Actually, you left
me hanging on the last,

00:18:03.164 --> 00:18:05.534
it was a big cliffhanger that we left on

00:18:05.534 --> 00:18:07.266
and you didn't finish it for me.

00:18:07.266 --> 00:18:08.274
- Ooh, I forgot.

00:18:08.274 --> 00:18:12.512
- And I almost forgot too
'cause you greased me out of it.

00:18:12.512 --> 00:18:13.633
- Oh yeah, I did.

00:18:13.633 --> 00:18:16.097
I said nice things about
you, hey, it's all about me.

00:18:16.097 --> 00:18:17.534
(laughing)

00:18:17.534 --> 00:18:18.695
- I was like I'm listening.

00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:21.137
- So the question was how do you get

00:18:21.137 --> 00:18:22.270
something out of nothing?

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.639
So the thing is with energy
you can have positive energy

00:18:25.639 --> 00:18:28.575
and negative energy, it's
not just an emotional thing,

00:18:28.575 --> 00:18:33.575
it's actually a real physical
thing in the physical universe

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.404
and each of those have
consequences on space,

00:18:37.404 --> 00:18:38.821
time, and matter.

00:18:40.075 --> 00:18:44.356
But if you bring them together,
it sums to no energy at all.

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:46.179
So how does this happen?

00:18:46.179 --> 00:18:47.188
So think about it.

00:18:47.188 --> 00:18:49.431
Let's say there's level ground

00:18:49.431 --> 00:18:53.948
and then I have a shovel and
I put ground from this part

00:18:53.948 --> 00:18:56.011
and I stack it over here.

00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:59.087
So I'm digging a hole and making a mound.

00:18:59.087 --> 00:19:01.305
Well I can keep doing
this and I can have a hill

00:19:01.305 --> 00:19:03.815
as arbitrarily as high as I want

00:19:03.815 --> 00:19:06.576
and I can climb to the top
of the Empire State Building,

00:19:06.576 --> 00:19:08.919
but there's a hole next to it.

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:11.267
So how did I get that high?

00:19:11.267 --> 00:19:12.823
How is that even possible?

00:19:12.823 --> 00:19:15.274
I took the dirt over here
and I put it over here.

00:19:15.274 --> 00:19:18.303
But I put the dirt back in
then everything's level again.

00:19:18.303 --> 00:19:20.896
So it's a way to think about what it means

00:19:20.896 --> 00:19:23.028
when you have negative
energy and positive energy.

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:25.825
A lot of things we do where
you started with nothing,

00:19:25.825 --> 00:19:27.260
but you ended with something,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.923
something that you care about.

00:19:28.923 --> 00:19:31.528
But in the total picture it sums to zero.

00:19:31.528 --> 00:19:33.806
- See, now that's a good explanation.

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:36.020
That I can walk away with
a go okay, I get that.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.375
- [Neil] And not lose sleep tonight, good.

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:39.062
- Yeah, I would have, I
would have lost sleep.

00:19:39.062 --> 00:19:41.582
Tonight I'm gonna be
sleeping going ah damn it,

00:19:41.582 --> 00:19:43.532
I should have asked him.

00:19:43.532 --> 00:19:45.571
Let's go with, I haven't read this one,

00:19:45.571 --> 00:19:47.910
I'm just gonna read it
now and see what happens.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.597
(laughing)

00:19:49.597 --> 00:19:50.614
- And see what happens.

00:19:50.614 --> 00:19:51.447
- Let's see what happens.

00:19:51.447 --> 00:19:53.410
It might be a crappy
question, we don't know.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.615
Vincent Zimmerman wants to know--

00:19:56.615 --> 00:19:57.877
- [Neil] From where, where is he?

00:19:57.877 --> 00:19:59.103
- At Twitter.

00:19:59.103 --> 00:20:00.583
- [Neil] Twitter, sure.

00:20:00.583 --> 00:20:02.302
- From the town of Twitter.

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:03.965
what's the most distant star you can see

00:20:03.965 --> 00:20:05.167
with the naked eye?

00:20:05.167 --> 00:20:06.782
- Ooh.

00:20:06.782 --> 00:20:08.411
So that's an interesting question.

00:20:08.411 --> 00:20:10.685
I can answer that two ways.

00:20:10.685 --> 00:20:13.961
So one of them is the most distant thing

00:20:13.961 --> 00:20:16.818
you can see with the naked eye is

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:21.484
our nearest red-blooded
galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:20:21.484 --> 00:20:24.289
And for the longest, well
until the early 1920s,

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:26.837
it was called the Andromeda nebula

00:20:26.837 --> 00:20:29.465
because it was just this
fuzzy thing in the night sky

00:20:29.465 --> 00:20:33.473
among the stars that trace out
the constellation Andromeda.

00:20:33.473 --> 00:20:35.053
So he named it after Andromeda.

00:20:35.053 --> 00:20:37.481
And it was a nebula.

00:20:37.481 --> 00:20:38.991
A fuzzy thing.

00:20:38.991 --> 00:20:40.629
And then with better
and better telescopes,

00:20:40.629 --> 00:20:43.023
wait a minute this thing
is composed of stars.

00:20:43.023 --> 00:20:45.452
Wait a minute, this thing is far away.

00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:48.198
Wait a minute, this is
an entire other galaxy.

00:20:48.198 --> 00:20:50.158
It's not just a fuzzy
thing in the Milky Way.

00:20:50.158 --> 00:20:52.253
It's another Milky Way.

00:20:52.253 --> 00:20:53.327
Well how far away is it?

00:20:53.327 --> 00:20:55.959
It was not close, quote,
close like these stars

00:20:55.959 --> 00:20:57.536
we see in the night sky.

00:20:57.536 --> 00:20:59.934
This is outside of our entire galaxy.

00:20:59.934 --> 00:21:02.797
The stars you see in the
night sky are tens, hundreds,

00:21:02.797 --> 00:21:05.080
thousands of light-years away.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.497
The Andromeda Galaxy is two
million light-years away.

00:21:11.096 --> 00:21:13.252
And you can see that with the naked eye.

00:21:13.252 --> 00:21:15.269
- I believe I saw that
when I was in Chile.

00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:16.777
- You would have, well, no, no, no.

00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:17.921
That's too far north.

00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:19.301
There are other fuzzy
objects in the night sky.

00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:20.134
- I saw two.

00:21:20.134 --> 00:21:22.113
- That's called, those
were first described

00:21:22.113 --> 00:21:24.383
and written about by Ferdinand Magellan.

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:27.179
- Mm-hmm, that guy was no
Magellan I'll tell you.

00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:28.500
(laughing)

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.109
- He was, sorry, what I should say is

00:21:31.109 --> 00:21:34.701
Western folk first learned
of these two clouds

00:21:34.701 --> 00:21:38.161
when Magellan did his
round-the-world voyage.

00:21:38.161 --> 00:21:40.495
Clearly Aboriginal peoples of Australia

00:21:40.495 --> 00:21:42.286
knew all about the Magellanic Clouds.

00:21:42.286 --> 00:21:44.763
So they named it in his
honor, the Magellanic Clouds,

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:46.322
and they were called clouds at the time.

00:21:46.322 --> 00:21:47.961
They are galaxies as well.

00:21:47.961 --> 00:21:49.033
Except they're closer.

00:21:49.033 --> 00:21:50.352
- There's a small one and a big one.

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:51.850
- And they're called the
Small Magellanic Cloud

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.005
and the Large Magellanic Cloud.

00:21:53.005 --> 00:21:54.447
- Yeah, they really went out on the names.

00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:55.433
(laughing)

00:21:55.433 --> 00:21:56.517
- We tell it like it is.

00:21:56.517 --> 00:21:58.175
- No, they blew the bank on that one.

00:21:58.175 --> 00:22:00.248
- So those are relatively nearby.

00:22:00.248 --> 00:22:03.831
A couple hundred thousand
light-years away.

00:22:05.672 --> 00:22:08.690
The Andromeda is two
million light years away.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.437
You're not seeing an individual star,

00:22:10.437 --> 00:22:14.151
you're seeing hundreds
of billions of stars.

00:22:14.151 --> 00:22:16.095
The muddled muddied light,

00:22:16.095 --> 00:22:18.686
the blended light of
hundreds of billions of stars

00:22:18.686 --> 00:22:20.516
that comprise the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:22:20.516 --> 00:22:23.699
That is the farthest object
visible to the unaided eye.

00:22:23.699 --> 00:22:25.255
And you can't see that from New York

00:22:25.255 --> 00:22:27.390
or any light polluted place.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.231
Just go out in the country
side, it'll be there.

00:22:30.231 --> 00:22:32.981
- Would you venture to think that

00:22:33.933 --> 00:22:36.431
if there are people there,

00:22:36.431 --> 00:22:39.078
that they could see us the
same fuzzy way we see them?

00:22:39.078 --> 00:22:40.511
- Oh, by all means.

00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:42.081
Oh yeah, I think about that all the time.

00:22:42.081 --> 00:22:45.050
In fact if there was
intelligent life there

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.386
and they had detectors and
they're looking our way,

00:22:47.386 --> 00:22:49.543
they would see us not as we are,

00:22:49.543 --> 00:22:53.441
but as we were two million years ago.

00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:56.128
Because that light is only
just now reaching them.

00:22:56.128 --> 00:22:57.037
- Wow.

00:22:57.037 --> 00:22:58.336
- [Neil] So they would not see signs of

00:22:58.336 --> 00:23:01.205
what we would call intelligence on Earth.

00:23:01.205 --> 00:23:04.037
- If they saw us now they
wouldn't see those signs either.

00:23:04.037 --> 00:23:06.558
(laughing)

00:23:06.558 --> 00:23:08.788
- So yeah, the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:23:08.788 --> 00:23:09.680
There it is.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.181
- That's pretty awesome.

00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:12.502
- Yeah.

00:23:12.502 --> 00:23:13.587
I think the word awesome

00:23:13.587 --> 00:23:15.603
shouldn't have qualifiers in front of it.

00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:17.642
Something either is or is not awesome.

00:23:17.642 --> 00:23:19.258
- It's not pretty awesome?

00:23:19.258 --> 00:23:20.897
It's not similar to awesome?

00:23:20.897 --> 00:23:23.362
It is not a simile of awesome?

00:23:23.362 --> 00:23:25.035
(laughing)

00:23:25.035 --> 00:23:26.213
I'm pretty awesome, I'm
gonna go with pretty awesome.

00:23:26.213 --> 00:23:27.117
- All right, all right.

00:23:27.117 --> 00:23:29.218
- I mean it's awesome, but
it's also pretty awesome.

00:23:29.218 --> 00:23:30.968
- Oh, pretty awesome.

00:23:32.351 --> 00:23:33.814
- This is a completely
different type of question,

00:23:33.814 --> 00:23:34.931
let's try this.

00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:37.931
This is slightly angry Lugia, Lugia?

00:23:38.977 --> 00:23:41.227
I don't know, that's
their name on Twitter.

00:23:41.227 --> 00:23:43.089
Why do sodium and chloride,

00:23:43.089 --> 00:23:45.094
two extremely toxic and harmful chemicals

00:23:45.094 --> 00:23:47.927
combine to form normal table salt?

00:23:50.682 --> 00:23:54.124
- This is the beauty of chemistry.

00:23:54.124 --> 00:23:56.458
So you think that of things properties

00:23:56.458 --> 00:23:59.291
are somehow inherent in the thing,

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.450
but the property is what manifests

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:07.353
after you combine it
with whatever else is...

00:24:07.353 --> 00:24:10.582
So you combine sodium,
which is a lethal metal

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:12.409
that you can cut with a knife.

00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:16.736
That's how soft it is and it
reacts violently with water.

00:24:16.736 --> 00:24:18.486
Add that to chlorine,

00:24:19.633 --> 00:24:23.011
which would poison you if you breathed it.

00:24:23.011 --> 00:24:25.356
Okay and put them together

00:24:25.356 --> 00:24:29.023
and you get completely
necessary table salt.

00:24:30.187 --> 00:24:31.770
Necessary for life.

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:33.815
So when you put them together,

00:24:33.815 --> 00:24:36.351
all the chemistry, it's a new chemistry.

00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:37.765
It's a new thing.

00:24:37.765 --> 00:24:39.675
Don't think of it as it probably has

00:24:39.675 --> 00:24:41.727
some of those properties
it used to have, no.

00:24:41.727 --> 00:24:45.111
All that matters is what
are its electrons doing

00:24:45.111 --> 00:24:47.880
when they talk to your electrons?

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.943
And if the configuration is different,

00:24:49.943 --> 00:24:51.640
that's all that matters

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.966
and the electrons that
manifest themselves to you

00:24:54.966 --> 00:24:57.893
in table salt are differently configured

00:24:57.893 --> 00:25:00.095
than the electrons that
manifest themselves to you

00:25:00.095 --> 00:25:02.512
as either sodium or chlorine.

00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:06.853
And for me the best way to say this,

00:25:06.853 --> 00:25:10.456
I had a little paragraph
of this in one of my books,

00:25:10.456 --> 00:25:12.755
it was let's take hydrogen.

00:25:12.755 --> 00:25:14.588
Hydrogen is explosive.

00:25:16.635 --> 00:25:19.110
If you have a ball of hydrogen
and light a match to it.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.383
- So is Mexican food.

00:25:20.383 --> 00:25:21.846
Carry on.

00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:23.567
(laughing)

00:25:23.567 --> 00:25:25.888
- Thank you for that
clarification in case we didn't...

00:25:25.888 --> 00:25:29.853
So hydrogen will explode
if you light a match to it.

00:25:29.853 --> 00:25:32.438
A ball of gaseous hydrogen.

00:25:32.438 --> 00:25:34.688
Oxygen promotes combustion.

00:25:36.284 --> 00:25:38.784
If you have a flame and add oxygen to it,

00:25:38.784 --> 00:25:41.059
it'll burn faster.

00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:44.738
Combine hydrogen and oxygen you get water

00:25:44.738 --> 00:25:46.488
that puts out flames.

00:25:48.512 --> 00:25:49.440
There you go.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.417
- You know what it reminds me of?

00:25:50.417 --> 00:25:52.557
It reminds me of George Carlin's old bit

00:25:52.557 --> 00:25:54.739
about halfway dirty words.

00:25:54.739 --> 00:25:57.094
Words aren't dirty until
they're put together.

00:25:57.094 --> 00:25:58.650
- Oh, okay.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.561
So he has a follow-on to
the seven dirty words?

00:26:01.561 --> 00:26:04.298
- Well this is old great material,

00:26:04.298 --> 00:26:07.866
but he said cock isn't a
dirty word, it's in the Bible.

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:10.451
And if you go to the dentist or the doctor

00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:12.380
and they give you a sucker.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.241
But when you put them
together you got a bad word.

00:26:15.241 --> 00:26:17.088
(laughing)

00:26:17.088 --> 00:26:18.045
- Okay, so a good point.

00:26:18.045 --> 00:26:19.563
So alone those words mean things,

00:26:19.563 --> 00:26:21.999
you put them together it
means something else entirely.

00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:25.258
And so I think you can only get nice words

00:26:25.258 --> 00:26:26.814
that combine to make bad words.

00:26:26.814 --> 00:26:28.534
I don't think you can take bad words

00:26:28.534 --> 00:26:30.317
that combine to make a non-bad word.

00:26:30.317 --> 00:26:31.215
- Yeah, no.

00:26:31.215 --> 00:26:32.098
Well I mean, it's the same.

00:26:32.098 --> 00:26:32.931
It's the opposite.

00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:34.931
- Well maybe, a jackass.

00:26:36.499 --> 00:26:38.301
But jack is not a bad word,

00:26:38.301 --> 00:26:39.916
ass is kind of like a vulgar word.

00:26:39.916 --> 00:26:41.907
- Is a donkey.

00:26:41.907 --> 00:26:43.486
- Yeah, so it's the same thing.

00:26:43.486 --> 00:26:46.538
Meaning is everything in language.

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:49.617
And if two words together
have a different meaning,

00:26:49.617 --> 00:26:51.439
deal with it.

00:26:51.439 --> 00:26:53.278
Don't say wait a minute, take it apart,

00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:54.628
and those have their own separate meanings

00:26:54.628 --> 00:26:57.059
therefore that word together has a, no.

00:26:57.059 --> 00:26:58.240
That ain't how it works.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.984
- So it's the same as the
sodium and the chloride.

00:26:59.984 --> 00:27:02.424
- [Neil] Exactly the same
as the sodium and chloride.

00:27:02.424 --> 00:27:04.347
- But it works in the opposite way.

00:27:04.347 --> 00:27:07.117
Where sodium chloride can form
together make something nice.

00:27:07.117 --> 00:27:08.810
- And make something beautiful, yes.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:09.643
- Gotcha.

00:27:09.643 --> 00:27:10.689
See what I did there for you?

00:27:10.689 --> 00:27:11.522
- Mm-hmm.

00:27:11.522 --> 00:27:12.499
- You're welcome kid.

00:27:12.499 --> 00:27:13.690
- [Neil] So what else you have?

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.523
- Let's see, Raul Solonarajo at...

00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.006
- [Neil] You can do better than that.

00:27:19.006 --> 00:27:20.091
Try that again.

00:27:20.091 --> 00:27:21.591
- Raul Solonarajo.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.912
Nah-ran-ho, nah-ran-ho.

00:27:24.912 --> 00:27:26.068
Nah-rah-jo?

00:27:26.068 --> 00:27:27.683
Listen.

00:27:27.683 --> 00:27:30.433
It's on Twitter, what am I doing?

00:27:32.798 --> 00:27:34.693
No, it's not a good question.

00:27:34.693 --> 00:27:37.536
What would be the single
most alarming thing

00:27:37.536 --> 00:27:38.499
that I could see with the naked eye?

00:27:38.499 --> 00:27:39.332
I don't know.

00:27:39.332 --> 00:27:40.165
- Oh.

00:27:40.165 --> 00:27:40.998
Ooh.

00:27:40.998 --> 00:27:41.831
- I mean that's...

00:27:41.831 --> 00:27:42.664
- No, I got this.

00:27:42.664 --> 00:27:43.519
I got this.

00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:44.500
- [Russell] I guess that's
up for interpretation.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.679
- I got this.

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.305
Okay, you ready?

00:27:47.305 --> 00:27:49.722
I didn't know what's the
single most alarming thing

00:27:49.722 --> 00:27:51.466
I could ever see with the naked eye was

00:27:51.466 --> 00:27:53.365
until I saw it.

00:27:53.365 --> 00:27:55.208
Which meant I did not anticipate it.

00:27:55.208 --> 00:27:56.424
Okay, you ready?

00:27:56.424 --> 00:27:57.582
- [Russell] Yep.

00:27:57.582 --> 00:28:00.224
- This is 1999, I'm on the Brooklyn Bridge

00:28:00.224 --> 00:28:01.826
at two o'clock in the morning

00:28:01.826 --> 00:28:03.253
and I'm looking up.

00:28:03.253 --> 00:28:04.421
'Cause that's how we roll.

00:28:04.421 --> 00:28:05.668
- That's exactly how you roll.

00:28:05.668 --> 00:28:07.650
- And it's November.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.394
I remember this because
there's a meteor shower.

00:28:11.394 --> 00:28:14.351
Okay, meteor showers are best
typically after midnight.

00:28:14.351 --> 00:28:16.362
So there I am and
Brooklyn Bridge is a nice,

00:28:16.362 --> 00:28:18.450
you're away from lights,
it's still very lit,

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.502
but you're away from
lights as good as you can.

00:28:20.502 --> 00:28:22.625
I'm a city person, it's the best I can do,

00:28:22.625 --> 00:28:24.733
and I'm there and I'm looking up

00:28:24.733 --> 00:28:25.992
and I'm seeing this meteor shower.

00:28:25.992 --> 00:28:27.445
It's called the Leonid meteor shower

00:28:27.445 --> 00:28:30.085
and you see the streaks of
white, they're shooting stars.

00:28:30.085 --> 00:28:31.158
It's beautiful.

00:28:31.158 --> 00:28:32.997
We're getting like three
or four per minute.

00:28:32.997 --> 00:28:34.602
This is a good rate.

00:28:34.602 --> 00:28:35.435
Okay.

00:28:38.078 --> 00:28:40.828
Then I saw a new star in the sky.

00:28:41.769 --> 00:28:44.972
I said I don't recognize that star.

00:28:44.972 --> 00:28:49.625
And it just got brighter
and brighter and brighter

00:28:49.625 --> 00:28:51.625
and then it disappeared.

00:28:52.602 --> 00:28:55.596
Then I saw a puff of smoke

00:28:55.596 --> 00:28:57.429
and I said whoa, whoa!

00:29:00.334 --> 00:29:02.295
Okay, so you know what just happened?

00:29:02.295 --> 00:29:03.128
- No.

00:29:03.128 --> 00:29:04.644
- [Neil] You don't know
what I just witnessed?

00:29:04.644 --> 00:29:06.043
- It sounds like a firework.

00:29:06.043 --> 00:29:09.255
- It was a meteor that was
headed straight towards me.

00:29:09.255 --> 00:29:10.327
- Oh wow.

00:29:10.327 --> 00:29:11.743
And it disintegrated.

00:29:11.743 --> 00:29:13.911
- And it disintegrated
straight towards me.

00:29:13.911 --> 00:29:15.445
There was no streak.

00:29:15.445 --> 00:29:17.707
There was no and I thought to myself,

00:29:17.707 --> 00:29:20.596
this is the final moment of my life.

00:29:20.596 --> 00:29:23.122
- It's the best way you could go.

00:29:23.122 --> 00:29:24.418
In all fairness.

00:29:24.418 --> 00:29:26.528
I mean it's the most appropriate way.

00:29:26.528 --> 00:29:29.772
- We are so accustomed to seeing
streaks of light in the sky

00:29:29.772 --> 00:29:33.139
and some of those are gonna
be headed straight for you

00:29:33.139 --> 00:29:35.358
and they're not gonna make a streak.

00:29:35.358 --> 00:29:38.034
They're just gonna get brighter.

00:29:38.034 --> 00:29:42.031
When I realized a split
second after that happened,

00:29:42.031 --> 00:29:44.836
what I just witnessed, I freaked out.

00:29:44.836 --> 00:29:47.972
I mean not in a psycho, I just
intellectually freaked out

00:29:47.972 --> 00:29:51.734
and I said damn, that's
what that's gonna look like.

00:29:51.734 --> 00:29:55.767
So that's the most terrifying
thing to look up and see.

00:29:55.767 --> 00:29:57.645
- Well there you go Raul.

00:29:57.645 --> 00:30:00.378
It's definitely the most
terrifying thing Neil saw,

00:30:00.378 --> 00:30:02.141
but what about you?

00:30:02.141 --> 00:30:03.224
What could...

00:30:04.518 --> 00:30:06.148
- All right, what else you got?

00:30:06.148 --> 00:30:07.148
- Let's see.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.405
Can you explain why some
of the planets in our--

00:30:10.405 --> 00:30:11.832
- But who said the question?

00:30:11.832 --> 00:30:14.088
- This is Ramona Vaughn on Facebook.

00:30:14.088 --> 00:30:14.971
- Ramona Vaughn.

00:30:14.971 --> 00:30:16.449
- Ramona, Ramona Vaughn.

00:30:16.449 --> 00:30:17.282
- Ramona.

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:18.424
- Ramona Vaughn.

00:30:18.424 --> 00:30:21.147
Can you explain why some of
the planets in our Solar System

00:30:21.147 --> 00:30:23.152
rotate in the opposite direction?

00:30:23.152 --> 00:30:25.308
Retrograde is what they call it.

00:30:25.308 --> 00:30:28.843
- Yeah, yeah, so the
planet Uranus for example,

00:30:28.843 --> 00:30:31.343
its axis is tipped 98 degrees.

00:30:34.261 --> 00:30:36.496
So it's rotating upside down.

00:30:36.496 --> 00:30:37.379
- But what determines that,

00:30:37.379 --> 00:30:39.525
oh because it's going backwards.

00:30:39.525 --> 00:30:40.764
- Well no, you're asking...

00:30:40.764 --> 00:30:42.146
I was hoping you we're
gonna answer that question.

00:30:42.146 --> 00:30:44.297
That's a very intelligent
thought-out question.

00:30:44.297 --> 00:30:48.203
So if you take something
turning and then I turn it

00:30:48.203 --> 00:30:51.047
and then I flip it, it's still turning.

00:30:51.047 --> 00:30:52.861
Who am I to say that's upside down?

00:30:52.861 --> 00:30:54.347
That's basically your question, right?

00:30:54.347 --> 00:30:56.480
It's 'cause the right hand rule.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.271
- Okay, but Uranus doesn't know that.

00:30:58.271 --> 00:30:59.923
(laughing)

00:30:59.923 --> 00:31:02.363
It's not like hey, Uranus is like Earth,

00:31:02.363 --> 00:31:03.612
what's going on there?

00:31:03.612 --> 00:31:05.759
Oh okay, I'm a lefty, I'm a lefty.

00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:07.943
- It's called a right hand rule.

00:31:07.943 --> 00:31:10.182
So here's how you do it, okay?

00:31:10.182 --> 00:31:12.737
So hold up your right hand in front of you

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:14.501
like you're gonna shake someone's hand.

00:31:14.501 --> 00:31:15.351
Good.

00:31:15.351 --> 00:31:18.170
Okay, now stick your thumb up.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.149
That's the axis of rotation.

00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:22.413
Now curl your fingers.

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:24.604
Your thumb is pointing north.

00:31:24.604 --> 00:31:25.898
- Yes.

00:31:25.898 --> 00:31:28.162
- I'm declaring that by tradition.

00:31:28.162 --> 00:31:30.838
Okay, so if you go to the planet

00:31:30.838 --> 00:31:34.507
and curl your fingers in
the direction it's rotating

00:31:34.507 --> 00:31:37.633
your thumb is going to
point north on that planet.

00:31:37.633 --> 00:31:38.851
Okay?

00:31:38.851 --> 00:31:43.009
So if I take Uranus with my
thumb up and fingers curled

00:31:43.009 --> 00:31:47.176
and I then tip my thumb
so it's pointed downwards,

00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:51.739
Uranus is turning back the other way,

00:31:53.083 --> 00:31:56.183
but the north still has
to have that relationship

00:31:56.183 --> 00:31:57.292
to that rotation.

00:31:57.292 --> 00:32:00.098
So that's what defines
the north of an object,

00:32:00.098 --> 00:32:03.504
the right hand rule just by convention.

00:32:03.504 --> 00:32:07.431
That's how we can say Uranus
is rotating upside down.

00:32:07.431 --> 00:32:09.047
Now why do we think that happens?

00:32:09.047 --> 00:32:10.884
- So their south is our north?

00:32:10.884 --> 00:32:11.717
- [Neil] Correct.

00:32:11.717 --> 00:32:12.606
- So they're Australia.

00:32:12.606 --> 00:32:14.856
(laughing)

00:32:16.194 --> 00:32:19.129
- No, why'd you get me to
agree with you on that.

00:32:19.129 --> 00:32:21.109
Your north is their north.

00:32:21.109 --> 00:32:23.161
Their north is their north.

00:32:23.161 --> 00:32:25.801
It just happens to be in everybody else's,

00:32:25.801 --> 00:32:28.453
occupying the same area as everyone else's

00:32:28.453 --> 00:32:29.821
Southern Hemisphere.

00:32:29.821 --> 00:32:31.168
That's all.

00:32:31.168 --> 00:32:33.540
But Uranus doesn't have issues here.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.235
- Well Uranus doesn't have much.

00:32:35.235 --> 00:32:37.018
(laughing)

00:32:37.018 --> 00:32:39.542
- So we think in the early Solar System

00:32:39.542 --> 00:32:41.226
because all the planets would have formed

00:32:41.226 --> 00:32:43.336
in the same sort of circulating cloud

00:32:43.336 --> 00:32:45.151
and so you don't get
upside down things in that,

00:32:45.151 --> 00:32:47.756
all the planets are going the
same direction around the Sun,

00:32:47.756 --> 00:32:49.291
that's the direction the Sun is rotating,

00:32:49.291 --> 00:32:50.742
that's the direction Earth is rotating,

00:32:50.742 --> 00:32:52.521
so everybody's turning the same way

00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:56.010
because that's the rotational
energy of the original cloud

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:57.471
out of which we formed.

00:32:57.471 --> 00:32:59.359
If you rotate the other way,

00:32:59.359 --> 00:33:00.865
the way we explain that is

00:33:00.865 --> 00:33:02.916
you had some bad stuff
happen to you early on.

00:33:02.916 --> 00:33:05.216
You got slammed by some other object

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:08.021
in the early Solar System
that tipped you on your axis.

00:33:08.021 --> 00:33:09.459
- So possibly during--

00:33:09.459 --> 00:33:11.324
- We think likely, not just possibly,

00:33:11.324 --> 00:33:12.489
but even likely.

00:33:12.489 --> 00:33:13.587
- From the Big Bang.

00:33:13.587 --> 00:33:16.073
- No, no, way later when it's
forming our own Solar System.

00:33:16.073 --> 00:33:17.476
Big Bang made the whole universe,

00:33:17.476 --> 00:33:20.188
wait 10 billion years then
you get our Solar System.

00:33:20.188 --> 00:33:21.320
We're a little late.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.936
- We're the dust settling so to speak.

00:33:22.936 --> 00:33:23.817
- Very good.

00:33:23.817 --> 00:33:24.675
- There we go.

00:33:24.675 --> 00:33:25.508
- Very good.

00:33:25.508 --> 00:33:28.861
So it got slammed in
the early Solar System

00:33:28.861 --> 00:33:31.642
and then it got tipped that
has been that way ever since.

00:33:31.642 --> 00:33:33.186
So we got take another break

00:33:33.186 --> 00:33:35.613
and when we're back more Cosmic Queries,

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:38.117
Astrophysics Household Edition.

00:33:38.117 --> 00:33:39.367
When we return.

00:33:43.139 --> 00:33:44.464
(upbeat music)

00:33:44.464 --> 00:33:46.519
StarTalk, we're back.

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:48.777
third and final segment of Cosmic Queries,

00:33:48.777 --> 00:33:50.529
Household Astrophysics Edition.

00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:51.807
Is that what we called this?

00:33:51.807 --> 00:33:52.640
Household?

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.296
Everyday, Everyday Astrophysics.

00:33:55.296 --> 00:33:56.852
- Household sounds like a cleaner.

00:33:56.852 --> 00:33:58.338
(laughing)

00:33:58.338 --> 00:33:59.941
Like these are like tips for you

00:33:59.941 --> 00:34:01.912
to get the stove shiny again, you know?

00:34:01.912 --> 00:34:04.279
- Using cosmic principles.

00:34:04.279 --> 00:34:06.544
So Russell Peters great
to have you on the show.

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:08.203
So you got all the questions there.

00:34:08.203 --> 00:34:09.125
- I got all the questions.

00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:10.127
- Give them to me.

00:34:10.127 --> 00:34:11.683
- I don't know if that's a real name.

00:34:11.683 --> 00:34:13.016
I see bank Carl.

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:16.659
It's an Instagram name.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:19.300
Anyway, what is a
fascinating fact or thought

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.952
that makes your appreciation
for the universe overflow?

00:34:22.952 --> 00:34:23.785
- Wow.

00:34:24.792 --> 00:34:25.924
- [Russell] That's a deep question.

00:34:25.924 --> 00:34:27.131
- It's beautiful.

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:28.546
That's a beautiful question.

00:34:28.546 --> 00:34:30.656
Let me just hear that question again.

00:34:30.656 --> 00:34:32.402
- I feel we need sax
playing in the background

00:34:32.402 --> 00:34:33.779
when you do it.

00:34:33.779 --> 00:34:35.643
(laughing)

00:34:35.643 --> 00:34:37.811
What is a fascinating fact or thought

00:34:37.811 --> 00:34:41.866
that makes your appreciation
for the universe overflow?

00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:42.699
- Hmm.

00:34:44.308 --> 00:34:46.205
- A fact and a thought are
two different things though.

00:34:46.205 --> 00:34:47.850
- I know, I know, here it goes.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:48.933
Here it goes.

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:52.643
I bask in our collective ignorance

00:34:56.142 --> 00:34:58.725
on the frontier of the unknown.

00:34:59.609 --> 00:35:01.192
I long to look out,

00:35:03.678 --> 00:35:06.797
look behind me and say hey, we got that

00:35:06.797 --> 00:35:08.614
and look in front of me and say

00:35:08.614 --> 00:35:11.031
we have no idea what that is.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.467
And so what keeps me awake at night

00:35:17.077 --> 00:35:20.721
and has me run back to
my office every morning

00:35:20.721 --> 00:35:23.860
is the prospect that we
could be on the heels

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.610
of a major discovery,

00:35:26.709 --> 00:35:30.389
answering a question that
we might have posed already,

00:35:30.389 --> 00:35:32.770
but possibly revealing a question

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.687
we had not previously known to ask.

00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:38.111
That's my muse,

00:35:39.877 --> 00:35:41.127
my cosmic muse.

00:35:42.789 --> 00:35:44.418
- I feel you overflowing.

00:35:44.418 --> 00:35:47.242
(laughing)

00:35:47.242 --> 00:35:49.434
- I had to give an overflowing answer.

00:35:49.434 --> 00:35:51.866
- You're like in LA when it rains.

00:35:51.866 --> 00:35:54.016
The LA River is overflowing.

00:35:54.016 --> 00:35:55.578
- All right Russel, give me more.

00:35:55.578 --> 00:35:56.503
- All right.

00:35:56.503 --> 00:35:57.360
Harry from California.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.397
- [Neil] Harry, no last name?

00:35:58.397 --> 00:35:59.230
- No.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.063
- Just Harry?

00:36:00.063 --> 00:36:00.955
Do you know Harry in California?

00:36:00.955 --> 00:36:03.125
- No but scary leavened
bread is his Instagram.

00:36:03.125 --> 00:36:04.399
- Okay. (chuckles)

00:36:04.399 --> 00:36:06.823
- Harry from California wants to know

00:36:06.823 --> 00:36:09.563
what do you think the single
most important discovery

00:36:09.563 --> 00:36:12.596
in the history of physics is and why?

00:36:12.596 --> 00:36:14.175
- Oh.

00:36:14.175 --> 00:36:16.051
Ooh, I got this.

00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:17.110
Okay.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.212
Now physics or astrophysics,
are they two different things?

00:36:19.212 --> 00:36:21.556
- Astrophysics is a subset of physics,

00:36:21.556 --> 00:36:23.306
but we good, we good.

00:36:24.319 --> 00:36:26.557
Some years ago I wrote an essay.

00:36:26.557 --> 00:36:29.150
It won an award from the
American Institute of Physics,

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:32.465
a writing prize award, and
the title the essay was

00:36:32.465 --> 00:36:33.882
In The Beginning.

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:38.192
And you're in the chair that I won

00:36:38.192 --> 00:36:40.396
and it's stenciled on the back.

00:36:40.396 --> 00:36:43.897
Plus I got $3,000, which is totally cool.

00:36:43.897 --> 00:36:46.349
- $3,000 is always a good thing to get.

00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:48.270
- Except I don't have the $3,000 anymore,

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.563
but I do have the chair.

00:36:49.563 --> 00:36:51.403
- Because you bought
this damn chair with it.

00:36:51.403 --> 00:36:52.616
(laughing)

00:36:52.616 --> 00:36:56.283
- So here's what I
celebrated in that essay.

00:36:57.828 --> 00:37:01.161
In that essay I celebrated the existence

00:37:02.518 --> 00:37:06.018
and the consequence of E equals MC squared

00:37:07.579 --> 00:37:09.829
on the arc of the universe.

00:37:12.767 --> 00:37:16.254
There is no understanding
of matter and energy

00:37:16.254 --> 00:37:19.239
in the universe without that equation.

00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:21.395
Stars would not produce energy.

00:37:21.395 --> 00:37:24.839
There would have been no Big Bang.

00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:29.121
Everything we take for
granted in this universe

00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:32.704
owes its foundation to
E equals MC squared.

00:37:34.043 --> 00:37:37.831
The equivalence of matter
and energy in the universe.

00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:39.874
For me that was the greatest discovery

00:37:39.874 --> 00:37:44.473
because of how much it
enabled us to understand.

00:37:44.473 --> 00:37:47.894
Combine that with quantum physics,

00:37:47.894 --> 00:37:50.292
had a lot of good folks
working on it in the 1920s.

00:37:50.292 --> 00:37:52.065
A watershed decade in the history of

00:37:52.065 --> 00:37:53.887
human understanding of the universe.

00:37:53.887 --> 00:37:56.492
Quantum physics is a theory of the small,

00:37:56.492 --> 00:37:58.575
atoms, molecules, nuclei.

00:38:00.386 --> 00:38:02.683
Coming to understand
how the universe works

00:38:02.683 --> 00:38:05.766
on its smallest scale made us badass.

00:38:07.545 --> 00:38:10.422
Not only could we have now well,

00:38:10.422 --> 00:38:12.638
bad, good and bad, bad.

00:38:12.638 --> 00:38:14.749
Take the word bad in both contexts

00:38:14.749 --> 00:38:19.749
because that empowered us to
end civilization as we know it.

00:38:20.508 --> 00:38:22.301
The foundation of the nuclear arsenals.

00:38:22.301 --> 00:38:23.208
- The atom bomb.

00:38:23.208 --> 00:38:24.268
- Exactly.

00:38:24.268 --> 00:38:25.247
Exactly.

00:38:25.247 --> 00:38:26.827
Yet it gave us our deepest understanding

00:38:26.827 --> 00:38:27.864
of how the world works

00:38:27.864 --> 00:38:29.680
and is the foundation to the entire

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.636
information technology revolution.

00:38:31.636 --> 00:38:36.317
There is no creation storage
or retrieval of information

00:38:36.317 --> 00:38:40.823
in the IT universe without an
understanding of the quantum.

00:38:40.823 --> 00:38:43.391
- Are you saying IT because I'm Indian

00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:44.839
and that's what my people excel at?

00:38:44.839 --> 00:38:46.694
- [Neil] Oh, that's your people?

00:38:46.694 --> 00:38:48.479
- That my people, we excel at IT.

00:38:48.479 --> 00:38:49.698
- Aren't you from Toronto?

00:38:49.698 --> 00:38:52.348
- Yeah, but I got to go
back to India for my family.

00:38:52.348 --> 00:38:53.290
(laughing)

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:54.202
- You got fam in India?

00:38:54.202 --> 00:38:55.035
- I do.

00:38:55.035 --> 00:38:55.868
- Oh, cool.

00:38:55.868 --> 00:38:56.701
- Tons-oh.

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:57.534
- Okay.

00:38:57.534 --> 00:39:00.743
So yeah for me, equals MC-squared.

00:39:00.743 --> 00:39:05.436
That's I think the most
profound fact of the universe.

00:39:05.436 --> 00:39:07.523
There's some close seconds
and thirds in that list,

00:39:07.523 --> 00:39:09.775
but I put equals MC-squared at the top.

00:39:09.775 --> 00:39:11.849
And what's cool is we learned
that in like third grade,

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:13.209
that's your first equation, right?

00:39:13.209 --> 00:39:14.727
- Well I was never a good student.

00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:15.560
- [Neil] Oh, yeah?

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.588
- I became more curious as I became older

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:19.933
'cause I always questioned everything.

00:39:19.933 --> 00:39:21.784
- [Neil] That's it.

00:39:21.784 --> 00:39:22.775
- [Russell] I know.

00:39:22.775 --> 00:39:23.848
- You don't need anything else.

00:39:23.848 --> 00:39:25.892
- I know but in the 70s and school,

00:39:25.892 --> 00:39:27.094
they didn't want you to question,

00:39:27.094 --> 00:39:29.039
they just want to accept
and I was like nah,

00:39:29.039 --> 00:39:30.629
I got questions about this.

00:39:30.629 --> 00:39:33.107
And they just boiled me
down to he's an idiot.

00:39:33.107 --> 00:39:35.145
- What do they say, what
are you, a comedian?

00:39:35.145 --> 00:39:36.182
(laughing)

00:39:36.182 --> 00:39:38.536
- One teacher told me I was
going to be a janitor so.

00:39:38.536 --> 00:39:39.776
I showed him.

00:39:39.776 --> 00:39:41.790
Now he's gonna say oh I
did that to motivate him,

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:42.770
like no you didn't.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:43.937
I saw the look in your eye

00:39:43.937 --> 00:39:45.337
and I heard the tone in your voice.

00:39:45.337 --> 00:39:46.698
- [Neil] Right, right, right.

00:39:46.698 --> 00:39:47.907
- So wait, but did you find it,

00:39:47.907 --> 00:39:49.288
and not to go off topic here,

00:39:49.288 --> 00:39:51.438
but don't you find it fascinating that...

00:39:51.438 --> 00:39:52.915
so Albert Einstein they came up with

00:39:52.915 --> 00:39:54.003
E equals MC-squared, right?

00:39:54.003 --> 00:39:55.203
- Yeah, yeah.

00:39:55.203 --> 00:39:57.178
- But it's in such a short amount of time,

00:39:57.178 --> 00:40:00.452
like it took us how many
you know centuries--

00:40:00.452 --> 00:40:01.572
- [Neil] Millennia.

00:40:01.572 --> 00:40:05.537
- Millennia to get there
and then from then to here

00:40:05.537 --> 00:40:08.240
we just did so much in
a short amount of time.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.568
Like why were we so dumb before that?

00:40:10.568 --> 00:40:13.068
(laughing)

00:40:13.068 --> 00:40:14.728
Like what made is so stupid before that

00:40:14.728 --> 00:40:17.088
and then all of a sudden like oh, bam!

00:40:17.088 --> 00:40:18.583
- Okay.

00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:20.083
It looks that way.

00:40:20.932 --> 00:40:23.221
It only looks that way.

00:40:23.221 --> 00:40:24.479
Okay?

00:40:24.479 --> 00:40:28.979
I have books from five years
before equals MC-squared,

00:40:30.376 --> 00:40:32.484
that would've been the year 1900.

00:40:32.484 --> 00:40:34.371
I have books.

00:40:34.371 --> 00:40:36.469
You read those books, science books.

00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:39.440
You read those books and say
the discoveries of recent years

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.288
are so vast and so amazing.

00:40:42.288 --> 00:40:45.476
We are lucky to be
living in special times.

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:49.155
Look at the steam ships across the ocean.

00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:52.137
We're laying telegraph cables.

00:40:52.137 --> 00:40:54.320
We can now communicate great distances.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.151
We have the railroads across the country.

00:40:58.151 --> 00:40:59.788
The world is smaller than ever before,

00:40:59.788 --> 00:41:01.768
what a great time to be alive.

00:41:01.768 --> 00:41:04.812
That's what they're
writing in the year 1900.

00:41:04.812 --> 00:41:07.812
So that's what you sound like today.

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:10.823
What a great time to be alive.

00:41:10.823 --> 00:41:12.393
Look at all the discoveries we've made.

00:41:12.393 --> 00:41:13.857
All I'm telling you is

00:41:13.857 --> 00:41:16.341
when you're living in a great time,

00:41:16.341 --> 00:41:20.444
every year feels like you're
living in a special time.

00:41:20.444 --> 00:41:21.989
Come back in a hundred years,

00:41:21.989 --> 00:41:24.470
we'll say those idiots back in 2019.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:25.978
What the hell did they know?

00:41:25.978 --> 00:41:28.277
- Yeah, well yeah, you can go back to 1999

00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:30.284
and be like a computer?

00:41:30.284 --> 00:41:31.369
It was you know?

00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:32.360
- Right or no, no, no.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.447
In 1999 no one has any
concept yet of a smartphone.

00:41:36.447 --> 00:41:38.482
- Yeah, well we had the
Palm Pilot I believe.

00:41:38.482 --> 00:41:39.670
- I had a Palm Pilot.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.503
- I had a Palm Pilot and I
thought that was pretty good.

00:41:41.503 --> 00:41:42.787
- Yeah, you thought it was great.

00:41:42.787 --> 00:41:46.620
I remember, I remember
1987 movie Wall Street.

00:41:48.937 --> 00:41:49.952
Okay?

00:41:49.952 --> 00:41:54.619
In that movie there's Gekko
on the beach in the Hamptons

00:41:55.732 --> 00:41:57.232
with a cell phone.

00:41:58.621 --> 00:42:02.500
And it's like shoulder-mounted
cell phone, right?

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:06.684
I remember 'cause I saw
that movie in first run

00:42:06.684 --> 00:42:09.396
and I remembered wow, that's cool.

00:42:09.396 --> 00:42:11.672
He could walk and there's no wires

00:42:11.672 --> 00:42:13.155
and he's talking on a phone

00:42:13.155 --> 00:42:15.031
and any of us today looking that

00:42:15.031 --> 00:42:17.483
say what the hell were we thinking?

00:42:17.483 --> 00:42:20.536
- I remember my brother's
first cell phone was about...

00:42:20.536 --> 00:42:22.724
about the size of that book,
that physics energy book

00:42:22.724 --> 00:42:23.557
and you had to carry--

00:42:23.557 --> 00:42:24.694
- Big fat book on my table.

00:42:24.694 --> 00:42:26.971
- It had a handle that pulled out

00:42:26.971 --> 00:42:28.622
and it still had like a receiver, like a--

00:42:28.622 --> 00:42:30.023
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:42:30.023 --> 00:42:31.134
- And the buttons were separate.

00:42:31.134 --> 00:42:32.594
- But it was portable.

00:42:32.594 --> 00:42:33.454
- It was portable.

00:42:33.454 --> 00:42:34.565
I used to sit in my brother's car

00:42:34.565 --> 00:42:36.872
and talk to my girlfriend
at the time like 1988, '89.

00:42:36.872 --> 00:42:38.427
- You're showing off in
front of your girlfriend.

00:42:38.427 --> 00:42:40.881
- No, because he had free
minutes after like nine o'clock

00:42:40.881 --> 00:42:43.544
so I would use it then and
it wasn't long distance,

00:42:43.544 --> 00:42:44.559
didn't matter then.

00:42:44.559 --> 00:42:45.807
- Right, right, right.

00:42:45.807 --> 00:42:49.496
So the evidence you're living
in special times is that

00:42:49.496 --> 00:42:51.867
at every moment you think
you're living in a special time.

00:42:51.867 --> 00:42:52.952
- Okay.

00:42:52.952 --> 00:42:54.048
Okay, but okay.

00:42:54.048 --> 00:42:55.793
Let's go with not just equals MC-squared.

00:42:55.793 --> 00:42:59.210
Let's say from like the mid-1800s to now,

00:43:00.716 --> 00:43:01.786
we made some big strides,

00:43:01.786 --> 00:43:03.010
but what was happening before that,

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.746
that just we were not doing anything.

00:43:04.746 --> 00:43:07.575
It just seems like we were
not being logical back then.

00:43:07.575 --> 00:43:11.525
- In the middle of the 1800s
we discovered and perfected

00:43:11.525 --> 00:43:12.858
and harnessed electricity.

00:43:12.858 --> 00:43:14.040
- Right, that's what I'm saying.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.029
when all that started--

00:43:15.029 --> 00:43:16.550
- You want to go before electricity?

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.383
- Yeah, like before that.

00:43:17.383 --> 00:43:18.479
Like let's goes 1700s.

00:43:18.479 --> 00:43:19.351
- Oh, oh.

00:43:19.351 --> 00:43:20.410
- Like we were just
like, what were we doing?

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:21.567
- The steam engine.

00:43:21.567 --> 00:43:23.325
Steam ships.

00:43:23.325 --> 00:43:24.296
Excuse me.

00:43:24.296 --> 00:43:25.389
- All right, all right.

00:43:25.389 --> 00:43:26.495
(laughing)

00:43:26.495 --> 00:43:28.051
All right, let's go 1600s.

00:43:28.051 --> 00:43:31.867
- 1600s, we've discovered that
Earth goes around the Sun.

00:43:31.867 --> 00:43:34.398
The Earth is not in the
middle of the known universe.

00:43:34.398 --> 00:43:35.288
- What was that guy's name again?

00:43:35.288 --> 00:43:36.243
That was Galileo?

00:43:36.243 --> 00:43:37.076
- Galileo.

00:43:37.076 --> 00:43:38.007
- Yes, see, all right.

00:43:38.007 --> 00:43:38.886
- Yeah, yeah.

00:43:38.886 --> 00:43:39.719
- Okay, just checking.

00:43:39.719 --> 00:43:41.051
- So no, there were discoveries.

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:41.884
- Making sure you knew.

00:43:41.884 --> 00:43:43.186
Making sure you're legit.

00:43:43.186 --> 00:43:45.478
Make sure this isn't
just Internet's trickery.

00:43:45.478 --> 00:43:50.478
- It is true that discoveries
happened less frequently.

00:43:50.576 --> 00:43:53.226
It is less likely that there
was an engineering discovery

00:43:53.226 --> 00:43:55.713
that would change your life at that time.

00:43:55.713 --> 00:43:57.271
That is true.

00:43:57.271 --> 00:43:58.896
But think of the mindset.

00:43:58.896 --> 00:44:01.750
If any discovery changed
your life at that time,

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:03.553
that was amazing,

00:44:03.553 --> 00:44:06.666
Because previously it didn't
change anybody's life.

00:44:06.666 --> 00:44:08.767
It would change it over generations.

00:44:08.767 --> 00:44:10.957
- Right, that's when things
were selling like hotcakes.

00:44:10.957 --> 00:44:13.008
(laughing)

00:44:13.008 --> 00:44:17.004
What I'm saying is people cared
about hotcakes at that time.

00:44:17.004 --> 00:44:18.971
That was the best part of their day.

00:44:18.971 --> 00:44:20.364
(laughing)

00:44:20.364 --> 00:44:22.685
- And you go later on, there
are advances in medicine

00:44:22.685 --> 00:44:26.018
and we discovered cures and there was...

00:44:27.279 --> 00:44:29.437
- Yeah, but I mean what I'm saying is like

00:44:29.437 --> 00:44:31.490
they were all farther apart,

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.566
you know spread apart
more and they seem like--

00:44:34.566 --> 00:44:38.824
- The 1700s into the 1800s,
we invent the chronometer

00:44:38.824 --> 00:44:42.090
that's seaworthy so we can
figure out longitude on Earth,

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.347
which has precision navigation.

00:44:45.347 --> 00:44:47.973
This stuff, you think you
live in special times,

00:44:47.973 --> 00:44:50.671
just go back then and
you'll be celebrating that.

00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:51.566
I'm just saying.

00:44:51.566 --> 00:44:53.594
- No, but I'm saying, what I'm saying is

00:44:53.594 --> 00:44:56.058
is that I feel like every
day we're discovering

00:44:56.058 --> 00:44:58.286
something new that's
gonna change our lives,

00:44:58.286 --> 00:45:00.418
but now there's so many things coming in,

00:45:00.418 --> 00:45:02.743
there's so many things that
we're discovering that,

00:45:02.743 --> 00:45:04.807
that they hold back on us now.

00:45:04.807 --> 00:45:05.942
(laughing)

00:45:05.942 --> 00:45:07.538
It's almost like hold on a second.

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:08.844
- This is too much for you.

00:45:08.844 --> 00:45:11.050
Yeah, we gotta be nice,
we gotta roll with that.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:12.555
- I was talking to a
computer guy the other day

00:45:12.555 --> 00:45:13.747
and he was tell me about technology

00:45:13.747 --> 00:45:16.424
that is about to be
introduced to the public.

00:45:16.424 --> 00:45:18.744
He said but we've had
this for over 12 years.

00:45:18.744 --> 00:45:20.880
And now they're introducing
it to the public.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.352
They make it seem like it's
the newest greatest thing,

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:23.894
he goes but this has been around.

00:45:23.894 --> 00:45:25.763
- Because they have a
marketability of the other stuff

00:45:25.763 --> 00:45:26.989
and they want to get their
money's worth out of it.

00:45:26.989 --> 00:45:28.164
The RND that produced it.

00:45:28.164 --> 00:45:28.997
- Yes.

00:45:28.997 --> 00:45:29.830
- Yeah, yeah.

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:30.663
- So there's so much--

00:45:30.663 --> 00:45:31.573
- They're holding back.

00:45:31.573 --> 00:45:32.707
That's an interesting concept.

00:45:32.707 --> 00:45:35.042
So if we keep this up we
could be a century behind

00:45:35.042 --> 00:45:36.538
what we could be doing just 'cause

00:45:36.538 --> 00:45:37.927
they're trying to make a buck off of stuff

00:45:37.927 --> 00:45:39.229
that they invented a hundred years ago.

00:45:39.229 --> 00:45:40.062
- Exactly.

00:45:40.062 --> 00:45:41.021
- Okay, interesting.

00:45:41.021 --> 00:45:42.584
This is an interesting conspiracy theory.

00:45:42.584 --> 00:45:43.695
- I don't know if it's a conspiracy

00:45:43.695 --> 00:45:46.785
or if it's just a hypothesis.

00:45:46.785 --> 00:45:48.836
- We only have a couple of minutes left.

00:45:48.836 --> 00:45:50.702
We're go into lightning round, okay?

00:45:50.702 --> 00:45:52.967
So ask me five questions

00:45:52.967 --> 00:45:54.774
and I'll give you sound
byte answers to 'em.

00:45:54.774 --> 00:45:55.607
Okay?

00:45:55.607 --> 00:45:56.738
- All right, from these questions?

00:45:56.738 --> 00:45:57.571
- And they took my bell from me.

00:45:57.571 --> 00:45:58.432
We'll have to simulate this.

00:45:58.432 --> 00:45:59.459
Okay, ready? Go!

00:45:59.459 --> 00:46:00.519
- Okay, here, ready?

00:46:00.519 --> 00:46:03.551
When the Earth and the moon
become double tidally locked,

00:46:03.551 --> 00:46:06.096
what effect could that have
on tides and weather patterns?

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.324
- Oh, excellent.

00:46:07.324 --> 00:46:10.117
So the moon is spiraling away from Earth

00:46:10.117 --> 00:46:11.696
at the rate of a few inches a year.

00:46:11.696 --> 00:46:13.100
One effect of that is that Earth is

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.527
slowing down in our rotation.

00:46:14.527 --> 00:46:16.072
We have to put in leap
seconds every now and then.

00:46:16.072 --> 00:46:17.658
You know the moon is trying to do?

00:46:17.658 --> 00:46:18.491
- What?

00:46:18.491 --> 00:46:21.844
- It's trying to slow us
down so that one day on Earth

00:46:21.844 --> 00:46:24.361
equals one month for the moon.

00:46:24.361 --> 00:46:25.614
When that happens we will always show

00:46:25.614 --> 00:46:27.631
the same face to the moon.

00:46:27.631 --> 00:46:31.294
And when that happens there
will be no tides at all.

00:46:31.294 --> 00:46:32.875
Tides will end.

00:46:32.875 --> 00:46:33.866
- Really?

00:46:33.866 --> 00:46:35.045
- Yeah, well moon tides will end.

00:46:35.045 --> 00:46:36.035
We'll still have Sun tides,

00:46:36.035 --> 00:46:38.215
but the moon tides will end, yeah.

00:46:38.215 --> 00:46:39.854
- What are moon tides exactly?

00:46:39.854 --> 00:46:42.648
- The gravity of the moon across the Earth

00:46:42.648 --> 00:46:44.315
stretches the Earth.

00:46:45.255 --> 00:46:46.691
The part of the Earth close to the moon

00:46:46.691 --> 00:46:48.612
pulls closer to the moon.

00:46:48.612 --> 00:46:50.652
The part that's farther
away is farthest away

00:46:50.652 --> 00:46:53.495
and it stretches and Earth
rotates inside of those

00:46:53.495 --> 00:46:54.707
tidal bulges.

00:46:54.707 --> 00:46:56.487
You're at the beach and the tide comes in,

00:46:56.487 --> 00:46:58.330
the tide comes out goes out.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:46:59.757
Nothing's coming in and out,

00:46:59.757 --> 00:47:02.211
you are rotating on the solid Earth

00:47:02.211 --> 00:47:07.211
in and out of a tidal bulge
caused by the moon and the Sun

00:47:07.517 --> 00:47:09.542
on the ocean surface.

00:47:09.542 --> 00:47:12.338
- Is it like when you're
in a bathtub with water

00:47:12.338 --> 00:47:14.198
and you start rocking back and forth,

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:15.450
the water starts--

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.037
- No, in that case it's just
the water that's moving.

00:47:18.037 --> 00:47:18.889
- Okay.

00:47:18.889 --> 00:47:20.380
- In this case it looks
like the water's moving,

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.346
but it's not, it's you rotating into it.

00:47:22.346 --> 00:47:24.622
Hardly anyone knows that
because colloquially

00:47:24.622 --> 00:47:26.179
we talk about tides moving in and out,

00:47:26.179 --> 00:47:28.513
but we are rotating into the tidal bulge

00:47:28.513 --> 00:47:30.221
and out of the tidal bulge.

00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:32.393
And there'll be a point
where the tides won't,

00:47:32.393 --> 00:47:36.225
the tides will just be static
and they'll never change.

00:47:36.225 --> 00:47:38.172
- So that is inevitable.

00:47:38.172 --> 00:47:40.481
- It'll take longer for that to happen

00:47:40.481 --> 00:47:42.716
than the future life expectancy of the Sun

00:47:42.716 --> 00:47:43.721
so don't worry about it.

00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:44.554
- Okay.

00:47:44.554 --> 00:47:45.408
(laughing)

00:47:45.408 --> 00:47:46.241
Well that's a concern of mine.

00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:47.464
- I'm supposed give a short
answer to that question.

00:47:47.464 --> 00:47:48.484
- [Russell] Well I know but--

00:47:48.484 --> 00:47:49.719
- I'll give you one last one, go.

00:47:49.719 --> 00:47:52.763
- How similar must an
exoplanet be to Earth

00:47:52.763 --> 00:47:55.005
in order to host human life?

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:57.057
- Oh, you know I think
we can handle a planet

00:47:57.057 --> 00:47:58.967
that has slightly less gravity.

00:47:58.967 --> 00:48:00.229
What do you weigh here on Earth?

00:48:00.229 --> 00:48:01.596
185 pounds?

00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:02.953
- Thank you, but 215.

00:48:02.953 --> 00:48:04.790
- 215, dude where you packing it?

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:06.596
You're big boned, it's big bones.

00:48:06.596 --> 00:48:08.415
- You were talking about, nevermind.

00:48:08.415 --> 00:48:09.248
(laughing)

00:48:09.248 --> 00:48:10.081
Bulges.

00:48:12.731 --> 00:48:16.321
- If you go to a exoplanet
was slightly less gravity

00:48:16.321 --> 00:48:19.385
and your way 190 pounds,
you're not gonna complain.

00:48:19.385 --> 00:48:21.615
Slightly more gravity,
if your heart is strong,

00:48:21.615 --> 00:48:24.809
and you a 230, 240,
you're not gonna complain.

00:48:24.809 --> 00:48:26.153
- Don't take me back up there.

00:48:26.153 --> 00:48:28.616
- So there's a range, you won't be fatter,

00:48:28.616 --> 00:48:30.408
you'll just weigh more.

00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:32.670
Your weight is not only how
many molecules you have in you,

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:36.125
it's also what's the force
of gravity operating on you.

00:48:36.125 --> 00:48:38.119
So you weight more but
you won't look heavier.

00:48:38.119 --> 00:48:40.036
You'll just be heavier.

00:48:41.389 --> 00:48:42.873
- So my mass will be the same?

00:48:42.873 --> 00:48:44.477
- Mass will be the same, correct.

00:48:44.477 --> 00:48:46.859
But your weight can be less or more

00:48:46.859 --> 00:48:48.756
depending on what planet you're on.

00:48:48.756 --> 00:48:50.900
In fact it's less or more on Earth.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.180
If you go to the equator
and the equator's spinning.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.192
On the equator you're moving
a thousand miles an hour.

00:48:56.192 --> 00:48:58.268
You weigh less on the equator

00:48:58.268 --> 00:49:00.260
than you do here in New York City.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.142
You weigh less on a mountaintop
than you do in a cave.

00:49:03.142 --> 00:49:05.023
- We should go to the equator guys.

00:49:05.023 --> 00:49:06.107
(laughing)

00:49:06.107 --> 00:49:08.524
They should have weigh-ins
for fights at the equator.

00:49:08.524 --> 00:49:09.796
- At the equator.

00:49:09.796 --> 00:49:11.093
And if you had a mountain on the equator

00:49:11.093 --> 00:49:13.592
you weigh less than any
other place on Earth.

00:49:13.592 --> 00:49:14.585
- That's it.

00:49:14.585 --> 00:49:16.764
I'm gonna propose it to the UFC.

00:49:16.764 --> 00:49:18.716
- But you have to ascend the mountain.

00:49:18.716 --> 00:49:19.549
- Eh.

00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:20.893
- You'll lose the weight
that you would have

00:49:20.893 --> 00:49:22.661
hoped you lose by being
in a lower gravity well

00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:24.595
just by climbing the mountain.

00:49:24.595 --> 00:49:26.356
So you better off just...

00:49:26.356 --> 00:49:27.696
By the way, it's not all that much weight.

00:49:27.696 --> 00:49:30.137
You pee out more weight
than you would lose

00:49:30.137 --> 00:49:31.647
by going to the equator.

00:49:31.647 --> 00:49:33.574
It's ounces, it's not pounds.

00:49:33.574 --> 00:49:34.702
- Well then I'd be pissed.

00:49:34.702 --> 00:49:35.535
(laughing)

00:49:35.535 --> 00:49:38.205
If I went through all that.

00:49:38.205 --> 00:49:39.740
- Russell, we got to go.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.122
- Why, this is so much fun.

00:49:41.122 --> 00:49:42.358
- Thanks, we got to do this again.

00:49:42.358 --> 00:49:43.271
- Yes, please.

00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:44.389
- [Neil] Next time you come through town.

00:49:44.389 --> 00:49:45.222
- Yes.

00:49:45.222 --> 00:49:47.303
- [Neil] Are you a world
tourist, a world performer--

00:49:47.303 --> 00:49:48.552
- I come to New York all the time.

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:49.733
- [Neil] New York's gotta
be in your soul somewhere.

00:49:49.733 --> 00:49:50.971
- It's definitely in my soul.

00:49:50.971 --> 00:49:51.804

00:49:51.804 --> 00:49:52.816

00:49:52.816 --> 00:49:53.824
- Russell, great to have you.

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:56.490
You've been listening to
and possibly even watching

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:58.312
StarTalk Cosmic Queries.

00:49:58.312 --> 00:49:59.714
Thank you to Russel Peters.

00:49:59.714 --> 00:50:00.547
