00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.129
[Vsauce 2]

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.403
This house in Germany was built
upside down,

00:00:06.403 --> 00:00:09.700
including every single room
and all of the furniture,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.323
and it's referred to
as "The World Stands on its Head."

00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:15.544
What the FAK?

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:18.376
The Facts and Knowledge
on weird houses.

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:21.488
This upside-down house
located in Poland

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.525
was created by Daniel Czapiewski.

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:25.525
The house was meant to be
a profound statement

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.071
about the Communist Era
and the state of the world.

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.647
Normally built in three weeks,
this house took 114 days,

00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:36.174
because the workers were so disoriented
by the strange angles of the walls,

00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:39.448
and many tourists complain
of seasickness and dizziness

00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:42.165
after only a few minutes
of being inside.

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:45.970
The Ensculptic was built
by Winslow Wedin in Minnesota

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.429
and was constructed almost entirely
out of foam.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.327
The 4,000-square foot,
two bedroom, three bathroom house

00:00:52.327 --> 00:00:55.601
has plenty of amenities,
including a fireplace, garage, and deck,

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:57.644
but when it was for sale,
the vaulted ceiling,

00:00:57.644 --> 00:01:02.026
rounded corners, and curved walls
were the primary selling point.

00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:05.080
The Futuro House was designed
by Matti Suuronen,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.100
and it looks like a flying saucer.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.653
Fewer than 100 were built
in the 60s and 70s,

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:13.787
and the distinctive shape
makes them popular among collectors.

00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:16.690
Composed of polyester,
plastic, and fiberglass,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.476
it was designed as a ski cabin
that would be quick to heat

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:21.914
and easy to construct
in rough terrain.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.654
But the house was taken
off the market in the mid-'70s,

00:01:24.654 --> 00:01:28.644
when high gas prices made
the manufacture of plastic extremely expensive.

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:32.894
It's estimated that around 50
of the original Futuro homes are still around.

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:36.121
The Guitar House is located
in Fayetteville, Georgia,

00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:39.511
and was built
by country-Western singer Elvis Carden.

00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:42.712
The 3,800-square foot,
guitar-shaped home

00:01:42.712 --> 00:01:45.028
took 16 years to build.

00:01:45.028 --> 00:01:48.278
The exterior walls had
the perfect curves of a Gibson.

00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:51.158
It has aluminum cables
across the length for strings,

00:01:51.158 --> 00:01:54.037
and upon completion,
Carden released an album

00:01:54.037 --> 00:01:56.266
called Living in an Old Guitar.

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:59.261
The Dog Bark Park Inn is
a bed and breakfast

00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:02.280
inside the world's largest beagle.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.043
Located in Idaho, it was built
by husband and wife owners

00:02:05.043 --> 00:02:07.199
Dennis Sullivan and Frances Conklin.

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:10.891
Guests enter the body of the beagle
through a private second-story deck,

00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:15.465
and the head of the dog is a loft
with a cozy alcove in the muzzle.

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:18.298
The dog bed and breakfast
is nicknamed Sweet Willy,

00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:21.827
and the 12-foot-tall smaller beagle
is named Toby.

00:02:21.827 --> 00:02:27.827
Oh, and the 11-foot fire hydrant nearby
contains a public restroom for humans.

00:02:27.827 --> 00:02:31.950
Joanne Ussary bought a 727
and spent $24,000 dollars

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.456
on renovations, converting it
into her dream home.

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:38.335
There are three bedrooms,
a living room, and a modern kitchen.

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:42.933
There's a jacuzzi in the cockpit,
and Joanne's bedroom is in first class.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:46.044
She says next time she wants
a Boeing 747,

00:02:46.044 --> 00:02:49.504
because those have an upstairs,
and she wants to go upstairs to go to bed.

00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:52.313
And there's also a guy
named Bruce Campbell in Oregon

00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:55.514
who renovated his own Boeing 727
into a home,

00:02:55.514 --> 00:02:58.184
but his cost
around $200,000 dollars.

00:02:58.184 --> 00:03:01.452
In Helen, Pennsylvania,
there's a 48-foot long,

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:04.122
25-foot tall shoe house.

00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:07.141
The shoe house was completed
in 1949

00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:11.320
by shoe store owner Colonel Haines
for advertising purposes.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.710
Haines walked up to an architect,
handed him an old work boot,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.496
and said, "Build me a house
like this."

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:21.699
So located on Shoe House Road,
it has a shoe mailbox

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.439
and a boot-decorated fence
surrounding the yard.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.131
The dog house is shaped like a boot,
and every window in the shoe house

00:03:28.131 --> 00:03:30.429
is decorated
with a stained glass shoe.

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.400
The front door has a stained glass portrait
of the Colonel holding shoes,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.037
and the current owners sell "Heel-basi"
and "Toe-Dogs" out of a snack bar in the heel.

00:03:40.037 --> 00:03:42.917
Walking House is
a modular dwelling system

00:03:42.917 --> 00:03:46.260
that enables people to live
a peaceful, nomadic life,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.232
moving slowly with minimal impact
on the environment.

00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:53.086
It collects energy using solar cells
and small windmills.

00:03:53.086 --> 00:03:55.518
There's a system
for collecting rainwater

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:58.049
and a system
for solar-heated hot water.

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.069
Walking House is not dependent
on roads,

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.345
but actually moves
on many different kinds of terrain

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:05.433
at a slow pace similar
to that of a walking human.

00:04:05.433 --> 00:04:09.914
For 33 years, Robert Bruno designed
and built his Steel House

00:04:09.914 --> 00:04:11.914
on the edge of a canyon.

00:04:11.914 --> 00:04:14.511
Located in Lubbock, Texas,
all of the walls in the home

00:04:14.511 --> 00:04:18.366
are either welded metal
or original glass creations,

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:22.034
all designed to optimize the light
and the visual experience.

00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:25.139
The late mayor
of Suwon, South Korea, Sim Jae-Duck,

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.508
built his loo-shaped,
two-story home

00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:32.407
to mark the 2007 inaugural meeting
of the World Toilet Association.

00:04:32.407 --> 00:04:35.495
Jae-Duck, reportedly born
in a restroom,

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:39.210
made it his life's work
to advocate for clean and working sanitation

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.134
for more than two billion people
living without toilets worldwide.

00:04:43.134 --> 00:04:48.451
The 4,520-square foot
steel, concrete and glass structure

00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:52.097
set Mayor Toilet back $1.1 million dollars.

00:04:52.097 --> 00:04:54.744
It features
a showcase glass-walled bathroom

00:04:54.744 --> 00:04:56.810
at its center, but those concerned
with privacy

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.364
can turn the walls opaque
at the touch of a button.

00:04:59.364 --> 00:05:02.011
It features a rooftop balcony
that's accessible

00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:05.471
by a toilet drain staircase,
and it's referred to

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.700
as Mr. Toilet House.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.509
Located in Austria,
the Auto Residence looks

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.509
like a futuristic Volkswagen Bug.

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.407
Designed by Markus Voglereiter,
it has two separate living spaces

00:05:16.407 --> 00:05:18.845
that are connected
by metal staircases,

00:05:18.845 --> 00:05:21.190
and there are numerous windows
throughout the house,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.953
making the entire car home
bright and sunny.

00:05:23.953 --> 00:05:28.202
John Milkovisch loved beer
a lot, so he covered his house

00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:31.778
with aluminum siding
made entirely of flattened beer cans.

00:05:31.778 --> 00:05:36.190
Over 18 years, he attached
around 50,000 beer cans.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.742
When asked why, he said,
"I guess I thought it was a good idea,

00:05:39.742 --> 00:05:41.742
and it's easier than painting."

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:44.316
The house and landscape are adorned
with many different types of beer

00:05:44.316 --> 00:05:46.476
that John drank mostly himself.

00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:48.983
He even used the pull tabs
and tops and bottoms

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:51.816
to make curtains
for his Beer Can house.

00:05:51.816 --> 00:05:54.092
I'm going to leave you
with this weird houseâ€”

00:05:54.092 --> 00:05:56.576
who designed it,
and what was it called?

00:05:56.576 --> 00:05:59.177
Before we go,
here's last video's winner.

00:05:59.177 --> 00:06:01.313
