00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.200
So let's take a quick look at the code query for the conference entities. So

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.910
here I am in the conference api.javafile or conferenceapifile

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.222
and the queryConferences method. So you'll notice it's declared has a at

00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:20.750
APIMethod annotation. Name queryConferences. Path queryConferences.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.170
And the httpMethod is HttpMethod.POST. So

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.380
the query for the conference is, you create the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.450
query of type conference. Then you call ofy.load.type specifying the

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.570
entity class, which in this case is conference class.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.150
And then we want to order by name. To actually

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.750
execute the query, we call the list method on

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.440
the query. And we're going to return the results of running

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.130
the query, which is going to be all the conferences,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.760
ordered by name. And that's all there is to it.
