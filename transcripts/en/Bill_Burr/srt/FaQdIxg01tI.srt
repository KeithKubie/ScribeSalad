1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,670
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burn and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:08,050
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,400
Ahhh,

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,540
just checking in.
Just checking in on you,

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,270
seeing how you're doing. How are
you today? Huh? Are you upset?

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,780
Thursday afternoon, Thursday
night football. What happened?

7
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:30,781
What happened during the song this time
that made people upset and decided that

8
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:34,480
they were going to get all up in arms
about their corner of the fucking world.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,280
Yeah.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,150
Unbelievable. I'm so fucking,
I'm going to be the guy talking.

11
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:45,151
I'm so fucking listening to people making
that thing about what they want it to

12
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:49,120
be about. It's like, that's not
what the initial protest was about.

13
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:51,250
If you would like to
discuss police brutality,

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm more than willing to listen to what,

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,330
I don't want to hear
your fucking Soliloquy,

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,040
you know all those people who are like,
you know, want to be the reverend,

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,500
like I don't even care. I don't even
he, yeah, of course you don't care.

18
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:07,480
It doesn't fuck what they're talking about
doesn't affect you. So then about you.

19
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,520
Okay. Who gives a fuck? It's one

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,560
moment at the beginning of the game,

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,910
commenting on something that people
are trying to fix. That's all.

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,570
That's all my biggest complaint about
tonight's game between the bears and the

23
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:31,571
fucking packets is they stopped the game
because there's potential of lightning

24
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,910
God for fucking bid.
Somebody gets electrocuted.

25
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,380
It's unbelievable.

26
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:44,381
It's unbelievable how important human
being still consider other human beings.

27
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,010
I just don't it. It really isn't
about that. It's like folk,

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,530
do you think the NFL gives a
fuck about you? They don't.

29
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,150
They don't give a shit about you.

30
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:56,930
They don't want you to get electrocuted
because then you can't go out and buy

31
00:01:56,931 --> 00:02:00,920
another jersey or another
ticket or NFL Sunday ticket.

32
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:05,360
That's what they care about and somehow
they're going to get blamed, right?

33
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,540
Because everybody in the crowd,
he's going to be like, well,

34
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:12,170
they should've known that
God was gonna do that.

35
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,420
You should have known what the weather
was gonna be. You know, there's no more,

36
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,940
Hey, fuck, oh, you went
outside. You know what?

37
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,920
South side lightning and you
went outside and God dammit,

38
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,280
lightening found you and that's
your own dumb luck. Guess what?

39
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,420
You're going to have your own Wikipedia
page. Now you don't have one now.

40
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,600
Nobody knows who the fuck you are,
but you get struck by lightening.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,980
Tommy's going to find you on Wikipedia.
Maybe you won't get your own page.

42
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,730
You might be on a page that's just a list
of people struck by lightening in 2017

43
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,280
or in or in whatever the fuck
would call in this decade.

44
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,230
It has to be an extraordinary
circumstance.

45
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,340
When you get struck by lightening
for you to your own Wikipedia page,

46
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:03,250
you have to get struck by lightning
and then something else happens.

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,170
You struck by lightning,

48
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,640
you catch on fire and you run into
a paper machine factory. All right?

49
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:13,850
With a bunch of children there who's
make a wish was that they could go to a

50
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:15,930
make a fucking paper machine factory.

51
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,780
Then you run in there and and then it all
goes up and all those little kids died.

52
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:23,500
Then now they need to have to share it
with the kids and it's a tough thing.

53
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,580
It's hard to get struck by lightening
and get your own Wikipedia page,

54
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,560
you know? You know, it's funny
as if that actually happened.

55
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,180
You got struck by lightning, you had a
nice afro going, you catches on fire,

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,250
you run into a paper Marshay factory.

57
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,280
There was a bunch of make a wish kids
in there and then they all fucking died.

58
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,480
The funniest fucking thing about all that
is how much shit your relatives would

59
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:50,890
get. You know what I mean?
Saying, Oh, you know that guy guy,

60
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:53,620
he's one of those Wilson kids.
Yeah.

61
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,190
You know his fucking brother gets struck
by lightening instead of just die in

62
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,850
laying there burning the
fucking asshole content.

63
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:04,120
He is runs into a paper machine factory
and kills a bunch of kids that were

64
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:06,700
already dying anyways.
You know

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,600
that everybody treats them like shit.

66
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,010
Like you can keep your wits about
you when your head's on fire.

67
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,310
The bottom line is, is uh, I
dunno what happened to football.

68
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,210
I don't ever remember it being
stopped because of weather used to be,

69
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,820
they'd play in all kinds of weather.
Right.

70
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:27,140
And you had the ice bowl
up there in green bay.

71
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,330
You had that game when all the locust to
send it down on the Kansas city chiefs

72
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:34,390
when they played the
fucking, uh, New York titans.

73
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,970
I'm just making up shit at this point.
I don't know what happened to the game,

74
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:40,270
but now any time is going to
be a little bit of crosswind.

75
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:43,570
What if it blows somebody's sunglasses
off and goes into somebody's eye?

76
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,040
I mean, Jesus Christ, those, those
people that, that's Wisconsin,

77
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,900
the amount of layers of clothes and
blubber you have to go through after the

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,210
lightning strikes them to even like,
you know,

79
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:01,600
rattle a few fillings loose of the
average person in Wisconsin. These are,

80
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:05,050
these are, these are wholesome
people up there. Okay?

81
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,200
They get that ll bean catalog and
to those people that is formal,

82
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,800
where do you understand that? You know,
when you get married in Wisconsin,

83
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:18,820
you can actually show up, you
know, you know, like everybody,

84
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:20,830
you're going to wear
tails with your Tuxedo.

85
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,310
They ask him if they're going
to wear those fucking, you
know, those rubber pants.

86
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,510
It was fucking rude.
The suspenders when you go trout fishing,

87
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,200
somebody was saying there was some
fucking guy, he walked out into the ocean.

88
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,480
I don't know why the fuck he was in a
river, some sort of water, a watery area,

89
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:42,481
and he walked in there and this wave came
in and washed into his fucking pants.

90
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,480
They'll come tipped him over and he
couldn't get up because the combination of

91
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:53,800
the weight of his ass and his legs, those
rubber pants and all the water in it,

92
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:58,670
it just fucking a, he drowned.
I don't know if that's true,

93
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,190
if that sounds like something
a fucking old lady with Tyson,

94
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:04,760
all this fucking old lady when
I was a kid, you know backwards.

95
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,200
You know parents didn't watch their kids
like parenting back in the day you woke

96
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,020
up, you gave him fucking, you
know the multicolored cereal.

97
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,040
He opened the door and they went outside
and they just met other kids and with

98
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:16,851
your kid brains,

99
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:20,750
you figured out what you were going to
do that day where there was this old lady

100
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,530
who lived around the corner and she still
always tell us all these crazy fucking

101
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:29,330
stories. She had terrible candy to where
you'd still show up. I don't know why,

102
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,800
and she's be one time now. I mean, she
may and Jeremy on when you get your guy,

103
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,310
any, hey tried to stomp his foot down
on the brakes to stop showing it,

104
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,980
wouldn't go through it and stop shining.

105
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,220
She said that his leg went all
the way up into his body and his,

106
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,030
and it was like six inches shorter
in front of the rest of his life.

107
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,570
He walked around and he couldn't get him,
you know,

108
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,330
and I used to come home and I'd repeat
the stories to my mother. Right.

109
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,730
I'd be like, mom, he [inaudible]. Yeah.
You know, one tiny, I was a guy, he,

110
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,240
his leg went up into his body and she,
one day she finally,

111
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:04,310
I think it was listened to me,
she just looked at me and she goes,

112
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,210
who told you that? Now it's like, oh,
the lady down the street. She goes,

113
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,630
tell listen to her. She's crazy. I
don't know why my mother talk like that.

114
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,630
I needed to do a different voice.
She doesn't smoke.

115
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,620
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about,

116
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,930
but what would you expect from
someone who forgot it was Thursday.

117
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,650
That's how awesome my life is.
I forgot it was Thursday.

118
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,280
Now sometimes he can forget it's Thursday
because your life is fucking terrible,

119
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,490
right? You Rhonda, right?

120
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:35,210
You're on a fucking bender or you're,
you're like,

121
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:38,370
I don't know what you're fucking,
um,

122
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,370
I dunno. You're fucking,
you're a political prisoner.

123
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,250
You forget what date is your in Shawshank.
All right.

124
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,200
Sometimes you fight them off.
Sometimes you don't.

125
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,540
You're marking off the days he
got Rita Hayworth on the wall.

126
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,130
You don't know what fucking data's not.

127
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:55,370
Even if you're Andy do frain and you're
good with numbers, you lose track.

128
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,260
And the only other people
that lose track of that,

129
00:07:57,261 --> 00:08:01,100
of people who work for themselves, which
I don't, I work for Netflix now, I guess.

130
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,440
I don't know. I just, you know, after
awhile you just said what fucking day is?

131
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,900
I don't know. Another day.
Live in the dream day. Um,

132
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,710
anyways, okay. Football Sundays
coming up. [inaudible] boom.

133
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,970
I'm going to start doing my
gambling pick of the week,

134
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,670
my gambling pick of the week.
All right.

135
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,880
I'm guaranteeing you that
if you gamble on this game,

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,560
money is going to change hands either
out of your pocket or into your pocket or

137
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,610
it might be a push.

138
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm guaranteeing that he called me
up at one 800 freckles fat that,

139
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,640
that um,

140
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,750
the giants getting three and Tampa Bay,

141
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,110
that giants,
the Oh and three giants.

142
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,140
Everybody looking at him like that washed
up for getting that Eli Manning has

143
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:53,960
won two super bowls against the
reigning super bowl champions.

144
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:58,950
They beat bill Belicheck two times. Um,
guys got two rings, you know, he's got,

145
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:02,940
he's got two rings, he's got no respect
and he's got half an offensive line,

146
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,930
but I think this week to get in three,
they were underdogs.

147
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,260
They did find fine against Philly
last week that came back late.

148
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:14,730
But who gives a shit? They still scored
27 points. I didn't really pay attention.

149
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,520
Right?
And then they lost on a 61 fucking year,

150
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,533
right?

151
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,510
Some fucking dude from nine oh
two one o came walking in. Right.

152
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,160
They just fucking kicked the goddamn
thing, like the end of a Hollywood movie.

153
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,993
All right.

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,750
Ain't going to happen. They're going to
go down to Tampa. Okay. First of all,

155
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,360
nobody respects the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
You know why?

156
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Because they have a giant pirates of
the Caribbean ship inside their stadium.

157
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,350
I don't know what they're trying to do.

158
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:52,970
I don't understand how
the Oakland Raiders, okay.

159
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,010
Who have like a pirate on the side of
their helmet are able to achieve the

160
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:02,510
baddest, baddest fucking uniform in all
the sports. As far as I'm concerned.

161
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,930
They, when they moved to Vegas and
they have the white home jerseys,

162
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:09,920
they better go back to the silver numbers.
[inaudible] my name is it Billy?

163
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:13,970
Fat tits. Alright. Tampa Bay Buccaneers,

164
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,140
I don't understand is what is
a buccaneer. Exactly. Okay,

165
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,690
let's look this up.
Because judging by their colors,

166
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:25,460
I feel like it's more like the
musical theater sort of pirate.

167
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,201
It's much more,

168
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:31,520
let's just go out and have an adventure
rather than raping and pillaging.

169
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:32,990
Okay.

170
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,680
What do we got here? All right, and
then fucking Buccaneers lost last week.

171
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:40,490
34 to 17 so they're coming off a big loss.
That's always a concern.

172
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:45,390
What the fuck is a buccaneer? Buccaneer.
All right. Buccaneers were a kind.

173
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah.
Okay.

174
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,140
A privater or pirate.
What's a privater private tier?

175
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,710
Yeah,

176
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,600
a private tier was a private person
also, they keep to themselves. Well,

177
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,280
that's not really good
in a team sport is it?

178
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,630
Or ship that engaged in maritime warfare.
Okay.

179
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:10,310
Under a commission of war.
All right.

180
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,290
Well it did it very officially.
All right.

181
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,763
Okay.

182
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,810
Particular to the Caribbean Sea, yet
pirates of the Caribbean. That's right.

183
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,950
Originally the name applied
to the landless hunters of
wild boars and cattle and

184
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,680
they largely uninhabited areas of tor
to Gha and Hispaniola the meat caught.

185
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,390
They smoked over a slow fire where
the fire, what are we talking about?

186
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,000
Something about jerk me or Jerky.

187
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,040
Why should we fear these people?
You know what?

188
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,700
This is just a whole bunch of reading
that I don't want to do it when caught by

189
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,190
anti pirate English authorities.
Seven. Alright. You know,

190
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:55,150
what I needed to do was to do
between a pirate in a buccaneer. Oh,

191
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:56,380
what's the difference?

192
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,590
What's the difference
between a or aid in Oakland?

193
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,910
Read and a buccaneer? I
would say about 30 pounds,

194
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,580
judge. I've been, well,

195
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,300
I've never been to the Tampa stadium
going to be there in a few weeks, so yeah.

196
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,283
Okay.

197
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:18,610
Yeah.

198
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,860
Buccaneer verse rate or
what's The difference?

199
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,300
This is why you've got
to love the Internet.

200
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,630
I'm not saying they have a right answer,
but they always have an answer.

201
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,160
What's the difference?

202
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,190
A buccaneer is a synonym
of Raider as nouns.

203
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,440
The difference between a buccaneer in
a raider is that buccaneer is an is

204
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,410
nautical.
Any of a group of Semen Jews?

205
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,850
No.
See men who cruised on their own account,

206
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,420
on the Spanish main and in the
Pacific in the 17th century,

207
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,700
similar to pirates, but did not
pray on ships of their own nation.

208
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,440
While the reader is one who gauges,
engages in a raid,

209
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,410
colon semi-colon, a plunderer. Well,

210
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:10,180
what the fuck is a raid and what is a
plunderer? See this. This is what you do.

211
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,490
You have fucking
plunderer.

212
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,800
The plunderer is a fictional character,
so they leave.

213
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,000
They don't even exist that
I don't want this fucking,

214
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,300
that was actually a superhero.
Daredevil fought the plunderer.

215
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,310
Plunderer come on, man. Come
on. Give me something. Give
me something here. You cons.

216
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,390
Plunder.
Wikipedia is just such a one trick pony.

217
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:40,820
Sometimes they just keep guiding
you back to the same fucking

218
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,330
yeah.

219
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,810
T to plunder the public treasury to
take wrongfully as pillars. Yeah. Okay.

220
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:50,930
All right. You know, I don't even
give a shit anymore. How about that?

221
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:55,820
All they know is whoever fucking drew
the Raiders logo did not draw the

222
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:58,760
Buccaneers logo.
That first one at least and less.

223
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,980
He was a raider fan.

224
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,920
It was like these for these fucking
guys saying that Kinda like us.

225
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,290
We already took this name.
Let me see. Tampa Bay.

226
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,513
Yeah.

227
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,200
Fucking ears.
It's be like a porno logo.

228
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,260
Yeah.

229
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,340
What do we got here that's sort of a
pirate? [inaudible] they kinda ripped off.

230
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,180
They're trying to rip off the old fucking
Oh,

231
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,660
trying to rip off the Raiders here. Well,
let's see. They're fucking original.

232
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,300
Their original logo was just like,
I think it was Tom Selleck.

233
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,190
I don't know what it was. No, not really.

234
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:39,860
Tom Selleck sort of winking at you.

235
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,300
Yeah.

236
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,070
Tiniest of knives in his fucking mouth.
There's the one I remember right there.

237
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,900
The cream sickle.

238
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,463
Yeah.

239
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,610
Yeah. I don't know what that was.
He looked like a three musketeer.

240
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:54,560
You look like a good guy.
I think that that was the problem.

241
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,410
Was there a point to any of that? I
don't think there was. Um, anyways,

242
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:58,971
this is one of the,

243
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:03,140
this is one of the greatest times
of the year in United States sports.

244
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,200
And who's kidding? Our sports are
the best if you don't believe it.

245
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,750
If you don't believe our athletes
are the best, I'm telling you,

246
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:11,660
you need to watch the Olympics.
Okay.

247
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,500
All of our white athletes
dominating all of those games.

248
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,170
Well, maybe we do. We do well in the
Winter Olympics that we know we don't,

249
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:25,880
we lose to the fucking Canadians.
We beat the Canadians in like the juniors.

250
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,660
We always beat them because anybody like
our age is already made it up to the

251
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:33,290
fucking Nhl, you know? But you got
to give those Canadian something

252
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,870
hockey. They got you. They that
you gotta let them have hockey.

253
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,630
Even though the Russians are kind
of slowly taken away from them.

254
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,490
A lot of European players,

255
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,890
the game is slowly being taken away from
their sticky served fingers up there.

256
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,680
Okay. We all understand this. All right.

257
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:55,340
And they're going to hang on for
dear fucking life. Cause if Canada,

258
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,230
God forbid ever was to lose hockey,
what would they be left with?

259
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,410
Huh?
What would they be left with

260
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,500
that shuffleboard on ice that they play?
What do they call it?

261
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,030
Do they call that? Uh, what
the fuck is it? New slide.

262
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,020
He just let that fucker go right.
That big

263
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,650
sort of a wheel, isn't it? It's a rim.

264
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,960
Kinda looks like a rim off of a jeep that
they turned into a giant hockey puck.

265
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,980
That's what it says. An obese hockey puck.
What the fuck do you call it? Curling.

266
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,580
I don't know why they call it curly.
There's no hooking.

267
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:39,570
There's nothing like that, you
know, fucking, I have no idea. Um,

268
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,750
anyways,
you have playoff baseball's coming up.

269
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:48,240
Who is going to start hockey's going to
start college and pro football's going.

270
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,530
The CFL is getting close to the Grey Cup.
All right.

271
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:56,030
I mean just what else could you want?
Okay.

272
00:16:56,031 --> 00:17:00,950
The Formula One in Moto GP, I'm going to
be wrapping up here in the next 40 days.

273
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,570
Mrs. Exciting fucking times. Let's check
out the baseball standing. Shall We?

274
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:07,490
Everybody. Who Do, we got here,

275
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,800
those Boston red sox
hanging on for dear life,

276
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,090
three games ahead of the New York,
the New York Yankees.

277
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,140
Um,
Tampa Bay devil rays,

278
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,750
soon to be Montreal Expos.

279
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,790
Spoiler alert. Um, I've been
tell you guys that story.

280
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,800
I must have told this story.

281
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,660
The time I went to the
Montreal Expos game by myself.

282
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,920
I was doing this Gig in upstate
New York and um, you know,

283
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:41,210
I was trying to go to all the fucking
stadiums. So I was like, all right, well,

284
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,790
you know, let's see this Montreal.
Yeah, they got a fucking games.

285
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,830
They had a game the next day.
So I went up, I did this kick,

286
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,890
I think I did the Lake Ontario playhouse.
I know I've told this story before,

287
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,070
but what made me,

288
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,670
I've got a few listeners maybe from
somebody from Chechnya is listening,

289
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:57,390
maybe somebody from Romania.
Um,

290
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,110
anyways,
so there was a game the next day.

291
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:05,970
So I ended up trying to cross the border
into Canada. Uh, this is pre nine 11,

292
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:08,910
by the way,
in a very weird spot by myself.

293
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,400
So I get stopped at the border and the guy
tells you, guy asked me, he's like, oh,

294
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,460
it's well, what are you doing there,
fellow Canadian dude? And I said,

295
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:22,900
I'm going to an expos game now. The Expos
had lost probably about, I don't know,

296
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:27,700
like 120 games at that point
during the season. And it goes off,

297
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,310
you're meeting some friends up there.
And I was like, nope, go on by myself.

298
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,940
And he was like, Oh hey Paul,

299
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,010
would you mind are pulling
over right there for a second.

300
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,040
So he asked me pull over and like two
more of these fucking guys come out and

301
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,230
they start ripping apart my car and
they send me inside and I'm like,

302
00:18:47,231 --> 00:18:49,570
what the Pfizer,
some sort of random drug search.

303
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,960
And I'm just sitting there watching
them and they're ripping it apart and

304
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:57,820
ripping her apart. And then if fun
suddenly fucking dawns on me like,

305
00:18:57,821 --> 00:19:01,700
what kind of a fucking loser? I
mean, I was like two hours away.

306
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:04,910
I was gonna drive two hours out of my
way to go up there to go to a Montreal

307
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,970
expos game by myself.
This guy could not fathom

308
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,640
than any human being.

309
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,230
Even one that looked like me would have
that much of a pathetic moment in their

310
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:19,640
life. He was convinced I was some
sort of drug mule or whatever.

311
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,520
I guess drug mules was that
when you have it up your ass,

312
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,060
but they never checked my ass.
They just checked the fucking car.

313
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,080
So it suddenly dawned on me that they
thought there was no way that I was that

314
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:36,290
pathetic. But I knew the real
answer was yes, I was that pathetic.

315
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,310
So it just struck me as funny and I
started laughing and I couldn't stop.

316
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:44,510
And I remember the cop looking over at
me and he saw me laughing and I think he

317
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,860
thought I was laughing. Like he
couldn't find the drugs, so they,

318
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,950
they were out there for
like a fucking half hour.

319
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,580
And then once I knew that
they thought I had drugs,

320
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,110
then I was just kind
of acting like a dick.

321
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,600
And I had a shitty and grin on
my face as I came walking up,

322
00:19:56,601 --> 00:20:00,860
smiling and they will, the guy was
getting mad, like I was smiling,

323
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:05,220
like he didn't find it or whatever.
And uh,

324
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,071
then I went up there,

325
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,970
I went up there and this fucking
French [inaudible] acted like he didn't

326
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:12,180
understand what I said when I asked him
to take my picture because I didn't have

327
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:14,190
anybody to take my picture
because I was by myself.

328
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,550
And one of those disposable cameras,
it just,

329
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,430
the story just keeps getting worse
and worse. Um, when I called him,

330
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:24,510
a conti laughed and walked
away. Um, so anyways,

331
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:26,280
I was sitting out in
like fucking left field

332
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,400
and uh,

333
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,720
it was such an old stadium. I
don't know when, just under budget,

334
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,370
I think it's socialism up there,
you know,

335
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:38,910
and they just don't step on the
poor the way we do up here. Um,

336
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,990
out in the outfield. Your seat only had
one arm rest. That's what I remember.

337
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,120
Even on the left or on the right,
I can't remember what,

338
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,040
and I was sitting out there and
all the fans not paying attention

339
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,300
to the game, the fans that
showed up and they would just
sing in Ole, Ole, Ole, Ole,

340
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:55,150
that soccer fucking song. And
I was watching, I swear to God,

341
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:56,620
I saw this guy and I'm like,

342
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,770
I watched this guy steal home plate
and I'm way out in left field.

343
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,800
So I jumped up and I was like,
yeah,

344
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:05,860
when he stole home plate and nobody
else jumped up with me and it was really

345
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:10,630
quiet in the stadium. So
then I was like, oh fuck.

346
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:15,570
Maybe that was something else.
Maybe, I don't know. Maybe
he's a pass ball. Maybe a,

347
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,410
it was a Bach.
I didn't know what,

348
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,980
so I fucking sat back down and felt
stupid cause everyone's looking at me.

349
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,290
And then later on that night I was back
at the fucking hotel and I was watching

350
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,290
TSN. That's their ESPN up there.
And they're like, they're like, oh,

351
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,680
it's something you don't see everyday.

352
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,640
And they showed a guy stealing home
plate and I was like, you know,

353
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,720
that's my expo story. Not Riveting,
but not boring. All right.

354
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:45,070
Then you've got the Cleveland
Indians crushing it, crushing it.

355
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,290
One 22 winters of 22 in a row. Um, I
feel like they've won like maybe what?

356
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:54,790
Like, like 25 of their
last 30, not 27. Um,

357
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,470
they're in. And who else?
The Houston Astros. Ah,

358
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:02,140
wow. Well look who's finally
in the American league.

359
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:05,080
Finally put on your big boy pants
and you get stopped playing.

360
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,740
Hit and run and get yourself nice and
roid it up and try to hit it over the

361
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:12,130
fence. Huh? Um,

362
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,710
the Washington senators in first place,

363
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:19,711
I didn't fucking know that the
cubs looking to repeat the Dodgers.

364
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,760
I went to the dodger game last night.
They went fucking 10 to nothing. Uh,

365
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,100
had a great time.
We sat right down on the field,

366
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,160
like terrifyingly close.

367
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,770
Like I tried to make sure I watched
every God damn pitch and uh, you know,

368
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,530
I'm not boozing. So, you know,

369
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,430
that's also scary if you're booze
and you know, you're all relaxed,

370
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,000
your heads like fucking foam
rubber, you know what I mean? It's,

371
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,310
you just bounces off at one app and
whether, you know, you don't know,

372
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,970
you order another fucking
round. Right. But, um,

373
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,920
I'm stone sober sitting there, so
actually realize what the fucking happens.

374
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,650
I was staying right on it.
What a great stadium.

375
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:03,820
That is just a great stay in great
fans out there. You know what I mean?

376
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:06,220
As long as you don't wear a different
colored Jersey and you don't sit on the

377
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:10,090
bleachers, you know what I mean? As
long as you not with your kids. Um,

378
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,210
it's a great stadium. It's a great, as
long as you're rooting for the Dodgers.

379
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,150
It's a wonderful time. And I went
there, had a pretty good time.

380
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,210
I had a great time, I should say.
I meant to say I ate pretty good.

381
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,680
Eight pretty good. I got a little off my
dial diet when I was in fucking Toronto,

382
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,930
so I think my calf is healed up.

383
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,490
We're going to try to hit the elliptical
tomorrow. Hey, guess what? All freckles,

384
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,580
all freckles is playing.
Um,

385
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,200
the Monte Carlo tomorrow in Las Vegas.
Um,

386
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,461
it's going to be great.

387
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,420
Bunch of people from Memphis
for family are coming out on,

388
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,030
a bunch of writers are
going to be at the show.

389
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,100
So I'm hoping I'm going to have a
good one. I'm very to play that one.

390
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:50,180
That's the one from um,
uh, not river Phoenix.

391
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:54,920
What was the name of that fucking movie?
Ocean's 13 or 1215,

392
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,350
whatever the fuck it was called where
everybody's still all those good looking.

393
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,350
He stood out there,
right? Looking at the uh,

394
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:01,970
okay.

395
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,750
The uh, what was it though? The
phones. The phone shoot enough.

396
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,370
You guys saw them over? Yeah, that's
stick casino playing that one.

397
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:08,570
I've always wanted to play that one.

398
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,060
And we said it was the cleanest
and classiest looking one,

399
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,640
at least from the outside. You walk in
and the things they all look the same.

400
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,630
But anyway, so let's, let's get
onto the, um, it's going onto the a,

401

402
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,680
Draft Kings. Okay. And I
said, I see, what did I say?

403
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,550
Giants getting three giants getting
three on three. Ready? Alright.

404

Draft Kings football season has begun.
What are your political prisoners?

405
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:36,971

00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:41,971

00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:31,250
Black people say it means that Bob,

436

we all could wear nice,

437

guts hanging over our ball bags.

But that perfect balance

One of your balls is hanging on a little
bit more to the right than the left.

last one lastly,
but not leastly legal zoom.

465
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:22,290
Everybody.
Ya know when you run your own business,

466
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,780
you know that time equals money.
It's not just an old saying,

467
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:29,280
it's a fucking fact.

468
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,970
So why waste your valuable time dealing
with issues that legal zoom can help you

469
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:37,410
with?
Huh?

470
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,540
You may already know that over 2 million
people have used legal zoom to start

471
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:46,860
their businesses,
but legal zoom services do not end.

472
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,490
They're running a business
comes with taxes, contracts,

473
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,290
hiring employees, changing the filter
and the air conditioning system.

474
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,930
Basically a lot of fine print.

475
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:03,230
That's why legal zoom built a network
of independent attorneys licensed in all

476
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,710
50 states.

477
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:09,450
They can provide the advice you need to
get through the daily grind of running

478
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:10,320
your business.

479
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,970
And you don't have to worry about billable
hours since legal zoom is not a law

480
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:15,804
firm.

481
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,220
Instead you can count on upfront pricing
and clarity and invest your time and

482
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:25,050
money and growing your business and let
legal zoom help out with the legal stuff.

All right, there you go. There

487
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,340
you go. Um, somebody asked me
do a bent benefit today folks.

488
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,260
Well,
they

489
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,370
doe Rico, those poor bastards are
still without power or you know,

490
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:54,250
after you have to get
hit by that hurricane and
everybody's over here talking

491
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,390
about somebody taking a knee.

492
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,930
I actually think taking a knee is more
respectful than standing up, isn't it?

493
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,050
Christ the guys on his fucking knees.
Um,

494
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,600
so hopefully I'll be able to do that.

495
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Hopefully people stopped focusing on
the song and start focusing more on the

496
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:15,810
heroin epidemic. Right. I'm on my soapbox.

497
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:20,070
The fact that we're feeding cows to
other cows and cutting the beaks off of

498
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:23,880
birds that are walking around doing face
plants because their breasts are too

499
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:24,780
fucking big.

500
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:26,923
You know,

501
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,080
you can't even give him
a big to fucking land on.

502
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,520
That's like that Max at get smart episode
where they put them in the Gurney and

503
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:38,450
they strapped him in and then it was only
one of those fucking rotary doors and

504
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,610
they stood him up.
You haven't seen that one.

505
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:44,690
They push them through and
he does the fucking face
plant. Oh, that bit killed me.

506
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,250
I loved it back in the day.
Can you tell them a huge meat TV fan?

507
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,680
I've been taping the twilight zones over
there and not only is the twilight zone

508
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,620
great. What's awesome about it
is afterwards I then get to do,

509
00:30:57,621 --> 00:31:02,621
my favorite thing is Google to see
how much of the cast is dead and I was

510
00:31:02,631 --> 00:31:03,261
surprised.

511
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:08,261
I watched the one that was the bewitched
pool and the both of the little kids is

512
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:12,680
still alive. They're in their
sixties the mother is still alive,

513
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,220
still alive and kicking like 89 years old.
However,

514
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:21,200
the dad fucking dropped like less than
10 years later in the early seventies had

515
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:25,070
a heart attack. You know what I mean?
That was a big thing back in the day,

516
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:30,071
guys died of heart attacks in women
died of accidental overdose overdoses.

517
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:33,500
You know, cause anytime they
got air quote hysterical,

518
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:36,470
they would give them black beauties
and all the guys get a Holly itself,

519
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,550
you know, they'd get slapped around and
the doctor's office and then you know,

520
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,960
to make sure the swelling went down,

521
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:44,960
they would give him these relaxing fires
for their cheeks in their, in their,

522
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:47,450
in the rest of their body. If something
like that, and I forget how it goes,

523
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,583
but that's what I do.

524
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,120
Like I watch Hawaii five o just about
every night and the other night they had

525
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:58,890
this episode called to hell with
Babe Ruth. And that was a big rumor,

526
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,980
right? That back in the day.
Back in the day when I was young,

527
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:04,710
I'm not acute anymore. They used to, um,

528
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,670
hello,

529
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,150
but come on in.
Turn the KNOB.

530
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,550
Oh, I thought you were coming
in. So back in the day.

531
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:24,340
Um, oh, it's the lovely Nia. Hi.

532
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,830
Hi. Hi everybody. I can't stay though.

533
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,610

534
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,300
Why'd you come in that dinner?
Oh yeah.

535
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:39,740

536
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,790

Middle Eastern food, like lamb and rice,

537
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,170
that sort of thing.
Lamin right. All right.

538
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Well in that I already ate for the
evening and another to bully salad with

539
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:54,764
chicken.

540
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:59,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Diane is
fascinating. So I'm gonna go order dinner.

541
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,590
Hi. I've, I haven't seen you in so long.

542
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,960
We were supposed to have
a date night tonight.

543
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,720
Yeah. And you blew me off. Not that blew
me off. I didn't blow you off. I just,

544
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,810
Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa. All right.

545
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:18,300
To hell with Babe Ruth. Okay. This
is a ledge allegedly. This my time.

546
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,280
Is it over officially done?
Yes. Okay. You're being
dismissed. You know what, Nia,

547
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,350
you're fired.
No Am I,

548
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,870
I'm at the end of the podcast here and
I was telling them about that to hell

549
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:28,710
with Babe Ruth thing.

550
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,040
Remember the Hawaii five o I was showing
you when they had the white guy playing

551
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:35,760
the Japanese guy with an but
then the lady, he was with boost.

552
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,850
I don't know if she was Japanese,
but she was definitely Asian. Yes.

553
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,540
And so she's got to sit there and look
at him with this fucking white guy,

554
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,990
stupid thing. And then they put
this awful makeup around his eyes.

555
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,430
This is 50 years ago.

556
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,733
Yep.

557
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,270
There you go. I don't know what to say
about it. I'm just bringing it up. Yeah,

558
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,730
that was terrible. It was. It was half a
century ago. Come on the podcast again.

559
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,030
Okay. No. [inaudible] dokey.

560
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,510
So anyways,
um,

561
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,283
okay.

562
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,870
Allegedly during the, uh, World War II,

563
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,540
when the Japanese soldiers
would do Abunzi charge,

564
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,560
which is fucking a suicidal
charge, I guess, or whatever.

565
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,580
Like Japan was not fucking around.
There was no quitting.

566
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,980
Okay. There was no, everybody
gets a ribbon. All right?

567
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,440
They would just,
if you fucking,

568
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,700
there was no surrendering
to your fucking enemy.

569
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,870
So during those Buns, I charges allegedly,
I don't know if this is propaganda,

570
00:34:36,871 --> 00:34:41,250
they would yell either to how with Babe
Ruth or Fuck Babe Ruth is what they

571
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:43,020
would yell.
Right?

572
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:48,060
So Babe Ruth got wind of it and
there's a quote in the New York Times,

573
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:51,960
I got to get this right. I don't
want to misquote the sultan of Swat.

574
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,570
The only man who ever had a ballpark
built around his fucking abilities. Um,

575
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,470
let me see if I can find this. Uh,
you can't. I can't find it. Um,

576
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:05,460
he basically said, he goes, any
JAP that says that I hope they,

577
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,460
I hope he gets shot.
He goes,

578
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,650
and while we're at it goes to hell with
all the Japs that was written in the New

579
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,483
York Times.

580
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,413
You know,

581
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:22,490
you could never do that in 1969 by the
time that episode of Hawaii five o came

582
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:22,641
out.

583
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:27,110
But what you could do was have a white
guy with the worst makeup ever around.

584
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:29,510
I'm going to fucking,
I'm going to post the picture.

585
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,490
I've got a post a picture I was, I don't
know if I'm going to do what either.

586
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:38,220
I just want to make sure I just got
a picture of John Daly in a fucking,

587
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,790
in his sweatpants.
Fucking

588
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,610
make a chocolate shake from himself in
a glass that had the Arkansas razorback

589
00:35:47,611 --> 00:35:50,490
thing on it.
Is there anything about John Daly?

590
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:54,870
That is an awesome anything.
Um,

591
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,640
so anyways,
I was watching this episode and this guy,

592
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:03,420
I'm watching the whole time going, that
guy is not Japanese. What the fuck?

593
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,130
I was looking, there's something
wrong with his eyes or whatever.

594
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:08,220
And I finally looked up the actor.
I don't know what he was,

595
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:10,440
he was first generation something
around that. But it was not you.

596
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,650
You should just see these, see his face.
His whole face is fucker white features.

597
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,410
And then he had this, like he was
sort of squinting his eyes though.

598
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,070
I was just was horrific. Felt
bad for the lady across from, I

599
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,910
can't imagine what she said when
she came home and just be like,

600
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,110
he didn't even look good.

601
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,010
So anyways,
I guess what I'm saying,

602
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,860
it's about time we make a
world war two movie. You know,

603
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,520
we actually have Japanese
people play Japanese soldiers.
Can we at least do that?

604
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,570
Has it been done? I don't
know. I watch sports. Okay.

605
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,080
And there is no fact checking
whatsoever when it comes to a,

606
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,520
when it comes to his pockets.
Guys,

607
00:36:51,521 --> 00:36:56,290
I ordered the greatest
fucking motherfucking cock
sucking fucking whiskey glass

608
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,020
you will ever own in your fucking life.

609
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,130
And it's so awesome that I know when
you see it, you're going to want it.

610
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,970
All right?
This guy's got a small operation,

611
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:10,720
so I'm not going to tell you who it is
until I ordered some more and get my

612
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:11,554
order in.

613
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,850
And then I'm going to let you
know on Monday, Monday, Monday.

614
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,850
I can't be that much of a cunt.
This is a great gift.

615
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:23,750
If you have a fucking person who loves,
hang on a second. Who loves to drink with?

616
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:29,170
All right?
And the holidays are coming up,

617
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,620
please guys.
Name on fuck.

618
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,280
Hang on a second. God dammit.
I gotta give you the name.

619
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,050
These are the greatest
fucking whiskey glasses ever.

620
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,470
There's this guy, he, uh, is
this, does this sound right?

621
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,160
This sounds kind of perverted.
He blows his own glass,

622
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:56,070
was a bad time to pause in that. He
blows his own. Three, two, one glass.

623
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,680
Um,
Nate Cotterman,

624
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,120
n a t e c o t t e r m a n Nate

625
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,920
cotterman.com, um, can make
you all kinds of things.

626
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,710
I actually fucked up my order.
I called the number up and he,

627
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,650
the guy just picked up, he's like, hello?
I'm like, ah. Yeah. As night there, he's,

628
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:19,320
I guess night. I'm like, yeah,
dude. I ordered the Riaa.

629
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,840
Put an order for eight glasses.
I ordered the wrong ones.

630
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,690
I wanted the ones with the square Cuban.
He goes, hey, I saw that. All right,

631
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:28,380
I'll take care of that.
How'd you hear about us?

632
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:31,050
I was just looking at wicked whiskey
glasses is what the guy does. All right,

633
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,610
for all you guys out there and you
drink the top shelf booze, all right,

634
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,410
you're a self made man or you were
born into it. Give a fuck. Right?

635
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,150
You got you a woman in line?
No. Um, and you've got,

636
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,610
you've got a top shelf bottle of
booze and you respect the booze.

637
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:52,230
You respect the artists,

638
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:57,330
artists who fucking whatever the fuck did
whatever he did to make it as mute and

639
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,160
his in his,
in his tasty God,

640
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:04,880
this is gonna make me go right off the
wagon and it's tasty as it is in and you

641
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,240
what you want to Colt, you know, so
there's all these different things.

642
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,640
There's these giant ice cubes you can
put in there, these big square ones,

643
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:17,560
but eventually towards the
end, you know, that's the,

644
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:19,610
the water's going to start
leaking into the booze.

645
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:23,600
You gave me talking tap water
here. Okay. Like beavers,

646
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:27,650
shitness stuff is mixing in with you.
God Damn Booze. You can't have that.

647
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,250
The, the aroma of duck feet
is, is, is coming in d two,

648
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,660
your pristine firewater here.
Right?

649
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,250
So then they also have, they
got these metal cubes or
whatever, but then you know,

650
00:39:40,251 --> 00:39:42,900
no matter what, there's going to be
some sort of metallic, maybe blah, blah,

651
00:39:42,901 --> 00:39:47,630
blah blah, blah. This
guy, Nate, all hail Nate.

652
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:53,650
He makes a whiskey glass and then he makes
a a square glass fucking ice cube and

653
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,900
marries that to the Gla.
It becomes part of the glass.

654
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,810
Then you take the whole fucking glass,
you stick it in the fridge,

655
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,660
the freezer or whatever, and
then everything's called. Okay.

656
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:09,350
And then you pour it in there.
Okay. The Bose has nowhere to hide.

657
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,070
It's surrounded on all
sides by nice chilled,

658
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,240
frigid glass.
But none of it leaks into the booze.

659
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,720
So you can drink it neat
and have an ice cold.

660
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,630
You can have your fucking cake
and eat it with these glasses.

661
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,070
I cannot say enough about them.

662
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,360
I absolutely love these fucking glasses
and I haven't even used them yet.

663
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:32,230
They got a little weight to them too. So
if you, if you limp wristed or you know,

664
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,850
if you're, you know, I
don't know if you, you know,

665
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,200
back in the day you got an old
roller blading injury and you've,

666
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:41,180
your pro both your risks. These
might not be for you. Okay.

667
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,680
But I fucking love these
glasses that you and, and,

668
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:48,200
and the coolest shit they caught him
in with the c. All right. That's it.

669
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,020
Enjoy the music.
And uh,

670
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,690
we've got another half hour shit
coming up from a Thursday afternoon,

671
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,610
just before Monday morning podcasts
and a Thursday gone by, you know,

672
00:40:58,611 --> 00:41:01,370
possibly early this year.
Maybe it was from a three years ago.

673
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,770
I don't fucking know. I don't pick
them. All right. Have a great weekend.

674
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,150
You can cuts. I'll see you
in Vegas. And uh, that's it,

675
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,860
right?
Yeah.

676
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,773
[inaudible]

677
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,850
oh, you know what, I didn't
even get to that fucking,

678
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:03,380
you see that report or that died.

679
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,360
Let me get to where the
hell is that story here.

680
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,910
This writer for rolling stone,

681
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,940
which I have a subscription to one of the
magazine's few magazines that actually

682
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:19,810
read every episode,
every installment.

683
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,900
Um, Michael Hastings, uh,

684
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:30,480
he had a horrible death. He fucking was
going down, I believe it was Highland,

685
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:35,130
just south of Melrose is Mercedes
was traveling at ridiculous speeds.

686
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,360
He hit a fucking tree and the whole thing,
we exploded,

687
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,740
bursts into flame and they had to
identify him by his dental records and uh,

688
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:45,130
allegedly this guy knew,

689
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,500
I guess he wrote some fucking article
in rolling stone where he was over in

690
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:54,880
Afghanistan talking to some higher ups
in the military and they was saying some

691
00:42:54,881 --> 00:42:59,260
shit that they thought was off the record
and he put it all in the article and

692
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:04,261
there's people conspiracy there is
trying to say that his car was cyber

693
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:08,410
attacked.
Now I'm not even gonna get into that,

694
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:13,610
but toot how fucked up is the world
getting if like that's actually something

695
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:20,170
that somebody could do. I'm not saying
whether it was done by this guy or not.

696
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,400
I have no fucking idea. He might've
been hammered. I have no idea.

697
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,530
I have no fucking clue.
I don't know anything about it,

698
00:43:26,531 --> 00:43:28,560
but I'm just saying that the fact,

699
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,300
okay that somebody can hack into your
computer and cause your car to speed up

700
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,970
and there's nothing,
you can't shut the car off.

701
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,960
This is why I don't know that.
I don't believe that.

702
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:47,470
It's just like his evil is that
is we got to eliminate this guy.

703
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:51,400
Isn't there a zillion other ways
to kill them without doing that?

704
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,520
Like what if he slammed into like a
fucking minivan with the [inaudible],

705
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,870
you know, a married couple in
their three, four kids, you know,

706
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:07,070
it's gotta be, you know, can't they
just spray some mist on him? You know,

707
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,820
just walk up to them in a mall like hi
sir, would you like to try this fragrance?

708
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:14,610
You just spray it on him. And
then the guy like, you know,

709
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:18,540
10 minutes later we just trying on
some slacks, he just keels over.

710
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:22,080
You can't just do it that way.
But anyways, is this true?

711
00:44:22,081 --> 00:44:25,350
Is can they actually do that shit?
And this makes me feel glad that you know,

712
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:29,780
half my time out here, I drive
around in a classic car, you know,

713
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,130
because not like I'm any sort of a
threat. But what I'm saying is if that,

714
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:38,390
if I just would think if you
had the ability to do that,

715
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:43,370
some fucking nerds would just do it
just to do it. Cause it would be funny,

716
00:44:43,371 --> 00:44:46,610
just speed you up for a second and
slow you down just to freak you out.

717
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:48,963
You know,

718
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:53,290
like do you remember back in the day
when this is like pre Internet fun?

719
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,230
What you would do is you'd take
your garage door opener, right?

720
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,220
And you would drive around
the neighborhood and he'd
pointed at every garage

721
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:04,710
until you found somebody
that had the same one as you.

722
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,880
And back in the day they just had
a, like, it wasn't sophisticated.

723
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:13,050
So not only yours open, not only
yours, it opened the other ones too.

724
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,630
So you'd,

725
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:21,610
you'd eventually find somebody that had
the same garage door brand is you when

726
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:23,820
you could open and close their garage.

727
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,140
So at least you could my fucking
neighborhood. So you just find,

728
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:33,020
you use drive one person nuts.
You just drive by and you just fuck it.

729
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:36,560
And every once in a while we just open
it and I don't know why we would do it.

730
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:41,390
We were assholes. But so using
that, if you could fucking do that,

731
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:46,560
um, with cars wouldn't, wouldn't

732
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,470
like these people like,
you know,

733
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,530
hack in to steal like credit
card numbers and shit. I mean,

734
00:45:52,531 --> 00:45:56,370
wouldn't that be somebody just doing
that just to do it like you're bored.

735
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,740
It was just the,
was this the dumbest part of the podcast?

736
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:06,741
Everybody did I stick the landing starting
off with ignorance and then a why,

737
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,530
why wouldn't they? Well, we'll
fuck you know what the reality,

738
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:12,450
if I ever book a commercial,
I'm going to be,

739
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:15,810
you know that commercial where the adult
sits there with all the kids and they

740
00:46:15,811 --> 00:46:16,740
go, you know, what would you,

741
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,410
what would you do if you had
a zillion dollars and it,

742
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:23,070
the kids that I could buy an
island made out of candy. Yeah,

743
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:27,500
we could have hot fudge waterfalls and
shit. I would be sitting there right with,

744
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,950
except it wouldn't be like
the basketball one way.

745
00:46:29,951 --> 00:46:32,640
They were like making fun of
the fact like I would be like,

746
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,930
you don't have to say I'm saying I'm okay

747
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,273
buddy.

748
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,773
[inaudible]

749
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,940
I'm all right for the birds. Hey
Belk, I've got these two parakeets.

750
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,440
My problem is that these
little dudes don't like me.

751
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,530
Uh, I've tried whistling
petting them. I don't know.

752
00:47:33,531 --> 00:47:36,620
You can pet a bird and
squirting them with water.

753
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,140
Um, do they like water? I'm
guessing that that's a good thing.

754
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:43,140
Parakeets like water.
I don't know.

755
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,270
Why don't we ask the fucking Jimmy's
guy to write a fucking nine pages on it?

756
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,750
I love all I'm upset with that guy
because he actually did the research as

757
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:54,010
opposed to me who were like, oh yeah,
I overheard this in a bar. So anyways,

758
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:57,910
this guy's petting his birds.
He's fucking, he getting
them with the water hose.

759
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:01,480
He's whistling Adam.
Whoo.

760
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,810
I'm all to no avail.
I know there are only birds,

761
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:11,410
but I feel they hold a deep resentment
towards me where yet clip their wings and

762
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:14,530
you stuck them in a cage. How would you
feel somebody cut your fucking nuts off,

763
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,750
came by, started whistling at
you and throwing water at you.

764
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,713
You know,

765
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,440
I got an idea. Why don't you leave
him alone? She opened the cage,

766
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,403
right?

767
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,940
Why don't you take him to one of those
car Dashi and doctors and I get a little

768
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:30,250
botox in their fucking
wings and let them fly away.

769
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,480
When that'd be annoying to
you if you are in a cage,

770
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:39,540
your arm's cut off at the fucking elbows
and somebody came up and rather than

771
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,230
whistle and they started speaking English
or you speak in English at you. Um,

772
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,050
he goes, I think it's because I
yelled at them. Oh, here we go.

773
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,440
Because I think they respect
me because I yelled at them.

774
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:51,980
Yeah.

775
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,570
What did you, what, what,
what were they doing?

776
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:55,600
Okay.

777
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,720
Uh, I said no with one
during my shoves. Uh,

778
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,050
basically I had to scold them
for pooping in their water dish,

779
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:07,390
but I had their best interests in mind.
Two.

780
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:11,650
Do you understand how fucking insane you
are that you feel like you can talk to

781
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:14,800
a bird?
You know,

782
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:17,470
why don't you like not
stick the water dish,

783
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,433
you know,

784
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:24,190
underwear that was underneath the swing
or what I would do is I just get a

785
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:26,650
bigger cage.
I'd get a bigger fucking cage.

786
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,760
I put the water in the center that
isn't near any of those trapeze bars and

787
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:33,670
hopefully they won't be at the top of
the cage and still shit down on it.

788
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:39,330
Or I would accept the fact that
it's a burden to cage and that it's,

789
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:44,000
you know, basically anything
at the bottom of the cage,

790
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,390
miners will be the city address.

791
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,833
Right.

792
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,930
I would just take that as part of it. I
wouldn't yell at the birds. But anyways,

793
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,320
this guy, he had to scold them
for pooping in their water,

794
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:58,520
but I had their best interest in mind.
I heard if they drink contaminated water,

795
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:01,940
it can cause a disease that makes
all their feathers fall off.

796
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,830
While you could also read up on it,

797
00:50:03,831 --> 00:50:06,920
as opposed to me who just repeats
shits that they, here he goes,

798
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,390
I do a lot for those little guys.

799
00:50:08,391 --> 00:50:13,010
But putting jackets on nude parakeets
isn't one of them. Even if I wanted to,

800
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:17,420
I couldn't, they don't even let me
pet them, let alone dress them. Dude,

801
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:21,890
you're not a bird guy. You should
have got a dog. Uh, he goes,

802
00:50:21,891 --> 00:50:23,120
when I originally bought them,

803
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:25,670
I imagine I would have one pair
of keyed on each shoulder. Why?

804
00:50:25,671 --> 00:50:28,850
Hanging out around my house.
But whenever I approached the cage,

805
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:32,510
they freeze in horror.
Every time they do that,

806
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:35,840
I can't help but remember my brother's
face when he fell through the ice,

807
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:39,770
we had to pull him out. I thought maybe
if I bought them more toys, they would,

808
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,920
that would somehow help. Two
birds. Motivation isn't more toys.

809
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,170
Their motivation is
you not have an energy.

810
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:52,090
Like I'm gonna fucking twist you head off
to their wings are clipped so they can

811
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:56,110
escape. You got them stuck in a cage.
They're terrified and you yelled at him.

812
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,980
I would say more than on one occasion,
you yelled at them.

813
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,580
All right?
Um,

814
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,410
you need to fucking relax.

815
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,653
All right,

816
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:10,950
listen to this.
Would you,

817
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:13,950
would you want to be like your
job to be in a cage all day?

818
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,733
You know,

819
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,720
and then some,
you know,

820
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:19,810
I dunno.

821
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:24,520
Some giant comes home and puts you on
his fucking shoulders and your whole job

822
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:26,380
is to enhance the giants fucking life.

823
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,480
You don't even have a little bit
of empathy for the fucking birds.

824
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:33,640
What I would do is I would just have a
totally relaxed energy and hope that they

825
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:38,110
forget that you're screamed at them,
treat them nicely.

826
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,930
Don't try to pet him. Just don't fuck
with them. Every time you come over,

827
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,530
they'll graduate and be like, Oh, this is
the guy who feeds us. Scale brings water.

828
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,050
This guys on our side,
you know,

829
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,390
as opposed to the mixed
messages that you send them.

830
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:51,960
MMM.

831
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,210
Yeah.
Birch don't give a fuck about toys.

832
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:56,643
Yeah.

833
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,750
Do they? I don't think
they do. Uh, he said,

834
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:02,690
I bought them a new toy every Friday
on my way home from work and it's a

835
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:05,000
ridiculous amount of toys in the cage.
And here's the kicker.

836
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:08,120
They haven't played with this
single one. Not once. Well Do,

837
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:12,430
do you look at the birds outside?
They're, they're not out there. If you,

838
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,160
you leave your toddler's toys
outside. They don't go, oh good.

839
00:52:15,161 --> 00:52:18,040
They left and then they go down. They
start playing on his fucking tricycle.

840
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:22,320
He goes, they just stare at
me. I took him to the vet,

841
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:25,310
but he spent more time looking at
his phone than the birds. Anyways.

842
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:29,550
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Um, I think you should find a bird lover,

843
00:52:29,551 --> 00:52:31,750
sir.
And uh,

844
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:36,290
give the birds away and then, um, I dunno.

845
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,200
I think you should get your temper in
check and before and before you do that.

846
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,470
Yeah. Get your temper in check.
And then if you want to get a dog,

847
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,680
it seems like you want more
interaction with the pet.

848
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,920
Most people get birds because they can
have an interaction with an animal,

849
00:52:49,921 --> 00:52:53,520
but they don't have to walk it
down the street and it's very,

850
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,800
a lot less interaction with them.

851
00:52:55,801 --> 00:53:00,801
You seem like you want a bird to
act like a dog slash a little kid.

852
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,400
Like, Hey, daddy's home. I
bought you a fire engine. Oh boy.

853
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:09,000
Look at that is the bell work. You know,
somehow you want the bird to do that.

854
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,413
MMM.

855
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:16,020
Yeah. Please stop yelling
at your birds. All right.

856
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,590
They can help with they shit in the water.
You know the birds,

857
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:25,260
they're not supposed to be in cages.
They fly around and they shit as they fly.

858
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,160
They shit when they're on branches,
when they have to go, they go,

859
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,290
they don't have any stress,

860
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,340
they don't have any shame and
there's water all over the place.

861
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,360
So now you've got them in this fucking
cage with little confined area water.

862
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,370
You know, what are, what are they
supposed to do? Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

863
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,330
What do I know about the restaurant?

864
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:30,463
[inaudible] [inaudible]

865
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,503
[inaudible]

866
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,020
hey,
what's going on?

867
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:51,021
It's bill bar and this is the
Monday morning podcast for a Monday,

868
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,810
September 28th, 2009. Um,

869
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,530
my voice is a little raspy
this morning cause a,

870
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:03,030
I did a lot of shows this
weekend getting ready for my, uh,

871
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,300
my next hour special that's going
to tape in December. And uh,

872
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:10,710
somebody actually sent me an
email questioning when, where,

873
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:14,490
and all that type of shit. And uh,
we're still solidifying all of that.

874
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:16,110
So the second I know,

875
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:22,070
I will let you guys know the chosen 14
listeners that I have on my podcast,

876
00:55:22,741 --> 00:55:25,440
which I know at this point
it's more than that. You know,

877
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:30,060
I've checked out some Google trends and
saw that I think I'm up to about 17.

878
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,510
I have no fucking idea how many people
listen to this and I could give a shit.

879
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:38,190
All right. That's it. I mean, I, I give
a shit. I want people to fucking listen.

880
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,670
But, um, I don't do this
thing too. Uh, I dunno.

881
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:48,570
I don't know. It's weird. I don't fucking
hype this thing really. If you find it,

882
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:53,330
you find it, you fucking
cunt. Um, all right.

883
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:57,360
So this is my deal. It's Monday
and I'm still in Addison, Texas.

884
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:02,070
Why do you ask why bill? I
thought Monday was the day, uh,

885
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:07,060
you went back to Hollywood and tried to
pursue your dreams of getting into a,

886
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,740
uh, a fucking movie here
or there. Well, I'm,

887
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:15,570
I'm hanging around one more day cause I'm
going to the cowboys game tonight on a

888
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,020
Monday night football cowboys playing the,
uh,

889
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,770
the fuck are they playing the Carolina
Panthers? I'm kind of out of sorts.

890
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:23,430
And you know,

891
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:26,110
you're not getting this podcast and
where you'll listen to and it right now,

892
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:27,580
and it's Tuesday morning.

893
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:31,870
And I'll tell you why he didn't fucking
get it is because he's fucking assholes

894
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:37,690
at the hotel, a rape and me
on the Internet. And you know,

895
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:40,960
I feel about corporations.
I don't fucking like them.

896
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,700
This is what these fucking assholes do,
right? You sign up for the Internet.

897
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:49,930
It's 13 bucks a day at this fucking
hotel, right? 13 bucks a day.

898
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,240
That's already ridiculous. All
right? But I'm on the road,

899
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:58,690
you know, whatever, I'm making some
money here. I'm doing all right.

900
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:03,490
And I need to fuck, I need the internet.
I lost my fucking blackberry. So I'm like,

901
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:05,560
I fuck it.
I'll pay it.

902
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:11,050
So I sign up for this shit at about 10
o'clock at night after I had flown in

903
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:15,970
Wednesday night and the next, you know,
the next day, you know, I signed up for,

904
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,760
for, for fucking day, 24 hours, right?

905
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,740
My world a day is 24
hours. All right? So I,

906
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:29,170
um, you know, I wake up the next day, I
do the morning radio. I hide my shows.

907
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:33,010
I have a great fucking time. I come back
in the afternoon, I say, you know what?

908
00:57:33,011 --> 00:57:34,030
I think I'll go on that.

909
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,450
That their new fangled internet that
the kids are talking about, right?

910
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,150
I go to go on the Internet
and Lo and behold,

911
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:43,120
I'm not on the fucking Internet
anymore and I'm like, wait a minute.

912
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,330
Even though I went to
fucking summer school,

913
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:49,450
just about every goddamn year
in high school because of math,

914
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,330
I know how to fucking ad.
All right?

915
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,650
Is that Algebra Shit and geometry and
Algebra two and trig and all that shit.

916
00:57:56,651 --> 00:58:01,120
That fucked me up because I'm,
you know,

917
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,500
I'm not into shapes.

918
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:10,230
The second they started drawing
those triangles on the ball,

919
00:58:10,231 --> 00:58:13,750
I just didn't give a shit. It's
just like really, you know,

920
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:15,880
there's certain things in
life you just fucking, no,

921
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:19,570
you're never gonna use it right now.
I know that you know a lot of the things.

922
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:23,500
I'm probably fucking the sitting in
this room right now because of geometry.

923
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,170
Look at all his shapes. When I
look around the wind, no fuck.

924
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,830
I look out the window.
That's a rectangle.

925
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:35,560
My doors are rectangle. Where's
the fucking triangle? Well,

926
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:39,760
that's a right angle on the
doorway. Hell, there's four of them,

927
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,820
right? Is that geometry? I
don't know what the fuck it is.

928
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:49,090
Is there an Isosceles triangle over by my
phone? I don't fucking know. All right.

929
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:52,630
But I know, you know what I mean? He
just fucking know some stuff. You know,

930
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:57,070
you just going to suck at.
So whatever bill, get on Con,

931
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:01,130
we're gonna stay on fucking track here.
Right. So anyways, so basically it was,

932
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:04,420
it had been about 14 hours since I
signed up for the Internet and all of a

933
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:06,160
sudden I'm not on the
fucking Internet again.

934
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:10,150
So I go back online to figure out what's
going on. And right after you'd signed,

935
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:14,990
you sign up for 24 hours. It says in
small print in parentheses that it,

936
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,710
it expires every day at noon time.

937
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,050
So basically I didn't sign up for
24 hours. What I signed up for was,

938
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,490
yeah,
14 hours.

939
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,630
I paid $13 for 14 hours
of fucking Internet,

940
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,530
eight of which I was
sleeping. Okay. So yeah,

941
00:59:34,531 --> 00:59:35,490
they fucking raped me.

942
00:59:35,491 --> 00:59:39,480
They came up with a new little fucky
fuck charge new little, you know,

943
00:59:39,481 --> 00:59:44,010
they just sit around like these fucking
money grubbing little comments to figure

944
00:59:44,011 --> 00:59:47,440
out some little fucking way,
you know,

945
00:59:47,441 --> 00:59:49,580
that they can just somehow squeeze it.
I mean the,

946
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,480
I'm sure if I sat down and
tried to figure out the map,

947
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:57,520
the math of like when people arrive in
a hotel and when they usually check out,

948
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:02,230
like how having it expire every day at
fucking noon gets them a little bit more

949
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:06,400
money, you know, so they can make
their yachts just a little bit bigger.

950
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:12,800
So you know what it was the
usual shit. What do I do? I
call the front desk, right?

951
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:14,060
And who do I get?

952
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:18,170
Do I get the head of the corporation that
runs this Internet scam? Of course not.

953
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:23,171
I get some fucking 25 year old person
who fucking majored in transportation or

954
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:28,070
fucking, I don't know, hotel management
and now has no fucking benefits in,

955
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:32,990
is working the front desk and I'm
pissed. So I say to them, I say, hey,

956
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:37,900
that chippy, this is bill burr calling
and fucking room one zero one eight.

957
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:43,420
Niner I don't know why I
just wanted to get military,

958
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,770
their alpha red nine or

959
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:52,060
68 cross power trip, do whatever
the fuck you call it. Anyway,

960
01:00:52,061 --> 01:00:56,020
so I fucking call this guy up and I go,
look,

961
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:01,420
I just signed up for a fucking day and
now it shuts off at noon and the guy goes,

962
01:01:01,421 --> 01:01:02,970
yeah. And I, um,

963
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,550
we don't have anything to do
with that here at the hotel.

964
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,240
The Internet is a
complete separate entity.

965
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,840
So even though you're in the hotel and
you're currently having their dick firmly

966
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:21,470
in your ass, we don't have
any responsibility on that.
If you'd like to see in,

967
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:22,990
and you know how I can fucking complain,

968
01:01:22,991 --> 01:01:27,640
I have to go back on the fucking Internet
and pay another 13,000 fucking dollars

969
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,210
to complain to these assholes.
So you know what? Fuck them.

970
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,160
Okay,

971
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,640
fuck them fucking assholes. You
know what? You're dumb fucks.

972
01:01:36,641 --> 01:01:39,940
You could have got 80 bucks out of me.
I was willing to pay 13 a day,

973
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,370
even though that was a total fucking rip
off it because you little fucking conti

974
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:47,770
attitude. Now you only get 13
bucks out of me. All right.

975
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:51,880
I don't understand why they do
that. Why they just, I mean,

976
01:01:51,881 --> 01:01:56,820
do people just give into it
trying to find the name of these assholes?

977
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:02,210
What is it? I see h or something like
that. I didn't know what the fuck it is.

978
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,160
What gives a shit,
right?

979
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,980
I'm just having one of these fucking
weeks and now I don't have any questions

980
01:02:05,981 --> 01:02:07,870
because I haven't been on the
fucking internet this week,

981
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,900
so I'm just basically going
to have to wing this podcast.

982
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:15,100
But fortunately I have plenty of stories
from my wonderful stay out here in

983
01:02:15,101 --> 01:02:19,030
Addison, Texas. Um, here's one for,

984
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,730
I'm going to be on the road
for the next three weeks.

985
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:23,520
So that's obviously putting a
strain on my relationship. Okay.

986
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:26,520
So I'm thinking maybe I'll do something
nice for the fucking two days.

987
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:31,090
I'm going to be home over
the next three weeks. And uh,

988
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:35,500
I'm a big fan of the core vet.
Everybody. Do you like the core vet?

989
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,180
Are you a middle aged American man like
me who never got married and doesn't

990
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:42,890
have kids? So now for some, that's
what it ends up. That's when,

991
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,970
and that's when that car starts
appealing to you. You have to start,

992
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,550
they start thinking that
shit. You know, maybe I'll,

993
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,990
maybe I'll get myself a corvette.

994
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:53,430
Maybe I'll go hang out at an Applebee's
and start hitting on somebody who's at

995
01:02:53,431 --> 01:02:56,250
least fucking born three decades after me.

996
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,240
No, I fucking love Corvettes.
I think they're there.

997
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,790
I just loved the look of the
car. I think it's, uh, you know,

998
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:10,080
it's an American made car. I think it's
a great value. You know what I mean?

999
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:11,210
I think, you know, they've got core Becca.

1000
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,400
I was like fucking 200 miles an
hour now a grant. And I know,

1001
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:16,440
I know that one's like six figures,
but you can get a corvette.

1002
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,620
Can't you get a corvette for like
65 grand? I mean, all that and all,

1003
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:25,200
it says a shitload of
money. But, uh, you know,

1004
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:26,670
I realized halfway
through this, I, you know,

1005
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:30,200
how much a Porsche cost is it Porsche or
Porsche? I don't even know how to say.

1006
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:34,740
That's another car that I fucking love
that, uh, that, you know, I can't afford,

1007
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,311
you know,

1008
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:39,480
how much money I'd have to make a fucking
year to justify blowing basically a

1009
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:42,480
house on a car, house, money on a car,

1010
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:47,130
house money granted it in fucking
Arkansas somewhere, but still,

1011
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,190
you know what I mean? Um, so anyways,

1012
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,880
I think the way to go is rather than
fucking going out and spending all that

1013
01:03:53,881 --> 01:03:56,670
fucking money on the car,
you just go rent one for a day.

1014
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:01,050
So one day I landed in fucking Burbank
airport and I'm driving by Hertz rental

1015
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:04,800
car. What do I see? I see a fucking
yellow corvette sitting there.

1016
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:08,100
I'm not into the yellow, but it's still
a corvette. And I'm thinking, you know,

1017
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:12,390
I want to use it. Why don't I just
fucking rent one for one day? You know,

1018
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:16,380
I'll rent one for one day. What's that
going to cost? Right? 300, 400 bucks.

1019
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:20,760
That's a fuck load of money, but
it's, it's way less than 70 grand.

1020
01:04:20,761 --> 01:04:25,590
75 grand. What the fuck? Why
not rent one of those things,

1021
01:04:25,591 --> 01:04:27,660
you know,
I'll take my girl out,

1022
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:31,830
we'll go for a cruise up in
the fucking Hollywood hills,

1023
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,410
will tip it over,
will die.

1024
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:38,490
Just like that fucking dude in the 50s
who look like Fonzie, but that's not him.

1025
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,160
What is his name?
Johnny was his name.

1026
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:44,760
Johnny was in every fucking
bad boy named Johnny back then.

1027
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,570
Do you ever notice that shit?
One of my favorite things to watch,

1028
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,730
um, is old. Like those old
black and white movies,

1029
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:57,750
whenever that they're doing
movies about gangs, you know,

1030
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:01,800
and it's always a bunch of white
actors and half of them are gay,

1031
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:07,410
just flaming homosexuals and they're
trying to act tough and it's fucking

1032
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:12,120
hilarious the way they flip
up their collar and they,
they pull up their sleeves.

1033
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,840
But the fuck that I watched the other
day was one of the worst fucking movies

1034
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,690
ever saw in my life was
a Marlon Brando movie.

1035
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:22,960
That one where he's on the motorcycle
and he stops into the town.

1036
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:26,800
If you want a fucking, yeah. Do you
ever get embarrassed for someone?

1037
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:31,180
Like somebody is doing something so
douchey that you just feel yourself just

1038
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:35,650
wanting to crawl underneath the fucking
hotel bed and lay next to the dead

1039
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:37,390
hooker that you didn't
even realize was there.

1040
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,713
You know what I mean?

1041
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,880
There is a scene in that movie where
they are in this bar and these two guys

1042
01:05:45,881 --> 01:05:50,881
start talking in this street slang and
the old bartender just can't keep up with

1043
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:56,500
it and they go like, Hey Daddy.
Oh Hey, if I can't even do it,

1044
01:05:56,501 --> 01:06:00,250
it's so fiery. Even got an, I cal get
embarrassed to even trying to recreate it.

1045
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:03,880
It's fucking horrific. So, uh,

1046
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:10,390
the fuck am I talking about? Yeah. I want
to rent this God damn car, right? Some,

1047
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:13,540
I'll rent it for one day,
right? A for one day.

1048
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,090
I'm going to tell you some right now,
la during the day,

1049
01:06:16,091 --> 01:06:19,150
especially during these hotter months,
it's fucking horrible.

1050
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:21,730
It's like living in a city.

1051
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:25,330
Let's write outside of God's stove and,

1052
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:30,040
and you know, it doesn't even
make sense or trying to, you know,

1053
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:32,650
I was trying to say that the
joke I was trying to do is like,

1054
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:37,030
you have a heat up an oven.
Sure. We all have. Ah,

1055
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:41,140
at some point you tried to cook a fucking
Turkey. Oh, fucking remind me. I've got,

1056
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:44,350
I tell you about a great youtube video.
Y'All, you know what? I'm going to forget.

1057
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:48,040
Let me get back to the stove thing.
Thanksgiving's coming up, everybody.

1058
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:51,760
I now I'm all over the place.
I'm going to fucking finish Brando thing.

1059
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,850
I'm going to finish this stove thing and
I'm going to get back to the corvette

1060
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:55,151
story,

1061
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:57,730
but first I'm going to tell him gonna
I'm gonna take a little break for the

1062
01:06:57,731 --> 01:07:02,560
holidays. All right. Over here in America
for all you people overseas, Bu, Bu,

1063
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:06,510
Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, um, I was
supposed to be ladies and gentlemen,

1064
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:09,580
all the ships at sea. Um, we have,

1065
01:07:09,581 --> 01:07:13,450
we have a holiday over here called
Thanksgiving where we give thanks for the

1066
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:15,060
fact that our founding fathers,
uh,

1067
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:18,520
committed genocide and gave us
all this beautiful land out here.

1068
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,900
Fuck you.
That's how the world works.

1069
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,490
You knew we will come and you
saw our cutlasses, you know,

1070
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:32,140
that's how the world works. Smash Mouth
Football, the black and blue division.

1071
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:36,640
That's how it fucking works.
The Norris. Um, no it isn't.

1072
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:41,620
I don't advocate that shit.
But you know what, what, what
it happened. But you know,

1073
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:46,750
they've got their casinos. We named
a couple of golf courses after him.

1074
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:48,760
You ever noticed that shit?
That's what I like about white people.

1075
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:52,750
We fucking slaughter people. Then we
named Shit after him. Once we feel bad.

1076
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:58,120
Oh, we'll call this a WAMPA tuck.

1077
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:04,570
This is the one Pathak grocery store
and this is the last in the mall.

1078
01:08:04,571 --> 01:08:09,150
He can call the SAC. Um,
anyways, Jesus Christ. Bill. Yes.

1079
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:11,530
So I saw this youtube video
Thanksgiving's coming up or right.

1080
01:08:11,531 --> 01:08:14,870
And one of the big things is a man is
you have to know how to carve a goddamn

1081
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,040
Turkey.
Okay.

1082
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:19,430
And as much as all you fucking guys out
there want to act like you know how to

1083
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:21,290
carve a Turkey most see a fucking don't.

1084
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:23,870
But you're too afraid to ask because
you're worried that someone's going to

1085
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:27,950
question your sexuality because that's
what it's like to be a man. Basically.

1086
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:32,780
If you don't just somehow
know shit without ever having
any explained it to you,

1087
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:37,440
that evidently means that you, you, you
want to have sex with another man. That's,

1088
01:08:37,441 --> 01:08:40,670
that's the laws that I learned
growing up. Um, so anyways,

1089
01:08:40,671 --> 01:08:44,330
there is a fucking youtube video out
there that of course I can't check because

1090
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:49,040
he's concert charging me $13 every
fucking an expires every noon.

1091
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:52,730
But there just go on,
go on to Youtube, right?

1092
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:57,350
And just Google how to carve a Turkey.
There is a fucking dude on there, man.

1093
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:00,170
I'm telling you, you, it's,

1094
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:05,420
it's unbelievable the way he takes
his bird apart. It's masterful.

1095
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:09,410
Okay. And don't make the mistake I made
last year because I carved the thing up

1096
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:12,410
perfectly, but the problem was my
knives, we're a little bit dull.

1097
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:16,910
Go get your knives professionally
sharpened this month. Okay.

1098
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:21,050
And Jesse eat spaghetti until Thanksgiving
so you don't fuck them up because I

1099
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:23,960
swear to God, I've tried with that
little sharpener that you get.

1100
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:26,470
A lot of people just
take out that sharpener,

1101
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:30,260
that a little knife thing and they
just go week, week, week and there's a,

1102
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,850
you have to fucking hold the thing and
as a at a certain angle and you can

1103
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:38,000
actually be making the thing dollar if
you don't know what the fuck you're doing.

1104
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,860
Trust me cause I did it.

1105
01:09:39,861 --> 01:09:42,800
You know I watched a couple of the
three stooges things and I saw them,

1106
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,490
I saw curly look, hey look,
I can't even fucking do it.

1107
01:09:46,491 --> 01:09:50,180
My fucking voice was so trashed.
Anyways,

1108
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,880
there's this killer youtube video man.

1109
01:09:52,881 --> 01:09:56,690
And it's like literally when this
guy is done with the thing you got,

1110
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:59,870
you got the drumsticks,
the wings in the dark meat,

1111
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,220
everything's lined up like that.

1112
01:10:01,221 --> 01:10:04,250
And then you've got all the white meat
with just a little bit of skin on top of

1113
01:10:04,251 --> 01:10:04,610
it,

1114
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:09,260
lined up like a fucking deck of cards
and you come out with your serving tray.

1115
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,990
I mean, if people faint,
it looked so good,

1116
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,480
that fucking carcass is just,
it's a macula. All right,

1117
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:20,090
so definitely check that shit out.
If you're going to make a Turkey,

1118
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:23,330
and if you one of those people too,
who wants to deep fry a fucking Turkey,

1119
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:27,560
make sure you put the Turkey
in the deep fryer first. Okay.

1120
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,710
And then fill it up with water so you
know how much fucking grease to put in

1121
01:10:30,711 --> 01:10:31,544
there.

1122
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:34,610
Evidently that's what people do is they
fill it all the way up to the top and

1123
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:38,150
then they dropped the bird in there
and then it overflows. Catches flame,

1124
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,490
lights their deck on fire and
they burn down their house.

1125
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:45,410
And that's not thanksgiving.
That's not even Halloween.
Anyways, let me get better.

1126
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,390
And what if I got to back up here?
So anyways,

1127
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,900
this fucking podcast is a mess.
Um, to fuck that God's oven,

1128
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:56,720
this is what I'm talking about. You have
a heat up, a fucking oven, you know,

1129
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:58,670
and then you're checking
on whatever you're cooking.

1130
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,700
And rather than opening it
and letting the heat come out,

1131
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,560
and then looking down with your face,

1132
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:07,340
you opened the door with your face right
there and you get that fucking heat

1133
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:12,020
furnace blast. That's what summer
is like in La in July and August.

1134
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:16,440
But I'm a tell you at night, it's
absolutely gorgeous. I'm telling you,

1135
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:19,860
you should do it at some point. You ever
come out to la? Fuck the Hollywood sign.

1136
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:21,930
Fuck going on sunset.
Fuck all of that.

1137
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:25,320
Go up on Mulholland drive
and drive through the hills
late at night and look at

1138
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:27,630
the valley and I, it looks like
Christmas, man. It's amazing.

1139
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:29,130
So that's what I wanted to do.

1140
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:33,240
I was going to get this fucking car
cruise around up there and uh, you know,

1141
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:38,100
have a couple of drinks, wrap it
around a tree, runaway from the scene,

1142
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:43,200
blame it on a minority. You
know, I'm fucking with you. Um,

1143
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,570
you know, I was kind of, have a good
fucking time. It's what I wanted to do.

1144
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,410
So I call these fucking
assholes up at Hertz.

1145
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:57,300
I call him up cause I wanna rent this
car that's going to cost me 350 bucks.

1146
01:11:57,301 --> 01:12:00,840
I'm going to throw a fucking iPod
right in the trash for one fucking day.

1147
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:04,090
A fucking taken some s turns
up there in the hills, right?

1148
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,190
So I call him up and I say, yeah, listen,

1149
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:12,840
I want to rent that corvette you got at
the Burbank airport. And they go, ah, oh,

1150
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:17,720
first of all, I had to fucking get
through their stupid, uh, they're stupid,

1151
01:12:17,721 --> 01:12:21,290
a whatever, the, the, the,
the computer thing. And you
know, of course they have this,

1152
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:24,290
this automated voice and you can
tell the person to do the voice over.

1153
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:28,130
They told her, just smile. When she did
it, it says, this is the tone. She goes,

1154
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:31,460
thank you for calling Hertz rental car.

1155
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:35,920
You can actually get a better deal
if you go to here. It's dead king.

1156
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:39,740
He this big stupid fucking grin on
her face. And it wasn't bugging me.

1157
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,860
I actually enjoyed it the first
time through because I'm like,

1158
01:12:42,861 --> 01:12:46,880
I'm going to get a corvette for one
fucking day. I'm going to live the dream.

1159
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,830
I'm going to live the fucking dream.

1160
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:53,310
I'm going to live the American fucking
dream before they collapsed the dollar

1161
01:12:53,311 --> 01:12:57,780
and combine this with fucking Canada
and Mexico and put a microchip in the

1162
01:12:57,781 --> 01:12:59,760
middle of our fucking forehead.
I'm going to do it.

1163
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:03,770
I'm going to get this God damn
corvette, right? So you know,

1164
01:13:03,771 --> 01:13:07,670
he wanted to fucking have a toothbrush
shoved up your ass. Press one.

1165
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:11,790
If you want to fucking do a cart wheel,
press 19 so finally up,

1166
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:13,880
you get up to 20 if you
want to make a reservation,

1167
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:18,680
I fucking hit that button and then
write again. Giggy wiggly here.

1168
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:23,300
El Pais date, right? It takes me
like fucking 20 minutes, right?

1169
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:29,710
Press or say cunt, right? I'm going
through all that shit. So finally,

1170
01:13:29,711 --> 01:13:33,950
I'm just like screaming operator.
Yeah. Into the phone. Right?

1171
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,370
So finally I get someone and I say, you
know, listen, I want to rent, you know,

1172
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,100
saw this car corvette you had at the
Burbank airport. And God damn it,

1173
01:13:43,101 --> 01:13:45,650
I'd like to rent it.
And they go, okay, um,

1174
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,840
let me give you the number for the Hertz
rental car location and they can help

1175
01:13:50,841 --> 01:13:55,550
you with that, sir. And I said,
okay ma'am. And she gives it to me.

1176
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,970
All right.
So I hang up and what do I do?

1177
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:03,170
I called the Hertz location out in
Burbank and what do I get again?

1178
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:06,380
That same computers,
smiley voice.

1179
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:11,410
Diggy recalling her GB anal
care. Yeah. Help eggs. Right.

1180
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:13,300
Okay.

1181
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:17,230
If you know the extension of the person,
how the fuck would I know that?

1182
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,550
How would I know what fucking extension
would like to have football players and

1183
01:14:22,551 --> 01:14:26,580
they have a hall of fame career and I
know fucking Brett Farve is extension four

1184
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:31,190
out of fuck what? I know
that shit. So once again,

1185
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:33,680
operator screaming into the phone,

1186
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,200
I want to fucking talk
to a goddamn person.

1187
01:14:37,201 --> 01:14:40,260
But of course I can't talk to a person.
What are they doing the entire time?

1188
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:42,480
They keep steering me to the Internet,

1189
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:49,230
basically saying in not so many words
that this would be a whole fucking lot

1190
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:53,380
easier if you just went on the
Internet. Yeti hurts Dad Cam, right.

1191
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,740
If you could just help us
eliminate more fucking jobs

1192
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,980
so we can eventually replace all of
you with fucking robots, you know?

1193
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,920
So I'm like, fuck this, I want
to talk to a goddamn person.

1194
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,140
So finally I get to the stupid,
you know,

1195
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:11,570
all I get is if you want to leave
a message, you know, I'm like,

1196
01:15:11,571 --> 01:15:15,890
I don't want to leave a
message. Right? And then they
go, well you didn't, you know,

1197
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:18,860
they come on like I didn't
make a decision. I have to
make a fucking decision.

1198
01:15:18,861 --> 01:15:22,100
I did make a decision. My decision is
I don't like any of the decisions you,

1199
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,780
you fucking gave me to make.

1200
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:30,110
So I think if you went Moria
pins play sport, Smiley face.

1201
01:15:30,111 --> 01:15:34,760
So I press four and then basically
if I wanted to talk to a person,

1202
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:39,800
I could basically schedule a phone
call when they could call me back.

1203
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:44,060
I could leave my phone number
or I could wait a half an hour.

1204
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:47,000
So I hang up and I'm like,
you know what,

1205
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:48,890
I've just wasted a half
hour of my fucking life.

1206
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:52,340
So I call these fucking assholes
back again at the national thing.

1207
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:54,560
Thank you for calling her to be anal care.

1208
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:58,940
I'm back in that shit again and I'm
screaming operator to the phone and I get

1209
01:15:58,941 --> 01:16:02,600
somebody and say, listen, who do
I talk to to make a complaint?

1210
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:06,110
Cause at this point I'm like, I'm not
renting this fucking car from there.

1211
01:16:06,111 --> 01:16:07,850
I know there's other places where they,
they,

1212
01:16:07,851 --> 01:16:12,260
they rent these exotic cars
is that column that, um,

1213
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,630
I was like, fuck it. I'm just
going to go through them, but I'm,

1214
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,530
but I'm going to make sure that
I complained to somebody. Okay.

1215
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:21,920
And I'm not going on the internet
and sending a fucking email. Right.

1216
01:16:21,921 --> 01:16:25,670
So I actually get a person and they
go, okay, well let me transfer. Okay,

1217
01:16:25,671 --> 01:16:28,460
I'm going to transfer you.
I'm sorry to hear that sir.

1218
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:30,150
I'm very sorry to hear that. Sorry. Um,

1219
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:33,710
let me transfer you to our complaints
department. I go. Okay, thank you.

1220
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,190
She clicks it over.
Yeah.

1221
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:40,450
Thank you for calling [inaudible]
I'm fucking back in it again.

1222
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:42,190
Yeah,

1223
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:46,240
right. And they, and they just fucking
tell me if I, if I'd like, I can't get,

1224
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:50,590
I can't get to a fucking person. So
now I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm determined.

1225
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:53,420
I'm going to get to somebody I call
back again. Can give you going here.

1226
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:57,550
It's go to the operator, go through
the bull shit again. When I say listen.

1227
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,330
Okay, you sitting down, person
on the other side of the phone.

1228
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:04,540
I would like to make a complaint.
I don't want to fill out a form.

1229
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,790
I don't want to make an email.
I want to talk to a person.

1230
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:08,950
I do not want to be
transferred into your national,

1231
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:11,570
he vaguely here fucking thing again.

1232
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,560
I didn't say fuck cause they could've
hung up on me. National System again,

1233
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,990
I would like to be transferred
directly to a person.

1234
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:22,220
I believe you call it a warm transfer
in the creepy corporate world.

1235
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,400
So can you do a warm transfer,

1236
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:30,470
meaning something alive to something
else alive that can communicate with me?

1237
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:33,470
She goes, yes sir. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. Having this difficulty.

1238
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,780
I'd say I understand lady.
I understand you're not on the yet.

1239
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:37,670
You're not on the yacht.
You're on the dark.

1240
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:41,330
Getting screamed at by guys like me every
day. That's why I'm not yelling at you.

1241
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:46,850
All right, fucking, I'm on hold
again. She can't get to anybody.

1242
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:50,660
Then I go back to her and then she hits
me with the form. What is your name, sir?

1243
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:55,040
What'd they did? None of your fucking
business. You don't need to know my name.

1244
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,460
What do you need to know my name for so
you can stick me on the hostile caller

1245
01:17:58,461 --> 01:18:03,410
list? Because I had the
audacity to complain about
your country fucking system.

1246
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:08,270
I'm not giving you my fucking name. I want
to talk to a person. Okay, sir. I just,

1247
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:11,870
yeah, I just, okay. Just following
protocol. I understand that ma'am.

1248
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,600
I'm not mad at you. I didn't say
that country. That fucks stuff.

1249
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:18,410
That's what I was thinking, but I
kept my God damn cool. I kept my cool.

1250
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:22,310
Just like fucking Steve McQueen in that
movie where he eats the deviled eggs,

1251
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,540
get mad at damn eggs.
So anyways, I fucking,

1252
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:32,960
I fucking
finally get to a person.

1253
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:38,810
All right? And I just say really
calmed me. I just say, look, you know,

1254
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:43,310
I've been on the phone for 40 minutes
trying to give you guys 350 bucks,

1255
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,160
okay.
And for the life of me,

1256
01:18:46,161 --> 01:18:50,450
I can't do it because I keep talking to
computers and they keep sending me back

1257
01:18:50,451 --> 01:18:53,660
into national system. Now, ma'am, I
know you have nothing to do with this,

1258
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:54,963
all right?

1259
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:59,360
But I want to know what is the best way
that I can try to complain so I can get

1260
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:03,800
to the inner hive, the inner layer of
the hive here and actually get to that,

1261
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:08,240
that person who's sitting there in those
loafers without any socks on sunning

1262
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:11,120
himself on the deck of his yacht.
I want to get to that guy,

1263
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:15,170
the guy who made this policy. Okay?
I like talking to people, man.

1264
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:19,580
I enjoy the fact that you still
have a job. Okay. That's what I,

1265
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:23,210
that's what I like here.
My phone buzzing in my phone,

1266
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:27,700
buzzed and hang on one second. Hey Paul,
let me call you right back. All right.

1267
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:33,140
So, uh, you know what? It actually worked.

1268
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:37,460
So basically what they did was,
is I got an email and they go,

1269
01:19:37,461 --> 01:19:41,510
you can send an email and I go and let me
guess. No one's going to call me. Right?

1270
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:46,280
Someone's going to email me back and
act like it's the actual frigging person

1271
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:50,510
that I'm talking to. But really it's going
to be an intern who's being, you know,

1272
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:52,160
who's working there for free.

1273
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,510
And also parttime reads those books for
Oprah's book clubs so she can come on TV

1274
01:19:56,511 --> 01:20:00,440
and acts like she fucking reads a foreign
a page book every fucking week. Right?

1275
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,770
Is that, are you going to give me too?
Cause if that's what the deal is I want,

1276
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:04,910
I want somebody up high.

1277
01:20:04,911 --> 01:20:09,911
So basically they gave me allegedly the
email of the vice president at Hertz

1278
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:18,030
reservations, Dad Cam, um, and
I actually have the guy's name.

1279
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,820
Now, whether this is true or not, I dunno,

1280
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,320
but what I want to tell the guy is
that I was trying to fucking rent

1281
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:31,420
that fucking flaming yellow corvette
that they have out there in Burbank,

1282
01:20:31,421 --> 01:20:32,680
California for the life of me.

1283
01:20:32,681 --> 01:20:35,230
I couldn't do it and now I don't want
to do it and I'm going to bring my

1284
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:38,530
business somewhere else and I
would appreciate it if you know,

1285
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:43,450
just hope against hope that maybe you'd
give some human beings some jobs because

1286
01:20:43,451 --> 01:20:47,050
my experience with your
company as you may be at best,

1287
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:51,280
have six people fucking working there
because you just,

1288
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:56,530
you just keep trying to steer the herd
onto the Internet and all you dumb fucks

1289
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:01,540
out there who are just constantly
helping them to get rid of people's jobs.

1290
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:05,620
You're out of your fucking mind because
those people are going to need jobs and

1291
01:21:05,621 --> 01:21:09,580
eventually they're going to be willing
to do your fucking job for a lot less

1292
01:21:09,581 --> 01:21:10,420
fucking pay.

1293
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:15,720
And considering we've sent 90% of our
factories out of this fucking country now.

1294
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:21,010
So now the American worker going to have
to fucking compete with sweatshop labor

1295
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:24,790
to make some fucking track shoes.
You know,

1296
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:26,860
why don't we try to keep
the jobs that we have?

1297
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:31,750
I'm not going to hertz.com you try
to pay me off with better rates.

1298
01:21:31,751 --> 01:21:36,700
Go Fuck Yourself. But some fucking human
beings in there the way you used to.

1299
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:39,630
And you know what?
You'd be $350 fucking rich.

1300
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:42,430
Or I'd be driving a corvette and
everybody would be fucking happier.

1301
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,850
You can put some new varnish on your,
the deck of your fucking boat.

1302
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:49,570
You fucking assholes.
So whatever.

1303
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,170
I know there's gotta be a private place
out there in la that I can call right up

1304
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:56,320
and they'll probably charge me
even more money. And you know what?

1305
01:21:56,321 --> 01:21:58,690
I don't give a fuck because
I want to go in there.

1306
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:01,720
They'll probably give me a little piece
of champagne or rug gimme a fucking foot

1307
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:05,200
massage. All right? They
probably won't do that,

1308
01:22:05,201 --> 01:22:08,380
but I'll talk to a person and that's
what the fuck I want. That's all I want.

1309
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:12,820
A little fucking human interaction San
asking too. God damn much. All right.

1310
01:22:12,821 --> 01:22:16,780
So anyways, there's that story. All right,
and I'm going to tell you another story.

1311
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,700
They want to just tell you guys
some stories this week. All right?

1312
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:21,160
Why don't you put your pajamas on?
All right.

1313
01:22:21,161 --> 01:22:23,170
Get a fire going in
your fucking apartment.

1314
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:26,140
If they haven't boarded the
thing up because they're
worried about getting sued.

1315
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:30,040
Um,
wasn't that great?

1316
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:35,020
Back in the day where if you started a
fire was your fucking fault as opposed to

1317
01:22:35,021 --> 01:22:39,460
the landlords as opposed to what? Why
did you have a fireplace in there? Well,

1318
01:22:39,461 --> 01:22:42,220
they had a fireplace in there
in case it got fucking cold out.

1319
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:44,740
Or maybe you want to have a romantic
evening with your girl and you want to

1320
01:22:44,741 --> 01:22:48,760
light a fucking fire. That's why there's
a fireplace in there. It's a fireplace.

1321
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:52,930
It is a place for a fire. Now, if somehow
you burned down the fucking apartment,

1322
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:57,220
evidently you didn't understand what
place to put the fucking firing you.

1323
01:22:57,221 --> 01:22:59,800
Dumb fuck who doesn't
not to use a fireplace?

1324
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:03,910
Evidently there's enough fucking people.
So they need to be boarded up.

1325
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,350
Boarding up a fireplace.
Jesus Christ.

1326
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:12,370
Why didn't you put Santa Claus in
jail while you're at it? All right.

1327
01:23:12,371 --> 01:23:16,660
That was a little big. Okay. I'm just
saying, you know, I like fireplaces.

1328
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:20,170
I like a crack of the fire.
I don't like those fucking gas ones.

1329
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:23,950
Those fake fires may technically
it is a fire, you know,

1330
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:26,590
I don't know.
What am I talking about?

1331
01:23:26,591 --> 01:23:29,200
Let me tell you a fantastic fucking
story last night. All right,

1332
01:23:29,201 --> 01:23:32,560
so I'm working the road with
Joe to Rosa Young Joe de Rosa,

1333
01:23:32,561 --> 01:23:36,490
the fucking teen idol from the opiate
Anthony Show who is actually going to be

1334
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:41,290
on the cover of teen beat this,
uh, this month in, it's actually,

1335
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:42,820
I saw a little bit of the photo shoot.

1336
01:23:42,821 --> 01:23:47,200
He's doing a tribute to a
Annette Funicello and uh,

1337
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,870
that other fucking guy was it Tony Curtis,

1338
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:52,750
who the fuck she used to make those
beach movies with or whatever.

1339
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,770
Joe is going to be there shirtless
holding her surfboard and knock. He needs,

1340
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:58,210
he's never look sexier.
Um,

1341
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:06,990
so, uh, the fuck am I
talking about? I Christ,

1342
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:10,510
I don't even know anymore. Um, yeah,
so we go out last night, right?

1343
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:14,680
We're doing the show is these two big
titted horse sitting in the front fucking

1344
01:24:14,681 --> 01:24:17,050
row. All right. So we're like,
Oh wow, look at these girls.

1345
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:20,800
These girls would probably be fun, right?
And I'm in a relationship, but you know,

1346
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:25,360
I like being the wing man. You know,
I love being the wingman. I'd love it.

1347
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,940
I love talking shit. The
girls, I love hitting on girls.

1348
01:24:27,941 --> 01:24:31,870
I fucking do it all the time and then I
try to pawn him off to wherever the fuck

1349
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:36,070
I am and uh, you know, so I don't
have any goddamn guilt, you know.

1350
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:39,010
So anyways,
so long story short,

1351
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:44,920
we're talking to these broads and it's
clear that there's some sort of strippers.

1352
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:46,450
I don't know what the fucking deal is.
Okay.

1353
01:24:46,451 --> 01:24:50,020
So we meet everybody from whatever I'm,
I'm gonna stop naming names here. Okay.

1354
01:24:50,021 --> 01:24:54,070
So a huge group of us from the show,
from the crowd and everything.

1355
01:24:54,071 --> 01:24:58,060
We go and we head out
to this bar, right? So

1356
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:01,210
one of the strippers is cool,

1357
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:05,950
the other one has a voice that could
literally crack a flatscreen TV.

1358
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:10,930
All right?
So the cool one shows up.

1359
01:25:10,931 --> 01:25:14,140
First she sits down, I'm like,
Hey, are you doing, you know,

1360
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:17,890
I like at the end of the week, I hang out
a by around for some people, you know,

1361
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:22,540
I'm in a great mood. I had a good
time. I'm on my way home, you know,

1362
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:26,890
up by some people, some drinks. So I say
to her, hey, what would you like to drink?

1363
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:30,760
She's like, I'll have an Faq and gag at
Google, one of those fucking chick drinks.

1364
01:25:30,761 --> 01:25:35,110
So you know, so I get her a drink. I buy
young Joe to Rosa fucking drink, right?

1365
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,970
Everybody's having a good time.

1366
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,760
And then this other person shows up who
I knew and she was a real nice person.

1367
01:25:42,761 --> 01:25:45,580
I said, hey, what do you want
for a drink? And she was like,

1368
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:48,640
I'll get a vodka red bull,
right? I got my $20 bill out.

1369
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:52,960
And then the strippers like, yeah, make
it tell right. And I was like, wait,

1370
01:25:52,961 --> 01:25:55,750
what do you mean make it to you
haven't even finished your first make.

1371
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:59,620
Don't be ordering off my money. You've
finished your first one there, young lady.

1372
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,050
All right, stand the fuck down.
You're not working right now.

1373
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,750
Not some dipshit getting a
fucking lap dance. All right,

1374
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:10,790
finish your fucking milk and
cookies first. So needless to say,

1375
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:13,040
the conversation called
between the two of us,

1376
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:18,080
but I didn't give a fuck man. I was
having a good time, but whatever.

1377
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:22,160
It was still kind of, you know,
whatever, just talking shit.

1378
01:26:22,161 --> 01:26:25,280
We were talking sports. The bartender
was cool, you know, we, everything,

1379
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:26,360
everything was going great.

1380
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:30,820
So with chilling out and all
of a sudden this fucking, uh,

1381
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:36,770
the other fucking stripper girl
shows up out and was so fucking,

1382
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:40,430
it was just such classic female shit.
She's got a tits hanging out.

1383
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:44,720
She's got the fuck me pumps on
and she comes up, she goes, hey.

1384
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,800
And she sees her friend with the drink
and she knows goddamn well she didn't pay

1385
01:26:48,801 --> 01:26:51,260
for it. So she looks over
at me as less. It's like,

1386
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:55,250
well that must have been the
SAP who fucking bought it.
Right? So she looks at me,

1387
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:58,340
she goes, Hey Belle. And
she's like, she's like,

1388
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:02,930
what are you Jane Can Right? And
I know what she's doing. I'm like,

1389
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:05,840
I'm drinking one of those
Sam Adams Octoberfest

1390
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:10,550
and is leaving like that nice and awkward.
Right?

1391
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,250
Cause I know what she's trying
to get a drink out of me. Right?

1392
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,970
So she doesn't know what to do.
She's like, ah, is that good?

1393
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:23,060
I'm like, why? Yes, yes
it is. At this point,

1394
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:26,270
Derosa knows what's going on. I don't
know that he knows what's going on.

1395
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:30,290
So she looks at me like, okay, well
evidently he's not buying any more drinks.

1396
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:33,530
And then she looks at Jo,
she's like, ah, Hey Cho,

1397
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:39,080
what are you tracking? And Joe gets
his shit eating grin on his face.

1398
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:43,910
He goes, why? I'm drinking a bud light.
Why would you like to buy me one?

1399
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:49,490
And she didn't know what the fuck to
do. She's like, uh, I, yeah. Again,

1400
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,510
he goes,
you know what?

1401
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:54,200
I think you should buy me a bud light
and you should buy my good friend bill

1402
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:57,380
burr here, another Oktoberfest.
What do you think about that?

1403
01:27:57,540 --> 01:28:02,210
And at that point I'm fucking
dying laughing. The other
stripper girl next to me,

1404
01:28:02,211 --> 01:28:04,490
she's laughing her ass off
cause she knows what happened.

1405
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:07,370
And then the fucking grow with this
screechy voice is sitting there.

1406
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:10,820
She doesn't know what the fuck to do.
We fucking nailed it.

1407
01:28:10,821 --> 01:28:13,310
And then wait and then like she's going,
she didn't know what to do.

1408
01:28:13,311 --> 01:28:14,780
And Joe's just going,
yes,

1409
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:19,810
why don't you pay it forward for all the
drinks that guys have boughten you and

1410
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:23,480
that you've drank. And then immediately
turned around and fucking walked away.

1411
01:28:23,481 --> 01:28:28,130
Why don't you for once by a Goddamn by
a couple of drinks for a couple of guys

1412
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:31,700
and she's a high in, you put
it that way. Fine. I, well I,

1413
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:35,720
well I might a fucking drink and
Joe's like, how bout some shots too?

1414
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:40,310
And she just was, I don't know what
her fucking ego was that she goes,

1415
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:41,720
final fucking do that too.

1416
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:45,170
So we actually got to strip it up
by his two bears and two shots.

1417
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:49,220
So we're feeling like the kings of the
world and then all of a sudden we found

1418
01:28:49,221 --> 01:28:52,940
out from this waitress that on the slide
she tried to put it on her boyfriends

1419
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:55,460
fucking credit card.
What a scumbag. Right?

1420
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:58,100
So we buster and we all win.

1421
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:02,580
And when this big commotion breaks out
right before the fucking bartenders are

1422
01:29:02,581 --> 01:29:06,360
about ready to swipe the boyfriend's
credit card, we were like, don't chill.

1423
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,540
Joette I just like an
officer and a gentlemen.

1424
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,510
I got nowhere else to go.
Right?

1425
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,800
We get him to stop and they take out her
ATM and she had to fucking pay for it.

1426
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,860
And it was a done deal.
We had two drinks,

1427
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:22,900
two shots from that
fucking person who knows.

1428
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:26,250
Never paid for a drink since
she got her fucking tits. Right.

1429
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:29,910
And this was the best part. The second
we got our drinks, we set thanks a lot.

1430
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,890
And we both got up and we walked away.

1431
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:39,660
Oh, it's tremendous. Tremendous.
It was the best night ever,

1432
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:41,610
and I'm just standing
there drinking my drink.

1433
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:45,810
Like 20 minutes later I'm milking it for
all it's worth this free fucking beer

1434
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,210
than a stripper bought me,
which is awesome. Right?

1435
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:51,480
And Joe was talking to some girl across
the way and you're looking at all of a

1436
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:55,170
sudden I just yelled over, I go, Joe.
And he looks over at me and I did.

1437
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:59,640
I did the Robert De Niro line from when
he was eating at Joe Pesci mom right

1438
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:03,870
before they hacked up Billy batts. Right.
He looks up and he's like, what's up?

1439
01:30:03,871 --> 01:30:05,070
And I just pointed at the beer,

1440
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:08,340
this stripper at bought and I
just went delicious. Delicious.

1441
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:13,520
And that was my evening. And
that that, there's another
story for you. What are we,

1442
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:17,100
35 minutes. Then you got any more
stories? As a matter of fact, I do.

1443
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:20,190
What else did I do this
fucking weekend? Oh, I know.

1444
01:30:20,191 --> 01:30:24,120
I took a trip to the cotton bowl.
What is the cotton bowl bill? Well,

1445
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:27,270
cotton bowl is a stadium that's been
around, I believe since the twenties,

1446
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:30,960
and it's the first place that the Dallas
cowboys played in and the Dallas Texans

1447
01:30:30,961 --> 01:30:35,010
in the old AFL. And God dammit,
I found out it's still existed.

1448
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:37,590
So I wanted to go fucking
take a look at it.

1449
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:41,580
So I went down there and lo and behold,
they were having their Texas there.

1450
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:43,830
Dallas, Texas state, motherfucking fair

1451
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,660
that they have every goddamn year.
I got a new text message,

1452
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:53,160
I hear my little 16 year old phone
call me when you wake up,

1453
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:57,390
I want to please you asshole. Um, anyways,

1454
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:02,680
so I go to take a tour of this thing, Mesa
first place, Tom Landry, coach, you know,

1455
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:07,680
the first season of the Dallas cowboys,
right? Dallas cowboys team that I love,

1456
01:31:07,681 --> 01:31:09,690
which was basically the Tom Landry years.

1457
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:15,170
And I never gotten to the Jimmy Johnson
ones because watching Tom Landry leave,

1458
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,810
I mean, it was like watching
Johnny Carson go, you know,

1459
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,220
no disrespect to the next people.
It's just, it's just not Johnny.

1460
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:27,690
It's not Tom Landry. You know what I'm
saying? So, uh, I never got into them.

1461
01:31:27,691 --> 01:31:30,720
So like this, you know, it was a big
deal to go check this out. So I go to,

1462
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:34,920
you know, go to this tour and it was the
worst fucking tour ever took in my life.

1463
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:37,800
It wasn't bad. It was an awesome
tour, but just the lady was cute,

1464
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:42,140
but she just didn't fucking know anything
about the stadium. She goes, uh Oh he's,

1465
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:46,520
you can see on either side. They
added some seats, they added thethe,

1466
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:50,610
all the shiny silver ones. Those are
the new ones. And I was like, how many,

1467
01:31:50,611 --> 01:31:53,490
how many people? The place is fucking huge
guy. People People's this place holds,

1468
01:31:53,491 --> 01:31:58,330
she's like, I think like 23,000, 23,000.

1469
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,100
I know you guys aren't
into sports the way I am.

1470
01:32:00,101 --> 01:32:04,930
23,000 is like a little hockey arena.
You know, you have a hockey game,

1471
01:32:04,931 --> 01:32:07,270
you sell at a hockey game,
23,000.

1472
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:12,010
This is where fucking Texas longhorns
in the fucking Oklahoma sooners play.

1473
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:12,700
All right.

1474
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:17,700
College stadiums do not hold 23,000
at the Division One fucking level,

1475
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:21,790
especially Texas, Oklahoma. You
know what I mean? So I'm like, ah,

1476
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:24,970
I think it's a little more, I guess
like 45,000. I didn't fucking know.

1477
01:32:24,971 --> 01:32:27,880
And she looks, and she goes,
yeah, I think it's 23,000.

1478
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:31,960
Then she looked at it a little pamphlets.
She goes on, sorry, it's 97,000

1479
01:32:35,370 --> 01:32:39,700
and I got to tell you right now, right
there, the stadium tour is fucking over.

1480
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:40,563
It's over.

1481
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:44,890
I don't want to hear another word from
you because that is the first fight.

1482
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:47,050
If you're doing a tour of a stadium,

1483
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,570
like if you want on the family
feud and the in the, in the,

1484
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:52,420
the first question was,
you know,

1485
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:55,210
you're standing there with one arm
behind your back so you can't cheat.

1486
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:57,850
I don't understand why you have to
do that on the family feud. Right?

1487
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:59,530
Like what if your lunch with two hands,

1488
01:32:59,531 --> 01:33:03,880
you're quicker diving in
like fucking Pete rose. Um,

1489
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:07,240
anyways, if the, if the
question was, um, you know,

1490
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:10,510
you've taken a tour of the stadium, what's
the first question you're gonna ask?

1491
01:33:10,511 --> 01:33:12,130
And you fucking slam your hand down.

1492
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:16,000
The first thing you would say is how
many people does this stadium hold?

1493
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:20,860
How many people does this stadium
home fucking number one answer.

1494
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:21,723
That's what it would be.

1495
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:25,480
That it's just chick acted like I asked
her what the fucking consistency of the

1496
01:33:25,481 --> 01:33:28,780
concrete was for the of the stadium.
She had no fucking idea.

1497
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:34,150
And then she tried to say
that that back in the day,

1498
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:37,120
the cotton bowl,
the cotton bowl,

1499
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:42,920
B o w l like a cereal bowl
was open ended on both sides.

1500
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:47,020
Think about that for a second.
A stadium that's called the,

1501
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:51,760
you ever seen the Rose Bowl?
The rose bowl is an open on either side,

1502
01:33:51,761 --> 01:33:54,010
is it now?
It's shaped like a fucking bowl.

1503
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:58,630
She tried to say that the cotton bowl was
open on both ends for a while and just

1504
01:33:58,631 --> 01:34:00,730
in 2002 they closed it off.

1505
01:34:00,731 --> 01:34:04,270
What they actually did was they put an
upper deck and as far as I could tell,

1506
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:06,940
they knocked down the end zone,
lower level. And they just,

1507
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:09,460
they rebuilt that and
they put an upper deck,

1508
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:13,390
but she was trying to say that
it was open ended until 2002.

1509
01:34:13,391 --> 01:34:15,550
And in my head I'm going,
I don't think that that's right.

1510
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:17,890
I don't think that that's right either.

1511
01:34:17,891 --> 01:34:20,350
And then we went into the
media room and Lo and behold,

1512
01:34:20,351 --> 01:34:23,710
they have a picture of the
cotton bowl in 1958 and closed.

1513
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:29,620
You know, I, you know, and I, I just,
I don't know, but we've got to go down,

1514
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:31,000
stay in right down near the field,

1515
01:34:31,001 --> 01:34:34,600
come right down where all the
players came out. And uh, you know,

1516
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:40,550
was asked me, Len Dawson Hanks,
dram, Bob Lilly, chuck Howley,

1517
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:44,800
you know, all that shit right up
till now. All the modern day players,

1518
01:34:44,801 --> 01:34:48,440
Ricky Williams played there.
Who else played on the long horn?

1519
01:34:48,441 --> 01:34:52,000
So many fucking guys, that
guy, Vince young, all those
fucking dudes. I don't know.

1520
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,380
Billy Sims, Earl Campbell, you
know, it was a fucking great time.

1521
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:59,090
Then I walked out of there and they
and I went to, I walked around.

1522
01:34:59,091 --> 01:35:01,940
The little state fair
isn't a little state fair.

1523
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:05,960
It's actually a big state fair that they
have and evidently down here in Texas,

1524
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:07,010
what they do is,

1525
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:10,820
and you people overseas who hate on
Americans are going to love this shit.

1526
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:12,200
It's just,
this is classic here.

1527
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:17,290
What they do down here in Texas is every
year they fry something every year with

1528
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:21,630
fry, something different.
Last year was Oreos.

1529
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:26,640
Year before that it was Twinkies.
We Fried Coq one year fried pizza.

1530
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:29,160
I'm not even lying. They fried
all of this shits. I mean,

1531
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:32,070
he told me they fried Coca Cola.
I don't know how the fuck you do that,

1532
01:35:32,071 --> 01:35:35,970
but they said they did it. I don't know
how to do it. What do you freeze the coke,

1533
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:38,660
Huh?
And then

1534
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:41,680
fucking rolling around in some fly.
I don't, I have no fucking idea,

1535
01:35:41,681 --> 01:35:42,514
but all I know,
you know what?

1536
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:47,140
Evidently they're out of fucking ideas
because this year, you know what?

1537
01:35:47,141 --> 01:35:49,690
They were frying.
They will frying butter.

1538
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:56,560
I swear to God,
they were selling fried fucking butter.

1539
01:35:57,310 --> 01:35:58,390
And I'm like,
why?

1540
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:03,460
That is the most disgusting fucking
thing I've ever heard in my life.

1541
01:36:03,461 --> 01:36:06,490
God dammit. I have to
try it. I got to try it.

1542
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:08,650
I have to see what it is.

1543
01:36:08,651 --> 01:36:12,400
Like I made a little fucking
youtube video. Actually,

1544
01:36:12,401 --> 01:36:17,350
I got to have the kid I was with made a
little video of me trying that little,

1545
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:18,483
uh,

1546
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:19,400
yeah,

1547
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,800
delicacy, that little
Texas delicacy. Dude,

1548
01:36:21,801 --> 01:36:24,860
it was the most disgusting fucking thing
I ever had. I've asked, the guy said,

1549
01:36:24,861 --> 01:36:25,581
all right,
well,

1550
01:36:25,581 --> 01:36:28,640
first thing I want to do was get the fried
Oreo because evidently that was a big

1551
01:36:28,641 --> 01:36:32,330
hit. That kind of made sense to me.
Fried Oreo is fucked up is that is,

1552
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:35,210
I would figure because it's fried,
it's going to be salty,

1553
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:39,140
but then you've got the sugary cookie
to kind of offset the two. You know,

1554
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:41,520
it's Kinda like,
you know,

1555
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,510
you did some lines and now you're drinking
some alcohol to even yourself out.

1556
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:48,090
Same fucking thing. Just in
a food way. Right. So, uh,

1557
01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:51,910
I went over to that one first and I go,
yeah, let me get in. The guy's like,

1558
01:36:51,911 --> 01:36:55,710
I don't, I'm like, yeah, let me get
one of those fried Oreos, Oreo cookies.

1559
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,140
And he goes, ah, I'm sorry. We can't,

1560
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:02,160
we can't cook yet until the
health inspector comes up and, uh,

1561
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:04,200
and gives us the,
okay,

1562
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:09,200
the Elton Elton Health inspector has
to inspect our booth first. So my law,

1563
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:12,370
next logical question was like, well,
how do you think you're going to do,

1564
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:17,550
I know, locked into a restaurant,
like, hang on a second.

1565
01:37:17,551 --> 01:37:18,690
I loved my having given sandwich.

1566
01:37:18,691 --> 01:37:21,950
Let's just have the health inspector
go through first. Let's just see a,

1567
01:37:21,990 --> 01:37:25,080
we have an acceptable amount
of roaches. So I said, fuck it.

1568
01:37:25,081 --> 01:37:28,530
And I went straight to the fried butter
and evidently they had already been

1569
01:37:28,531 --> 01:37:32,250
inspected. And I said, all
right, hang out. And he goes,
well, how can I help you?

1570
01:37:32,251 --> 01:37:35,340
I go, I got to get some of that fried
butter. And the guy goes, all right,

1571
01:37:35,341 --> 01:37:38,970
what do you want? You want original? You
want something else to something else?

1572
01:37:38,971 --> 01:37:42,930
And I go, let me get the original. And
he goes, all right. And he goes, uh,

1573
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:48,570
uh, he, yes, he said that your
choice of toppings. I forget
what the fuck they were,

1574
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:53,070
but I went with the Welch's grape jelly.
I know this is disgusting.

1575
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,860
You know what's funny is probably as
somebody working on treadmill right now

1576
01:37:55,861 --> 01:37:56,220
listening

1577
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,490
to this feeling a lot better about
themselves. So they basically,

1578
01:37:59,491 --> 01:38:03,150
they look like these little Dino's
Duncan Munchkins or doughnut holes.

1579
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:08,050
That's what it looked like. Okay. And
then there was like the grape jelly,

1580
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:13,980
there was, there was the uh, the Great
Jelly, sorry, my phone keeps ringing.

1581
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:18,690
Um, so I dip it in the grape jelly
and I took a bite out of it and do it.

1582
01:38:18,691 --> 01:38:22,620
It was the most disgusting fucking
thing I've ever tasted in my life.

1583
01:38:22,621 --> 01:38:25,890
It tasted like a flavor list doughnut.
And then you know,

1584
01:38:25,891 --> 01:38:30,891
that awful gum that has this squirting
inside that was like the inside,

1585
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:35,160
except it was butter. It was just
a little nugget of like butter.

1586
01:38:35,161 --> 01:38:38,220
It was fucking gross.
And it was so disgusting.

1587
01:38:38,221 --> 01:38:40,680
I had to have another
one because you know one,

1588
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:44,400
you know one for each ventricle
over ventricles, you get,
I forgot more than two.

1589
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:47,520
Maybe that's why I'm still fucking living.
I don't know what,

1590
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:52,440
but I had another one just to be like
is was it that bad and a yes it was,

1591
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:53,303
it was a

1592
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:54,950
okay.

1593
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:56,560
It was wrong. It was just,
that's all I can say.

1594
01:38:56,561 --> 01:38:59,560
I was just fucking wrong and
should not be done. And uh,

1595
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,610
yeah,
I'm just gonna leave it dad.

1596
01:39:03,611 --> 01:39:07,350
I think I'm gonna end the podcast right
here cause I'm out of stories and a

1597
01:39:07,390 --> 01:39:10,930
Jesus Christ, my fucking phone wants
to, I got it. I have a voicemail,

1598
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:15,650
I'm going to New York next week and I'm
going to get my blackberry when I get a

1599
01:39:15,651 --> 01:39:19,340
new blackberry again. I didn't get one
out in la cause if you do it out in la,

1600
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,260
they can't give you a New York number,
you know?

1601
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:24,050
And I want to keep that number just
because at this point I've had the number

1602
01:39:24,051 --> 01:39:28,310
forever. You know, I don't want to
have to call fucking 9,000 people.

1603
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:29,920
Okay.

1604
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,810
I Dunno. I Dunno what the fuck
I'm talking about. All right.

1605
01:39:31,811 --> 01:39:34,970
This has been the Monday morning podcast.
I Apologize I didn't have any a,

1606
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,610
they didn't have any
questions this week did I?

1607
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:40,320
I don't have anything cause I couldn't
get to my email. I had a couple,

1608
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:45,010
this is September 24th.
Um,

1609
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,400
all right, I'm going to read one here. Um,

1610
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:53,250
this is actually a commenting
on rugby and women. All right.

1611
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:57,580
Here we go up bill, after hearing your
show this week regarding rugby, um,

1612
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:01,600
where you asked whether or not any
rugby player has played in the NFL,

1613
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:05,150
I decided to do some research on
the subject. Uh, what I found out,

1614
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,253
yeah.

1615
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:07,380
Um,

1616
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:10,410
is that there have been several rugby
players who have crossed over to play in

1617
01:40:10,411 --> 01:40:11,010
the NFL.

1618
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:13,980
Many of their names won't ring a bell
because it appears they are all kickers

1619
01:40:13,981 --> 01:40:18,480
and punters. The two names that came
up the most often were Ben Graham,

1620
01:40:18,481 --> 01:40:21,540
a kicker, who I think
played for the jets. And

1621
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:27,270
Mick Luckhurst was also a kicker who
played for the Falcons from 1981 to 1987.

1622
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:31,170
What I found funny was that the rugby
guys who attempted to try out for other

1623
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:35,820
positions such as linebacker or running
back or often considered too small,

1624
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:41,060
too slow or too weak to do damage on
the field against a much larger NFL

1625
01:40:41,071 --> 01:40:43,020
players.
Um,

1626
01:40:43,021 --> 01:40:46,260
now I know a lot of people in England
are going to flip out about that shit.

1627
01:40:46,261 --> 01:40:47,094
Well,
you know what?

1628
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:51,840
They say that all the time that American
football players are a bunch of pussies

1629
01:40:51,841 --> 01:40:54,190
because they wear helmets
and all that type of shit.

1630
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,120
Well,
I got news for you.

1631
01:40:55,450 --> 01:41:00,450
There's a great article in Gq magazine
that I actually read and I never read Gq

1632
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,560
because a,

1633
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:07,561
it's kind of like the male cosmo where
you just open it up and there's a ton of

1634
01:41:07,721 --> 01:41:10,900
articles,
not articles as a ton of advertising.

1635
01:41:10,901 --> 01:41:15,130
You can't find where the fucking
articles are and it smells like Cologne.

1636
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:22,090
I swear to God it does. It's really
a fucking, it's a really, uh,

1637
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:24,970
awful magazine. But I got
to tell you this, there was,

1638
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:27,310
there's a woman on the
cover of this magazine,

1639
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:31,810
Olivia Wilde might be the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen in my life.

1640
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:35,140
She's just ridiculous. And I was like
I have to read this article about this,

1641
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:36,910
this,
this female.

1642
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:41,140
And it turned out there was an article
in there about concussions and above

1643
01:41:41,141 --> 01:41:44,800
football players going crazy
and killing themselves.

1644
01:41:44,801 --> 01:41:49,300
Professional football players.
And they were talking about Mike Webster,

1645
01:41:49,301 --> 01:41:52,960
the center for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
It's an unbelievable article.

1646
01:41:52,961 --> 01:41:55,840
It's a Olivia Wilde is on the cover.

1647
01:41:56,470 --> 01:42:00,130
And basically they were saying the helmets
cause that's the number one thing I

1648
01:42:00,131 --> 01:42:01,620
hear these English guys can say anything,

1649
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:04,720
you know American football players or
pussy cause they were like the helmets in

1650
01:42:04,721 --> 01:42:09,520
the pads. Evidently the all the
helmet does is it protects the skull.

1651
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:15,400
It doesn't protect the brain cause
the brain sits in like fluid and moves

1652
01:42:15,401 --> 01:42:19,180
around. So when you get slammed in the
side of the head and not only mentioned,

1653
01:42:19,181 --> 01:42:22,750
they were saying the way they build these
helmets is back when they had leather

1654
01:42:22,751 --> 01:42:25,570
helmets. You know, back in the
days, the three stooges days,

1655
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:27,460
if you watch the guys play football,

1656
01:42:27,461 --> 01:42:31,300
they didn't lead with their heads
because you'd get knocked out.

1657
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:34,690
But now in an effort
to protect their heads,

1658
01:42:34,691 --> 01:42:38,110
they were basically saying what they've
done with these helmets is they created

1659
01:42:38,111 --> 01:42:42,430
a weapon. And these football players,
especially the Lyman, every play,

1660
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:45,520
if you watch them, they just slam
into each other with their heads.

1661
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:49,720
And I have a deadly, they're doing
unbelievable amounts of brain damage.

1662
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:52,510
And Mike Webster's brain,
he basically,

1663
01:42:52,511 --> 01:42:56,800
he went crazy and he couldn't
fucking remember shit. So
they, during the autopsy,

1664
01:42:56,801 --> 01:42:59,140
they removed his brain,
they sliced it in half.

1665
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:03,910
And he had lists all [inaudible]
f I don't know that this plaque,

1666
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:06,900
I don't know what they called it,
but it was like a,

1667
01:43:07,630 --> 01:43:11,890
they said it should have been the brain
of like an 89 or 90 year old guy in this

1668
01:43:11,891 --> 01:43:14,950
guy died at 50. So, uh,

1669
01:43:14,951 --> 01:43:17,680
I'm not saying that rugby guys
are pussies or anything like that.

1670
01:43:17,681 --> 01:43:19,240
I was just giving people shit or whatever,

1671
01:43:19,241 --> 01:43:23,410
but I'm just defending American
football players saying that, you know,

1672
01:43:23,411 --> 01:43:26,020
just cause they have that fucking
helmet on. You know what I mean?

1673
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:27,370
I find that really interesting.
Like,

1674
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:29,620
cause I used to always watch
guys riding motorcycles.

1675
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,970
My duty out of your fucking mind.

1676
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:35,320
Do you realize the brain damage you're
going to get if your head slams off a

1677
01:43:35,321 --> 01:43:38,710
curb like Gary Busey did and uh,

1678
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:41,540
evidently obviously you know, if
you're wearing a helmet, you know,

1679
01:43:41,541 --> 01:43:44,800
you protect and you know from literally
putting a hole in your head so you

1680
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:47,350
should wear it.
But you know,

1681
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:50,770
I'd never really dawned on me obviously
because I'm a comedian and not a fucking

1682
01:43:52,580 --> 01:43:56,660
that just be, you can have a
helmet on and your brain can,

1683
01:43:56,661 --> 01:44:00,200
you can have just as much, I think
basically just as much brain damage.

1684
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:03,950
I think what you would have to have
is some sort of like hard shell in the

1685
01:44:03,951 --> 01:44:08,951
middle and then like 80 feet of nerf
on the outside of our spongy fucking

1686
01:44:09,591 --> 01:44:10,910
material on the outside.

1687
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:15,910
So you would have to start to slow
your head down before it came to the,

1688
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:20,270
to the, uh, what am I trying to
say? I think beyond a certain speed,

1689
01:44:20,271 --> 01:44:23,090
it doesn't make a difference whether
you have a fucking helmet on or not,

1690
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:26,600
because your brain is going to slam
against the inside of your skull.

1691
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:30,830
So fucking hard, uh, that is not
going to matter. And they go,

1692
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:34,160
that's coming from a comedian. So, you
know, it's, it's medically accurate.

1693
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:38,240
All right, let's move on here. Um,
and once again, to those people in,

1694
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:41,240
I have no disrespect. It was rugby
guys are fucking tough sons of bitches.

1695
01:44:41,241 --> 01:44:45,020
I have no, but no, no,
uh, questions about that.

1696
01:44:45,021 --> 01:44:48,320
But you really have to stop saying that
American football players are pussies

1697
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:53,270
because they have pads on
those fucking guys. You know,

1698
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:57,300
you wouldn't want to play rugby against
them. Put it that way. All right.

1699
01:44:57,620 --> 01:45:01,670
All right, let's plow ahead here.
Alright, Bill. Uh, you also stated some,

1700
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:06,290
some ways you can tell when you've
won an argument with the woman. Um,

1701
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:08,630
stuff like the crying
and when they begin to,

1702
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:12,200
to switch your words to talk about past
topics in the middle of an argument.

1703
01:45:12,201 --> 01:45:16,130
Yeah. They bring up other shit that you
did because they're losing the shit that

1704
01:45:16,131 --> 01:45:19,310
you're talking about right then and there.
I guess guys do that too. But anyways,

1705
01:45:19,311 --> 01:45:22,670
let's plow ahead here. He said, well,
I have a better one on my way to work.

1706
01:45:22,671 --> 01:45:26,840
My wife and I were arguing over me hurting
her feelings because I came home from

1707
01:45:26,841 --> 01:45:31,430
a 10 hour day at work and three and a
half hours of night school just wanting to

1708
01:45:31,431 --> 01:45:36,060
go to bed. So even though my sexy
Latin woman was in, it was a,

1709
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:39,170
was ready for some action,
I simply took a shower,

1710
01:45:39,171 --> 01:45:44,000
crawled into bed next to her and went to
sleep. Needless to say, she was pissed.

1711
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:47,360
So this morning we were
fussing about it and she says,

1712
01:45:47,361 --> 01:45:50,630
that really hurt my feelings,
um,

1713
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:55,670
because it felt like you didn't
want me. And he said, um,

1714
01:45:56,330 --> 01:46:00,890
and I don't know what, what came over me.
But instead of being an angry black man,

1715
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:04,520
I simply smiled, grabbed her,
grabbed her hand, kissed it,

1716
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:06,980
and commonly said in a soft voice,

1717
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:12,310
now you know how I felt last week
and she said absolutely nothing.

1718
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:17,570
She just stared at me like she wanted
to start the waterworks but she couldn't

1719
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:18,440
get it going.

1720
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:23,270
I dropped her off at the office where
she kissed me and actually apologized.

1721
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:27,200
I smiled the entire way to work.
Wow.

1722
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:31,460
I actually thought she was going to get
mad because that was kind of harsh the

1723
01:46:31,461 --> 01:46:35,960
way you said it. That's like stand
up, applause, break, stand up comedy.

1724
01:46:35,961 --> 01:46:39,170
Well now you know I fell
last week if fucking Twat.

1725
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:41,870
That's how I would have delivered it.
But I guess you said it nicely and calmly,

1726
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:44,180
but yeah,
you know that is kind of fucked up.

1727
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:47,390
That's one of the things that I have
found like in relationship is, you know,

1728
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:50,280
you've got to watch out because
for the most, I think I would,

1729
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:53,880
I would venture to guess without
doing a survey as always,

1730
01:46:53,881 --> 01:46:57,270
I would venture to guess
that 92% of relationships,

1731
01:46:57,271 --> 01:47:01,440
women control the sex because guys
will do it basically whenever.

1732
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:05,220
I really sound like a hacky comedian guys,
we don't give a shit woo woo,

1733
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:08,730
but it seriously, and then
women kind of use it as a, uh,

1734
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:13,050
they start using. Yeah, he's still
a bit about that as a reward.

1735
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:17,160
You took out the trash here at good boy
and you get like a hand job. You know,

1736
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:21,630
you can't do that if you really
want to equalize, you know,

1737
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:23,280
the whole sex in your relationship.

1738
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:28,280
You why you gotta you gotta continue to
rub one out every once in awhile so that

1739
01:47:28,321 --> 01:47:30,690
way you know, if they don't want to
have sex and you're like, all right,

1740
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:34,370
that's cool. You know and then,
yeah, keep it. Keep eye on any,

1741
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:35,520
then you're creating a war

1742
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:39,300
because I would say then what you do
is next time they want to have it,

1743
01:47:39,301 --> 01:47:40,470
then you act like you don't have it.

1744
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:43,020
That's not the way to go about doing
it because then you start playing games

1745
01:47:43,021 --> 01:47:47,460
with each other. What you probably
should say is a, I don't know,

1746
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:50,370
just basically what I've said to
women, which is, Oh yeah, bell,

1747
01:47:50,371 --> 01:47:52,980
we should say exactly what you said cause
you have your fucking life figured out.

1748
01:47:53,130 --> 01:47:56,670
You fucking single 40 year old
psychopath. Yeah. Once again,

1749
01:47:56,671 --> 01:47:58,680
I want to say don't ever
listen to what I say on here.

1750
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:02,190
You know I am not a trained person and
I'm worried at some point someone's going

1751
01:48:02,191 --> 01:48:03,060
to take my advice,

1752
01:48:03,170 --> 01:48:05,190
they're going to get punched in
the face and I'm going to get sued.

1753
01:48:05,191 --> 01:48:08,040
So you've got to understand that you're
talking to a comedian here who's may be

1754
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:13,020
read three books in his life. Two of
them had pictures on every other page.

1755
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:17,370
All right. That's, that's what you're
dealing with now. She, I'm telling you,

1756
01:48:17,371 --> 01:48:21,390
the big thing with women is if you want
to get your way, is not to get mad,

1757
01:48:21,690 --> 01:48:23,550
not to play a fucking game with them.

1758
01:48:23,551 --> 01:48:28,230
You just have to tell them
how what they're doing is
making you feel they can't

1759
01:48:28,231 --> 01:48:31,980
get around it if you have a legitimate
complaint, you know, let me see.

1760
01:48:31,981 --> 01:48:33,510
I got something ridiculous like,
Hey,

1761
01:48:33,511 --> 01:48:35,700
I want to put it in your
ass and you won't let me.

1762
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:39,220
And it's really making me feel like
you don't trust me. I mean, that's,

1763
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:48,540
I think you're going to lose
that one. All right. But um,

1764
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:54,120
oh Jesus, I'm sorry to get back on
track here. If you fucking, you know,

1765
01:48:54,121 --> 01:48:56,490
like some serious like that where
you just like, look, you know,

1766
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:59,430
I feel like anytime you want to have sex,
I'm willing,

1767
01:49:00,090 --> 01:49:02,940
but there's a lot of times I want to
have it and you don't want to have it.

1768
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,870
And that was so now I kind of feel like
this thing that we're allegedly sharing

1769
01:49:06,871 --> 01:49:11,370
together,
you totally control and uh,

1770
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:15,390
that doesn't make me happy.
Thoughts,

1771
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:19,590
whatever you put flour the fuck you say
it. You said calmly without saying, fuck,

1772
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,660
and I'm telling you,
well, what can they do?

1773
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:27,030
They got to sit there and answer
it and I can guarantee you that'll,

1774
01:49:27,031 --> 01:49:30,270
that'll work out good for you for at
least three fucking days before it slides

1775
01:49:30,271 --> 01:49:33,210
back to normal again. It's a
never ending fight. All right?

1776
01:49:33,211 --> 01:49:35,190
But what you gotta do is
you've got to have the fights.

1777
01:49:35,490 --> 01:49:37,560
You got to have the fights
and protect your real estate.

1778
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:38,580
Or are you going to spend,

1779
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:41,400
you're going to spend your entire
time and goal line fucking d.

1780
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:47,170
That's the worst fucking relationship
you've given up so many fucking the whole

1781
01:49:47,171 --> 01:49:49,570
time.
It's fourth and goal first and goal.

1782
01:49:49,571 --> 01:49:52,840
What am I talking about first
and fucking goal, right?

1783
01:49:52,841 --> 01:49:55,750
And you just jumped off side. So it's
half the distance to the fucking go.

1784
01:49:55,751 --> 01:49:59,530
We got it built. You're in
a bad situation. All right,
that's all I'm saying. Okay.

1785
01:49:59,531 --> 01:50:02,620
That's the end of the podcast. Thank
you everybody for listening. All right,

1786
01:50:02,621 --> 01:50:03,670
here's what I got coming up.

1787
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:07,450

1789
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:14,710

and I'll get them for you.

1790

Internet. Um, that's going to be a Friday.

Really excited to see them,
