00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 The stereotype that men are smarter than women has a long history, 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.000
 But in a gender battle, who actually has superior thought when it comes to it? 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.420
 Are boys smarter than girls? 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.960
 Early studies show that male brains are larger than 8 to 13 percent in size of female brains, 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.400
 But this is due to differences in body size. 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.140
 Women's brains have more saturation or flexibility, and as a result, 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.880
 Larger cortical surface area. 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.380
 Besides, the bigger is not always the best. 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.560
 Amber whales, elephants and dolphins have larger brains than humans, 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.160
 Though smart, their cognitive abilities are less than ours 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.020
 But there are other structural differences 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.140
 Such as having more male contacts within the hemispheres 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.740
 While women have more communication between hemispheres 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.400
 But overall, MRI imaging shows a significant overlap in the physical structure of the sexes. 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.000
 After 1400 study of brains and gender comparison, 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.980
 The researchers found that most men and women show up 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.580
 A mosaic of typical structures between females and males in the brain 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.020
 The study also assessed gender stereotyping. 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.620
 Such as how video games are often considered to be male behavior while scrapbooking female behavior 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.480
 The study found that only 0.1 of the test subjects showed only the typical behavior of males and females 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.080
 IQ tests find results of similar major studies showing little intelligence 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.460
 Or there are no gender differences in general intelligence 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.220
 But women have stronger verbal abilities, while men have more powerful visual-spatial abilities. 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.460
 Interestingly, studies show more male variation in tests with their scores both worse and better. 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.940
 A meta-analysis found that one in 22 studies showed that men had an IQ of 3.3 to 5.5 higher than women 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.220
 But this study was questioned by academics who found a flawed methodology 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.280
 In the academic performance of language, mathematics and science, 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.920
 Women consistently received a better score in 70% of nations. 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.460
 But in the SAT-SAT tests in the United States, men scored 33 points higher in math and science. 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.320
 Other tests, such as the International Student Assessment Program, have shown that both sexes perform equally well 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.500
 In many countries, girls have performed better, such as Iceland, indicating cultural and environmental differences 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 And do not necessarily play biological differences 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.860
 However, research has found that stereotypes about women's performance are already affecting their success 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.600
 When it is said that a particular test in mathematics is of great importance in gender differences, 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.700
 Women performed much worse than their male counterparts. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.760
 While women who were told there was no difference, they scored the same score 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.720
 This phenomenon is known as the typical threat. 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.460
 So Google search data shows that parents 2.5 times more likely to 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.080
 To search Is my son talented? More than is my daughter talented? 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.500
 Despite 11% of girls in the gifted programs in America. 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.860
 The girls picked up this bias as early as 6 years of age. 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.620
 When the story of the fifth-year-old was told about a really intelligent person 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.000
 Both boys and girls connect intelligence with gender 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.400
 But at the age of 6 both girls and boys chose a male character as the smartest. 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.480
 In a similar experience children were asked if they wanted to play a game for people who are really smart 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.640
 Again at the age of five both sexes wanted to play the game, but before the age of six the girls decided that these games were not for them 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.240
 Although women strive to work in the fields of science, technology and mathematics, studies show they face barriers 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.620
 In the study of double blindness in the Faculty of Science from the universities of scientific research, applications for the position of Laboratory Director were classified 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.400
 What they did not know was that the request for appointment was made randomly either male or female names 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.540
 What they do not know is that requests are randomly assigned either to male or female names 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.400
 As a result, faculty members considered male applicants to be more efficient 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.740
 Are eligible for guidance, although applications with women's names are identical 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.020
 Higher male salaries have been offered from 30,000 to 26,000 for females 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.120
 Although these studies produce a realistic fact that points to increasing parallels 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.280
 Gender as decades go by and education 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.980
 Despite these barriers, women continue to contribute to our collective scientific knowledge 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.980
 Rosalind Franklin has allowed us to understand our DNA 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.860
 Katherine Johnson assisted Apollo 11 landing on the moon 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.880
 This year Maryam Mirzakhani is the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for Mathematics 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.020
 Said fellow mathematician Isabella Lappa 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.240
 Nothing persuades me just like Mirzakhani's choice that a woman is capable of doing 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.880
 Sports research at the same level as men 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.820
 I had no doubt about it in the first place 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.120
 What he does instead is that we as a society, men and women alike, have become better at encouraging 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.380
 Nurturing sports talent in women, and more capable of recognizing excellence in women's work 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.620
 To learn more we asked ASPA Women's Science to speak personally about their experiences that have grown 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.080
 Giving insight into how to navigate the societal pressures of being a woman.
