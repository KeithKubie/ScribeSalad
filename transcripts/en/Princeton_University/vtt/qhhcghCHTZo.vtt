00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.450
        
              

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.500
        WARREN POWELL: The OJ game is
        a particular exercise where      

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.840
        they form teams of five or six
        students to run an orange      

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.250
        juice products enterprise.
              

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.700
        This is where they have
        to decide how to buy      

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.040
        orange juice futures.
              

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.140
        They do contracts.
              

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.390
        They do shipping.
              

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.980
        They have to locate
        manufacturing and storage      

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.140
        facilities.
              

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.200
        They have to try to understand
        the market.      

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.580
        They have to learn how people
        respond to prices.      

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.150
        We do simulate things like
        outages due to storms from      

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.860
        time to time.
              

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.460
        And we see this regularly
        in the news.      

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.550
        A cold front will hit Florida,
        and the prices will spike.      

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.480
        But the game allows people to
        learn to not only solve      

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.700
        difficult analytic problems,
        but to also do so in teams.      

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.940
        There's an extensive evaluation
        process, students      

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.370
        write evaluations
        of each other.      

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.680
        They're told how to
        write evaluations.      

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.490
        There's even a little analytic
        write up, where they have to      

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.620
        do the mathematics of
        what they're doing.      

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.800
        But at the end of the day, it
        really boils down to how well      

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.260
        they work together, and how will
        the team leads can get      

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.290
        the most out of the talent
        on their team.      

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.420
        JUAN SAGREDO: We have different
        people that are in      

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.010
        communication with them.
              

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.700
        We have by three graduate
        serious who are in regular      

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.900
        communication on Skype,
        basically letting them know      

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.050
        when they should submit
        things, setting up on      

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.840
        what's going on.
              

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.270
        We have a person that trouble
        shoots things, and this all      

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.900
        goes on through Skype.
              

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.590
        WILL HARREL: We have a few
        different programs that we run      

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.370
        to analyze the results
        and then fill      

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.960
        out part of the sheet.
              

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.770
        And then we look through that,
        make our own human judgments,      

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.870
        make some changes, and then
        quickly fill out the sheet as      

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.480
        fast as we can.
              

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.960
        And we just 10 minutes
        to do that.      

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.840
        JACK CHING: We are usually
        waiting on the industry      

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.280
        reports to be uploaded
        by Professor Simao.      

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.960
        And that gives us a sense, but
        it's a few years after the      

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.260
        fact, so we don't really know
        how everyone else is doing      

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.960
        until at least a couple
        of runs in the future.      

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.690
        HANNAH STEELE: We kind of had
        trouble in the first run.      

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.870
        So we've been trying to get back
        to profits since then.      

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.470
        WILL HARREL: We are constantly
        watching how the      

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.620
        other teams are doing.
              

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.950
        This is definitely a very
        competitive game.      

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.150
        At the end of the game, the
        team who earned the most      

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.020
        profit over the course
        of all of the years      

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.480
        is the winning team.
              

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.970
        WARREN POWELL: Round
        of applause.      

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.460
        You guys did a great job.
              

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.300
        You cannot win this
        game by luck.      

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.050
        You have to do analysis.
              

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.100
        It's careful planning and
        execution that wins this game.      

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.180
        WILL HARREL: It was great to win
        this, and I just feel like      

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.430
        all of our efforts have been
        rewarded because we've been      

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.730
        working for, now, two or three
        months on this game, and spent      

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.510
        some late nights.
              

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.970
        And it's great just to
        see that we were      

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.220
        able to come on top.
