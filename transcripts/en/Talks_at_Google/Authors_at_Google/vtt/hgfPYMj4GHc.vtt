[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:08.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.052
CAIT FLANDERS: This
is really cool.

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:11.510
I also just have
to say it's really

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.200
neat coming from Canada--

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.060
I'm from a small island on
the west coast of Canada.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.910
So to be standing
at Google London

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.480
is kind of wild right now just
talking about my little book.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.310
So my name is Cait Flanders.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.170
Thank you to Nicola
for inviting me here.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.730
I have been a personal
finance blogger for the past--

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.180
gosh, like seven or eight
years at this point.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.550
My last job that I had
was I was managing editor

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.174
of a financial startup
for about three years,

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:44.840
and I've done a lot
of freelance writing

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.510
in the personal finance space
for other financial startups,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.180
different banks,
and stuff like that.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.190
And now I am an author, which
is pretty wild, like I said,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.990
because I'm just
from a little island

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.830
on the west coast of Canada.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.596
And now you guys are holding a
book that became a "Wall Street

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:03.970
Journal" bestseller, and every
day I'm just sort of like,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.080
what?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.440
But it's really amazing
to be here today.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.340
So I will take you a little
bit-- step backwards.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.870
Having a career in
personal finance

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.730
is something that I
never, ever set out to do.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.550
I can honestly say,
looking back on my life

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.720
and the different
interests that I've had,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.372
I never thought that
that is something

00:01:22.372 --> 00:01:24.830
I would do-- that I would be
writing about how people could

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.660
be better with money.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.280
And I say that because I have
not always been good at money.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.550
So I grew up, very fortunately,
with a family that talked

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.020
about money all the time.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.207
Actually, we say it--
it's a line in the book,

00:01:38.207 --> 00:01:38.790
but it's true.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.956
So my dad's a sailor, and
when your dad is a sailor,

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:43.160
no topic of
conversation is taboo.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.860
You basically talk
about everything.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.350
But money was the
biggest one, so I

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.127
remember things
growing up, and my dad

00:01:50.127 --> 00:01:51.710
would tell me things,
like how much he

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.980
made, how much my mom made,
what they paid for their house.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.340
And actually knowing things,
like how much stuff costs--

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.881
I remember going to
the grocery store

00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:02.300
and them actually pointing
out how much things cost.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.190
So we knew, like, OK,
for a family of five,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.260
this is what groceries cost.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.020
I remember looking at their bank
accounts, all kinds of stuff.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.970
We talked about
money all the time.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.200
My dad was also someone
who had this really--

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.280
I will say annoying
when you're 13, 14,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.490
15 years old-- habit
of every morning,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.810
he would read the newspaper.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.820
And when he would find
an article about anything

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.486
personal finance
related-- so whether it

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:28.610
was about retirement savings
accounts, real estate markets,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.847
the economy, just anything
that was going on.

00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:32.930
My dad would cut them out
and leave them on my bed

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.520
for me to read when I
got home from school.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.120
So I would walk into the
house, walk into my room,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.910
and see these, and immediately
roll my eyes and groan,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.729
and be like, I have no interest
in reading this right now--

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:45.770
and unfortunately didn't.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.740
I will say that even though my
dad talked to me about money

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.540
all the time, I still
made a lot of mistakes.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.194
And I think that's sort of just
something that happens in life.

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:56.360
We don't do everything just
the way that our parents

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.150
have hoped that we would.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.270
So I will say right now--
so I'm 32 years old.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.700
When I was 25, I was maxed out
with close to $30,000 of debt,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.400
and that was basically
just consumer debt.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.520
So it wasn't even student loans.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.470
I didn't even have a
great excuse for why

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.880
I was in that amount of debt.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.350
And if I were to switch
that into pounds--

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.641
you guys might know this stuff.

00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:22.370
I'd say it was probably
like 16,000, 17,000 pounds

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.440
of just consumer debt.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.590
And when I say maxed out,
I was truly maxed out.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.750
I had $100 left
in my bank account

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.540
and $100 left on one
of my credit cards.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.510
And I somehow had to make
that last me for six weeks.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.150
So I had no choice at
that point but to start

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.410
taking my finances seriously
and to start paying off my debt.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.540
And so I started
this little blog

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.462
that I wrote anonymously
for a long time

00:03:47.462 --> 00:03:48.920
that I thought was
just going to be

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.294
this little place
on the internet

00:03:50.294 --> 00:03:53.180
where I could document my
debt repayment journey.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.890
No one was supposed to read it.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.280
I never intended to ever have
an audience or readership

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.840
or anything like that.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.226
All I wanted to do--

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:02.600
and it was as
boring as this-- is

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.630
I would write these
weekly spending reports.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.150
So weekly spending reports
literally looked just like--

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.750
Monday, I spent
$2.91 at Starbucks.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.170
Tuesday, I spent
$2.91 at Starbucks.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.660
Maybe I spent some money on
groceries or something else.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.260
Wednesday, Thursday.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.779
That's all it was.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.400
I would post these every Sunday.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.734
There was nothing
exciting about them,

00:04:24.734 --> 00:04:26.900
but then people started
reading them and commenting.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.950
And I was like, what?

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.635
What's going on here?

00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:31.010
And then I found
this whole world

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.140
of personal finance bloggers--

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.310
a lot of people
doing the same thing.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.810
So this was 2011,
2012, a couple of years

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.060
after the kind of
financial crash.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.220
So I think everyone has
sort of finally coming

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.720
to this place of
like, OK, it's time

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.428
to really start getting
serious with what

00:04:46.428 --> 00:04:48.350
we're doing with our money.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.590
What I will say about being
maxed out at that point

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.260
is that it weighed
so heavily on me

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.420
that I became extremely
aggressive about my debt

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.530
repayment approach.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.890
So I can't say that I had the
best techniques for the way

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.600
that I paid off my debt.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.085
I also look back at it and
think that it was extremely--

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:08.240
not just aggressive.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.347
I was really hard on myself.

00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:12.680
So the things I used to say
to myself when I was in debt

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.264
was like, you're a bad person.

00:05:14.264 --> 00:05:15.680
You've screwed up
all your chances

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.870
of having a strong
financial future--

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.030
kind of like I deserve
to be punished and not

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.160
have any sort of fun
money or free money

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.470
because I had just gotten myself
into this horrible situation.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.790
And so I just deserved whatever
it took to get out of it.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.610
And I paid off my
debt in two years,

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.340
and that sounds great on paper.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.950
But the problem then was that
throughout those two years,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.440
I hadn't taken the time to
learn why I had actually gotten

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.129
into debt in the first place.

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.920
So I didn't understand
what my habits were.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.380
I didn't know actually what
I had been overspending

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.640
on all those years before.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.220
I kind of had this record
of the past two years

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.500
when I was paying off my
debt, but I didn't really

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.456
know anything about
myself as a consumer.

00:05:53.456 --> 00:05:54.830
Because just for
those two years,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.680
I was just anti-consumption,
anti-everything,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.410
which-- we can talk about
that more in the mindful

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.590
zone of that now.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.600
But I didn't know
anything about myself,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.220
so on top of being
super aggressive,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.040
being hard on myself, and
not learning anything,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.942
it's not that surprising to
me that once I was debt free,

00:06:12.942 --> 00:06:14.900
I actually just went back
to spending basically

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.280
all of my money.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.140
So there were months
when I was paying off

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.930
my debt where I would put up to
55% of my income towards debt

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.104
repayment, and that was great.

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:24.770
But again, a little
bit too aggressive--

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.890
like not quite something
that could be sustainable.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.362
Because again, I
had no fun money.

00:06:29.362 --> 00:06:31.070
I didn't allow myself
to do anything just

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.190
for pure pleasure, like the
simplest things that you enjoy.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.180
I didn't let myself
do any of it.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.830
So there were months back then--

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.710
55% of my income
going towards debt.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.380
And in the first year
that I was debt free--

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.820
and I should have been set
up to have this much more

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.260
successful financial future.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.780
I should have been able to
achieve all kinds of goals.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.530
And instead, I was saving
maybe 5% of my income.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.299
And I would write
these blog posts then

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:58.340
where I would say at the
beginning of every month

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.190
that I wanted to be
saving 20% of my income.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.030
And then at the
end of every month,

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.120
I would be like, oh,
hey, guys, remember

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.590
when I said that thing?

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.650
I actually only
saved like 3% or 5%.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.030
I think the most was about
12% in an entire year.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.020
And it's not that I
was saving nothing,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.480
but it's that writing that
down every single month

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.287
did not feel good.

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:20.870
It didn't fell good to share it
and have to tell people that I

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.352
had not achieved my goal.

00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:24.060
But also, it just
didn't feel good for me

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.601
because I knew that
I could do better

00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:27.930
and that I really wanted to.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.655
So I will tell you
about this challenge

00:07:29.655 --> 00:07:31.530
that I decided to sort
of set out for myself.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.750
But everyone upfront-- a
question is always like, oh,

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.000
why did you start doing it?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.780
What was the goal?

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.640
And I'm like, to
be honest, I think

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.280
we wish it was sort of
like a more dramatic story,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.400
or we wish that there were
some huge rock bottom moment

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.649
or something like that.

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:46.940
But I think for me, something
I've learned about myself

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.850
is that I usually
create change in my life

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.592
after I've been thinking about
it for a really long time

00:07:52.592 --> 00:07:54.050
and eventually get
to a place where

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.420
I'm just really uncomfortable
and I have to make a change.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.930
So for me, all it was
was that once a month,

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.570
for 12 months in a
row, I would think,

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.710
I can do better than this.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.650
I don't know exactly
what that looks like yet,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.630
but I'm not happy
with what I just did.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.500
I know I can do better.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.630
So what does that look like?

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.700
And then after a year of
being debt free, not that

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.950
surprisingly, I had
another money conversation

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.300
with my family.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.400
My sister, at the
time, was 20 years old.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.052
I was 29, and we're sitting
in my parents' house.

00:08:25.052 --> 00:08:26.510
We're all just kind
of hanging out,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.490
and my sister starts
telling us about how

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.770
she had just bought some camera
or something for like $500.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.130
Keep in mind, she's a full
time university student.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.360
She is working part
time, but she doesn't

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.559
have a ton of extra money.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.545
So we're all just
kind of picking at her

00:08:38.545 --> 00:08:40.970
and being like, oh, you should
save more of your money.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.391
Don't spend it all.

00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:44.390
And she goes, yeah, but
I save 20% of my income,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.460
so I can do whatever
I want with the rest.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.440
And so first of
all, I'm like, wait.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.910
What?

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.940
How has my sister figured
this out before me?

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.010
How's she saving 20% on
her part time salary,

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.730
and I can't even do that
making a decent income

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.460
at a financial startup?

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.510
OK.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.000
But then the words that
came out of my mouth

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.910
were just automatic.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.840
I didn't even think of
them before I said them.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.400
I just said to her, yeah,
but you live at home.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.700
Do you really need
80% of your income,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.352
or could you live on less?

00:09:15.352 --> 00:09:17.060
And then it was one
of those things where

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.370
I have no idea what anybody else
said for the next five minutes.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.160
And in my head, I'm like, whoa.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.230
Where did that
question come from?

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.570
Why have I never
asked myself that?

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.630
Do I need 90% or
95% of my income,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.980
or could I be living
on less than that?

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.140
And so the wheels just
started turning from there,

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.050
and within a couple of
weeks, I just sort of

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.550
wrote down these
rules for something

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.024
that I called a shopping ban.

00:09:40.024 --> 00:09:41.690
When I think about
the shopping ban now,

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.700
I sort of wish I had called it
something different because it

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.730
sounds incredibly
restrictive up front.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.850
It's like, no shopping.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.290
You can't buy anything.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.670
That's not what the goal
was, and that's not even

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.370
what that year looked like.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.590
I just sort of had
this idea that I

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.190
didn't want to buy anything
unless I absolutely needed it.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.427
And also knowing I had
never shopped like that

00:10:00.427 --> 00:10:02.510
before, I had never spent
money like that before--

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.651
waited until I actually
needed something.

00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:07.150
I used to be someone who made
a lot of preemptive purchases,

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.649
right?

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.990
You just buy things because you
think, I'll need it one day.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.370
It will help me
in that scenario.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.540
But I never waited until
I just needed the thing,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.700
and then you buy the thing.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.722
So I just wrote
these rules down,

00:10:20.722 --> 00:10:22.930
and I will say-- so there
were three different lists.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.560
The first list was the
things I was allowed to buy.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.980
So basic stuff-- you could
call it even consumables.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.890
So I was obviously
allowed to buy groceries.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.940
I could put gas in my car, buy
toiletries when you run out

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.441
of them.

00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:39.940
I'm always like, if you run out
of deodorant and toothpaste,

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.530
everyone in your life wants
you to buy more of that stuff,

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:43.900
so please buy more of it.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.890
So anything that you are using
often and run out of-- buy it.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.390
Buy more of the
stuff that you need.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.760
That's fine when
you run out of it.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.680
The things I could not buy--

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.730
that list was a lot longer.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.730
So I couldn't buy clothes,
shoes, books, magazines,

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.700
electronics, things
for around the house.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.950
And then I added take-out
coffee to that list

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.182
of things I couldn't buy.

00:11:07.182 --> 00:11:08.890
And I will say I'm
not a personal finance

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.140
writer who's like, you're
not allowed your $5 latte.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.595
I just had a $5 latte--
well, a $5 Canadian latte.

00:11:15.595 --> 00:11:17.470
So I'm not one of those
people who says that.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.329
I was just at the
point with my finances

00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:21.370
where I was no longer
comfortable with how much I

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.690
was spending on it.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.460
And I was doing it
strictly out of habit.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.040
It wasn't because I genuinely
wanted the coffee even.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.140
It's just this thing
that I did all the time,

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.700
and so I was just
still doing it.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.790
So I was like, no more
take-out coffee, either.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.430
I also created this
other short list

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.220
because I decided to do
this for an entire year.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.400
So I started trying to
look ahead a little bit

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.500
and just think of a
few things that I might

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.850
need in that upcoming year.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.370
So one was--

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.190
I had five weddings to go to,
and I'm not really someone

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.050
who dresses up in general.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.290
So I was like, I need an
outfit-- so one outfit--

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.040
a dress, shoes, or
whatever, and that will

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.530
be for all of the weddings.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.680
I knew that I had no
kind of winter boots,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.430
and actually, these
are the ones I bought.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.950
So I bought these in 2014
and just still wear them

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.170
now, which is great.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.360
And there was something
else I really wanted.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.060
It was if I could
save the money,

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.810
I really wanted to buy
a new bed that year

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.790
because my bed was 13 years old.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.100
And I think because it
was a bigger ticket item,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.180
I could never seem to save and
actually afford to replace it.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.300
It's so interesting to look
back at the psychology of that.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.040
In all my years
previous, I was so

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.037
quick to spend $20
here, $30 there,

00:12:29.037 --> 00:12:30.370
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.020
How quickly that
stuff adds up, and I

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.786
could have just had $1,000
to buy a bed back then.

00:12:34.786 --> 00:12:36.910
But anyway, so I was like,
if I can save the money,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.284
I would really
like to buy a bed.

00:12:38.284 --> 00:12:40.120
That just was important to me.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.220
So I started this challenge
on my 29th birthday.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.300
So it was July of 2014.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.850
Right up front, I
also decided to start

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.490
sort of a secondary
challenge, which again, I

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.830
still think or
wish I had a better

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.050
reason for why I started it.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.720
But I just sort of got on
that kick of de-cluttering.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.486
I definitely recognized
the fact that I'd

00:13:00.486 --> 00:13:02.110
been spending a bunch
of money on stuff

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.450
that I probably didn't really
need, wasn't even using.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.950
I could look around
my home and see

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.840
that I had more
than enough stuff,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.090
and there was so much that
I wasn't wearing anymore--

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.010
I wasn't reading it,
touching it, whatever.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.894
I just wasn't using this stuff.

00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:16.060
So at the same time that I
decided to stop shopping,

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.820
I also decided I was
going to de-clutter, which

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.440
sounds really counterintuitive.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:25.930
But it ended up being the
very weird and great challenge

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.090
to do together because
it all taught me

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.780
about becoming a more
mindful consumer in general.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.130
So I set out to do that.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.290
When I started
de-cluttering, I will say,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.390
that was the very first
thing I sort of did.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.820
Starting the shopping ban felt
easy in the first few weeks.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.750
But when I started de-cluttering
at the exact same time,

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.220
what was so
interesting about that

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.594
was that I took inventory,
which sounds so boring.

00:13:49.594 --> 00:13:51.760
But I took inventory of not
only the amount of stuff

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.330
that I got rid of but also
the things I was keeping.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.650
Now, the reason that ended
up being so important--

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.750
I was strictly doing
it for a data point.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.060
I'm so nerdy that throughout
this entire process

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.640
I was literally tracking the
percentages of how much stuff

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.440
I got rid of, how
much stuff I kept,

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.110
and it was just purely for me.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.610
It didn't matter
for anyone else.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.860
I was just super curious how the
numbers were going to add up.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.950
And so the first
couple of months, I

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.140
ended up de-cluttering
43% of my belongings

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.290
in just maybe a month
and a half, two months.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.066
And it was really easy at first,
but that list of inventory

00:14:23.066 --> 00:14:24.190
of the things that I kept--

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.898
the reason it ended
up being so important

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:29.080
was because it helped
stop me from making

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.839
a lot of impulse purchases.

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:32.380
So throughout the
shopping ban, there

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.590
were numerous times where I
did think about buying things.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.057
But then I was able to just
sort of mentally check and go,

00:14:39.057 --> 00:14:39.640
you know what?

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.580
When I started this, I actually
still owned over 50 books

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.960
that I haven't even read yet.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.014
I do not need to buy more books.

00:14:46.014 --> 00:14:48.430
And the same thing just for
toiletries, kind of the things

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.305
you have the most of.

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.280
So when people ask
me now, well, what

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.870
should I do if I was going
to start a shopping ban?

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.790
I'm like, don't even
start one, to be honest.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.040
Start by taking inventory
of the stuff you own.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.850
Because I think that alone
will help people just

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.160
stop making some of
the impulse purchases

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.660
they're more inclined to make.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.270
So I de-cluttered,
took inventory,

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.310
and then I noticed
kind of month two--

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.590
that is where the first
time things really

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.140
started to feel like they
were a little bit trickier.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.520
And when I say this--

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.860
OK, journalists keep asking
me what the hardest part was,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.040
and I'm like, to be
honest, the hardest part

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.670
was really changing habits.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.440
So the things you
do all the time.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.480
So one of the
hardest things for me

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.710
was to give up take-out coffee.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.584
And then journalists
laugh at that sometimes,

00:15:29.584 --> 00:15:32.570
like, oh, how silly.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.740
What a frivolous thing.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.660
And I'm like, no,
you don't get it.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.760
It's not about the
take-out coffee.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.460
It's that that is something
I was doing habitually

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.420
almost every single day.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.320
Which meant that every single
day, I'm then in that moment

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.370
where I'm like, oh, I
want to do this thing--

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.474
oh, but I can't.

00:15:48.474 --> 00:15:50.390
And so you have to stop
and start figuring out

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.880
what your triggers were, and
why you were thinking of doing

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.236
that, and change your reaction.

00:15:56.236 --> 00:15:58.610
Like, I had never thought of
changing my reaction before.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.690
I always just like,
when I thought

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.187
of getting take-out coffee,
I just immediately got it.

00:16:02.187 --> 00:16:03.770
So it was the first
time that I really

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.100
had to start thinking about
why I was even considering

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.870
getting take-out coffee and then
changing my reaction to that.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.080
Gosh, what was like--

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.510
so the hardest parts--

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.470
take-out coffee.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.880
Books were the next biggest one.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.939
And again, it's a habit.

00:16:17.939 --> 00:16:19.480
I used to have this
really bad habit,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.320
and it's so easy with
stuff like Amazon.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.200
You just hear of
something online,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.970
or you can hear
it from anywhere.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.580
And you immediately click over,
and you go to buy the thing.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.620
And back then, it
was like you need $25

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.765
to get the free shipping.

00:16:31.765 --> 00:16:33.890
You just add something else
that sounds kind of OK,

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.990
get your free shipping--
bing, bang, boom.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.510
I do that once a week
or once every two weeks.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.250
I do not read that many books.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.990
I really wish that I
did, but I never did.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.320
It's very rare that I
read that many books,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.470
but I did it all the time.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.870
Which meant that at least
once or twice a week,

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.630
I was kind of sitting
there being like, well,

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.570
that book sounds good.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.900
What do I do now?

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.046
And so in the
beginning, noticing

00:16:55.046 --> 00:16:57.170
that those were the two
toughest ones for me-- that

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.378
would look different for
everyone, because everyone's

00:16:59.378 --> 00:17:00.590
spending is so personal.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.110
And that's why,
again, people ask me

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.030
about shopping bans or doing
something similar all the time.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.349
And I'm like, yours is going
to look different than mine.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:08.849
And what's hard for you is going
to look different than what

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:11.599
looked hard for me, because
everyone's are different.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.970
The things that we have
habits for-- some of them

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.329
are kind of similar,
but often not.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.980
Everyone's values
are so different.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.900
So those are the toughest parts.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.230
The changing the
habit part is what

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.529
then became the most
important thing for me.

00:17:27.529 --> 00:17:28.820
Like with the take-out coffee--

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.446
pretty easy.

00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:31.070
Honestly, well, and
you guys are lucky.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.410
Like at work, it would
just be here for you.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.357
But for me, it was
like, OK, well,

00:17:35.357 --> 00:17:37.190
instead of going out
to get take-out coffee,

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.000
I just have to kind of leave
all the stuff for making coffee

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.410
on the counter at all times.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.170
If it's just there,
then you do it.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.870
And then that becomes a
habit, an enjoyable habit.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.180
I started enjoying making
coffee every morning

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.910
and almost noticing it became
this really nice routine

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.260
because I was working remotely
for the startup that I was at.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.490
And I would just enjoy
my kind of slow mornings

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.462
getting up, making the coffee,
kind of listening to a podcast

00:18:01.462 --> 00:18:03.170
or something, just
relaxing a little bit,

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.970
and then starting the day.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.610
It was so much
easier than just--

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.210
and actually, isn't that
even weird to think about?

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:09.793
I was working remotely,
and somehow it

00:18:09.793 --> 00:18:12.020
used to seem easier to get
dressed and go downstairs

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.720
to get coffee rather
than just to make coffee.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.660
But it was just a habit.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.750
So changing that
habit was easy--

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.180
or easy over time.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.280
The books one was tough.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.540
I thought about buying books
for a long, long, long time.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.542
I will say that I became very
good friends with my library.

00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:32.750
And I actually had to get
a new credit card that year

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.340
because mine had
been compromised,

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.410
and so they have to send you
a new number and all of that.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.451
Still to this day-- it's
been almost four years--

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:41.360
I do not have that credit
card number memorized.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.190
I used to know all
of them off by heart

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.320
because it was just so
easy to do online shopping.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.820
I still don't know
what that one is,

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.950
but I memorized my
library card number

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.220
within probably three
weeks of having it

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:56.120
because I used it all the time.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.890
And then another
question I get-- so aside

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.894
from my personal habits is,
how did friends deal with it?

00:19:01.894 --> 00:19:03.560
That's probably the
most common question

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.397
I get at any kind of
event that I do now.

00:19:05.397 --> 00:19:06.230
What did friends do?

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.820
What did family do?

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.300
I feel super fortunate
that my friends and family

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.060
were mostly pretty supportive--
family, definitely.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.490
I think also because
over the years, the thing

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.170
that they had watched
me do was sort

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.390
of take on these big
challenges and just do them.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.681
Like other things I'd written
about on the blog was not

00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:25.070
only paying off my
debt in two years,

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.000
but I also quit drinking
in those two years.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.166
And I'm very open and honest
about that in the book.

00:19:29.166 --> 00:19:30.680
So if you do read
it, you will find

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.260
a lot of stories about that.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.960
And I also decided to sort
of take control of my health.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.984
I lost 30 pounds.

00:19:36.984 --> 00:19:38.900
I started training for
my first half marathon.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.730
I was just doing
these big challenges.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.100
So family was just like, oh,
yeah, you'll do this thing,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.450
no problem.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.660
What was more interesting with
friends is that at first I

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.690
will say our struggle was more
just that friends didn't really

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:51.980
seem to get the point.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.410
So I would find out all my
friends had gone out for dinner

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.368
or something like that.

00:19:55.368 --> 00:19:57.020
I'm like, wait,
where was my invite?

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.220
And then they'd be all
confused and be like, well,

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.980
I thought you weren't
going to dinner.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.640
I'm like, no, I
can go to dinner.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.810
Invite me to dinner.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.150
I'm allowed to do that
if I want to do that.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.200
They're like, oh, OK.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.340
So friends seemed
confused all the time.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.590
What was more
interesting was when

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.400
I would find myself listening
to conversations with friends

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.160
where they were talking about
how much stuff they had bought,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.870
or like the deals
they had got, or where

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.400
they had bought something from.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.100
And I don't think I'd ever
realized how socially normal

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.404
it is to talk about shopping.

00:20:25.404 --> 00:20:26.820
I was really naive
when I started.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.528
I just kind of thought
no one would care,

00:20:28.528 --> 00:20:29.970
and it wouldn't be a big deal.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.190
And then this is something
I also noticed, obviously,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.360
when I quit drinking.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.885
Drinking is very
culturally normal.

00:20:34.885 --> 00:20:36.510
And so you're in a
lot of conversations

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.190
where now you're
like, OK, I'm not

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.050
part of this
conversation any more.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.150
I can't add anything to it.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.940
I can't participate in any way.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.980
And with shopping,
I just didn't think

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.975
that was going to be a thing,
but it came up all the time.

00:20:49.975 --> 00:20:52.350
And it can be as simple as,
where did you get your shoes?

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.280
Where did you get your bag?

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.360
Oh, what book are you
reading right now?

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.160
Where did you get it from?

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.250
Who did you hear about--

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.200
just anything.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.550
People talk about the stuff
that they buy all the time.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.231
And so it's not
that friends cared.

00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:04.230
It was really that it was
one of those moments--

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.390
and I think about this a lot.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.106
Especially when you're
sober, you often

00:21:08.106 --> 00:21:09.480
find yourself in
situations where

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.438
you feel like the only
sober person in the room

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:13.560
because you genuinely are.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.950
You're the only who
isn't participating.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.800
And with these conversations,
it ended up being the same.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.840
So I will say the
first six months or so

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.525
of the shopping ban were just
tough in terms of figuring out

00:21:28.525 --> 00:21:31.044
what my habits were,
how to change them,

00:21:31.044 --> 00:21:32.460
and then also
starting to question

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.320
a little bit more what
my values actually

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.736
were and the things
I actually did

00:21:35.736 --> 00:21:37.390
want to be spending money on.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:41.630
But it got a little bit
tougher about halfway through.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.409
So in the book, I
talk about it a lot,

00:21:43.409 --> 00:21:45.450
but my parents ended up
announcing that they were

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:46.852
getting divorced that year.

00:21:46.852 --> 00:21:48.810
And I think it was the
first time that I really

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.450
recognized that I was more--

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.980
I'll just say an
emotional consumer.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.480
So I think what I
realized that year

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.090
was that in the past what I
would have done was probably

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.776
drank my way through that.

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.150
I'm also pretty
honest about when

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.620
I was younger, binge
eating-- things like that.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.520
And because I didn't have
those, and now I also

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.040
didn't have spending
as an option,

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.770
I had to do the tougher
part, which is you just

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.450
have to feel the hard feelings.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.460
And that's not great
advice, sort of.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.570
People are always like,
OK, if you couldn't

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.620
do that, what did you do?

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.420
And I'm like, I cried
a lot that year.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.390
It was really not that exciting.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.420
It wasn't a great year all
around or for all parts of it,

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.734
but it was a really hard year.

00:22:24.734 --> 00:22:27.150
And I had to learn how to feel
feelings for the first time

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.960
and just get through it.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.740
So what ended up getting easier
after that was finally coming

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.869
to a place where I had a goal.

00:22:36.869 --> 00:22:38.910
I didn't have a goal,
really, when I got started.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.770
I sort of wrote these
few things down--

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.100
I want to spend less,
and I want to save more.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.520
And it was definitely just
this kind of financial journey

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.110
that I was on.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.400
But then I just thought--

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.312
and the other part
of that was that I

00:22:50.312 --> 00:22:52.770
said I wanted to also become
a more mindful consumer, which

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.150
I truly was just
kind of making up.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.110
Like, I didn't even know
what that really meant.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.776
I'm like, that sounds
like a good thing.

00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:00.300
If I could be a more mindful
consumer, that sounds great.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.290
But I didn't really
have a financial goal.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.270
So at halfway through,
I was doing pretty good.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:08.017
I was saving typically about
20% of my income every month.

00:23:08.017 --> 00:23:10.350
I was spending a bit on travel
for the first time, which

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.975
felt great because
travel was something

00:23:11.975 --> 00:23:13.081
I'd always wanted to do.

00:23:13.081 --> 00:23:14.580
But I never seemed
to have the money

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.871
to do it because I was sort
of just mindlessly spending

00:23:16.871 --> 00:23:19.090
money on whatever else.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.200
So I was spending a bit on
travel, living on much less

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.670
than I had been before.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:25.940
But then I decided--

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.810
or sort of in looking
at my finances--

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.780
realized that not only
was I living on less,

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.859
but I was also doing
a bit more freelance.

00:23:32.859 --> 00:23:34.650
To the point that I
realized I was actually

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:38.860
earning the amount of money that
I was living on at that time.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.730
So it started to become an
option to me that I could maybe

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.530
quit and either work for myself
or just figure something out.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.830
And that is a position I had
never been in and never even

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.620
imagined being in before.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.750
I had never thought to myself
that I would work for myself.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.460
I grew up with parents who
worked in the public service.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.470
And so I just--

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.390
entrepreneurship or
whatever-- it just

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.760
wasn't something I ever
aspired to or thought

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.680
would be part of my future.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.560
But once I realized that my
spending was exactly how much I

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.050
was already earning just
on the side, I'm like, OK,

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.680
there's a little bit more
motivation here to keep going.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.750
And I sort of kicked it into
high gear at that point.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.320
In the last six months, I made
this decision to quit my job.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.259
And I ended up,
on those months--

00:24:22.259 --> 00:24:22.800
I don't know.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.341
There were months
in there I probably

00:24:24.341 --> 00:24:26.760
saved up to 45% of my income.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.350
And by the end of
it had enough money

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.944
that I felt completely
comfortable quitting

00:24:30.944 --> 00:24:33.360
and knew that, even if I could
only do it for six or eight

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.370
months, I had tons of money.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.690
I had lined up a ton of work.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.517
And I had tons of
money in the bank.

00:24:38.517 --> 00:24:41.100
And that I could at least make
it work for probably six months

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.599
to a year.

00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:43.620
And that it just would
have been worth trying.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.600
And I was someone who never
took chances on myself before.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.080
When I really look back at the
kind of consumer that I was,

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.080
I used to buy things for
all the wrong reasons--

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.180
and even as a drinker, too.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.610
I wrapped so much of my
self-worth up in the wrong

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.360
things and in trying to be
someone that I actually wasn't.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.490
And in that year, I
ended up de-cluttering

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.770
70% of my belongings.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:05.520
As part of that--

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.990
I remember the
toughest part right

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.489
towards the end of
de-cluttering was

00:25:08.489 --> 00:25:11.969
realizing that everything left
over was stuff I actually used.

00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:13.510
But there were these
few items that I

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.440
had held onto that were
sort of for this more

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.894
aspirational version of myself.

00:25:18.894 --> 00:25:20.685
So I used to buy books
that I would think--

00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:23.070
I don't know, a smarter
or just more interesting

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.570
version of myself might read.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.810
Or I'd buy clothes that a more
professional or put together

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.096
version of myself might wear.

00:25:30.096 --> 00:25:31.470
Creative projects
were a big one.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:34.530
I had so many-- everything
from a DSLR camera,

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.640
to scrapbooking stuff,
to painting stuff.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.600
I had all these different
materials for creative projects

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.196
that I thought I
might do one day.

00:25:42.196 --> 00:25:44.070
But I never did any of
them, because the real

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.250
me wasn't actually
interested in any of it.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.010
And so I remember in
letting go of all of that

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.630
and sort of letting go through
that entire year of just all

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.680
the stuff that I didn't
need, I realized the things

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.310
that I actually do value and
who I really am as a person.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.270
And it became a lot easier to
start making spending decisions

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.830
once I actually knew
who I was already.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.469
So I don't want to cut it
short there, but I'm like,

00:26:08.469 --> 00:26:10.260
there's more I could
say, but I don't know.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.801
I've seen a few
faces where I'm like,

00:26:11.801 --> 00:26:15.118
are there any questions yet?

00:26:15.118 --> 00:26:15.618
Oh, no.

00:26:15.618 --> 00:26:18.490
[LAUGHS]

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:23.930
OK, well, what I will say is
that when I finished the year,

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.280
I had quit my job.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.340
I had lived on an average
of 51% of my income.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.000
I saved 31% of it.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.020
And I spent 18% on travel,
which was a lot of money.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.890
But I'd never been
able to do that before.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.710
And so even-- if we
had cut that out,

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.140
though, if I hadn't
spent anything on travel,

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.990
I would have saved
49% of my income.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.090
And a lot of that
truly just came back

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:48.110
to making more mindful
decisions every day, every week.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.530
Not that I was buying nothing.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:53.030
I also want to say, I don't
believe that buying stuff is

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.290
bad or spending money is bad.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.880
I buy things now,
and I spend money.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.599
I'm on a six-week
vacation right now.

00:26:58.599 --> 00:27:00.140
And I've bought
books since I've been

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.180
here and a few other things.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.500
I don't think it's about that.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.170
It really for me was about
getting to a place where

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.172
I could figure out who I was.

00:27:08.172 --> 00:27:10.130
And it makes spending
decisions so much easier.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.220
Because now I know when I make
a purchase it's for something

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.252
I actually need, or I really
want it in that moment.

00:27:16.252 --> 00:27:18.710
It feels really amazing to buy
a book because you genuinely

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:19.760
really want to read it.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.580
And that day you sit down and
read it in three or four hours.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.020
That feels really good.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.660
And that is something I
can't say about past me.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.680
I never knew how to do that.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.820
But yeah, I'll leave
it there for now.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.580
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.080
Oh.

00:27:39.202 --> 00:27:40.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.600
So the only part you
haven't mentioned yet

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.340
is when you decided
to write the book

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.490
and how you went from
kind of this experiment

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.155
to becoming an author.

00:27:49.155 --> 00:27:50.530
Can you talk a
little about that?

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:50.880
CAIT FLANDERS: Yeah.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.950
OK, so the question
just being about when

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.960
I decided to write the book.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.760
I don't know that
that was a decision.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.330
It was this really amazing
twist of events that happened

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.370
after I finished the year.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:07.860
So earlier that year, I had
done an interview with someone

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:08.860
at "Forbes."

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.620
And the interview was
about someone else.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.870
She was like, I know-- because
I knew kind of everyone

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:13.830
in the personal finance space.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.420
And she's like, I know that
you have a good relationship

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.410
with this person.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.750
I'm doing a profile on them.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.250
And I would really love a couple
of quotes of just what they

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:21.850
mean to the community.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.160
So we did this great interview.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.880
She got the quotes.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.380
And at the end of
it, she goes, now,

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.440
when you're done doing the
thing you're doing, let me know.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.229
We can write a profile about it.

00:28:30.229 --> 00:28:31.770
So I reached out to
her about a month

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.049
before, because I knew
the last couple months,

00:28:34.049 --> 00:28:36.090
especially, I was like,
I've got this in the bag.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.460
This shopping ban thing
is just a way of life.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.900
I'm saving as much money as
I can so I can quit my job.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.970
This is easy.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.480
So I emailed her to say,
hey, I'm almost done.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.230
I'll be done soon.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.949
Let's do the interview.

00:28:47.949 --> 00:28:49.740
And the day it came
out, which was actually

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.257
the last day of the
shopping ban, it came out.

00:28:53.257 --> 00:28:55.590
She emailed me the link that
morning and goes, just FYI,

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.650
these things have a
tendency to go viral.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.060
I'm like, what?

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.310
And within two weeks, I
had been contacted by six

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.630
different literary agents.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.579
So I never made that decision.

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.370
That was sort of
something that came after.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.720
And it's been really
interesting, because I think,

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.020
as a writer, as a creative,
you sort of struggle with--

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.980
I didn't set out to do it.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.490
But at the same time, I
was writing about something

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.380
that people were
obviously thinking about.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.600
And so publishers, literary
agents just saw that.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.180
And it just became an option.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.230
It's sort of one of
those things, too.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.750
It was like, quitting my job was
never the goal either, right?

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.990
And it just became an option.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:33.630
It was the first time where
I was really in a position

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.130
where I could take
an opportunity

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.730
and move forward with it.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.355
So it just became an option.

00:29:39.355 --> 00:29:42.442
AUDIENCE: It's so
ironic that you gave up

00:29:42.442 --> 00:29:45.476
buying books to write one.

00:29:45.476 --> 00:29:46.350
CAIT FLANDERS: It is.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.390
Although, I will say
about that, too, is--

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.830
I don't tell anyone to just
go out and buy the book.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:51.570
I'm always like--

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.460
I talk about this now.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.535
I buy books when I know
I'm going to read it.

00:29:55.535 --> 00:29:56.910
So if it feels
like something you

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.304
want to read now, then buy
it, or ask your library

00:29:59.304 --> 00:29:59.970
if they have it.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.590
I don't know how the library
system works over here.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.006
But in North America, you can
just go and ask your library

00:30:04.006 --> 00:30:05.010
to get the book.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.480
And that also helps authors.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.560
Authors-- I don't--

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.094
not maybe over here.

00:30:09.094 --> 00:30:11.010
But in North America,
authors actually-- like,

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:11.730
a small amount--

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.550
get paid out every single
time your book is checked out.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.750
So just an FYI.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.800
It's just as-- not
maybe just as good.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.630
But it all helps.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.270
It all helps.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.059
And so I'm-- yeah.

00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:22.350
I just always think about that.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:27.000
I would never go out and
tell anyone to buy any book.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.190
But, yeah, no,
the irony is real.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.420
And it is not lost on me.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:35.400
[LAUGHS]

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.250
AUDIENCE: What would you say
are some of the treats that

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:39.750
you've--

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:40.750
so you mentioned travel.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.416
But just aside from
that, what would you

00:30:42.416 --> 00:30:44.880
say that you're doing now that
you haven't done before that

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.963
is maybe a splurge or an
expense that you wouldn't

00:30:46.963 --> 00:30:49.817
have considered, like a treat?

00:30:49.817 --> 00:30:51.150
CAIT FLANDERS: Well, it's funny.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.130
The word treat-- and I talk
about this a little bit

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:53.629
in the book.

00:30:53.629 --> 00:30:55.500
The word treat or
treat yourself,

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.380
things like YOLO, all the
sort of different phrases

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.680
that are out there, the reason
I don't like them just sort

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.305
of in general--

00:31:02.305 --> 00:31:04.179
not even just that we
say them to each other.

00:31:04.179 --> 00:31:06.060
Although, part of
that that I don't like

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.789
is that I think everyone truly
wants to be saving more money.

00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:11.580
And yet, we've created
these little phrases

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.788
where we're all encouraging
each other to spend more.

00:31:13.788 --> 00:31:15.040
It's really weird.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.010
So I don't like that
word, because for me, it

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.590
makes it still feel
like it's something

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.820
I shouldn't be having.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.520
So for me, I actually believe--

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.310
I don't really have thoughts
on needs versus wants.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.740
If you really want
something, it's just a need.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.810
If it fits in your
budget, it's a need.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:35.020
So I would say
now as a consumer,

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.421
I pretty much never buy clothes.

00:31:36.421 --> 00:31:37.920
There's all these
things that I just

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.510
realized I don't care about.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.740
But I do--

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.030
I mean, I buy books.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.970
I don't buy more than I read.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:49.470
But it feels really
amazing now to--

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.230
I would say I buy more
books in bookstores.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.280
I don't buy anything
online really anymore.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.610
And that for me has come
from this place of-- it's

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.190
so much different to
walk into a bookstore,

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:02.340
really read a few pages
of it, get an actual feel

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.920
for what the book is like,
and then making the decision

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.000
to buy it.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.710
Rather than just
hearing about it,

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.150
immediately getting it online.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.920
So I probably spend more on
books because I do it that way.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.770
But I also-- it's
like, something

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.270
that's super weird-- or people
keep calling me a minimalist.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.120
I'm like, I don't even know
if I would call myself one.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.800
Because I do like
tangible stuff.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.730
I like real books.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.230
I don't really like e-books.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.629
So probably just books
still, just differently.

00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:31.170
It's just a lot different buying
them now than it used to be.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.310
AUDIENCE: One of
the things people

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:44.650
say with credit cards and
online, you mentioned,

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.551
that you don't actually track
the money you're spending.

00:32:47.551 --> 00:32:49.300
It's very easy, because
you don't actually

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.400
physically experience them.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.066
Did you use any tricks,
like paying more

00:32:52.066 --> 00:32:53.800
with cash or
something like this,

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.690
or any kind of similar things?

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.600
You mentioned going to actual
bookstores instead of online.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.760
Anything else that helps?

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.350
CAIT FLANDERS: It's funny.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.840
I love that question,
because my answer still

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.820
is not great in the sense of--

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.960
I think it's going to be
personal for everyone.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.729
So I remember trying a cash
budget years ago, actually,

00:33:11.729 --> 00:33:13.270
when I was trying
to pay off my debt.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:14.603
And it just did not work for me.

00:33:14.603 --> 00:33:16.480
Or at least the
way I was doing it.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.730
I think because I had tried
to really restrict myself.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.980
This is the amount of money
I'm allowed for two weeks.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.190
But then things genuinely
do come up in that time.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.460
You're like-- even if it's
only $20, you're like,

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.100
I actually really
need that money.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.220
What am I supposed to do now?

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.530
So cash doesn't
quite work for me.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.770
I would say now I basically
pay for everything with credit.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.720
But it comes--

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.190
I mean, that's been a cycle.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.360
When I was paying off my
debt, I never used my credit.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.122
For about a year after that,
I didn't really love using it.

00:33:46.122 --> 00:33:47.830
And then now I'm just
in a place that I'm

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.330
really comfortable
with my spending,

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.130
because I know I
won't overspend.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.270
I trust myself and look
at my spending weekly.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.080
And so I just know
that I'm doing OK.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.220
But I think it's really
personal for everyone.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.590
The one thing that I
have done for a long time

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:06.790
and still do to this day is
I actually put pen to paper

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.310
and write things down.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:10.000
So in a journal,
I will literally

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.467
write down how much I
spend everyday and on what.

00:34:13.467 --> 00:34:15.050
I don't do that quite
as much anymore.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.201
But I did it for years.

00:34:16.201 --> 00:34:18.159
Because for me, there's
something so different.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.560
It was the same way as
publishing on the blog.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.500
Knowing that I had to write
down the exact amounts

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.360
and put it out
there, I naturally

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.717
just started to spend less.

00:34:26.717 --> 00:34:28.300
Because you'd see--
oh, you know what?

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.980
It actually doesn't feel
great to be spending money

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.420
on Starbucks every single day.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.020
So maybe I'm going to cut
it down just a little bit.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.699
So I would-- I don't know.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:37.590
I'm super old school.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:39.388
I love technology
for so many things.

00:34:39.388 --> 00:34:40.929
But there's something
about spending.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.277
Writing it down by
hand, it just helped

00:34:43.277 --> 00:34:45.110
me become more mindful
of it over the years.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.470
So I guess it's been quite
a bit of trial and error

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.960
through the process.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.900
My question is more
about, is there anything

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.940
over this amount of time that--

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.192
is there one thing that you
would have done differently?

00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:13.870
Or anything that you
particularly regret around

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.220
decisions that you made?

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.020
CAIT FLANDERS: Good question.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.790
I don't know if I would
do it differently.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:23.350
I guess I actually forgot about
one story in this is that--

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:27.317
it was, I guess, four and a
bit months into the first year

00:35:27.317 --> 00:35:28.150
of the shopping ban.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.590
Because I actually
didn't even say this,

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.965
but when the first
year was over,

00:35:30.965 --> 00:35:33.490
I ended up doing it
for a second year--

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:36.160
and again, just for sort of data
points, which is super boring.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.660
But I was super
curious about things

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.640
like, how much stuff
do I actually use?

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.060
How many things of
toothpaste do I actually

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.880
use in a year, or deodorant,
or lotion, or cosmetics,

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.850
things like that?

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.250
So I will say it was a
regret in the first year.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:53.340
I sort of wished I had
kept track of all of that.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.230
And not because it's earth
shattering information.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:58.660
It doesn't even matter to
anyone else except for me.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.792
But having that information
now, tracking that for a year,

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.250
it really helped
me figure out sort

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.730
of like an semi-average female
consumer-- how much stuff

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.050
am I actually using?

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:10.180
Which then-- it just
keeps preventing me

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.190
from making impulse purchases.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.350
I know that I don't
need to go stock up

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.120
on stuff, because
it takes a long time

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.980
to actually use things up.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.510
So that was sort of a regret.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.640
But one thing that
did happen was

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.040
four or four and a half months
into it, Black Friday came up.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.770
And one of the things
that I had done

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:29.320
when I started the
shopping ban was I

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.010
unsubscribed from
basically everything.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:34.810
And I also unfollowed all
retailers on social media.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.250
So I thought I was doing great.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.810
I wasn't really getting
those emails anymore.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:39.893
I wasn't being told about
all the different things

00:36:39.893 --> 00:36:40.393
I could buy.

00:36:40.393 --> 00:36:41.643
So I thought I was doing good.

00:36:41.643 --> 00:36:43.150
And then somehow,
Black Friday, I

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.580
got an email from my
favorite bookstore.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:51.040
And I actually talked myself
into buying something.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.180
So I talked myself into it.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.469
And it was really this
exercise after that.

00:36:56.469 --> 00:36:57.760
Because it happened so quickly.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.630
And people call it
impulse purchases.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.780
And in that moment, I was like,
I've actually done this a lot

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:01.990
before.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:03.640
And it feels a lot more
like a blackout purchase,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.480
where it's so quick.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.730
And then all of a sudden you
have a confirmation email

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.354
that's like, here's
this thing you did.

00:37:08.354 --> 00:37:09.732
You're like, wait I did what?

00:37:09.732 --> 00:37:11.680
How much did I just spend?

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.279
So on Black Friday,
that happened.

00:37:14.279 --> 00:37:15.820
So all of a sudden,
I see that I have

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.600
an e-reader, a confirmation
I have bought a new e-reader.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.580
I immediately canceled
the order and then go,

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.210
what just happened?

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.690
And I realized there are
so many stories we tell

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.850
ourselves to justify something.

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:31.480
And it's not that the e-reader
would have been bad, per se.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.444
Mine was broken.

00:37:32.444 --> 00:37:34.360
So these are the stories
I was telling myself.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.350
Mine was broken.

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:36.250
It did work.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:39.670
But you had to-- you know
the reset pin, or little hole

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:41.050
you have to stick a pin in?

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.250
I had to do that every time
I wanted to turn it on.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:46.820
So I sort of had to have a
pin available at all times.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:50.500
So it sort of would
have helped me.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.850
But I didn't need it.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:53.060
I didn't actually need it.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.070
So I'm telling myself
all this stuff.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.230
And like, you haven't bought
yourself anything in so long.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.060
And you've never seen
it this low before

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.220
in price and all this stuff.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.450
It happened so quickly.

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:03.400
And then you just
make the purchase.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.770
And so I think it
wasn't a regret.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.750
Because actually
something I realized

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.150
that year was that,
past me, any time I

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.780
would have sort of screwed up
a challenge or gone off track,

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.510
old me would have been really
hard on myself and sort of just

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:19.275
shamed myself and made myself
feel really, really bad for it.

00:38:19.275 --> 00:38:20.900
And that was the
first time I was like,

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.440
I have to take this as a
learning experience instead,

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.840
figure out what just happened,
so that going forward I

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.040
can just start
changing my behavior

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.380
or becoming more cognizant.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.294
Like in that
specific example of--

00:38:31.294 --> 00:38:32.710
what are the stories
I tell myself

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.376
before thinking about
making a purchase?

00:38:39.619 --> 00:38:40.160
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.864
This is probably quite
a difficult question.

00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:44.780
But I wondered, having
gone through everything

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.140
you've gone through and thinking
about everything in the way

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.380
that you have, what are
your thoughts on how

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.110
far your behavior
in the past was

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:55.585
kind of innate human behavior?

00:38:55.585 --> 00:38:58.910
Or how much was it based on the
context we all find ourselves

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.402
in now where there's so
much stuff available?

00:39:01.402 --> 00:39:03.360
CAIT FLANDERS: No, it's
a really good question.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.920
So it's sort of two parts.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.540
Part of it is I don't know.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:12.380
Because I don't know
what my old spending was.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.300
When I got into
debt, especially,

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.610
I never tracked
spending in my life.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:18.956
I just kept seeing that
my balance was growing,

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:19.580
and I stopped--

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.739
I truly-- it was so bad.

00:39:20.739 --> 00:39:22.280
I stopped looking
at my credit cards.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.600
I just saw that the
balance was growing,

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.850
and as long as I could
make the minimum payment,

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:27.980
I felt like I was
going to be OK.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.050
And so I don't know,
honestly, what old me really

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.970
spent money on.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.639
I'm guessing there was
probably not only social--

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:36.680
influence from things like
social media, but just

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.120
generally social influence.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.910
When your friends are doing
something, you just do it, too.

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:42.769
I also know parts
of my debt came

00:39:42.769 --> 00:39:44.810
from partying too much,
or just in the sense of I

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.224
never wanted to say no.

00:39:46.224 --> 00:39:48.140
So any time some friends
asked me to hang out,

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.270
I would just say
yes, even if it meant

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.800
I was putting it on credit.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.630
So I don't know.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.390
I'm sure there's a mix
of kind of both there.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:58.315
But I do know at
the end of the day,

00:39:58.315 --> 00:40:00.440
when I look at some of the
things that I was buying

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.580
and some of the stuff
I was putting money

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.440
on-- and especially
with parting--

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.660
so much of my self-worth
was wrapped up in the fact

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.451
that I was a really
good partier and people

00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:08.980
loved partying with me.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.910
And I truly-- as soon
as I quit drinking,

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.920
I almost had an identity
crisis of just, like,

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.604
I don't even know
what I'm good at

00:40:14.604 --> 00:40:16.520
or why people would want
to be friends with me

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.710
or want to hang out with me.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:19.970
Because that was my life.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.250
My life was so revolved
around partying

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.820
that I just didn't get it.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.700
So not only in trying
to figure that out

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.991
and then de-cluttering and
looking at some of my stuff,

00:40:27.991 --> 00:40:29.720
I'm like, there's
so much stuff I used

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.040
to do for the wrong reason.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.350
I just didn't understand
who I was as a person.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.724
And in starting to just
kind of let stuff go,

00:40:36.724 --> 00:40:39.140
that was the first time I
really started to figure it out.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.910
And I'm like, the
answers were so simple.

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:42.289
I'm like, I'm a writer.

00:40:42.289 --> 00:40:42.830
I'm a reader.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.220
So I like books.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:44.959
I'm a writer.

00:40:44.959 --> 00:40:45.500
I'm a reader.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.970
I hike a lot.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.320
I'm a sister.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.140
I'm a friend.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.660
I'm a daughter.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.916
Who I am, they're actually
all pretty simple things.

00:40:53.916 --> 00:40:55.790
And so once I sort of
figured that stuff out,

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.650
it just made
spending easier now.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:59.990
But old me, I don't know.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.800
I'd say a big mix.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.090
AUDIENCE: How regiment did
you go when you first started?

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.650
Were you watching
how much water you

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.870
were using in the shower
and that sort of--

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:16.872
or is it just spending?

00:41:16.872 --> 00:41:18.080
CAIT FLANDERS: Just spending.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:18.420
AUDIENCE: Just spending.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.350
CAIT FLANDERS: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.100
No, just spending.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.246
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:41:21.246 --> 00:41:22.620
No, it's a good
question, though,

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.585
because that's sort
of a topic in general

00:41:24.585 --> 00:41:25.960
that's pretty hot
right now, too,

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.260
of extreme frugality and
the things that people

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.930
will do to sort of cut back.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.750
That, for me, has never
quite aligned with who I am

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:34.500
or what I'm about.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.600
Because like I said, I
still went to restaurants.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.562
And I bought something
if I needed it.

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:40.020
There were a few
things that year--

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.270
and I think women can
probably relate to this--

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.130
I only owned one pair of jeans.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.110
And they ripped in
the inner thigh.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.670
That only lasts for so long.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.270
You can only fix
that so many times

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:52.490
before you have to replace that.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:55.180
So no, it wasn't about
spending no money.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.820
It was really for the first
time having to ask myself

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.730
why I'm thinking of
buying something.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.559
I almost think, too--
make a visual of it.

00:42:02.559 --> 00:42:04.350
It was kind of putting
a barrier between me

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.933
and every single purchase where
you almost are hitting a pause

00:42:06.933 --> 00:42:08.910
button and asking
yourself a few questions

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:10.420
before you're doing it.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.709
So instead of just automatically
making the purchase,

00:42:12.709 --> 00:42:15.250
getting the thing, it was kind
of like hitting pause and just

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:17.309
going, huh, do I
really need this thing?

00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:18.850
What's going on in
my head right now?

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:19.560
How am I feeling?

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.000
What's going on in my life?

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.770
What influencers are
around me right now?

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:24.720
What's going on?

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.360
But yeah.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.152
SPEAKER: Any more questions?

00:42:34.152 --> 00:42:35.860
Well, thank you very
much for that, Cait.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.430
CAIT FLANDERS: Thank you.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:37.270
SPEAKER: Let's give Cait
a round of applause.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.870
Thank you.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:38.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.320
CAIT FLANDERS: Thank
you for having me.
