00:14:58.862 --> 00:15:01.454
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A TEST. 

00:16:22.026 --> 00:16:26.713
 TESTING.  
&gt;&gt; THOSE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN 

00:16:27.847 --> 00:16:33.628
DEFEATED AND YOU ARE MOVING FROM
 A PROPOSAL FOR UNLIMITED TAXING

00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:44.336
 POWER.  CONSTITUTION AUTHORIZES
 CONGRESS TO CREATE A NAVY AND

00:16:44.925 --> 00:16:48.717
 CALL INTO FEDERAL SERVICE 
WITHOUT RESTRICTION.  NOW, YOU 

00:16:49.057 --> 00:16:54.348
NEED TO COMPARE WITH THE 
ARTICLES AND UNDER THE ARTICLES,

00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:58.733
 CONGRESS CAN

00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:05.974
 REQUISITION.  NOW, YOU HAVE 
CONGRESS THAT CAN RAISE AN ARMY,

00:17:06.727 --> 00:17:13.271
 NOT ONLY DURING WARTIME, BUT 
DURING PEACETIME AND NO LIMITS 

00:17:13.272 --> 00:17:19.030
TO DURATION AND IF THEY HAVE TO 
GET A SUPER MAJORITY COMMITMENT 

00:17:19.031 --> 00:17:24.187
AND THAT'S A SHIFT OF POWER TO 
THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND AT 

00:17:24.188 --> 00:17:30.017
THE TIME, THEY FELT THAT 
STANDING ARMIES WERE VERY 

00:17:30.018 --> 00:17:38.360
DANGEROUS TO THE ENEMY AND THEY 
THOUGHT THAT CONGRESS WOULD 

00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:46.367
PRESENT DISPERSE.  AND THE 
LIMITED POWER.  AND FOURTH, 

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.625
CONGRESS HAS IMPLIED POWERS 
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND 

00:17:52.126 --> 00:17:56.157
ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION AND 
EXPRESSLY PROVIDES THAT CONGRESS

00:17:56.699 --> 00:18:02.085
 MAY ONLY EXERCISE THOSE POWERS 
THAT ARE EXPRESSLY DELEGATED AND

00:18:02.086 --> 00:18:07.487
 UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, THE 
CONSTITUTION CLEARLY AUTHORIZES 

00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:12.366
IMPLIED POWERS AND LISTED IN 

00:18:16.088 --> 00:18:21.006
ARTICLE ONE, SECTION EIGHT AND 
CONGRESS ALSO HAS THE AUTHORITY 

00:18:21.484 --> 00:18:25.314
TO PASS LAWS THAT ARE NECESSARY 
AND PROPER TO THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:18:25.992 --> 00:18:30.864
 OF THE OTHER POWERS OF THE 
GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S EXPLICIT 

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:38.803
OF THE CONGRESS IMPLIED POWERS. 
THAT WAS AN INTENSELY 

00:18:38.804 --> 00:18:44.409
PROPOSITION IN THE RATIFYING 
PROCESS AND FINALLY, THE 

00:18:45.435 --> 00:18:53.041
CONSTITUTION IMPLIES THE 
MECHANISM FOR A ENFORCEMENT OF 

00:18:53.531 --> 00:19:00.677
FEDERAL CONFEDERACY AND THE 
TREATIES WITHIN THE 

00:19:01.469 --> 00:19:03.469
CONFEDERATION 

00:19:04.692 --> 00:19:12.087
CONGRESS, BUT THE CONFEDERATION 
CONGRESS HAD NO WE WAY OF 

00:19:12.756 --> 00:19:15.913
IMPLEMENTING.  GIVING THE 
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THE 

00:19:15.914 --> 00:19:23.413
AUTHORITY ANY POWER TO VETO ANY 
STATE LAW IT FELT LIKE VETOING 

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.020
AND INSTEAD, THEY CAME UP WITH

00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:31.690
 A 3-PART PROVISION FOR 
ESTABLISHING FEDERAL SUPREMACY 

00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:39.389
AND IT IS THE FEDERAL SUPREMECY 
CAUSE IN ARTICLE SIX OF THE 

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:46.155
CONSTITUTION AND IT IS SUPREME 
OVER STATE LAW TO THE CONTRARY. 

00:19:46.156 --> 00:19:50.177
SECOND, THE CONSTITUTION CREATES
 A FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM AND 

00:19:50.178 --> 00:19:57.316
THERE WERE NONE UNDER THE 
ARTICLE.  

00:19:57.317 --> 00:20:02.537
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT 
AND CONGRESS IS AUTHORIZED, BUT 

00:20:02.538 --> 00:20:08.744
NOT REQUIRED TO CREATE THE 
FEDERAL SUPREME COURT AND YOU 

00:20:09.561 --> 00:20:11.561
HAVE THE FEDERAL

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:23.370
 JUDICIALS THAT WILL ENFORCE THE
 FEDERAL SUPREMACY AND NO STATE 

00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:29.588
SHALL MAKE ANYTHING FOR GOLD OR 
SILVER LEGAL TENDER AND STATES 

00:20:29.589 --> 00:20:35.061
SHALL NOT PROVIDE THE OBLIGATION
 OF CONTRACT AND THAT'S 

00:20:35.062 --> 00:20:39.964
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED TO THE 
PAPER MONEY LAWS AND THE DEBTOR 

00:20:39.965 --> 00:20:44.515
RELIEF LAWS AND THE MAJORITY OF 
THE STATES HAVE BEEN PASSING IN

00:20:47.929 --> 00:20:49.929
 THE

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:58.196
 MID 17 '80S AND OTHER THAN THE 
GREAT DEPRESSION AND THE 

00:20:58.197 --> 00:21:02.263
MAJORITY OF THE STATES THAT 
ENACTED THE RELIEF LEGISLATION 

00:21:02.264 --> 00:21:05.528
AND IT IS AN 

00:21:08.863 --> 00:21:12.940
OFFICIAL FORM AND THE DEBTORS 
AND THEY WANTED TO SUPPRESS THAT

00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:16.313
 THROUGH THE CONSTITUTION.  IT 
IS IMPORTANT AND WORTH TAKING 

00:21:16.314 --> 00:21:21.341
NOTE OF THE FACT THAT THE 
MAJORITY OF THE STATES HAD 

00:21:21.342 --> 00:21:24.118
PASSED THESE LAWS IN THE MID

00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:34.761
 1780'S AND HOW REPRESENTATIVE 
THE OPINION WAS IN THE COUNTRY. 

00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:40.838
 NOSE ARE THE NATIONALIST 
PROVISIONS AND LET ME TURN TO 

00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:46.786
THE ANTI-POP PEW LIST PROVISIONS
 AND ARTICLE

00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:54.241
 TEN IS AN

00:21:56.574 --> 00:21:58.574
 ANTI-POP PEW

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:27.300
 LIST  LIST LEGISLATION.  THIS 
IS RELATIVE TO THE ARTICLES AND 

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:21.439
STATE CONSTITUTION AND UNDER THE
 ARTICLES THE STATE 

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:25.495
REPRESENTATIVES SPEND ONE YEAR 
IN OFFICE AND UNDER THE STATE 

00:22:25.496 --> 00:22:27.970
CONSTITUTION AND THE LOWER HOUSE
 HAD AN

00:22:35.188 --> 00:22:40.382
HAD AN YULE TERMS IN OFFICE AND 
THE MAJORITY OF STATES HAD 

00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:45.686
GOVERNORS WHO SERVED ANNUAL 
TERMS IN OFFICE AND SOME STATE 

00:22:46.244 --> 00:22:50.484
SENATES.  AS YOU KNOW, UNDER THE
 U.S. CONSTITUTION, THE 

00:22:52.827 --> 00:22:57.643
CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES 
SERVED TWO YEARS, THE PRESIDENT 

00:22:58.894 --> 00:23:01.762
SERVED FOUR YEARS.  MOST OF THE 
DELEGATES WANTED TO GO FURTHER 

00:23:03.207 --> 00:23:10.204
IN EXTENDING THE TERM IN OFFICE.
FOUR STATE DELEGATIONS VOTED AT 

00:23:12.333 --> 00:23:16.650
ONE POINT FOR LIFETIME TENURE 
FOR THE PRESIDENT.  THAT'S A 

00:23:16.946 --> 00:23:22.845
SCARY THOUGHT FOR YOU, DONALD 
TRUMP AS A LIFETIME PRESIDENT.  

00:23:24.282 --> 00:23:29.578
HAMILTON WANTED SENATORS AND 
PRESIDENTS TO BE LIFETIME 

00:23:30.181 --> 00:23:36.313
TENURE.  HE FELT THAT WAS THE 
ONLY WAY THAT YOU COULD 

00:23:36.858 --> 00:23:42.146
ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE PROPERTY 
RIGHTS AND THEY MADE A 

00:23:42.147 --> 00:23:49.999
RADIFICATION AND THAT'S WHY THEY
 REDUCED THE TERM TO 2, 4, AND 6

00:23:50.752 --> 00:23:55.131
 YEARS.  AS YOU KNOW THE 
SENATORS WERE ELECTED FOR THE 

00:23:55.132 --> 00:23:59.297
STATE LEGISLATURES AND THAT 
REMAINED THE CASE

00:24:02.993 --> 00:24:07.133
 UNTIL 1913.  THE PRESIDENT WERE
 AND STILL ARE CHOSEN BY THE 

00:24:07.134 --> 00:24:15.069
METHODS THAT ARE CHOSEN BY THE 
STATE LEGISLATURES.  TODAY, WE 

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:22.443
ASSUME THAT WAS GENERAL 
ELECTIONS.  IT DIDN'T MATTER.  

00:24:22.444 --> 00:24:25.522
NOBODY WAS VOTING FOR PRESIDENT 
AND THEY IN

00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:33.906
 THELY -- INDEPENDENTLY 
DELIBERATED AND CHOSE THE 

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:39.788
PRESIDENT.  THE REASON FOR THAT,
 THEY DISTRUSTED THE PEOPLE TO 

00:24:40.738 --> 00:24:49.476
CHOSE THE NATION'S DELEGATE.  
QUOTING "IT WOULD IMPROPER TO 

00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:55.259
DEFER THAT CHOICE TO THE PEOPLE 
AS IT WOULD BE TO DEFER A TRIAL 

00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:03.061
OF COLORS TO A BLIND MAN".  
THINK ABOUT THAT.  THE PEOPLE 

00:25:03.062 --> 00:25:08.632
CAN'T POSSIBLY TRUSTED TO CHOOSE
 THEIR REPRESENTATIVE.  IT WOULD

00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:16.123
 BE A LIKE A BLIND MAN CHOOSING 
BETWEEN COLORS AND THE DIRECT 

00:25:17.347 --> 00:25:21.942
REPRESENTATION OF THE DIRECT 
DELEGATES AND THEY EVEN 

00:25:22.663 --> 00:25:27.463
STRUCTURED THE HOUSE, SO IT 
WOULD BE INSULATED FROM THE 

00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:31.294
POPULAR OPINION.  CREATING A 
VERY SMALL HOUSE OF 

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:40.178
REPRESENTATIVES AND THE 
INDIVIDUAL CONGRESSMAN WOULD BE 

00:25:40.766 --> 00:25:46.945
WITH CERTAIN CON STITCH WENCIES.
AND BACK AT THE TIME IT WAS

00:25:50.894 --> 00:26:00.135
 LIKE 40 OR 30,000.  YOU ARE 
TALKING ABOUT CONSTITUENCY 20 

00:26:00.136 --> 00:26:04.708
TIMES AS LARGE FOR THE HOUSE AS 
IN MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE.  

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:14.266
FAIRLY LARGE CONSTITUENCIES IN 
FAIRLY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.  THE 

00:26:14.267 --> 00:26:24.157
REASON FOR THAT IS TWOFOLD AND 
THE PEOPLE MORE AFTER FLEWENT

00:26:24.518 --> 00:26:33.218
 AND THE LARGER THE CON STITCH 
WENCY, THE LARGER THE

00:26:35.528 --> 00:26:37.528
 REPRESENTATIVE AND THE

00:26:56.907 --> 00:27:06.219
 CONSTITUENT.  AND 65 
CONSTITUENT.  AND 65 FOR THE 

00:26:50.995 --> 00:27:00.986
ENTIRE COUNTY.  THE NEXT POINT 
AMONG THE SAME DIMENSION AND 

00:27:01.487 --> 00:27:06.335
AUTHORIZING CONGRESS TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THE CONSTITUENCIES 

00:27:07.147 --> 00:27:10.508
WERE EVEN LARGER.  PROVIDING 
THAT CONGRESS CAN CHANGE THE 

00:27:11.054 --> 00:27:16.192
STATE REGULATIONS FOR THE TIME, 
PLACE, AND MANNER OF THE FEDERAL

00:27:16.193 --> 00:27:19.798
 ELECTIONS.  WHAT THEY HAD IN 
MIND WAS THAT CONGRESS COULD SAY

00:27:20.494 --> 00:27:25.504
 TO A STATE LEGISLATURE, WE 
INSIST THAT YOU ELECT YOUR 

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:31.271
CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE AT 
LARGE, RATHER THAN BY DISTRICT. 

00:27:31.871 --> 00:27:36.968
VIRGINIA WAS THE LARGEST AND THE
 MOST POWERFUL STATE AT THE TIME

00:27:36.969 --> 00:27:42.098
 OF THE FOUNDING. VIRGINIA HAD 
TEN REPRESENTATIVES AND YOU HAVE

00:27:42.912 --> 00:27:47.494
 TO ASSUME THEY HAD TO BE 
DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCIES AND

00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:59.305
 THE FLAMERS FIGURED THAT 
CONGRESS WOULD PICK TEN 

00:27:59.306 --> 00:28:04.414
CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES 
FROM THE ENTIRE STATE.  EVERY 

00:28:04.415 --> 00:28:07.880
VIRGINIAN VOTES FOR EVERY 
REPRESENTATIVE AND THAT WOULD BE

00:28:08.642 --> 00:28:15.932
 EVEN AN ENORMOUS CONSTITUENT 
AND THEY WOULD BE EVEN MORE 

00:28:15.933 --> 00:28:22.552
INSULATED FROM THE DIRECT 
SUPERVISION OF THEIR 

00:28:23.173 --> 00:28:28.143
CONSTITUENTS.  AND THE RECALL 
AND THE MANDATORY ROTATION IN 

00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:33.583
OFFICE.  EACH OF WHICH, I WILL 
ELABORATE IN A SECOND AND UNDER 

00:28:34.383 --> 00:28:39.735
THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION, 
THEY EXISTED AND THE FRAMERS 

00:28:40.124 --> 00:28:44.438
CONSCIOUSLY LEFT THEM OUT OF THE
 FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.  

00:28:44.439 --> 00:28:48.580
INSTRUCTION IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT 
IT SOUNDS LIKE AND THE MECHANISM

00:28:49.028 --> 00:28:52.605
 THAT ALLOWS THE CONSTITUENTS TO

00:28:56.529 --> 00:29:01.685
 INSTRUCT THEM HOW TO VOTE.  
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT FOR THE 

00:29:01.686 --> 00:29:07.809
MOST PART BACK THEN.  BUT A NEW 
ENGLAND TOWN MEETING COULD SAY 

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:12.223
TO ITS REPRESENTATIVE, WE WANT 
YOU TO VOTE THIS WAY ON RAISING 

00:29:13.073 --> 00:29:17.339
TAXES AND IF YOU DIDN'T WHAT 
YOUR CONSTITUENTS INSTRUCTED YOU

00:29:17.788 --> 00:29:20.633
 TO DO, YOU WOULD BE MORALLY

00:29:23.866 --> 00:29:31.494
 ABOUT  DOCTOR -- ABOUT BRIDGED 
TO RECALL YOUR SEAT.  AND AT ANY

00:29:31.495 --> 00:29:37.386
 POINT IN OFFICE, THEY WOULD BE 
RECALLED BY THEIR STATE 

00:29:37.778 --> 00:29:42.506
LEGISLATURES.  YOU CAN BE SURE 
THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURES DID 

00:29:42.507 --> 00:29:47.340
THEIR BIDDING OR IMMEDIATELY 
REMOVED FOR THE OFFICE.  THE 

00:29:47.734 --> 00:29:51.138
CONSTITUTION DOESN'T PROVIDE FOR
 THAT.  UNDER THE ARTICLES, YOU 

00:29:51.494 --> 00:29:54.747
CAN ONLY SERVE THREE OUT OF 
EVERY SIX YEARS AND AFTER

00:29:58.203 --> 00:30:05.298
 SERVING THE SIX YEARS, YOU ARE 
ROTATED OUT OF OFFICE.  AVOIDING

00:30:05.614 --> 00:30:07.614
 THE

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.379
 LEGISLATURES FROM GETTING 
EMBEDDED IN OFFICE.  THEY WANT 

00:30:16.701 --> 00:30:22.062
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT TO BE
 SUSCEPTIBLE OF THE

00:30:27.202 --> 00:30:33.959
 POPULOUS IMPULSES AND SHUT DOWN
 ANY STATE LEGISLATURE IF A 

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.929
STATE TRIES TO PASS IT GOING 
FORWARD.  THAT'S THE FIRST PART 

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:42.900
OF MY TALK.  THE SECOND PART IS 
EXPLAINING HOW 

00:30:49.133 --> 00:30:56.122
THE CONVENTION.  AND THE 
ANTI-FEDERALISTS AND THE PEOPLE 

00:30:56.123 --> 00:31:03.237
WHO OPPOSED RATIFICATION AND THE
 DEMOCRATIC AND THE ARISTOCRATIC

00:31:03.554 --> 00:31:05.554
 PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY WERE

00:31:11.655 --> 00:31:17.808
 IN  DIFFERENTLY REPRESENTED IN 
PHILADELPHIA.  HERE'S SOME 

00:31:18.431 --> 00:31:25.090
DISCREET POINTS THAT MAY ADD UP 
TO AN EXPLANATION AND I'M GOING 

00:31:25.423 --> 00:31:30.986
TO PUT MY POINTS ON THE COUNTER 
REVOLUTION AND I DON'T THINK 

00:31:31.773 --> 00:31:36.750
THAT ANYBODY HAS SUFFICIENTLY 
EXPLAINED WHY THE PHILADELPHIA 

00:31:37.577 --> 00:31:41.480
CONVENTION WAS SO 
UNREPRESENTATIVE AND HOW THEY 

00:31:41.869 --> 00:31:47.600
CONVINCED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO
 DEPRIVE THEM OF SIGNIFICANT 

00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:50.985
INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIONAL 
GOVERNMENT.  THE STATE 

00:31:51.739 --> 00:31:55.583
LEGISLATURES ELECTED THE 
DELEGATES FOR THE PHILADELPHIA 

00:31:56.292 --> 00:32:02.703
CONVENTION, EXCEPT FOR ONE.  
RHODE ISLAND DIDN'T SEND 

00:32:03.309 --> 00:32:05.309
DELEGATES TO PHILADELPHIA AND 
OTHER 

00:32:08.815 --> 00:32:15.114
STATES, THE STATES CHOSE THE 
DELEGATES.  THEY SIMPLY CHOSE 

00:32:15.115 --> 00:32:22.530
THEIR MOST EMINENT, WELL-KNOWN, 
LARGE REPUTATION CITIZENS.  IN

00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:31.066
 PENNSYLVANIA, THEY ARE GOING TO
 SEND BENJAMIN

00:32:36.303 --> 00:32:40.805
 FRANKLIN AND GEORGE WASHINGTON 
AND CHOOSING THE WELL-KNOWN, 

00:32:41.256 --> 00:32:45.596
EMINENT CITIZENS AND THE WAY 
THAT YOU WOULD REQUIRE SUCH A 

00:32:46.695 --> 00:32:50.491
REPRESENTATION IS EITHER SERVING
 FROM THE CONFEDERATION CONGRESS

00:32:50.731 --> 00:32:55.623
 AND/OR THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY. 

00:32:55.624 --> 00:33:01.625
THE MAJORITY OF DELEGATES SERVED
 IN THE CONFEDERATION CONGRESS 

00:33:01.878 --> 00:33:11.009
AND THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY.  IF 
YOU SERVED IN THE CONFEDERATION 

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:19.185
CONGRESS, YOU ARE USED TO 
THINKING IN PA ROCK KEEL TERMS 

00:33:20.176 --> 00:33:24.968
AND IN ADDITION MANY PEOPLE WHO 
SERVED IN THE REVOLUTIONARY 

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:30.535
YEARN LEARNED TO DISTRUST THE 
STATE, LIKE GEORGE WASHINGTON 

00:33:31.054 --> 00:33:37.596
AND JOHN MARSHALL AND SAW THE 
STATE OFTEN AS BEING OBSTRUCTIVE

00:33:38.492 --> 00:33:46.152
 AND REFUSING TO ANTI-UP MAN AND
 ANTI-UP MONEY AND TURNED THEM 

00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:50.736
INTO NATIONALISTS FOR LIFE.  
THEY TENDED TO BE WELL

00:33:54.040 --> 00:34:02.478
 EDUCATED, LARGE LANDOWNERS AND 
NOT HAVING A POP PEW

00:34:04.325 --> 00:34:09.988
 HIS INFLUENCE ON GOVERNMENT.  
IT HAD NO REASON TO MOBILIZE AND

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:14.398
 ADVANCE THAT AGENDA BECAUSE 
THEY HAD NO REASON TO SUSPECT 

00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:20.771
THAT'S WHAT THE PHILADELPHIA 
CONVENTION WOULD BE UP.  ENDS 

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:30.214
UP, IT WAS IN THE HEAD OF ONE 
MAN, JAMES MADISON.  HE SERVED 

00:34:30.215 --> 00:34:35.836
IN THE CONFEDERATION CONGRESS 
AND VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE AND HE 

00:34:35.837 --> 00:34:40.230
WAS WELL REGARDED AND PEOPLE 
LIKED HIM.  

00:34:40.231 --> 00:34:45.422
HE WAS NOT A FORMIDABLE SPEAKER 
AND OFTEN, THE REPORTER HAD TO 

00:34:45.423 --> 00:34:49.081
WRITE DOWN WHAT MADISON WAS 
TALKING AND HE WAS

00:34:52.506 --> 00:34:56.613
 SICKLY AND DIDN'T HAVE A BIG 
PRESENCE LIKE GEORGE WASHINGTON.

00:34:56.614 --> 00:35:04.657
  HE PLAYED A LARGE ROLE BECAUSE
 HE WAS THE BEST PREPARED MAN IN

00:35:05.907 --> 00:35:09.829
 THE ROOM.  
ALWAYS THE BEST PREPARED PERSON 

00:35:10.657 --> 00:35:14.193
IN ANY DEBATE.  MADISON SPENT 
THE MONTHS BEFORE THE 

00:35:15.063 --> 00:35:20.634
PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION 
SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZES THE 

00:35:21.982 --> 00:35:25.858
CONFEDERACY AND DIAGNOSING THE 
PROBLEMS THEY TENDED TO SUFFER 

00:35:26.135 --> 00:35:29.144
FROM AND PROPOSING SOLUTIONS.  

00:35:33.062 --> 00:35:39.720
HE QUEERED  -- COORDINATED AMONG
 HIS VIRGINIA DELEGATES AND THEY

00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:44.955
 ARRIVED A FEW HOURS EVERY DAY 
TALKING THROUGH THEIR NEW IDEAS 

00:35:45.194 --> 00:35:51.398
FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND TOGETHER,
 THESE TWO LARGE STATES, THE 

00:35:52.084 --> 00:35:57.123
THREE LARGEST STATES AT THE TIME
 WERE VIRGINIA, PENNSYLVANIA AND

00:35:57.124 --> 00:36:01.551
 MASSACHUSETTS.  THEY ARE THERE 
EARLY AND THE LARGEST STATES AND

00:36:02.015 --> 00:36:10.482
 COD NATING ON A FAIRLY 
NATIONALIST ANTI-POPULIST AGENDA

00:36:10.897 --> 00:36:15.801
 AND IT IS CALLED THE VIRGINIA 
PLAN AND IT TURNS OUT THAT 

00:36:15.802 --> 00:36:25.236
PROPOSAL WAS VERY NATIONALIST 
AND ANTI-POPULIST.  OBVIOUSLY, 

00:36:27.345 --> 00:36:30.698
WHERE YOU END UP DEPENDS ON 
WHERE YOU START AND THEY STARTED

00:36:32.012 --> 00:36:38.169
 ON A POPULIST POINT ON THE 
SPECTRUM. 

00:36:42.002 --> 00:36:48.510
 TEN DELEGATES DECIDED TO TURN 
DOWN THEIR POPULIST.  

00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:52.541
THEY BECAME LEADING 
ANTI-FEDERALISTS AND APPOINTED 

00:36:53.713 --> 00:36:58.031
TO THE PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION 
AND DIDN'T GO AND BECAME LEADING

00:36:59.766 --> 00:37:04.592
 PROPONENTS OF RATIFICATION.  IT
 IS HARD TO KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T

00:37:04.593 --> 00:37:11.271
 GO.  SOME OF WHAT THEY SAID AND
 IT IS A FAIRLY SMALL SAMPLE 

00:37:11.272 --> 00:37:19.526
SIZE AND DANGEROUS TO SPECK CUE 
LATE AND ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT

00:37:19.881 --> 00:37:25.795
 THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T GO BECAUSE 
THEY HAD LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR THE

00:37:29.157 --> 00:37:34.070
 MILDLY CONVENTION AND THEY 
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN

00:37:34.342 --> 00:37:40.553
 PHILADELPHIA WAS A FAIRLY 
REVOLUTIONARY REFORM PROJECT AND

00:37:41.014 --> 00:37:45.666
 IF THEY KNEW THAT, THEY MIGHT 
HAVE GONE TO FIGHT AGAINST IT.  

00:37:46.159 --> 00:37:50.237
BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS 
GOING TO HAPPEN, SO THEY DIDN'T 

00:37:50.564 --> 00:37:54.065
GO.  SOME DELEGATES WENT TO THE 
PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION AND 

00:37:55.267 --> 00:38:02.050
DIDN'T APPROVE TO THE 
NATIONALIST AND ANTI-POPULIST 

00:38:02.524 --> 00:38:10.824
DIRECTION AND LEFT EARLY.  
LEAVING ONLY ALEXANDER HAMILTON,

00:38:11.652 --> 00:38:13.652
 WHO WAS THE

00:38:15.295 --> 00:38:20.946
 LARGEST NATIONALIST AND 
ANTI-POPULIST OF THEM ALL.  

00:38:20.947 --> 00:38:27.264
LUTHER MARTIN WAS ONE THAT LEFT 
THE CONVENTION EARLY AND BECAME 

00:38:28.547 --> 00:38:31.347
ONE OF THE LARGEST 
ANTI-NATIONALISTS IN MARYLAND 

00:38:31.348 --> 00:38:39.192
AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY 
LEFT.  IT WAS DOING SOMETHING I 

00:38:40.641 --> 00:38:46.825
WILL HEEGITIMATE AND THEY DIDN'T
 WANT TO STAY.  YOU CAN STAY AND

00:38:47.088 --> 00:38:53.099
 FIGHT AGAINST IT AND MAKE IT 
LESS OBJECTIONABLE.  THEY CHOSE 

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.576
TO LEAVE AND THAT WAS PROBABLY A
 MISTAKE.  AND

00:39:00.303 --> 00:39:02.713
 FIFTH, THEY CLOSED THE DOORS TO
 THE PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION AND

00:39:04.695 --> 00:39:09.548
 MADISON SAID IF THEY HADN'T 
DONE THIS, THEY MAY NOT HAVE 

00:39:09.549 --> 00:39:13.603
BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH ANY 
CONSTITUTION AT ALL.  

00:39:13.604 --> 00:39:17.716
ONE OF THE REASONS FOR CLOSING 
THE DOORS IT LIMITED THE 

00:39:18.071 --> 00:39:24.466
DELEGATES TO TAKE VERY EXTREME 
ANTI-NATIONALIST POSITIONS AND 

00:39:24.905 --> 00:39:28.600
IF THEY WERE MAKING THESE 
STATEMENTS WITH THE PRESS IN THE

00:39:29.947 --> 00:39:33.216
 GALLERIES AND CLOSING THE 
CONVENTION MEANT THAT THE 

00:39:34.197 --> 00:39:39.855
ANTI-FEDERALISTS, THE PEOPLE WHO
 WERE GOING TO OPPOSE THE 

00:39:40.804 --> 00:39:45.991
CONSTITUTION WERE DEPRIVED OF 
FOUR MONTHS OF OPPOSITION.  IF 

00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:51.154
THE ANTI-FEDERALISTS WOULD HAVE 
KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON, THEY 

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:56.404
COULD HAVE STARTED IMMEDIATELY 
ORGANIZING THEIR OPPOSITION, BUT

00:39:56.683 --> 00:40:03.778
 THEY DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THE 
CONVENTION OPENED ITS DOORS.  

00:40:04.143 --> 00:40:08.463
AND THE DELEGATES MADE A MOMENT

00:40:12.942 --> 00:40:19.514
MOMENTOUS DECISION TO SEIZE THE 
CONVENTION AND MADISON IS AIRING

00:40:20.068 --> 00:40:24.252
 HIS IDEAS AND THINKING THROUGH 
HIS IDEAS ABOUT TALKING ABOUT 

00:40:24.253 --> 00:40:27.048
AND WITH THE LETTERS WITH 
WASHINGTON, THEY FIND WITH THEIR

00:40:29.934 --> 00:40:39.005
 MUTUAL SATISFACTION THEY AGREE 
IT IS NOT TEMPORAL EXPEEDENS AND

00:40:39.338 --> 00:40:44.382
 THEY WANT THE CONSTITUTION TO 
DO SOMETHING MORE.  GIVE UH P ON

00:40:44.628 --> 00:40:50.036
 THE IDEA OF INCREMENTAL REFORM 
AND DO SOMETHING MORE DRASTIC.  

00:40:50.793 --> 00:40:56.851
AND WHEN HE INTRODUCES THE PLAN 
AND GEORGE WASHINGTON IS 

00:40:58.947 --> 00:41:02.910
IMMEDIATELY MADE THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE CONVENTION AND ACCORDING 

00:41:02.911 --> 00:41:09.712
TO MADISON'S NOTES.  HE, 
RANDOLPH, WOULD NOT AS FAR AS 

00:41:10.088 --> 00:41:14.800
DEPENDENT ON HIM WOULD NOT LEAVE
 ANYTHING NECESSARY UNDONE.  THE

00:41:15.554 --> 00:41:19.891
 PRESENT MOMENT IS FAVORABLE.  
AND PROBABLY THE LAST.  THEY 

00:41:20.335 --> 00:41:25.362
WENT FOR BROKE AND TO GET THE 
TYPE OF GOVERNMENT THEY REALLY 

00:41:25.363 --> 00:41:29.049
WANTED AND THEY WERE GOING TO 
PURSUE SOME MORE

00:41:32.326 --> 00:41:35.853
 RADICAL REFORM.
THEY TRIMMED THEIR SAILS TO SOME

00:41:36.267 --> 00:41:42.194
 EXTEND TO ENSURE THE LIKELIHOOD
 OF RATIFICATION AND THEY WERE 

00:41:42.581 --> 00:41:46.693
GOING TO OVERHAUL THE 
GOVERNMENT.  HOW DID THEY GET 

00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:52.528
THIS RATIIED WHEN IT IS SO 
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT PEOPLE WERE 

00:41:52.945 --> 00:41:57.079
EXPECTING AND PROBABLY WANTING. 
IT IS A POINT OF EMPHASIS AND 

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:05.108
YOU SHOULDN'T ASSUME THIS WAS 
INEVITABLE AND IT WAS A HIGHLY 

00:42:05.371 --> 00:42:09.261
CONTINGENT SERIES OF EVENTS.  IT
 ALMOST FAILED. 

00:42:12.864 --> 00:42:16.622
 TWO STATES REJECTED THE 
RATIFICATION BEFORE CHANGING ITS

00:42:16.946 --> 00:42:24.576
 MIND.  AND THE FEDERALISTS, THE
 SUPPORTERS OF THE CONSTITUTION 

00:42:24.577 --> 00:42:30.597
HAD ARRANGED FOR THE CONVENTION 
TO BE ADJOURNED WHEN THEY SAW 

00:42:30.598 --> 00:42:36.661
THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE AND THEY
 COULD COME BACK IN A FEW MONTHS

00:42:37.089 --> 00:42:39.340
 AND FIGHT AGAIN.  IN VIRGINIA, 
THE VOTE

00:42:44.583 --> 00:42:47.971
 WAS 89-79.  AND IN 
MASSACHUSETTS IT WAS

00:42:52.923 --> 00:42:59.325
 187-168 IN FAVOR.  THOSE ARE 
THE TWO LARGEST STATES AND IF 1 

00:42:59.326 --> 00:43:06.203
OR 2 HAD REJECTION THE 
CONSTITUTION, IT WAS PROBABLE 

00:43:06.204 --> 00:43:12.765
THAT THE CONSTITUTION WOULD HAVE
 GONE INTO EFFECT.  EVEN IF

00:43:16.085 --> 00:43:19.884
 NINE STATES RATIFIED, YOU 
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT 

00:43:19.885 --> 00:43:26.236
VIRGINIA AND MASSACHUSETTS AND 
PENNSYLVANIA.  THE THREE LARGEST

00:43:26.708 --> 00:43:30.168
 STATES.  THIS IS NOT A RIGGED 
SYSTEM, NOT A SCAM, BUT IT TURNS

00:43:30.406 --> 00:43:35.592
 OUT THAT IT WAS NOT AN ENTIRELY
 FAIR FIGHT AND AN EVEN PLAYING 

00:43:35.593 --> 00:43:42.935
FIELD.  THE FEDERALISTS 
ADVANTAGE WITH MALL PROPORTION 

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:48.753
IN SOME STATES, ESPECIALLY, 
SOUTH CAROLINA.  IN SOUTH 

00:43:49.105 --> 00:43:55.896
CAROLINA AND 20% OF THE WHITE 
POPULATION AND ONLY MEN AND 

00:43:56.431 --> 00:44:00.125
THOSE THAT OWN LAND ARE 

00:44:05.016 --> 00:44:08.775
VOTING. 
AND 20% OF THE POPULATION LIVES 

00:44:08.776 --> 00:44:14.993
IN COASTAL AREAS ALONG THE 
ATLANTIC SEA BOARD AND THE 

00:44:15.614 --> 00:44:20.972
SUPPORT IS VERY STRONG IN THOSE 
AREAS AND IT ELECTS 60% OF THE 

00:44:22.043 --> 00:44:24.910
DELEGATES AT THE RATIFYING 
CONVENTION BECAUSE OF THE 

00:44:27.404 --> 00:44:33.776
MISPROPORTION.  AND PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE POLITICAL POWERS TEND TO BE

00:44:36.509 --> 00:44:39.252
 ALTRUISTIC IN NOT SHARING IT.  
A

00:44:42.857 --> 00:44:46.941
 MAR -- MAJORITY OF THE 
POPULATION OPPOSED THE 

00:44:47.884 --> 00:44:54.846
CONSTITUTION AND BECAUSE OF 
SEVERAL PROPORTION, TWO-THIRDS 

00:44:55.795 --> 00:45:02.628
OF THE VIRGINIA DELEGATES VOTED 
IN FAVOR.  90% OF AMERICANS 

00:45:02.949 --> 00:45:08.344
LIVED OUTSIDE OF CITIES IN

00:45:13.014 --> 00:45:20.062
 1877 AND 1878 AND THE 
NEWSPAPERS TENDED TO BE 

00:45:20.063 --> 00:45:24.127
OVERWHELMING SUPPORTIVE OF THE 
CONSTITUTION. 

00:45:24.128 --> 00:45:30.132
ANY FEDERALISTS HAD A HARD TIME 
EVEN GETTING THEIR ESSAYS 

00:45:30.684 --> 00:45:36.894
REPRINTED IN MANY STATES.  AND 
THE LEADING FEDERALIST IN SOUTH 

00:45:37.767 --> 00:45:40.591
CAROLINA COMPLAINED THAT THE 
WHOLE WEIGHT AND INFLUENCE OF 

00:45:40.592 --> 00:45:46.930
THE PRESS WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE
 CONSTITUTION.  ONLY 12 OF THE 

00:45:46.931 --> 00:45:52.272
90 NEWSPAPERS IN CIRCULATION IN 
THE ENTIRE COUNTY

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:04.513
 POSTED IN FAVOR OF THE 
FEDERALISTS.  IT IS LIKE TODAY, 

00:46:04.514 --> 00:46:10.145
ONLY HAVE FOX NEWS.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, IN NEW YORK, 19

00:46:13.236 --> 00:46:17.181
 OUT OF EVERY 20 VOTERS IS 
ANTICIPATING ELECTING DELEGATES 

00:46:17.182 --> 00:46:23.270
FOR THE CONVENTION, 19 OUT OF 20
 VOTED FOR A FEDERALIST DELEGATE

00:46:24.032 --> 00:46:30.856
 AND THIS HAD AN EFFECT IN WHERE
 THE ELECTIONS WERE HELD INSIDE 

00:46:30.857 --> 00:46:37.606
AND OUTSIDE OF THE STATE 
RATIFYING CONVENTION AND ALL OF 

00:46:37.607 --> 00:46:42.615
THE ELECTIONS WERE OPEN TO THE 
PUBLIC AND THAT MEAN THAT THE 

00:46:42.918 --> 00:46:47.240
GALLERIES TENDED TO BE DOMINATED
 BY SPECTATORS AND THE CITIES 

00:46:47.776 --> 00:46:53.238
TENDED TO BE DOMINATED BY THE 
FEDERALIST SPECTATORS WHO WERE 

00:46:54.427 --> 00:47:00.568
NOT SHY ABOUT VOICING THEIR 
OPINIONS.  IF THE FEDERALISTS 

00:47:00.569 --> 00:47:07.190
GOT UP TO SPEAK, THEY WOULD BE 
BOOED AND HISSED AT.  DIFFICULT 

00:47:08.304 --> 00:47:13.134
FOR ANY FEDERALIST TO GEFRN -- 
EVEN GET THEIR OPINION

00:47:17.967 --> 00:47:21.030
 VOICED.  
HOLDING OPEN HOUSES AT THEIR 

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:26.513
HOMES DURING THE DURATION OF THE
 SOUTH CAROLINA CONVENTION AND 

00:47:26.856 --> 00:47:30.682
ADJOURN TO THEIR HOMES AFTER THE
 DAY'S DELIBERATIONS WERE OVER 

00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:35.789
AND YOU CAN BE SURE THEY WERE 
WHISPERING INTO THE EAR'S OF THE

00:47:37.306 --> 00:47:41.312
 DELEGATES, THE POSITIVE AND 
GLOWING THINGS OF THE 

00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:50.078
CONSTITUTION.  FEDERALISTS JUST 
HAD AN EASIER TIME ORGANIZING 

00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:58.631
THEIR SUPPORTERS.  THIS IS AN 
ERA OF VERY RUDIMENTARY 

00:47:59.045 --> 00:48:03.522
COMMUNICATION AND THE AREAS THAT
 WERE REMOTE FROM THE COMMERCIAL

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:08.837
 CONNECTION AND REMOTE FROM THE 
ROADS, THEY TENDED TO OPPOSE THE

00:48:08.838 --> 00:48:13.225
 CONSTITUTION.  IF YOU WOULD 
ASSUME THAT THE FEDERALISTS AND 

00:48:16.446 --> 00:48:23.529
THE ANTI-FEDERALISTS ARE EQUAL 
IN NUMBER, THE FEDERALISTS HAD 

00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:29.930
AN EASIER TIME ORGANIZING THAN 
THE ANTI-FEDERALISTS.  AND THE 

00:48:31.726 --> 00:48:39.245
ELITE OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED 
RADIFICATION, THAN IN THE STATE 

00:48:39.246 --> 00:48:42.640
OF VIRGINIA.  THAT WAS A BIG 
ADVANTAGE FOR FEDERALISTS

00:48:45.872 --> 00:48:51.810
 IN THE RATIFYING CONVENTIONS 
WHEN THE 

00:48:54.912 --> 00:48:59.134
ANTI-MATERIAL -- FEDERALISTS 
WERE OPEN TO HAVING THEIR MINDS

00:50:06.525 --> 00:50:44.159
 CHANGED.  ANTI-ELITISM

00:49:30.424 --> 00:49:33.577
 225 YEARS AGO.  I'M GOING TO 
MENTION A COUPLE OF OTHER POINTS

00:49:34.121 --> 00:49:38.589
 AND THEM I'M GOING TO BE DONE 
AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS.  

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:45.622
THE GENIUS OF THE ARTICLE SEVEN 
WAS A HUGE POINT AND PUTTING THE

00:49:46.168 --> 00:49:53.001
 CONSTITUTION INTO OPERATION AND
 NO STATE COULD BIND ANY OTHER. 

00:49:57.458 --> 00:50:04.290
UNANIMOUS STATE CONSENT AND THE 
ARTICLES WERE NEVER SUCCESSFULLY

00:50:08.526 --> 00:50:13.067
 AMENDED.  THEY COULDN'T BE 
BOUND WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT, BUT

00:50:13.473 --> 00:50:17.918
 ALSO NOT PART OF THE COUNTRY, 
UNLESS THEY RATIFIED.  IT IS 

00:50:17.919 --> 00:50:23.107
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE
 IT IS PRESERVEG EVERY STATE'S 

00:50:23.108 --> 00:50:30.602
RIGHT TO GO ITS OWN WAY.  ONCE 
NINE STATES HAD RATIFIED, THE 

00:50:30.603 --> 00:50:34.910
OTHER STATES WOULD BE -- THEY 
ARE NOT IN THE COUNTRY AND YOU 

00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:41.519
HAVE A NEW COUNTRY AND THEY ARE 
NOT GUARANTEED MILITARY 

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:48.863
PROTECTION AND SUBJECT TO 
FOREIGN TRADE TAXIFICATION AND 

00:50:48.864 --> 00:50:53.964
CUT OUT THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS 
THAT WERE MADE BY THE FIRST NEW 

00:50:53.965 --> 00:50:58.453
CONGRESS AND ONCE THE NEW 
CONGRESS MET, IT IS GOING TO 

00:50:58.454 --> 00:51:02.834
HAVE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT 
DECISIONS TO MAKE.  

00:51:02.835 --> 00:51:09.125
LIKE WHERE TO PLACE THE NATIONAL
 CAPITOL AND THE ADOPTION OF THE

00:51:09.439 --> 00:51:16.295
 CONSTITUTION.  AND ONCE THE 
NINE STATES RATIFIED, THE OTHER 

00:51:16.296 --> 00:51:19.918
FOUR DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE AND 
THEY JUST MADE IT UP AT THE 

00:51:21.329 --> 00:51:25.279
PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION AND 
ENTERING INTO THE CONVENTION, 

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.800
EVERYBODY THOUGHT BECAUSE THE 
CONVENTION SAID IT, ANYTHING 

00:51:31.737 --> 00:51:38.978
PROPOSED WOULD HAVE TO BE 
APPROVED BY CONGRESS AND THEY 

00:51:38.979 --> 00:51:42.260
JUST CHANGED THE RULES AND 
THOUGHT THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH

00:51:42.618 --> 00:51:48.377
 IT, AND THEY COULD.  
ESPECIALLY, IN NEW YORK AND 

00:51:48.755 --> 00:51:51.742
VIRGINIA, WHERE ANY 

00:51:55.937 --> 00:52:00.809
ANTI-FEDERALIST MET, IT WAS NINE
 MONTHS AFTER THE PHILADELPHIA 

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:05.661
CONVENTION ENDED AND I THINK 
THEY CALCULATED IT WAS GOING THE

00:52:06.304 --> 00:52:10.944
 GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO RALLY 
THEIR SUPPORTERS. 

00:52:10.945 --> 00:52:16.960
WHAT THEY DID, THEY MADE 
THEMSELVES IRRELEVANT AND BY THE

00:52:17.227 --> 00:52:24.924
 TIME IT WAS UNDERWAY IN LATE 
JUNE.  NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS THE 

00:52:25.326 --> 00:52:31.228
NINTH STATE TO RATIFY AND THE 
VIRGINIA CONVENTION WAS THE 

00:52:31.575 --> 00:52:37.117
TENTH STATE TO RATIFY AND IT 
HUGELY CHANGED THE CALCULUS IN 

00:52:37.727 --> 00:52:42.105
NEW YORK.  WHETHER YOU LIKE THE 
CONSTITUTION OR NOT, DO YOU WANT

00:52:42.106 --> 00:52:49.304
 TO BE PART OF THE NEW NATION 
AND THE NATION'S CAPITOL IS IN 

00:52:49.305 --> 00:52:55.963
NEW YORK AND THEY WERE GOING TO 
LOSE IT IF THEY DIDN'T JOIN THE 

00:52:55.964 --> 00:53:02.824
UNION AND THEY WERE GOING TO 
LOSE HARD CURRENCY AND HAD 

00:53:02.825 --> 00:53:10.416
VIRGINIA OR NEW YORK CHOSEN TO 
GO IN A DIFFERENT FAVOR, IT 

00:53:10.417 --> 00:53:16.654
COULD HAVE INFLUENCED THE LATER 
STATES.  ONE THING I WANT TO 

00:53:16.655 --> 00:53:23.294
EMPHASIZE AND THE FEDERALISTS 
MANAGED TO DO SOMETHING ELSE AND

00:53:24.228 --> 00:53:28.262
 I LEARNED THIS WORKING ON THE 
BOOK AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY 

00:53:28.263 --> 00:53:32.627
IMPORTANT TO THEIR SUCCESS TO 
KEEP THE IMMEDIATE OPTIONS OFF 

00:53:32.628 --> 00:53:35.833
OF THE TABLE.  AND THE 
CONSTITUTION, WHICH AT LEAST, 

00:53:35.834 --> 00:53:39.867
HALF OF THE COUNTRY WAS 
SIGNIFICANTLY FLAWED.  THEY 

00:53:39.868 --> 00:53:45.934
WANTED TO DENY PEOPLE A CHOICE 
ON THE SPECTRUM SOMEWHERE IN THE

00:53:45.935 --> 00:53:49.830
 MIDDLE BETWEEN THE ARTICLES AND
 THE VASTLY MORE NATIONNATIONAL

00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:58.642
IST AND POPULIST CONSTITUTION.  
THE TWO WAYS TO ARRIVE AT AN 

00:53:58.643 --> 00:54:03.588
INTERMEDIATE SOLUTION WERE THE 
FOLLOWING PROCEDURAL MECHANISMS.

00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:11.400
  ONE WAS AMEND THE CONSTITUTION
 BEFORE IT GETS RATIFIED RATHER 

00:54:11.401 --> 00:54:17.440
THAN AFTERWARDS AND THEN, LET'S 
HOLD 

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:26.572
A SECOND CONVENTION.  ANY 
FEDERALISTS, THEY MADE GOOD 

00:54:26.876 --> 00:54:32.930
ARGUMENTS.  WHO IN THEIR RIGHT 
MIND -- PATRICK HENRY SAID THIS,

00:54:32.931 --> 00:54:38.670
 YOU HAVE TO BE A LUNATIC TO 
SIGN A CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER 

00:54:38.671 --> 00:54:43.459
PARTY WHEN THAT PARTY GETS TO 
CHANGE THE TERMS THAT YOU HAVE 

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:48.599
ALREADY AGREED TO.  THAT'S LIKE 
AGREE TOGETHER THE CONSTITUTION 

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:54.564
WITH AMENDMENTS TO COME.  YOU 
SHOULD INSIST ON SEEING THE 

00:54:54.565 --> 00:55:00.894
AMENDMENTS IN ADVANCE, WHICH 
SEEMS PRETTY REASONABLE.  AND IT

00:55:01.211 --> 00:55:06.006
 WAS UNVEILED AT A SECRET 
CONVENTION AND WE HAVE HAD A BIG

00:55:06.007 --> 00:55:12.203
 NATIONAL DEBATE AND PEOPLE HAVE
 TOLD YOU ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS 

00:55:12.204 --> 00:55:14.204
AND 

00:55:15.204 --> 00:55:24.600
NOW, LET'S VOTE FOR MORE 
DELEGATES AND GET TO A MORE 

00:55:24.601 --> 00:55:29.314
INTERMEDIATE POSITION, WHICH IS 
WHERE MOST OF THE DELEGATES WERE

00:55:29.704 --> 00:55:34.453
 AT.  THEY OPPOSED THESE 
ALTERNATIVES BECAUSE THEY 

00:55:35.174 --> 00:55:37.174
UNDERSTOOD THAT

00:55:38.442 --> 00:55:42.956
 A SECOND CONVENTION WOULD ALAW 
THEM TO PRESERVE THE CORE OF 

00:55:42.957 --> 00:55:46.717
WHAT THEY HAD DONE IN 
PHILADELPHIA.  THEY WANTED TO

00:55:49.958 --> 00:55:57.846
 ARRIVE AT WHAT MOST AMERICANS 
AGREED WITH, BUT WHAT THEY 

00:55:57.847 --> 00:56:02.800
THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR THE 
NATION'S GOOD.  RANDOLPH, THE 

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:09.888
GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA AND MADISON
 ARE CORRESPONDING.  AND MADISON

00:56:12.033 --> 00:56:19.235
 IS TOYING WITH HIS IDEAS AND 
RANDOLPH SAYS, WE SHOULD PRESENT

00:56:19.236 --> 00:56:21.236
 IT TO THE COUNTRY IN A

00:56:26.911 --> 00:56:33.281
 DISATTACHED FORM AND MADISON 
WAS HORRIFIED BY THIS.  THIS IS 

00:56:33.282 --> 00:56:40.290
WHAT MADISON SAID TO JEFFERSON 
LATER THAT YEAR." IN VIRGINIA 

00:56:40.291 --> 00:56:45.367
WHERE THE MASS OF PEOPLE ARE 
ACCUSTOMED TO BE GUIDED BY THEIR

00:56:46.931 --> 00:56:55.984
 LEADERS, THE MATTER OF WHETHER 
TO RATIFY OR NOT RATIFIED

00:56:57.785 --> 00:57:02.240
 THE CONSTITUTION SURPASSS WHAT 
MOST ARE INFORMED

00:57:05.753 --> 00:57:13.301
 ON ".  TO SUM UP IN ONE MINUTE.
  THE CONSTITUTION IS MORE POP 

00:57:13.302 --> 00:57:20.398
PEW HIS THAT WHAT MANY AMERICANS
 WANTED AND THEY BARELY GOT IT 

00:57:20.399 --> 00:57:27.775
RATIFIED AND BENEFITTING FROM 
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PROVED 

00:57:28.343 --> 00:57:32.577
ADVANTAGEOUS AND MISCALCULATIONS
 BY THEIR POLITICAL ADVERSE SAYS

00:57:33.652 --> 00:57:38.828
 AND SOME LUCK.  WHETHER YOU 
AGREE WITH WHAT THEY DID IN 

00:57:39.195 --> 00:57:44.455
PHILADELPHIA AND YOU THINK IT IS
 LEGITIMATE OR I WILL 

00:57:44.758 --> 00:57:51.163
LEGITIMATE, YOU HAVE TO STAND 
BACK WITH ADMIRATION OF WHAT 

00:57:51.164 --> 00:57:55.583
THEY ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE IT WAS
 A TYPE OF CO.  THIS IS NOT WHAT

00:57:56.357 --> 00:58:02.036
 MOST AMERICANS BARGAINED FOR.  
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.  I 

00:58:02.484 --> 00:58:06.510
CAN TAKE SOME QUESTIONS.  I 
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME WE 

00:58:50.568 --> 00:58:52.568
HAVE.  

00:59:07.615 --> 00:59:09.615
HAVE.  
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:27.365 --> 00:59:28.498
HAVE.  
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:27.365 --> 01:00:23.562
&gt;&gt; THING THAT YOU DIDN'T MENTION
 IS THE BILL OF RIGHTS, THAT 

00:58:35.234 --> 00:58:39.074
MUST HAVE PLAYED A BIG PART IN 
THE CONVENTION AND THE 

00:58:39.669 --> 00:58:44.130
RATIFICATION OR DID IT NOT?"  
&gt;&gt; THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS TACKLED

00:58:44.756 --> 00:58:47.311
 IN THE LAST 

00:58:52.031 --> 00:58:58.400
CHAPTER OF THE BOOK.
NO STATE DELEGATION SUPPORTED 

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:04.205
THEM.  THE FEDERALISTS DURING 
THE RATIFYING CONVENTION HAD TO 

00:59:04.206 --> 00:59:08.344
EXPLAIN AND DEFEND THE ABSENCE 
OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THAT'S

00:59:09.184 --> 00:59:14.653
 THE NUMBER ONE OBJECTION THERE 
IS NO BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE 

00:59:15.441 --> 00:59:20.763
PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH 
AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND SO 

00:59:22.563 --> 00:59:26.816
ON.  THE FEDERALISTS HAD 
ARGUMENTS WHY THEY THOUGHT THE 

00:59:30.736 --> 00:59:35.986
EXISTENCE OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS 
WOULD BE DANGEROUS.  IT IS NOT 

00:59:36.312 --> 00:59:41.349
CLEAR TO ME IF THEY WOULD HAVE 
OPPOSED THE BILL OF RIGHTS IF IT

00:59:42.023 --> 00:59:46.258
 WOULD HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN THE
 CONVENTION AND THEY WERE THERE

00:59:49.355 --> 00:59:55.596
 FOR TEN LONG HOT SUMMER MONTHS 
AND THE DELEGATES JUST SAID THEY

00:59:55.597 --> 00:59:58.575
 DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS. 

00:59:58.576 --> 01:00:06.514
IT TURNED OUT TO BE A PRINCIPLE 
MISTAKE AND MADISON WAS RUNNING 

01:00:06.515 --> 01:00:11.376
FOR OFFICE AND WANTED TO BE 
ELECTED TO THE FIRST CONGRESS 

01:00:11.849 --> 01:00:16.365
FROM VIRGINIA AND IT INCLUDED A 
LARGE SHARE OF THE CENTRAL 

01:00:17.085 --> 01:00:24.483
VIRGINIA BAPTISTS AND THEY HAD 
BEEN OPPRESSED AND MANY BAPTIST 

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:31.525
PREACHERS HAD BEEN THROWN IN 
JAIL FROM THE PREVIOUS DECADE.  

01:00:32.024 --> 01:00:35.635
THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY 
THERE WAS NO PROTECTION FOR 

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.693
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN THE 
CONSTITUTION.  AND MADISON WAS 

01:00:39.901 --> 01:00:45.520
RUNNING AGAINST JAMES MONROE, A 
REVOLUTIONARY WAR HERO AND THIS 

01:00:45.959 --> 01:00:51.833
WAS A DISTRICT THAT HAD BEEN 
GERRYMANDERED TO KEEP PATRICK

01:00:54.989 --> 01:00:59.533
 HENRY OUT OF THE FIRST CONGRESS
 AND NOW, HE WOULD SUPPORT A 

01:00:59.534 --> 01:01:03.159
BILL OF RIGHTS NOW THAT THE 
CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN RATIFIED 

01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:05.708
AND MADISON GETS UP IN CONGRESS

01:01:12.882 --> 01:01:18.871
 ON JUNE 8, 1879, AND SAYS I'M 
PROPOSING THE AMENDMENTS TO THE 

01:01:20.016 --> 01:01:23.503
CONGRESS.  THEY ARE NOT 
INTERESTED IN WHAT MADISON IS 

01:01:23.504 --> 01:01:28.582
PROPOSING.  THEY WANT STRUCTURAL
 CHANGES AND LIMIT THE TAXING 

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:36.516
POWERS AND THE MILITARY POWERS. 
THAT'S WHAT MADISON OFFERS, THE 

01:01:36.754 --> 01:01:42.855
RIGHT AGAINST SEARCH AND SEIZURE
 AND ROBUST, SIGNIFICANT 

01:01:43.525 --> 01:01:47.273
PROTECTIONS.  THEY WANT LIMITS 
ON NATIONAL POWER RATHER THAN 

01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:52.673
THE RIGHTS PROTECTIONS AND THE 
CONGRESS SAID TO MADISON, NOW 

01:01:52.926 --> 01:01:58.539
THAT YOU HAVE DONE YOUR DUTY, 
YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN AND BE 

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:03.578
QUIET BECAUSE WE HAVE IMPORTANT 
THINGS TO DO LIKE RAISING THE 

01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:06.208
TAXES AND WHY SHOULD

01:02:10.502 --> 01:02:15.251
 WE BE AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION
 AND MADISON PERSISTS AND MAKES 

01:02:15.534 --> 01:02:18.816
ARGUMENTS AND IF WE DON'T 
DELIVER WHAT OUR

01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:27.484
 CONSTITUENTS WERE PROMISED, 
THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO TRUST US

01:02:28.374 --> 01:02:35.009
 AND MADISON PERSISTS AND AT THE
 END OF THE DAY, HE'S ABLE TO 

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:40.751
GET CONGRESS TO APPROVE THE TEN 
AMENDMENTS AND THAT'S HOW WE GET

01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:47.075
 THE BILL OF RIGHTS.  IT IS 
FASCINATING AND NEITHER SIDE 

01:02:47.076 --> 01:02:52.836
CARES MUCH ABOUT THE RIGHTS 
PROVISIONS AND THEY THINK OF 

01:02:52.837 --> 01:02:55.011
THEM AS PARCHMENT

01:02:59.654 --> 01:03:05.367
 BARRIERS.  AND'S NOT WHAT WE 
THINK TODAY BECAUSE WE CELEBRATE

01:03:05.903 --> 01:03:11.770
 OUR BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE 
JUDGES ENFORCE THEM, BUT IN

01:03:14.782 --> 01:03:17.495
 1879, NEITHER SIDE THINKS IT IS
 IMPORTANT IN THE CONSTITUTION. 

01:03:21.459 --> 01:03:24.322
 THE ADOPTION OF THE 
CONSTITUTION AND MOST OF THE

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:35.648
 ANTI-FEDERALISTS HAD COME 
AROUND AND JAMES MADISON WAS 

01:03:35.649 --> 01:03:43.151
MORE OR LESS THE MAJORITY LEADER
 AND I WONDER IF JAMES MADISON 

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:49.878
WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS AS A 
SUCCESSFUL COO AND IF THE 

01:03:50.382 --> 01:03:53.258
ANTI-FEDERALISTS WOULD HAVE ALSO
 RETHOUGHT THE SITUATION?  

01:03:53.259 --> 01:03:59.556
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.  I 
HAVE TO BREAK IT INTO TWO PARTS 

01:04:00.511 --> 01:04:02.511
AND THE FIRST PART, WHAT 
HAPPENED TO

01:04:03.771 --> 01:04:05.771
 THE CRITICAL

01:04:09.056 --> 01:04:15.704
 CRITICISM.  AND JAMES WOOD, ONE
 OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL 

01:04:15.705 --> 01:04:23.358
POLITICAL WRITER IN THIS PERIOD,
 AND THE ANTI-FEDERALISTS DID 

01:04:23.794 --> 01:04:25.794
GIVE UP THEIR ANTI-HE

01:04:28.822 --> 01:04:34.967
 GET -- 
ANTI-LEGITIMACY DEBATE AND THIS 

01:04:35.281 --> 01:04:37.281
IS I WILL

01:04:40.413 --> 01:04:42.413
 GET

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:08.102
ATE. 

01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:42.246
ATE.  PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE 
DUBIOUS MIGHT HAVE SAID IT IS 

01:05:05.065 --> 01:05:12.360
ABOUT GREAT BRITAIN OPENED UP A 
DEMAND FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS

01:05:12.361 --> 01:05:16.852
 AND THE UNITED STATES WAS MORE 
INTERESTED IN THE LAW AND WITH 

01:05:16.853 --> 01:05:21.693
THE BOOMING ECONOMY, PEOPLE ARE 
NOT AS INTERESTED IN OBJECTING 

01:05:21.694 --> 01:05:24.860
TO THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT 

01:05:28.737 --> 01:05:32.277
EXIST.  THE CONSTITUTION QUICKLY
 PROVES THAT THE 

01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:39.175
ANTI-FEDERALISTS TYPES COULD 
MAKE THE SAME ARGUMENTS THEY 

01:05:39.176 --> 01:05:43.925
MADE AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION 
WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION.  ONE OF

01:05:44.337 --> 01:05:47.903
 THE FIRST DEBATES IS IF 
CONGRESS CAN CHARTER A NATIONAL 

01:05:48.332 --> 01:05:51.665
BANK.  
AND JAMES MADISON SAYS THERE IS 

01:05:52.106 --> 01:05:59.416
NOTHING IN THE POWER THAT ALLOWS
 THEM TO CHARTER A BANK.  AND 

01:06:00.761 --> 01:06:08.712
ALEXANDER HAMILTON SAID ON THE 
OTHER HAND, IF CONGRESS CAN 

01:06:08.713 --> 01:06:17.581
RAISE TAXES, WOULDN'T IT BE 
CONVENIENT TO HAVE A BANK.  THE 

01:06:18.038 --> 01:06:22.449
ARGUMENTS OF WHAT THE 
CONSTITUTION MEANS AND IF THE 

01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:28.026
STATE SENATE THAT APPROVED THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE PLAYS A ROLE 

01:06:30.836 --> 01:06:37.931
IN REMOVING THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE.  JAMES MADISON ATTACKS IT

01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:42.605
 AND SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT 
CAN ONLY DECLARE WAR AND NOT 

01:06:43.062 --> 01:06:47.025
PEACE.  AND IT TURNS OUT THAT 
THE ANTI-FEDERALISTS TYPE CAN GO

01:06:48.376 --> 01:06:52.251
 ON MAKING THEIR SAME STATE 
RIGHTS POPULIST

01:06:55.429 --> 01:07:01.021
 ARGUMENTS UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION AND IN THE FIRST 

01:07:01.022 --> 01:07:03.022
CIVIL WAR, THEY

01:07:04.191 --> 01:07:08.227
 DOMINATE THE GOVERNMENT.  
WHAT'S THE POINT OF ATTACKING 

01:07:08.228 --> 01:07:13.878
THE CONSTITUTION WHEN YOU CAN 
CONTROL ITS INTERPRETATION.  AND

01:07:13.879 --> 01:07:15.879
 MADISON SEEMED LIKE A

01:07:18.971 --> 01:07:20.971
 HUGE NATIONALIST IN

01:07:23.458 --> 01:07:31.809
 1787.  BY 798, MADISON IS 
ARGUING TO NULL FIE A FEDERAL 

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:37.863
LAW AND HE'S WRITING RESOLUTIONS
 FOR THE VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE 

01:07:37.864 --> 01:07:39.864
AND THAT A STATE

01:07:42.431 --> 01:07:48.521
 AUDIT COULD RATIFY THE FEDERAL 
LAW.  WHAT HAPPENED TO JAMES 

01:07:48.877 --> 01:07:54.311
MADISON?  MADISON WAS ONLY A 
NATIONALIST WHEN HE HAD IN MIND 

01:07:54.776 --> 01:07:58.888
THE STATE DEBT RELIEF AND IF THE
 STATES ARE GOING TO BE 

01:08:01.917 --> 01:08:07.541
DISTRIBUTING THE WEALTH FROM THE
 DEBTORS, THE STATES NEED TO 

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:13.861
SIGN ON TO THAT.  MADISON 
DOESN'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE A 

01:08:13.862 --> 01:08:21.626
NATIONAL BANK AND THE NATIONAL 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD SUBSIDIZE THE 

01:08:21.627 --> 01:08:27.703
STATE DEBT AND MADISON IS A 
VIRGINIA ARISTOCRAT AND THE 

01:08:27.704 --> 01:08:35.186
SOUTH VIRTUALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY
 BANKS AND NOW, TRYING TO CREATE
