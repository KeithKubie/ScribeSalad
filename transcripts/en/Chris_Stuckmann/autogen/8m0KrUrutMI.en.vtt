00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909
and it just worked for me it makes the
 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.720
and it just worked for me it makes the
film a little less impactful and overall

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730
film a little less impactful and overall
 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.970
film a little less impactful and overall
the film as a whole I can see how it

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980
the film as a whole I can see how it
 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.530
the film as a whole I can see how it
might bore some because it is

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540
might bore some because it is
 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.539
might bore some because it is
