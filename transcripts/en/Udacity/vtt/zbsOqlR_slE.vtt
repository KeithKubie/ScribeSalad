00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.590
So it turns out that the formula
of a square is the same thing

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.480
as the formula of
the area of a rectangle.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.770
A square is just a special case
in the realm of rectangles

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.040
because in the case of a square w = l.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.180
Try calculating the area
of these rectangles.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.460
Note that they are not drawn to scale.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.640
Enter your answers in the boxes.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.849
