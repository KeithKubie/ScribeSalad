00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:02.279
- [Voiceover] Part b,
on what open intervals

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:04.724
contained in negative three is
less than x is less than four

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:08.927
is the graph of f both
concave down and decreasing?

00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:11.110
Give a reason for your answer.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.606
All right, so f and this should be both

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:16.172
concave down and decreasing.

00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:19.181
So f concave down,

00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:21.596
concave down.

00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:25.173
That's going to be true if and only if

00:00:25.173 --> 00:00:29.230
the second derivative
of f is less than zero

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.380
which is true if and only if

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.796
f prime is decreasing,

00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:38.536
f prime is decreasing.

00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:41.220
So that's how we can tell
when f is concave down.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.902
I wanna see what do I
need to observe of f prime

00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:45.678
because that's the graph they gave us.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:50.055
All right, now for f to be decreasing,

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:52.566
f is going to be decreasing

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.983
if and only if,

00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:55.805
we are decreasing when
you have a negative slope

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.443
if your relative change is negative.

00:00:57.443 --> 00:01:01.204
So that's true if and only if f prime of x

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:03.062
is less than zero.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:05.186
So both true.

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:08.119
Both true

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.137
when

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:13.485
f prime of x is less than zero

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:15.632
and decreasing,

00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:19.001
and, let me write, and
f prime is decreasing.

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.682
And f prime, decreasing.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.567
So let's see if we can identify that.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.343
Well, let's go back to our graph

00:01:26.343 --> 00:01:29.060
and see when is f prime
of x less than zero

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.591
and decreasing.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.507
So if we look at less than zero,

00:01:33.507 --> 00:01:34.964
let me highlight this,

00:01:34.964 --> 00:01:36.062
so less than zero.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:39.707
I'm highlighting it in
magenta right over here.

00:01:39.707 --> 00:01:43.783
This is all the places
where we are less than zero

00:01:43.783 --> 00:01:45.849
in magenta.

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.686
And now of that, where are we decreasing?

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:53.237
Well, we are decreasing over
this interval right over here.

00:01:53.237 --> 00:01:56.627
So that would be negative
two is less than x

00:01:56.627 --> 00:02:00.226
which is less than negative one.

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:02.258
So that's we're decreasing

00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:03.762
of the places where we are negative.

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:06.084
I'm taking the subset
of where we are negative

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:07.640
to think what we're decreasing.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.882
We're decreasing right there.

00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:10.984
And we are also decreasing,

00:02:10.984 --> 00:02:13.285
we are also decreasing

00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:14.736
right over there.

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:19.043
So that is one is less than
x which is less than three.

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:22.735
Now we are decreasing before x
equals negative two over here

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:24.616
but we're not less than zero there

00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:26.021
so I'm not gonna include that.

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:28.018
And so we have our intervals.

00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:29.817
So our open intervals.

00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:34.375
So we have both true for when
these two things are true.

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:37.591
And so this happens.

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.327
This happens

00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.806
when

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:47.073
negative two is less than
x is less than negative one

00:02:47.073 --> 00:02:50.517
or one is less than x

00:02:50.517 --> 00:02:53.268
is less than three.

00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:55.672
So those are two open intervals.

00:02:55.672 --> 00:02:56.751
This one

00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:58.710
and that one.
