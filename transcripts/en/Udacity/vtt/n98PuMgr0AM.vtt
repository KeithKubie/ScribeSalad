In the last lesson, we saw that some things can grow and decay exponentially.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.854
We explored things like this with functions of the form y equals a to the x and

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:13.376
y equals a to the negative x. But, exponential functions can also be multiplied

00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:17.430
by constants, just like we saw with different forms of interest. For a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.590
continuously compounded interest for example, we looked at the equation a A

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.443
equals P times e to the rt. Where P is the amount of money invested, the

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:29.981
principal, r is the rate of interest per year written as a decimal, and t is

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:35.649
the time in years that the money's been invested for. Another example of a

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.736
function that fits this form is the way that bacteria die off when a drug is

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:45.166
administered. In this case, P represents the initial amount of what we're

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:49.134
starting with, which this time is the number of bacteria, r this time is the

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:53.102
decay rate of how quickly the bacteria die off, and t here is the time period

00:00:53.102 --> 00:01:01.030
we're considering measured in hours. So for example, if the starting number of

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.400
bacteria is 1,000 and the rate at which they decay or die off is negative 0.5.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.810
What is the function B of t for the number of bacteria alive after t hours?

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.299
