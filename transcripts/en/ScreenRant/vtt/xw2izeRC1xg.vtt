00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.480
Star Wars has been a force in pop culture
for nearly 40 years in just about every kind

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.480
of medium imaginable.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.790
Thanks to movies, TV shows, books, and comics,
fans have plenty of materials to follow their

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.840
favorite characters.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.230
With all the stories out there, some of the
more imaginative fans have conjured up some

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.230
wild theories about the galaxy far, far away.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.600
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Movie Theories
That Completely Change Star Wars Films.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.679
Darth Jar-Jar

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.650
Jar-Jar Binks is perhaps the most reviled
character in the saga, but does he deserve

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.270
more respect than he gets?

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.800
Some – probably jokingly – have theorized
that Jar-Jar is the evil mastermind behind

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.860
everything that happens in the movies, using
his outward appearance as a ruse to mislead

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.140
those around him – similar to Yoda in Empire
Strikes Back.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.930
Apparently, Jar-Jar was a co-conspirator with
Palpatine and manipulated events so that the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.100
Sith rose to power and took over the galaxy.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.769
This is amusing to consider, but there’s
no way we’ll know for sure.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:03.180
Jar-Jar will never be heard from again.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.629
Supreme Leader Plagueis

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.360
All Star Wars fans are trying to figure out
the true identity of Supreme Leader Snoke,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.910
one of the new villains shown in The Force
Awakens.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.399
The most popular belief is that Snoke is actually
Darth Plagueis, the Sith Master who taught

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.170
Palpatine the ways of the Dark Side.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.590
Palpatine mentioned in Episode 3 that Plagueis
had the ability to create life and cheat death,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.870
so even if Plagueis was “killed” by Palpatine,
he could still possibly return.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.530
And Snoke’s scarred physical appearance
indicates that he’s been through a lot,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.380
perhaps injuries from Palpatine’s betrayal
all those years ago.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.340
The answers should be coming soon.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.840
Rey Skywalker

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.590
Moviegoers don’t learn the parentage of
Force Awakens protagonist Rey, so all the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.770
theories popularized before the film’s release
still hold water.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.772
The most prevalent is that she is the child
of Luke Skywalker, keeping in line with the

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:49.579
idea that the saga is the Skywalker family
story.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.859
In Episode 7, Rey is shown to be adept at
flying, and she picks up on her Force abilities

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:54.990
rather quickly.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.520
This is similar to some of the other Skywalkers
shown in the film, Luke and Anakin.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.020
And besides, Rey seems too important for her
parents to be “nobody,” right?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.530
Palpatine is the Father

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.030
All we know about Anakin’s birth is that
there apparently was no father, and it was

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.940
a miracle.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.790
As the prequel trilogy progresses, George
Lucas sheds a little more light on the concept.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.440
When telling Anakin the story of Plagueis,
Palpatine mentions that Plagueis could use

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.610
the Force to influence midi-chlorians and
create life.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.390
His facial expression when making that revelation
implies that Palpatine learned this trick

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.760
from his master, and for some reason decided
to give life to Anakin.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.860
Things are still muddy, but this is a little
better than Anakin just showing up out of

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.190
nowhere and it gives the series another layer
of intrigue.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.000
Boba Fett Killed Luke’s Family

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.160
Obi-Wan mentions that Imperial stormtroopers
are precise with their shots, but Star Wars

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.480
fans are well aware that isn’t the case.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.340
It’s believed that stormtroopers are the
ones who kill Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru when

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.870
looking for the droids, but the execution
doesn’t line up with the ineptitude that’s

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.800
on display throughout the series.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.050
Who could have done it?

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.050
Boba Fett.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.500
Not only was the bounty hunter on Tatooine
during the film’s events, in Empire, Vader

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.940
specifically instructs him to not disintegrate
his prey.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.520
Perhaps Vader contacted the bounty hunter
and put him on the job.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.520
Luke’s Hiding Place

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.000
It doesn’t make sense that Obi-Wan would
hide Luke on Tatooine, which was also Vader’s

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
home planet.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.590
But a theory proposes there’s a method to
Kenobi’s madness – Tatooine was the last

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.240
place Anakin would look for his son.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.840
Anakin had several bad memories on the planet,
including watching his mother die.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.140
Not only that, Episode II unfortunately shares
Anakin’s not-so-fond thoughts about sand,

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.510
which Tatooine is full of.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.520
Looking to distance himself from his prior
life, Vader may not have even considered Tatooine

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.410
due to a desire to forget about the world
entirely as he learns about the Dark Side.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.150
It makes sense, from a certain point of view.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.030
Han Solo: Jedi Knight?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.440
When Han first meets Luke and Obi-Wan, he
makes it clear he doesn’t believe in the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.910
Force and mocks the “hokey religion.”

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.030
But what if he subconsciously could access
its power?

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.130
Some fans think Han is secretly Force sensitive,
since many of his actions in the original

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.490
trilogy – like flying through an asteroid
field – seem a little too fortunate to just

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.490
be good luck.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.960
Plus, when Han dismisses the Force, Obi-Wan
makes a smug expression, hinting that he may

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.299
sense something in the smuggler.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.250
If only Han had realized his full potential,
the Galactic Civil War could have ended much

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.450
sooner.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.669
Chewie and R2: Rebel Spies

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.860
What if two side characters were working together
to ensure everything fell into place?

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.130
One theory suggests that Chewie and R2-D2
were Rebel spies, solving some of the plot

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.379
holes their inclusion in the prequels creates.

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:41.129
In Episode 3, Chewie is seen fighting alongside
with Yoda, who later would ask him to go to

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.449
Tatooine to look after Luke.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.431
That explains why Chewie conveniently bumps
into Obi-Wan at Mos Eisley when he’s looking

00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:47.710
for a ride off planet.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.710
As for R2?

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.219
He convinced the Republic to not wipe his
memory so they’d still have access to his

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:53.219
intel.

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:54.219
He just kept that fact from C-3PO.

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.909
Qui-Gon, Lord of the Sith

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.500
Qui-Gon Jinn is shown to be a Jedi Master,
but perhaps he had some nefarious plans.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.400
Some fans think he was a Sith in disguise
and plotted to overthrow the Jedi.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.120
Qui-Gon is a maverick, who typically defies
the Jedi Council’s recommendations.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.380
This extends to his feelings on young Anakin,
who he pushes to be trained despite concerns

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.500
about the fear and anger Anakin’s feeling.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.870
Knowing that the boy was too old to begin
training, Qui-Gon thought that Anakin could

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.400
grow powerful with the Dark Side and throw
the Jedi into chaos.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.430
It’s interesting, but it seems pretty diabolical
when Qui-Gon could just turn to the Dark Side.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.800
Tarkin Is Snoke?!

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.669
Everyone has a theory about who Snoke is,
and we have a wild one of our own.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:36.919
Could Snoke be Tarkin?

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.870
It's a stretch, but there's evidence to support
it.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.689
Snoke has extensive knowledge of the rise
and fall of the Galactic Empire, Palpatine

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:43.689
and Vader.

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.550
In addition, he's never a confirmed Force
user, despite being Kylo Ren's master.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.879
If Snoke was an ancient Sith or powerful Force
user, shouldn't Kylo be able to control it

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:52.879
better?

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.930
Time will tell if we're right, but it's a
fun thought for now until we learn more.
