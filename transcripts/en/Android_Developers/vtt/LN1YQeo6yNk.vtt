00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.230
BEN FRENKEL: I'm Ben Frankel,
product manager on the Google

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.680
Play Instant team,
and I focus on games.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.430
Today, we have Jam City,
King, and Zynga with us

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.920
to talk about
Google Play Instant.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.200
But before we get
started, I'm going

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.740
to provide you some context
for the panel discussion.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.210
So last year at I/O, we
launched Instant Apps.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.660
And since then, we've
been pretty busy.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.550
We've enabled Instant Apps
on over 1 billion devices,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.830
and we've made major
improvements to our tooling

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.930
and Android studio.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.410
And most recently, at the game
developer conference in March,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.700
we announced that Instant Apps
was finally coming to games.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.850
And this week, we were
excited to announce

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.260
that Google Play Instant is
now available to all game

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.330
developers.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.150
Now, let's take a look at
Google Play Instant in action.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.635
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:08.120
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:29.491
- Divine!

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:39.950
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.150
BEN FRENKEL: So King's
Candy Crush team just

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.760
launched that app
this past Tuesday,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.700
and you can check it out
on the Play Store today.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.340
So just think about
that for a second.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.800
That's Candy Crush,
one of the most,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.870
if not the most successful
mobile games ever coming

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.030
to Google Play Instant.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.070
And what gets partners
like King excited

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.940
is the vision that
bringing instant to games

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.699
can transform game discovery.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.710
And we know that
this is possible

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.610
because we have seen
this movie before.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.240
Whenever media becomes
instant, consumption goes up.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.600
Speed is a huge
competitive advantage.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.960
We've seen this with
streaming music and movies.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.770
And before that, Google proved
the transformative impact

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.460
of speed with instant search.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.030
And we want to do the
same thing for games

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.530
because we believe that instant
will do the same thing for you,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.220
the game developer.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.310
Imagine users trying more
games, exploring more genres,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.990
and ultimately finding more
games they love to play.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.750
That would have a transformative
impact on your business.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.630
And over the course of
our early access program,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.640
the data has proven
this theory out.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.700
Today, the most visible
entry point to an Instant App

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.010
is the Try Now button,
as you can see here.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.440
And with just the
Try Now button,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.620
partners are already
seeing an up to 20%

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.040
increase in user acquisitions.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.320
Again, that impact is
from Try Now alone,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.040
which just scratches the surface
of the overall Google Play

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.536
Instant opportunity.

00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:29.910
People will also
be able discover

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.720
your games through ads,
through the Play Games app,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.140
through social invites, and
banners, and collections

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.260
on the Play Store.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.830
And today, we're announcing
that Instant Apps is coming soon

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.750
to preregistration.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.420
Soon, players that
preregister can also

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.990
get a sneak preview
of your game.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.370
And when you promote
preregistration

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.330
through social media,
email, or your website,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.390
users can instantly play that
game from any Android device.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.012
It's an awesome way to introduce
your game to the world.

00:04:09.012 --> 00:04:10.720
And as you look at
what our partners have

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.310
done with the discovery services
that I just described, and you

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.089
hear about what they're excited
about doing in the future,

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.510
you'll start to see how
important a role Google Play

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.740
Instant can play throughout
the lifecycle of a game.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.250
From the pre-launch phase,
when your goal is to make your

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.850
launch as big as possible,
to build the hype machine

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.070
around your game.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.900
And once you've
had that big launch

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.910
and you've acquired
a bunch of users,

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.590
you want your game to go viral.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.740
You want your players to invite
their friends to the party,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.050
so to speak.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.330
And after your game has
been around for a while,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.610
your goals end up changing.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.750
Your focus then turns to
retaining your existing players

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.350
and bringing back those
that may have churned.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.250
At each stage, the
right instant experience

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.330
can play an integral
growing your game's success.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.580
And there are three types
of instant experiences

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.240
among the many, many that
we saw among our partners.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.930
It was very difficult to
choose just these three.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.610
But I wanted to highlight
these three today for you.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.960
The first is the minigame.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.550
A minigame is often
a gaming experience

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.250
that is complimentary
to the full game

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.200
and is a great fit
for preregistration.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.970
Danceville's minigame here
lets you choreograph a routine

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.490
by manipulating the
individual limbs

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.120
on this awesome-looking
character here.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.360
And once you are done, you
can share an animated GIF

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.070
with all of your friends.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.890
It offers endless
combinations of moves

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.250
and plenty of entertainment
to occupy players

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.990
all the way through to the
eventual launch of the game.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.310
The second is what I'm calling
the core gameplay preview.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.930
And the goal of
this archetype is

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.910
to provide a glimpse
of what players

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.790
will experience
after the tutorial

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.590
and introductory levels.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.080
This is a great game and a great
type for different experiences

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.060
that have a deep upgrade
system, for example,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.640
such as Zombie Gunship
Revenant, like you can see here.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.046
In this example, the
installed app at the top

00:06:24.046 --> 00:06:26.170
typically starts you off
with just a single weapon.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.610
It's not unusual to let people
slowly acclimate to new game

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.150
mechanics and so forth.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.600
So you start off with
a single machine gun,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.420
and the zombie horde
that's arriving up there

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.064
is arriving at a
relatively modest pace.

00:06:42.064 --> 00:06:44.230
Contrast this with the
instant experience, which you

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.100
can see down here on the left.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.520
In this one, you don't
just get one machine gun,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.800
but you get two machine guns.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:00.610
You get a high-power sniper
rifle and hellfire missiles.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.590
The whole experience is intended
to get your adrenaline pumping,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.440
and is a great fit for Try
Now for ads and other user

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.280
acquisition channels.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.900
And if you're focused on
bringing back churned users,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.890
the game highlights pattern
might be the right fit for you.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.310
The Candy Crush experience
is a great example of this.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.950
To build their Instant
App, the Candy Crush team

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.610
selected five levels
from the more than 3,000

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.450
available in the full game,
starting with level 16

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.900
going all the way
up to level 590.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.470
And each was selected to
highlight a unique combination

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.210
of game mechanics.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.910
I really like playing level
590, which you can see here.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.780
There's a conveyor belt that
perpetually moves candies

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.710
around.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.824
And there is this really
fascinating portal right

00:07:51.824 --> 00:07:53.990
in the middle of it, which
you can't see right now--

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.910
you can maybe see there now--

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.170
and through which candies
magically disappear.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.090
The goal of this
type of experience

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.670
is to provide a
glimpse of what you've

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.370
been missing out on since
the last time you played.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.920
And it's very effective.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.920
So now that you have
a sense of the role

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.620
Google Play Instant can play
throughout the lifecycle

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.570
of a game, let's
turn our attention

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.240
to how you build these
types of experiences.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.290
And just like we want to make
it as easy as possible for users

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.900
to start playing
your games, we also

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.770
want to make it easier for
you, the game developer,

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.200
to build these experiences.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.960
And we've made a substantial
investment in this area.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.870
First, we've adapted
the Instant App

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.419
framework to better suit
the unique needs of game

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:42.440
developers.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.650
There are three changes that
we made to the framework.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.480
We raised the size
limit to 10 megabytes,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.810
we enabled the
progressive download

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.840
of assets and executable
code, and very importantly,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.230
we integrated with game
engines and added support

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.110
for native code and OpenGL.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.480
And that last point
is vitally important

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.240
because it means you
can use the same code

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.930
base as your full game to
build your Instant App.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.390
And by integrating with
game engines like Unity,

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.090
we've made it possible
to build with the tools

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.800
that you're already
familiar with.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.070
To make this possible
for Unity developers--

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.010
possibly many of you in
the audience here today--

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.800
we have to work closely with the
world's most widely-used game

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.540
engine, Unity.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.980
Through this close
collaboration,

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.860
millions of Unity
developers will

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.650
be able to optimize their
current and future games

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.390
for Google Play Instant.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.280
And to that end, we've built
the Google Play Instant Unity

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.420
plug-in.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.880
The plug-in simplifies building
and deploying an Instant App

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.850
all from within the
Unity IDE, and it will be

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.920
available in the coming weeks.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.780
And if you're a Unity
developer and you

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.460
want to start building an
Instant experience today,

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.510
I recommend you join
our Unity beta program.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.910
And you can sign up at
this link here in the lower

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.662
left-hand corner.

00:10:01.662 --> 00:10:03.120
And I'll review
this at the end too

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.920
so you don't have to immediately
break out your photos

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.110
and take a picture.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.550
And if you sign up today, you'll
get the latest news and access

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.900
to beta features.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.910
We're also excited to
announce that Cocos

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:21.020
has added instant support
to their IDE, Cocos Creator.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.420
And they've gone
beyond supporting

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.090
Google Play Instant
as a build target

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.450
by adding tools that simplify
the process of building

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.040
and an Instant App.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.930
Cocos has added two
steps to their standard

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.400
build process just for this
purpose, record and refactor

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.180
steps.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.130
On the recording step,
you play your game

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.970
in the Cocos simulator, which
tracks which assets are used

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.380
and when.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.600
And then in the
refactor step, you

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.240
use a visual nonlinear
editing-style

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.660
tool to define the boundaries
of your instant experience.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.960
And assets are broken
down by category,

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.410
as you can see here, to
support further optimizations.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:07.670
Cocos has made an alpha build
available for the adventurous

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.830
to try, and you can
check it out today.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.800
With that, now that
I've set the context,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.400
let's bring our
esteemed panel up

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.400
on the stage to talk
about their vision for

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.540
and experience
with Instant Apps.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.646
So folks, come on up.

00:11:24.646 --> 00:11:27.086
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:36.890
Thank you.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.130
So why don't we kick
things off with each

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.590
of you introducing
yourselves, talking bit

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.800
about your background
and any other thoughts

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.880
you think might be
interesting for the crowd?

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.296
MARCELO FERREIRO:
Hello, everyone.

00:11:48.296 --> 00:11:49.600
I'm Marcelo Ferreiro.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.050
I'm a director of
engineering at Jam City.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:58.070
And we were in charge of
creating the Google Play

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:02.770
Instant experience
for Panda Pop game.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.380
OLIVIA YU: Hi, I'm Olivia Yu,
vice president of Platform

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.970
Partnerships at King.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.450
And we created two Google
Play Instant experiences,

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.360
one with Bubble Witch 3,
and then just recently,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.435
earlier this week on Tuesday,
with Candy Crush Saga.

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:18.310
KYLE RUSHTON: Hello, my
name is Kyle Rushton.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.070
I'm a senior director of product
management at Zynga, where I've

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.480
been for the last six years.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.970
And I work at Zynga on our
central product management

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.730
team, and I worked in both
the Zynga Solitaire and Words

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.545
With Friends 2 Google
Play Instant experiences.

00:12:30.545 --> 00:12:31.420
BEN FRENKEL: Awesome.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.890
Thank you for that.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:37.520
So first question,
how do you see

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.000
instant and instant experiences
impacting the overall gaming

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.310
landscape?

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:47.150
MARCELO FERREIRO: So the
mobile gaming landscape,

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.210
it's more competitive
than ever at this moment.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:58.810
And we see Google Play Instant
as a very valuable tool

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.270
for developers to acquire
new users into their games.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.719
So I think that's a
great [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:05.760
BEN FRENKEL: Makes sense.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.426
OLIVIA YU: Yeah.

00:13:06.426 --> 00:13:10.397
So at King, I think we think it
can completely change the way

00:13:10.397 --> 00:13:11.480
that games are discovered.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.940
So there's a ton of different
untapped opportunities

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.920
that we're looking
into, whether it's

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.720
advertising, cross-promotion
in our games,

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.080
social, so there's a bunch
of different opportunities

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.760
that we haven't even looked
at for Google Play Instant.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.770
So there's a lot of
untapped potential.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.770
KYLE RUSHTON: Yes, so I
think in the short term,

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.050
when thinking about
app store discovery,

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.530
we'll ultimately see more
consumers trying games, which

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.280
will ultimately lead to more
installs and longer and better

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.240
engagement.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.640
But thinking longer
term, I think

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.960
it will allow
developers to reshape

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.296
the way they think about
discovery in the first place,

00:13:44.296 --> 00:13:46.670
and allows us to think outside
the box about how we bring

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.030
our experiences to consumers
in ways that are outside

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.480
of traditional app store.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.470
BEN FRENKEL: Awesome.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.000
So couple other questions
here for you guys.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.060
What instant use cases have
you tried, and what use cases

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.210
are you most excited about?

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.380
MARCELO FERREIRO: So for us,
we built the first 10 levels

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.250
of the game for users to play.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.630
And then they are
able to carry over

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.830
their progress into the full
app when they install it.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.720
So it's more like the core
gameplay that you made.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.660
And in the future,
we see that we're

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:38.150
going to explore
probably sharing

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.950
the game with your friends.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.900
BEN FRENKEL: Right.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.270
So this would be like a
social invite use case.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.560
MARCELO FERREIRO: Yes, yes.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.415
Now that Facebook, it's--

00:14:50.415 --> 00:14:51.290
BEN FRENKEL: Got you.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.130
MARCELO FERREIRO: Yeah.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.010
BEN FRENKEL: Olivia?

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.620
OLIVIA YU: So I think
I mentioned earlier,

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.990
I think we're pretty excited
about all the different use

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.010
cases, probably specifically on
the performance marketing side

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.540
once it's available.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.339
And then also for our
side, also cross-promotion.

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:08.380
It's really important, as
you brought up earlier.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.360
We have a ton of lapse
players on Candy Crush Saga,

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.760
so it's a great way for
us to bring players back,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.330
for them to see
everything that's

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.830
happened with the game, all the
new features, and for people

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.130
to remember about
the game again.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.585
So I think those are
the main use cases

00:15:23.585 --> 00:15:24.710
we're pretty excited about.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.354
And social as well,
as Marcelo mentioned.

00:15:27.354 --> 00:15:29.020
BEN FRENKEL: Seems
to be a common theme.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:29.510
OLIVIA YU: Yes.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.301
KYLE RUSHTON: Yeah.

00:15:30.301 --> 00:15:33.050
So to date, we've been focused
primarily or almost exclusively

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.290
on Try Now, and trying
to optimize conversion

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.580
funnel through app store.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.440
I think what I'm most excited
about, and perhaps is--

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.564
we've already said social
a few times, a little bit

00:15:41.564 --> 00:15:43.100
part of my Zynga DNA as well--

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.920
is absolutely social
invites and social sharing.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.350
I think on native--

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.574
driving virality
and social growth

00:15:51.574 --> 00:15:53.990
has always been challenging,
because on the recipient side

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.406
of that experience,
there's always

00:15:55.406 --> 00:15:57.694
a lot of friction for a
user receiving an invite

00:15:57.694 --> 00:16:00.110
to think about what they've
received, go to the app store,

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.930
download the app, install
the app, and then ultimately

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.970
potentially play
through [INAUDIBLE],,

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.250
and then find out what
their friend was actually

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.976
trying to share with them.

00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:11.030
But in a world of instant
where you can just

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.610
share that experience,
perhaps play a move in Words

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.292
With Friends, share
it with your friend

00:16:15.292 --> 00:16:17.000
and they immediately
open the game board,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.458
is really transformative
in the way

00:16:18.458 --> 00:16:20.420
we would think about
discovery and sharing

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.422
an app in the first place.

00:16:22.422 --> 00:16:23.380
BEN FRENKEL: Excellent.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.360
So a common theme
here, social good.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.860
And there's lots of
other opportunities

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.520
as well I'd love to
hear thoughts on.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.070
But all the things that you've
implemented so far, what's

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.070
been the impact you've seen?

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.230
And what do you
anticipate in the future

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:43.870
from the next project that you
do with Google Play Instant?

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.860
MARCELO FERREIRO: Well,
I think social will be

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.770
really important in that sense.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:58.350
Being able to just click and
being able to play the game.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.010
That's going to be
really important.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:04.839
It removes the friction
of the installation, which

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:09.930
is where people actually
are eager to play the game,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.760
and they probably need
to wait 10, 15, 20

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.319
seconds to download it.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:19.040
And being able to take
advantage of that eagerness,

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.482
and I think that's going to be
really important in the future.

00:17:23.482 --> 00:17:24.440
BEN FRENKEL: Thank you.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.106
OLIVIA YU: Yeah.

00:17:25.106 --> 00:17:28.270
So from our side, we
actually see a lot of users,

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.734
like a high intent to install.

00:17:29.734 --> 00:17:31.150
And then we've
actually seen a lot

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.190
of users who played the
instant game actually

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.280
go to install Bubble Witch
3 or Candy Crush Saga,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.525
so that's what we're
really excited about.

00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:40.150
And then I think
there's different ways

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:45.370
to continue to optimize the
funnel from instant to actually

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.039
installing the game.

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:47.830
KYLE RUSHTON: Yeah.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.320
So we've been really encouraged
by the level of engagement

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.441
we've seen with the
Try Now experience,

00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:54.940
and the demand we're seeing
from the consumer side of people

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.398
really being interested just
to check something out and not

00:17:57.398 --> 00:18:00.670
necessarily download
the full experience.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.550
But our focus has
been purely on driving

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.690
installs and conversion.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.560
I think looking forward, in
addition to moving forward

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.600
that experience, we'll
also look to drive

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.810
things like re-engagement
and re-activations

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.210
and other core metrics that
are part of the experience

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.960
beyond just optimization
of the installation funnel.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.000
BEN FRENKEL: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.030
So we've heard from
you what you've

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.460
done, what the impact has been.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.730
But let's shift the
conversation to talking about

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.860
how you build the
instant app, and how you

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.420
design an instant experience.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.050
So let's start off
with you, Olivia.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:43.670
What factors do you think make
for a great instant experience?

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.910
OLIVIA YU: I think, for us,
it was really important--

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.451
you're pretty much
playing instantly,

00:18:47.451 --> 00:18:49.480
and to make sure
that the player feels

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.910
like they're in pretty much
the experience right away.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.180
And we really picked, as you'd
shown earlier, really exciting

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:55.680
levels.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.210
So we wanted to make sure we
had really great, exciting,

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.197
and engaging levels for
the user to experience.

00:19:01.197 --> 00:19:02.780
So that was, for us,
really important.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.155
That's why we've selected
certain levels, as you can see.

00:19:05.155 --> 00:19:07.330
So certain levels
have certain boosters,

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.070
certain features
to make sure it's

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.440
really different for every
level that they experience

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.612
within the Google Play
Instant experience.

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:16.340
BEN FRENKEL: Excellent.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.260
KYLE RUSHTON: Yeah.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.550
Could you rephrase the--

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.600
restate the question?

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.340
BEN FRENKEL: Yeah,
so what factors make

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.420
for a great instant experience?

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.400
KYLE RUSHTON: Oh, yeah.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.510
Sorry, missed it
for a second there.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.850
So yeah, so certainly,
speed is important.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.390
So getting people immediately
into the core experience.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.370
I think it probably
goes without saying,

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.780
but I also think it's important
to redesign for the use case.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.780
So at Zynga, with
optimization of installs

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.300
being our primary
driver, we were really

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.310
trying to get an experience
that was concise and short so

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.040
that it ended in a
clear opportunity

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.030
to expose a user to installing
the full experience.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.120
I think if you were doing
something like a social invite,

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.019
or using it for cross-promotion,
or user acquisition,

00:19:58.019 --> 00:19:59.560
or different channels,
you might have

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.570
to think about the design for
that use case specifically.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.090
So I think use case is really
important to understand,

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.770
and exactly what KPI
you're trying to drive

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.255
when building the experience.

00:20:10.255 --> 00:20:13.640
So it's probably not necessarily
a one-size-fits-all answer.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.666
BEN FRENKEL: Gotcha.

00:20:14.666 --> 00:20:16.284
Marcelo?

00:20:16.284 --> 00:20:20.540
MARCELO FERREIRO: Well, for
us, what made sense was to--

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.750
as I mentioned before-- build
the first part of the game,

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.910
basically because
we know it's strong.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:33.880
So I wanted to share that,
and having the possibility

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.980
to then move to the full app
and be able to carry over

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.740
that progress.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:46.830
That was the use case
that we [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:52.300
But we see, in the future,
another possibilities

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.160
of making, probably
in another games

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.430
that we do in Jam City, like
testing different use cases,

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:06.080
and optimize those
for each game.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.180
BEN FRENKEL: So I have
a followup for you.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.580
So building a game that meets
the 10-megabyte size limit

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.170
sounds--

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.630
probably for many of you--

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.990
to be pretty intimidating.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.300
But all of you have successfully
done something like that.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:23.250
And what my question is for
you is, as you built out

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:27.230
the instant experience
for Panda Pop, what

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.570
are the kinds of things
you learned about both

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.850
that process as
well as maybe things

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:36.140
that you learned about the
installed apps infrastructure

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.890
and so forth?

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.350
MARCELO FERREIRO:
So our first idea

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:44.590
was to make the instant
app 20 levels long.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.990
Being able to go back
and forth, [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.780
them up, and then go to the
game, and then go to the map

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.330
again.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.500
But, again, we realize
that we weren't

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:02.310
going to achieve the size
limit goal that we had.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.600
So at that point, we
get together with a team

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.840
and basically decided to only
do gameplay and do the first 10

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.910
levels.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.660
So that enabled us to
remove a lot of textures,

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:24.200
scenes that we weren't using,
localization strings that

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.460
needs to be stripped off.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.800
And what we learn is
that every little thing

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.190
that you can remove
from the app,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.140
remove it, because its
going to be important.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.900
Remove the plug-ins,
remove the localizations

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.210
that you don't use.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:53.290
Even the smallest pre-fab,
it's important to take it out.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:54.540
BEN FRENKEL: It's all cut out.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.498
MARCELO FERREIRO: Yeah.

00:22:55.498 --> 00:22:58.370
Yeah, so take away everything.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:04.100
We try to do it in a way
where we could build it

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:10.610
on top of the regular game,
so we benefit from the changes

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:14.660
that we made in the full app.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.670
So I would also recommend
that, if possible.

00:23:19.697 --> 00:23:22.030
BEN FRENKEL: So you're saying
that through that process,

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.812
you were able to make
optimizations that

00:23:24.812 --> 00:23:26.020
then impacted your full game?

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.800
Is that right?

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.716
MARCELO FERREIRO: Yes.

00:23:27.716 --> 00:23:32.050
In fact, there were two
things that we benefit

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.790
from building the instant app.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:40.180
One was, we improve
the way we were

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.220
making [INAUDIBLE] animations.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.330
And that made the
application run

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:50.990
smoother and with a
reduced memory footprint.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:55.935
So we basically, in the
full app, we gain memory

00:23:55.935 --> 00:23:57.830
and we gain performance.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.474
So it was truly beneficial.

00:24:01.474 --> 00:24:02.640
BEN FRENKEL: That's awesome.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.454
And Kyle, why don't
you talk a little bit

00:24:04.454 --> 00:24:05.370
about your experience.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.800
You converted at least
a couple of games

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.430
that I've had an
opportunity to play,

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.000
and what was your experience
like, and how did you do that?

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.791
KYLE RUSHTON: Yeah.

00:24:13.791 --> 00:24:16.450
So fortunately, in the case of
Zynga Solitaire, the full app

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.820
itself was just around
the 10 megabyte mark,

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.400
so we didn't have much
difficulty getting it

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.980
under the threshold
in that case.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.190
In the case of Words
With Friends 2--

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:30.430
I think this goes back
to the design piece of it

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.130
as well-- was really just
having a clear focus of what we

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.000
wanted to bring to consumers.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
And so for us, we launched
Words With Friends 2

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.090
about six months ago.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.548
One of the new
features we launched

00:24:39.548 --> 00:24:41.620
with that was a feature
called Solo Series,

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.500
which allows users to play
against AI-powered bots.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.330
We thought that was
a really good match

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.360
for the instant experience,
so we focused exclusively

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.440
on bringing a subset of Solo
Series to the instant app.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.090
By having that
clear focus, we were

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.890
able to remove a
lot of other stuff

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:58.600
that was tangential
or unrelated.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.460
And so we could really
reduce the app size

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.040
and build a really
clean experience

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.420
without a lot of the other--

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.650
I don't call it fluff,
but aspects of the app.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.580
BEN FRENKEL: Also, so
to synthesize that,

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.724
you're saying that you can cut
out, let's say, lots of levels,

00:25:12.724 --> 00:25:14.140
but another thing
is to just focus

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.560
on one particular slice
of the experience.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.721
KYLE RUSHTON: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:19.721 --> 00:25:21.455
I think that is a good summary.

00:25:21.455 --> 00:25:23.080
BEN FRENKEL: Excellent.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.394
Any thoughts, Olivia?

00:25:24.394 --> 00:25:25.060
OLIVIA YU: Yeah.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.090
So I think for us, we just
focus a lot on the gameplay.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.170
And then we took
out the Saga map,

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.864
we don't have any
other features,

00:25:31.864 --> 00:25:33.280
and a lot of our
games always have

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.440
a narrative in the beginning,
and a [INAUDIBLE],, so we

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.180
obviously took everything
else so it was only just

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.160
focus on the gameplay.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.834
So that's what we
wanted to focus on.

00:25:40.834 --> 00:25:42.250
BEN FRENKEL: Makes
a lot of sense.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.610
And we've heard similar
things from a lot

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.870
of our other partners as well.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.530
It's either
stripping out assets,

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.610
or choosing a select gameplay.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.390
But I think it's really good
to get some additional context

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.596
from you up here.

00:25:58.596 --> 00:26:00.220
So I wanted to
particularly talk to you

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.520
about some of the challenges
related to developing

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.470
a instant experience in Unity.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.230
And what are some of the
things that you ended up

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.980
having to do and learn
through that process?

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.480
MARCELO FERREIRO: Well, as you
mentioned before, the biggest

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.609
challenge for us was size.

00:26:14.609 --> 00:26:15.400
BEN FRENKEL: Right.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.350
MARCELO FERREIRO: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:22.660
So as I mentioned
before, we needed

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:29.410
to change the way we were
doing [INAUDIBLE] animations.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:34.480
Because what we were using
at the time, the files

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.270
that it was producing,
they were bigger,

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.660
and they were also taking up
a lot of memory in the game.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:52.810
And after that, we
also needed to refactor

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:57.970
certain parts of the code
to be able to only use

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.840
the scene of the gameplay.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.030
I think those were the
two biggest challenges

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.650
that we needed to make.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:15.400
But in the end, we end up with
a more modularized obligation,

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:20.750
and we were able to benefit from
that in a technical way also.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.350
So it was a win-win for us.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:25.490
BEN FRENKEL: Excellent.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.900
And so, looking
forward, overall,

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.670
what kind of
developments do you see

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:36.940
emerging in the instant gaming
space and the coming years?

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.450
You can go as far in the
future as you would like,

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.020
but I'd love to hear
your thoughts on how you

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.910
see the whole space evolving.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.910
MARCELO FERREIRO:
I think that this

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:57.410
is going to be probably the--

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.770
I would say the future
of user acquisition.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:08.060
Also, the social part of being
able to share a link and start

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.230
playing right away.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.310
That's probably going
to be the future apps

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.740
that we're going to see.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.824
And of course, we are
going to benefit from that.

00:28:18.824 --> 00:28:20.719
BEN FRENKEL: Awesome.

00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:22.510
OLIVIA YU: I still
think, as you mentioned,

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.040
especially with
new games coming,

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.600
so there's also a way
to also fully leverage

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.460
their preregistration
on Google Play

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.850
so players can actually try the
game before they preregister

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:34.310
and actually install it.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.040
So I think that's another way.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.680
And then depending on where you
are in the stage for your game,

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.919
there could be different
instant games experiences.

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:44.710
KYLE RUSHTON: Yeah.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.990
I'm really excited to see
what the creativity of game

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.540
developers will bring
to Google Instant.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.620
And I think there will be
some breakout mechanic built

00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:00.630
on top of Google Play Instant
that to date would not

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.220
be possible.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.410
And so I think once you
think about it from a design

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.570
perspective, and
what you can bring

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.270
once there's no friction
between a current user

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.420
and a potential user,
or a re-activated user,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.544
I think we'll be able to
build new mechanics on top

00:29:13.544 --> 00:29:16.470
of that that are breakout.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.290
BEN FRENKEL: I wanted to give
you a big round of applause.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.332
Thank you for being here.

00:29:20.332 --> 00:29:20.998
OLIVIA YU: Yeah.

00:29:20.998 --> 00:29:21.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.456
BEN FRENKEL: And I hope
you all learned a lot.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.260
And I just wanted
to close things out

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.200
with a collection
of links so that you

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.500
can follow up and take action
on the things you learn today.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.500
So yes, taking a photo
is definitely preferable,

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.010
because this last URL is
probably difficult to remember.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.590
So Google Play
Instant, that's where

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.210
your getting started guide is.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.360
You can see the technical
documentation there.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.540
There's a beta
sign-up for Unity,

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:55.470
so if you want to build
a game with Unity today,

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.730
we encourage that, obviously.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:00.960
Then sign up here to be
part of our instant beta.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.540
And if you're interested,
and adventurous,

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.530
and are willing to try something
that's hot off the press,

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:10.890
the alpha build of Cocos
Creator with the new features

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:15.310
that we described today, you
can go to this link here.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:19.500
And it's very stable, I've been
told, by the people from Cocos.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.550
So go check it out.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:25.950
It's really cool, we were
demoing it all week at Tent C,

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:30.360
or whatever it is called,
and it was stable.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.740
But either way, go check it out.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.906
I think you're going to
really get a kick out of it,

00:30:33.906 --> 00:30:35.920
and it's only going to
get better from here.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.430
So thank you all for your time,
and enjoy what remains of I/O.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.776
