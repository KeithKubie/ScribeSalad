00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.859
 When we want to categorize living organisms 

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:03.680
 in a complicated way, 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.120
 we can divide them into 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.800
 eukaryotes or eukaryotes 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.340
 or prokaryotes. 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.260
 Prokaryotes ... 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.040
 The biggest difference 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.940
 between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are membrane-restricted structures, 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.240
 which the eukaryotes have, and the prokaryotes - not. 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.320
 The most obvious difference is the presence of a membrane-bound core. 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.500
 In a eukaryotic cell, genetic information is found 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.660
 inside the core, which is bounded by a membrane. 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.140
 Here it is - this is the core. 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.270
 Your genetic information is in it, 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.680
 this is your DNA. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.610
 In the prokaryotic cell, your DNA would look like this. 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.680
 It may be at one end of the crew 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.800
 We call this nucleotide, but it is not limited to a membrane like the nucleus. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.020
 Time to write it ... 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.949
 No membrane ... 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.050
 There is no core membrane bound. 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.020
 There is no core bounded by a membrane. 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.000
 This is not the only difference between 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.140
 prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.800
 This is just the most noticeable difference. 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.060
 In fact, in the word "eukaryotes" the "carriot" 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.380
 comes from the Greek word for "stone" or "kernel". 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.340
 Let me write it ... 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.320
 This means "stone" 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.370
 or "nut". 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.040
 "Prokariot" means "before the kernel or the stone". 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.980
 We can look like nuts or stones 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.640
 these membrane-bound structures, 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.240
 especially the kernel you see here. 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.100
 But that's not all. 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.300
 The eukaryotes also have other membrane-bound structures, 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.400
 which prokaryotes do not have. 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.540
 You can see mitochondria, 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.160
 my-it-chores 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.200
 in a eukaryotic cell, plant or animal, 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.100
 but you will not find them in a prokaryotic cell. 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.940
 And there are other types of structures. membrane bounded 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.620
 You will see things like Goldie's apparatus. 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.780
 This is a microscope picture of a eukaryotic cell. 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.100
 And here's the Goldie apparatus, 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.410
 which helps in the synthesis of proteins. 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.700
 This is a microscopic picture of mitochondria, 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.640
 and that of the core. 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.720
 This is the nuclear membrane. 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.540
 And this is the genetic information, 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.320
 all this here. 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.130
 It is in the form of chromatin (uncompressed chromosomes). 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.620
 Here is quite crowded, 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.960
 as we have shown it on the diagram. 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.060
 So it's DNA in the form of a chromatin, 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.990
 but in the part that looks even thicker and darker, 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.590
 the microscope picture below 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.290
 we see the kneeling. 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.680
 her-wife 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.240
 This is the place, 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.780
 where ribosomal RNA is produced. 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.800
 Ribosomal RNA, which is part of the ribosomes, 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.980
 who play an important role in the process of translation or 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.200
 in simple words - the synthesis of proteins, 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.040
 based on the information in the RNA. 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.880
 We will discuss this in detail in other videos. 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.680
 These ribosomes here 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.200
 are constructed from ribosomal RNA 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.440
 and proteins. 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.340
 Here's where they're building - in the kneeling, 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.580
 the dense part of the core. 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.960
 The major difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is, 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.840
 that the eukaryotes have a core limited by a membrane 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.720
 other membrane-bound structures such as mitochondria. 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.100
 There are theories that 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.560
 mitochondria have first developed into prokaryotic organisms, 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.210
 who lived in symbiosis 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.640
 inside a larger eukaryotic cell. 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.880
 And the other difference is, 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.000
 that in eukaryotes, DNA is in multiple chains. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.760
 So if you decide to straighten the DNA molecule, 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.660
 you will get multiple chains. 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.360
 In the prokaryotic cell, the DNA is ring-shaped. 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.180
 It can fold in different directions, 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.230
 but generally ring-shaped. 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.070
 These are the three main differences: 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.889
 nuclear membrane, other membrane-bound organelles 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.120
 such as the mitochondria or the apparatus of Goldie and 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.760
 also the multicellular DNA in the eukaryotes 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.860
 or annular DNA in the prokaryotes. 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.880
 In addition, eukaryotic cells are usually larger, 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.820
 unlike prokaryotes that are smaller and simpler. 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.500
 Once we know the main differences, 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.140
 to give examples of eukaryotes? 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.200
 Most organisms are eukaryotic, 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.290
 with which we have access every day 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.650
 or we think we have a touch every day. 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.110
 Including all multicellular organisms ... 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.100
 very much 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.040
 I mean animals, plants and mushrooms. 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.320
 Here are the unicellular ones. 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.300
 This is a slipper here. 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.340
 It is a eukaryote. 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.580
 There is a core surrounded by a membrane 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.960
 and other organelles. 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.720
 Here are cells from the top of the onion root, 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.000
 they are plant cells 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.550
 You can see it because it is colored, 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.610
 these are the nuclei of the cells. 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.380
 This is a nice picture because you can see 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.880
 cells at various stages of mitosis, 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.200
 which is very interesting. 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.260
 Animal cells and your own cells 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.300
 are also eukaryotic. 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.320
 Then what are the prokaryotic cells? 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.250
 Well, the simplest example is bacteria. 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.340
 These are bacteria 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.540
 and are prokaryotic organisms. 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.400
 And the smaller things, 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.100
 or those that are rarely spoken by the archaeans. 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.630
 First, people thought arches were bacteria, 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.000
 who just live in 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.500
 extreme conditions. 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.650
 But now it is known that they are a different kingdom - 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.260
 kingdom archaeus. 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.670
 When we talk about overpopulations or empires, 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.150
 it is often thought that bacteria are one branch, 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.180
 and the arches - another. 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.020
 Archaeas are here ... 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.180
 And eukaryotes are also a separate branch, 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.210
 I will paint them here. 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.050
 And with eukaryotes there are all things, 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.520
 for which we have already spoken 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.700
 here are plants and animals, 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.260
 mushrooms and unicellular, 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.160
 and similar. 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.540
 So, on a higher level of understanding 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.100
 we can consider archaea and bacteria as prokaryotes, 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.560
 and these, of course, are eukaryotes. 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.470
 I hope this explains things well.
