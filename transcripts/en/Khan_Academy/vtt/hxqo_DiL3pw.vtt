00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.880
What I want to do in this video
is prove that between any two

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.700
rational numbers-- so let's say
that's a rational number there,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.850
and then let's say that this
is another rational number that

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.455
is larger than
this one right over

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:19.020
here-- that between any
two rational numbers,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.840
you can find an
irrational number.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.880
So that number right
over there is irrational.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.482
You can find at least
one irrational number.

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:33.190
And that's kind of
crazy, because there's

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.420
a lot of rational numbers.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.378
There's an infinite number
of rational numbers.

00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:41.370
So we're saying between any
two of those rational numbers,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.997
you can always find
an irrational number.

00:00:45.997 --> 00:00:48.080
And we're going to start
thinking about it by just

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.820
thinking about the
interval between 0 and 1.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.860
So if we think about the
interval between 0 and 1,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.680
we know that there are
irrational numbers there.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.100
In fact, one of them
that might pop out at you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.860
is 1 over the square
root of 2, which

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.440
is the same thing as the
square root of 2 over 2,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.520
is equal-- I
shouldn't say equal,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:22.510
is roughly, is approximately
equal to 0.70710678118.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.210
And I could just
keep going on and on

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940
and on and on and on and on.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.780
This thing does not repeat.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.400
But the important point is,
it's clearly between 0 and 1.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.660
So I could write 1 over
the square root of 2

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.052
is clearly between 0 and 1.

00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:39.010
So the way that I'm going
to prove that there's

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.690
an irrational number between
any two rational numbers

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.560
is I'm going to start with
this set of inequalities,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.310
and I'm going to
manipulate it so I end up

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.800
with an r1 over here
and an r2 over here.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.320
And then from 1 over
the square root of 2,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.300
I would have manipulated
this to construct

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.570
that irrational-- at least
one of the irrational numbers

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.280
that's between those
two rational ones.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.180
So instead of making this
an interval between 0 and 1,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.660
let's make this an
interval between 0

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.110
and the difference
between these two numbers.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.640
So the distance between
r1 and r2 is r2 minus r1.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.510
So let's multiply
both sides of this--

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.550
or all three parts
of this inequality,

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.410
I guess I could say, by
r2 times r2 minus r1.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.330
So let's do that.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.210
So if you multiply this,
0 times r2 minus r1, well

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.830
you're just still
going to have 0 there,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.070
is less than-- And we know
that r2 is greater than r1,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.060
so r2 minus-- let me make
it clear what we're doing.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.900
We're going to multiply
everything times r2 minus r1.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.290
r2, we're assuming,
is greater than r1,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.880
so this thing right over here
is going to be greater than 0.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.195
So if you multiply
the different sides

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:57.070
of an inequality by
something greater than 0,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.730
you don't switch the inequality.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.740
So 0 times that is 0, 1 over
the square root of 2 times

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.620
that is going to be 1
over the square root of 2

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.330
times r2 minus r1.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.790
And then that's going
to be less than-- well,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:27.510
1 times that is just
going to be r2 minus r1.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.710
And now, we just have to kind
of shift everything over.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.280
So let's add r1 to
all sides of this.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.250
So if we add something to
all parts of the inequality,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.470
then that's also not going
to change the inequality.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.990
So we're going to
add r1 over here.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.020
We can add r1 over here.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.629
And we can add r1 over there.

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.170
And so on the
left-hand side, we have

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.094
r1 is less than r1 plus--
let me just copy and paste

00:04:01.094 --> 00:04:03.260
all of this so I don't have
to keep changing colors.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.900
Whoops, that's not
what I wanted to do.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.660
Let me do this.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.320
There you go.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.220
All right.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.040
That should be pretty good.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.240
So copy and paste that.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.310
r1 plus this, plus that--
let me write the plus down--

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.830
plus that, is less
than-- that one

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.320
is a different shade of
blue-- is less than-- well,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.190
what's r1 plus r2 minus r1?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.080
Well, that's just
going to be r2.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.370
So I've just shown
you that you give me

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.550
any two rational
numbers, and I'm

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.520
assuming r2 is greater
than r1, I have just

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.970
constructed an
irrational number that's

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.750
going to be between those
two rational numbers.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.040
You take r1, you take the
lower of the rational numbers,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.880
and to that you add
1 over square root

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.450
of 2 times the difference
between those two

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.320
rational numbers,
and you are going

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.060
to get this right over here
is an irrational number.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.120
You're saying hey, how do
I know that this thing--

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.970
how can I be satisfied that
this thing is irrational?

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.430
Well, we've already seen.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.620
You take the product of an
irrational and a rational,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.750
you get an irrational number.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.480
You take the sum of
an irrational number

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.570
and a rational number, you
get an irrational number.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.430
So we've constructed
an irrational number

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.660
that's between
these two rationals.
