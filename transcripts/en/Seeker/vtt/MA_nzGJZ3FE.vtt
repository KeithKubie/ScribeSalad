00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.380
The next time someone complains about their
commute, bring up Beijing's national expressway,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.590
which had a traffic jam that lasted for almost
two weeks!

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:17.810
Why do we have so much traffic?

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.980
Traffic is part of driving, but why does it
exist?

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.760
Mathematically speaking, traffic happens.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.660
Three things affect the inevitability of traffic
along the best travel routes -- speed, density,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.660
and flow.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.140
A study in the SIAM Journal on Mathematical
Analysis back in 2011 was the first to create

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.670
a mathematical model of every car on the road
and how bottlenecks affect a jam -- like that

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.219
monster in Beijing.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.989
Turns out one single car can start a backup,
which affects all the cars around them and

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.710
continues in a wave throughout the rest of
the traffic -- this wave is called Phantom

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.710
Traffic.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.610
I don't know if you've experienced phantom
traffic, but it's when cars on the highway

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.090
stop for no reason!

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.129
MIT researchers put drivers on a circular
track, told them all to maintain the same

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.600
constant, slow, speed, and very quickly, jams
formed!

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.790
Researchers call these jamitons -- because
mathematically they're similar to waves called

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.790
solitons.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.189
It can be frustrating, but it's just math!

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.759
When density reaches a certain point, research
from MIT found, a single car breaking can

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.469
start a wave -- but to be clear, it's not
that driver's fault!

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.159
Mathematically, if everyone followed the exact
same rules, there comes a point where car

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.880
density is high enough, that the flow and
speed are affected because of human reaction

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.880
speeds.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.630
They happen not because one person screwed
up -- but because of how humans observe and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.209
react to traffic!

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.090
It's human nature!

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.659
Science loves to compare our experiences with
animals around us; and when it comes to traffic,

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.029
that animal is the humble ant.

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:47.939
Have you ever seen an ant traffic jam?

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:48.999
No way!

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.340
A multi-country study from Universities in
Germany, India and Japan looked at an ant

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.709
species from India to look at how ants manage
traffic.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.180
And, holy crap, they're basically perfect
drivers.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.479
Ants spread pheromone scents to indicate safe
routes to forage.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.309
Their receptors keep them on these pheromone
"roads" and help them communicate with each

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:08.759
other while travelling.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.010
Turns out, as more and more ants travel on
the same road, they travel closer together,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.489
but don't slow down as density increases -- unlike
the cars in the MIT studies.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.189
Remember, as density increases, humans tend
to slow down.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.700
Instead, ants go the same speed no matter
how many are on the road.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.379
And they put the needs of the many first.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.819
Ants taking food to the colony are automatically
given right of way; and though there are no

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.480
lanes, ants move out of the way to keep things
flowing.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.190
Humans have a hard time putting others' interests
before their own quite so easily; which is

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.240
part of the problem…

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.909
See, ants are part of a colony, but humans
are egoists… we're individualistic, and

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.900
that's another source of traffic.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.120
If someone drives a bit slower than you on
the highway, do you speed around them, or

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.510
slow down just a little and tuck in behind
them.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.370
I think we all know what happens here.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.459
Speeding around them and continuing on our
way!

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.829
Perfect little traffic ants, however, they
slow down behind ants carrying things -- like

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:08.829
leaves.

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.920
The ants behind it will travel slower, but
everyone actually got where they are going

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.030
faster overall because ants didn't have to
compensate for all the other people speeding

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.790
around the slow cargo-laden ant.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.450
Essentially, if we all made tiny sacrifices,
we'd end up getting everywhere faster because

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:56.749
traffic waves, jams and backups would pretty
much disappear; Phantom traffic waves too!
