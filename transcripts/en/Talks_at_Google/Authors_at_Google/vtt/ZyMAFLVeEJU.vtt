SANDY LEGER: Hi, friends.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.050
Thank you for coming here.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.880
Thanks for wanting to listen
to us and learn about

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.720
prevention of human trafficking

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.150
in the US and abroad.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.900
My name's Sandy Leger.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.350
I am the co-founder, president,
and chairman of

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.965
abolishslavery.org.

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:31.130
And in a moment I'm going to
introduce Aaron Cohen here.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.390
He's our speaker.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.310
Human rights activist.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.200
But before I do that, I want to
tell you a little bit about

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.840
our organization and the
movement to free slaves.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.130
Slavery has changed
over the years.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.120
It certainly wasn't abolished
150 years ago with the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.420
Emancipation Proclamation
with Abe Lincoln.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.620
As our president today says,
human trafficking is

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.880
modern-day slavery.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.330
At Abolish Slavery, we work
to prevent the spread of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.120
modern-day slavery by helping
establish and mentor human

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.530
trafficking task forces
domestically and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.080
internationally.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.070
That's a mouthful.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.970
These task forces find and
protect human trafficking

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.930
victims and promote the
infrastructure needed to

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.170
rescue victims and assist them
on the road to recovery.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.700
Today more than ever, victims of
human trafficking are being

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.830
prostituted, enslaved, abused,
tortured, and murdered by

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.010
predators who exploit their
vulnerabilities.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.440
But with your help and with
the help of victim service

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.810
providers, we can free the
captives together.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.950
The human trafficking movement
in the US is growing, and with

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.170
it, many organizations are
training law enforcement to

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.919
better understand the complex
dynamics of domestic

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.270
prostitution and sex
trafficking.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.370
We recently completed a series
of investigations and rescues

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.070
in New York, working with the
NYPD, and vice detective Chris

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.010
Baughman from the Metro Las
Vegas Police Department and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.450
certified shelters.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:41.720
These partnerships were the glue
that kept us together,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.630
and it led to the rescue
of several victims.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.600
One of these victims is a young
lady named Christina.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.830
She's from New Hampshire.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.820
And I was there for all of
this, actually, as were

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.790
Melissa and Gracie,
my daughter.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.110
She'd been trafficked all
throughout New Hampshire, all

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.830
the way down to New York.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.050
And we rescued her-- it
was Abolish Slavery

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.920
with the NYPD help.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.320
Her emotional reunion with her
mother was successful.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.130
And she's now seeing a
counselor, she's applying to

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.530
colleges, and she has a blog
that you can visit at--

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.926
what's the name of it?

00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:32.384

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.660
And her name's Christina.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.070
With us today, speaking of,
is the victim advocate for

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.720
Abolish Slavery, Melissa
Grace Hoon.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.558
Could you stand up?

00:03:52.558 --> 00:03:53.808
MELISSA GRACE HOON: Hello.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.270
SANDY LEGER: It's Melissa's
responsibility to coordinate

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.390
survivor transition and
security, as she did with our

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.710
survivor from New Hampshire,
so that post-rescue, our

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.160
survivors receive the best care
possible from the service

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.880
providers, and making sure that
their unique situations

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.450
are helped.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.660
As of late, we've been
increasingly using technology

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.090
in our investigations and
finding sex trafficking

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.190
victims online.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.190
We document them, and we're
allowed now to see something--

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.540
I think Aaron's going to say
later-- something that was

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.270
invisible, that we don't
normally know about, to

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.520
something that is visible.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.930
For the last two years, Abolish
Slavery has trained

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.570
law enforcement in human
trafficking investigations in

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.225
Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Haiti, Mexico--

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.540
Ooh.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.530
Wow, OK.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.260
That's like being in a
department store when you see

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.510
yourself on the camera.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.300
And also in the US, with
the FBI's help.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.030
We plan to begin our
next round of

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.090
investigations next month.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.290
We don't know exactly where
we're going to be, because we

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.590
had to change a plan.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.810
The victims actually moved, the
traffickers moved them, so

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.350
it's not going to be where
we had intended in Texas.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.580
But we continue to work with law
enforcement when we do the

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.900
investigations and the rescues
and transition the victims

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.420
from a life of slavery
to a life of freedom.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.350
We just take it so
for granted.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.090
We're also working on our next
installment of books and

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.190
television production.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.980
We're excited to develop some
PSAs and other media to raise

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.760
awareness and to raise crucial
funds needed to continue the

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.320
work of bringing freedom
to those who are

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.000
lost in modern slavery.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.020
It's my hope, and all of our
hope, that this short film

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.990
we're about to show you will
help explain the painstaking

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.180
work of rescuing victims who
at this very moment are

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.430
enslaved in the US.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.860
AARON COHEN NARRATING: Human
trafficking is the

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.290
fastest-growing illegal
business.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.010
It's already passed arms sales,
and it's in a position

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.260
to pass drug sales.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.650
Ever since the internet boom,
sex trafficking has been

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.040
growing at an alarming rate.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.110
The massage parlors of Asia are
teeming with young human

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.360
trafficking victims.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.600
I met Na while working
undercover in Cambodia.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.810
She told me she was 19,
but I could see

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.316
she was much younger.

00:07:24.316 --> 00:07:25.250
AARON COHEN: What?

You're so shy.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.385
worst places for sex

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.445
AARON COHEN: So we're getting

00:07:51.445 --> 00:07:52.830
out of the station.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.030
Basic estimates suggest that
there's up to 27 million

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.620
slaves in the world today.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.530
Here in Haiti, there's
an unprecedented

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.430
300,000 domestic slaves.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.860

of the children

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.990
carrying in the street.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.810
I can't help but feel as if
we're looking at modern-day

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.460
slavery here in Haiti.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.600
AARON COHEN NARRATING: The
ancient land of Kush, known

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.970
today as Sudan, was connected
to Egypt by the Nile River.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.620
Tradesmen and camel caravans
waged bloody civil wars for

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.880
the past centuries over the

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.230
African tribal communities
destitute.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.920
Heartbroken parents were facing
an agonizing choice

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.730
when they discovered that their
children had been taken

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.470
to this little-known place
called Darfur.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.120
It was a long, difficult journey
for the former slaves

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.120
to walk home hundreds of
miles across the front

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.710

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.600
And that's something
I always live with.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.840
I always live with the fact--
people say, well how many

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.730
children have you rescued?

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.830
Or how many slaves
have you freed?

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.360
And the answer is, how many have
I left behind, really?

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.070
And that haunts me.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.440
It stays with me.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.690
It never leaves.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:25.350
SANDY LEGER: I've only watched
that a few times, and the boy

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.290
who was two years old when they
took him-- and I have a

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.190
two-year-old.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.735
He can't even make real
sentences yet.

00:12:34.735 --> 00:12:37.000
I can't even imagine.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.910
OK, so it gives me great
pleasure to introduce to you

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.160
Aaron Cohen.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.570
He's the mission director
for Abolish Slavery.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.430
He's an award-winning--

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.320
I'll give you all the
goodies about him.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.240
He's an award-winning writer and
human rights activist who

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.660
draws his inspiration from the
Jubilee, which is an ancient

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:07.450
law of debt forgiveness and
setting the slaves free.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:16.140
Media, including FOX, CNN,
"Larry King Live," MSNBC, and

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.280
NBC, have a lauded Aaron's work
in finding and rescuing

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.610
victims of human trafficking.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.680
He was awarded the US
Congressional Certificate of

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:34.200
Merit, the Prize for Humanity,
and the Major League

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.190
Baseball's Greatest Save
trophy for his efforts

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.015
combating slavery in the
United States and

00:13:42.015 --> 00:13:44.810
in dozens of countries.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.420
Working with the Abolish Slavery
team, Aaron trains

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.920
counter-human-trafficking task
forces and undercover police

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.240
officers in the US and
other countries.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:02.090
His memoir, "Slave Hunter: One
Man's Global Quest to Free

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.780
Victims of Human Trafficking,"
has been translated into many

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.730
languages and will be available
at the book table

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.700
following our presentation.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.540
Melissa and I and Gracie will
also be at the table, if any

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.930
of you are interested in making
a donation or asking us

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:26.610
about how you can be involved,
how you can help, and how you

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:31.820
can be part of setting
these slaves free.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.200
So without further to-do,
I give you Aaron Cohen.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.590
AARON COHEN: Thank you.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.150
How is everybody today?

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.700
I'm so excited to be here and to
talk to you about slavery.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.940
The original topic for the
discussion sort of germinated

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.990
when my friend Michael P. Hale
from Google and I were talking

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:00.060
about the use of technology
in saving lives.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.170
And so we together came up with
this idea to sort of do a

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.670
little study, a little bit of
investigation about how the

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.590
role of technology is changing
both human trafficking

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.780
tremendously but also
human existence.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.630
So if we're going to talk about
the role of technology

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.291
in saving lives, two things
need to be defined first.

00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:23.170
First of all, we have to
define technology.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.520
What is technology?

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.220
Where does it begin?

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.790
Who were the originators
of technology?

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.810
And secondly, we have
to define life.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:32.760
How does life begin?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.900
What is life?

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.900
So what was really interesting
for me is you know, I'm a

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.130
human rights activist and I
travel around the world,

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.000
working with vice detectives.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.690
We work in task forces trying
to find victims of human

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.110
trafficking.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.990
And it can be pretty
dry at times.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.040
It's your typical scene,
drinking coffee and eating

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.520
doughnuts, and most of the
time, waiting around.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.160
So I got really excited when
Michael talked to me about

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.760
putting this speech together,
because I learned a lot of

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.590
things studying about
technology.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:06.210
Ultimately, we're trying, all
of us in this room, to take

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:06.970
our little--

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.130
our life--

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.510
and when I say "little life,"
I'm referring to myself.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.810
And look at me.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.020
I'm very oddly tall, right?

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.270
And am I in the Johnny
Cash Fan Club?

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.480
Maybe.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.150
But the thing is that we're
trying to take our little

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.290
life, which is a drop, a little
stone in the water, and

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.530
our little waves come out to our
family and our friends and

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.610
to our outer circles.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:33.160
How do we move that from
just a small impact

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.130
to something big?

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:38.330
And I realized that in looking
at technology and at life in

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.290
general, the answers
are there.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.540
But what's so unique and so
different about this topic is

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.500
that the line between life and
technology is becoming more

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.750
and more blurred.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.750
So when we talk about the
beginning of it, or an idea of

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.250
a Big Bang, I'm going to go
through a little bit of a

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.720
history of science with you.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.180
We have these competing theories
on quantum physics,

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.619
the idea of string theory, where
mathematically, they put

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:07.069
together a 10-dimensional
reality.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.503
And then you have another group
of physicists saying

00:17:09.503 --> 00:17:13.500
they support this idea called
M-theory, which is really an

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.960
11-dimensionality that then
collides with the 10th to

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.750
create this Big Bang.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.770
And what happens in a Big Bang
is that this explosion occurs,

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.784
this massive explosion, and then
like the little pebble in

00:17:25.784 --> 00:17:31.800
the water, these huge cords of
universes and galaxies come

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.740
out from that big explosion.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.770
And essentially, the oldest
writing we have in the world--

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.630
when I went to try to find the
origins of slavery, where

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.210
slavery begins--

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.020
the oldest writings in the world
are talking about the

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.280
cords of our galaxy.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.780
And that's the cuneiform tablets
from ancient Sumeria.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.670
They even name it.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.120
They would look to Orion's belt
as sort of this Grand

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.000
Central Station that could take
them through the Pleiades

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.520
to the Northern Star, where all
the other stars rotated

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.690
around the Northern Star.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.910
And there was this ancient
belief that somehow, the

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.860
domain of the heavens, or the
throne of the creator, shall

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.670
we say, was vested in this
northern position.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.210
And so the cuneiform writings
talk largely about this.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.790
They named the first cord
from the center Norma.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.790
They named the second
cord Crux.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.690
The third was called
Sagittarius.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.770
And the fourth was
called Orion.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.750
And that's where we live.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.230
Our Milky Way galaxy is on the
fourth cord from the center of

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.960
our Milky Way galaxy, and we're
on planet Earth, the

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.800
third planet from the sun.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.890
So when I realized that the
Sumerians, who in many ways

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.450
are the inventors of slavery,
because after all, the first

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.910
records of slavery come from
ancient Sumerian culture in a

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.640
place called Babylon.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.690
Now, remember the Tower of Babel
from history lessons,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.870
from the biblical story?

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.960
Ancient Babel was a place
where they all spoke one

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.510
common language.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.210
They had a common theme.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.750
And they had figured how to
become interconnected.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.250
Now the word that they use in
the ancient Aramaic is this

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.580
word called "shem." Now a HaShem
or a shem is what we

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.000
call a name.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.370
But that is not a good
translation for this word to

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.780
English, in my view.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.220
As we look into the idea that
these people were building a

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.470
tower, the ancient tower
of Babylon--

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.570
this is the actual
historical ruins.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.220
Saddam Hussein's palace
sat on that little

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.330
spiraling feature there.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.140
And that was the actual ruins
of the Tower of Babel.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.770
So it's a historical
archaeological site.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.580
And what it says in the
scriptures, both biblical and

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.690
extrabiblical, is that they
built this tower so that they

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.410
could travel into the heavens
to build a name for

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.270
themselves.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:20:00.750
So the word "shem," or name, in
the Hebrew is linked to an

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.350
idea of a codex, an idea of a
source coding that creates a

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.940
reaction in folks.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.500
So that's essentially what
they're talking about when

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.830
they say a name--
a technology.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.030
So all of a sudden, when
we think of technology,

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:19.570
technology is linked in the
ancient, ancient records to

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.500
the idea of a Big Bang and the
formation of life itself.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.090
At the Tower of Babel, they
were very interconnected.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.260
And so the idea that the
languages were confused, the

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.230
codes were confused-- remember
when Microsoft had their

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.640
security platform hacked
by the government?

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.830
How did it go?

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.220
The government said, you've got
too much of a monopoly.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.210
We want to pull out your code.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.490
So it confused the languages.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.830
And it reminded me of this
important term called

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:53.300
emergence, which is the way
complex systems and patterns

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.370
arise out of multiplicity of
relative simple networks.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.120
In other words, if you have a
complex problem to solve and

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.160
you have a colony of ants, a
single ant cannot solve the

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.180
complex problem.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.200
But through emergence, through
emergence and through their

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.850
interconnectivity, a colony
of ants can solve very

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:18.410
intellectual complex problems
because of their collective

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.130
interconnectivity, their
collective intelligence.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.620
So as we move forward to
discuss slavery and

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.760
technology, I think
that emergence is

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.050
an important concept.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.790
Because after all, we've been
fighting slavery generation

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.860
after generation.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:37.130
And it seems like every 100
years or so, we fool ourselves

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.370
by thinking somehow
we've done it.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.620
But what happens is we don't
connect all the dots to

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.280
actually finish the job.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.680
So today, there's more
slaves than any

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.400
time in human history.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.550
They say that there's
upwards of 27

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.590
million slaves worldwide.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.220
And if you think about that,
we're living in this

00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:00.350
technology where we're all
connected, and yet at the same

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:05.420
time, the technology is being
used to lure, coerce, and

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:11.060
subjugate women and girls
into slavery.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.930
There's a shot of the Tower of
Babel, which was an actual

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.225
thing that happened.

00:22:17.225 --> 00:22:21.730
And what's cited as what was
the problem by the ancients

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.480
was the fact that they had
developed emergence.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.750
They had developed
interconnectivity amongst

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.890
themselves so that no problem
that they sought to solve was

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:31.590
unsolvable.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:36.360
They could literally
tap into eternity.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.490
Their system was propagated
in Egypt.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:43.290
In the legends of slavery, we
see that the god of Egypt,

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.690
which was Ra, the sun god, left
Egypt, became known as

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.110
Amun Ra, went to this historical
characters in

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.360
Babylon named Nimrod, and that's
where the Tower of

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.760
Babel was formed, from
the Amun Ra.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.500
Of course, the story
picks up later

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.010
in the various histories.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.940
But all the archaeological
ruins are there.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.610
They would form shrines, and
from these shrines, they would

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.030
then recruit young women and
girls to work as shrine

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.370
prostitutes.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.100
The men would oftentimes be
subjugated into labor and be

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.910
forced to build pyramids.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.820
So we have the vestiges of
these communities and the

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.730
archaeological ruins of what
slavery produced in the past,

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.880
and they're still
with us today.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.140
Unfortunately, I don't think
that we've answered the

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:33.430
questions as to why, as a single
human community, why as

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.970
a human single human community
would we subjugate each other

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.340
to slavery in order to pursue
these material objectives.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.230
And of course, the Hanging
Gardens of Babylon are there

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.320
as a reminder to us.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:51.580
As the science progressed, some
very, very interesting

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.010
people came on the scene.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.590
Of course the founder of modern
science, Sir Isaac

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.260
Newton, he became famous, of
course, for the apple falling

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.590
onto his head, determining
gravity, of course.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.470
But what he did is remarkable.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.990
He was a student of the
ancient literatures.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.970
So he would study mystical
traditions in literature.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:16.770
And what he did was he took the
ratio of the Ark of the

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:21.490
Covenant, which was 1.5 cubits
by 2.5 cubits, and he created

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.760
a numerical factor which he
called the Sacred Proportion.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.020
And he multiplied that
times pi times 360.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:36.000
Then after him, another
scientist helped him to

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.990
develop, essentially, the
diameter of the Earth.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.600
So the father of modern-day
science, Sir Isaac Newton,

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.120
with the help of Sir John
Watson, they were able to

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.350
determine the diameter
of the Earth.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.590
And from that, there was a
curvature of the Earth that

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.090
was able to be determined, and
then they changed something.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.690
They changed the measurement
of distance.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.310
Using technology, they said
the kilometer, which was

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.240
distance over a straight line,
was not as accurate of a way

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.710
of measuring navigation on the
oceans, but rather distance

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.190
over the curvature of
the Earth was a

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.900
better way of going.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.040
So today, if I travel to Japan,
or if I go to China, or

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.880
if I go to the Philippines or
to Indonesia, wherever I go,

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.740
English is almost a
second language.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.650
And it's remarkable when
we think about that,

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.430
why that is the case.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.960
Is it because of
our literature?

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.600
Is it because of our culture?

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.660
Is it because of
our democracy?

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.620
Well, it may have something to
do with the nautical mile, an

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.580
actual technological
advantage.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.190
But of course, that technology
was used, those ships were

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:42.080
used to go and bring the African
slaves out of Africa

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.970
and bring them across into the
New Worlds to become enslaved.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.040
And so what we've seen from the
ancient history, both from

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.720
Babylon to Egypt to today is
the use of technology to

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.690
empower a certain group of
people, but at the same time

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:00.900
to subjugate and put others
into a position of

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.990
vulnerability to that
technology.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:09.720
Of course, after the initial
founders of modern science had

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.460
their run, a gentleman came
on the scene named Cantor.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.850
And what Cantor did is he
reinvented, for all practical

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.420
purposes, mathematics.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.870
Now we already had this
mathematics in some of our

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.890
ancient languages, related
to Chinese and Aramaic.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.740
But what Cantor did is he said,
let's take a seed and

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.650
let's plant a seed.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.170
And we'll say the
seed is a line.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.930
And then the law of how that
seed divides is we take the

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.990
line and we divide
the line in half.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.380
So in the first generation,
we plant the seed.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.700
In the second generation, we
divide the line in half and

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.100
execute the law of growth.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.130
Then those two become four,
those four become eight--

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.790
the bytes system was developing,
the idea of

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:57.620
utilizing zeros and ones in
low-level language to create

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.100
an operating system through
which interconnectivity and

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.240
intelligence could
be communicated.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.015
So of course, what happened
to Cantor?

00:27:05.015 --> 00:27:08.750
He went crazy and ended up
in an insane asylum.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.110
But he inspired a group of
mathematicians, Fournier and

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.080
some others, who developed what
they called immortal math

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.060
or chaos theory.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:22.840
The idea that 1 plus 1 equals
2 was a concept in what we

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.190
call mortal math.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:28.740
But 1 plus 1 equals infinity
is reflected in this.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.460
Because a seed is planted and
it divides to infinity.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.360
So this is a different construct
of looking at

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.170
mathematics and physics that
Cantor and Fournier

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:38.940
developed for us.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.260
And of course, those were the
seeds that led, of course, to

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.870
the computer coming
on the scene.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.610
So here we are.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:56.250
We're in the year 2013.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.890
We have more slaves than
we've ever had in any

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.690
time in human history.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:03.390
It's the fastest-growing
illegal business.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.690
And the technology is on the
rise to both enslave the human

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.030
and to free the human.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.330
And so I'm here today largely
to ask for your help.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:17.520
Because gosh, these pimps and
these traffickers are

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.230
utilizing the internet and
Facebook and social networking

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.220
sites to find their victims.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.960
And from there, what they do is
they recruit them using a

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.860
whole series of mechanisms,
and they then subject them

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.100
into slavery.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.520
And the police and the law
enforcement task forces that

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.150
we work with at Abolish Slavery,
they're not as

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:42.010
tech-savvy, per se, as some of
the traffickers and pimps who

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.080
are out there preying on
young women and girls.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.080
So what are we going to do?

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.220
How are we going to catch up
with the bad guys in this

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.830
particular issue?

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:58.050
For me, I had this experience
where early on in the human

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.420
trafficking movement,
I became a vice

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.820
detective looking for victims.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.930
So I was the guy who was
the undercover person.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.820
I would pose as a john.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.440
I would go into brothels, and
I would essentially try to

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.400
interview a victim to find out
if they were a victim of sex

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:14.960
trafficking.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.870
Generally speaking, I would
look for the youngest ones

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.180
that I could find.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.940
And I would wear a wire, because
I needed a technology

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.190
to actually document
the crime.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:28.290
But the problem was that
the wire was so--

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:31.470
I had a transponder, and the
wire went from my shirt, not

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.200
unlike the microphone
I'm wearing now.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.490
It went from a shirt to here,
and then I had to have a

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.080
backpack to pick
up the signal.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.580
And I used to get such anxiety
over the wire.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.760
I would come into my hotel room
and it'd be sitting there

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.890
on the counter, and my heart
would start racing.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:48.830
Oh my gosh, the wire.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:53.470
I would get very, very nervous
that somehow I would get

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.180
caught wearing the wire and
something bad would happen.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:01.810
And so I began to project from
that thinking, I began to

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.540
project fear onto the device.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:09.240
And what I had done was I had
put a reminder of fear in

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.920
front of myself, and it began to
inhibit my ability to work

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.100
with the victim in the room.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.140
And what I do when I enter that
room is I'm trying to get

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.710
to know the person and
win their trust.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:25.120
But if I'm afraid, if I'm filled
with doubt, how am I

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.700
going to do that?

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.530
It's very difficult to win
someone's trust if you're

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:30.720
doubtful and you're fearing.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.620
And I meditated on it.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.750
I thought to myself, you know,
I've got to put the wire away.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.740
I cannot work with the wire and
have it out and see it and

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.610
have my heart started beating
as a reaction, almost like a

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.090
Pavlov's dog reaction.

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:47.240
I ring the bell and the dog
would think dinner's coming.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.640
Well, I would see the wire and
I would become fearful.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.830
And what I realized is that I
needed to keep the vision of

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.830
what I was trying to do in front
of me, not the fear.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:02.625
So I had put a vision of
something that created fear

00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:05.680
and doubt in front of me, and it
was affecting the way that

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.480
I performed in my job.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.730
So what I did instead
is I looked for an

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.630
alternative to the wire.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.070
And it's interesting--

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:17.770
you laugh about it, but these
birds, says it's a bit freaky

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.370
with the wireless technology.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.100
They're just hanging on nothing
there in the air.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.940
And that's what I
was looking for.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.950
I was looking to become the
person that could work in that

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:31.060
room with the victims in a way
where I wouldn't be caught

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.820
wearing a wire and get
beat up or worse.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.930
So as time went on, I realized
I needed to put something in

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:38.630
front of me.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.780
I needed to keep my vision
in front of me.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.900
And what I began to do is I
looked at the wire, and

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.310
instead of having the
wire there, I

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.080
replaced it with a key.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.240
And I put a key there on the
counter in front of me.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.890
And that made a huge
difference for me.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.610
Because when I would walk by and
see my keys there, all of

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.330
a sudden, I would realize, oh,
yeah, I put the keys there,

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:01.310
because the wire was
there before.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:05.020
And the key is this thing that
will unlock these victims from

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.050
being enslaved.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.240
Even myself--

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.070
I can unlock my own issues,
my own problems.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.210
Because I was doubting myself.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:17.440
I thought, why should I be
the guy to be doing this?

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.860
How did I end up here?

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.850
How could I possibly
sustain this?

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.220
It's so expensive.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.460
All of these doubts and things
arised in my mind that

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.380
probably could have changed
my path so that I

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.280
wouldn't have continued.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.800
But I began to realize that not
only was the technology

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:40.670
this great macro Big-Bang
phenomenon, but the technology

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.130
was also this micro thing
inside of me.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.330
It was a micro/macro situation,
where both my life

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.420
and the technology and the
application of them to freedom

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.110
for others was something very
relevant to what was going on

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.480
in my life.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.580
I discovered Dr. Masaru Emoto.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.190
Now he's a very controversial
figure in the scientific

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.240
community, because he developed
a theory which sort

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.790
of lends itself to what I'm
talking about right now.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:10.830
His idea was to take water,
dirty water from a dam, bring

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:14.690
in a group of folks who could
meditate over the water, and

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.620
then measure the molecules and
take pictures of the water

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.530
crystals prior to the meditation
and then following

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.960
the meditation.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.190
And he discovered some
shocking things.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.570
And if you look on the figure,
it shows the water from the

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:33.800
dam, and then it shows the water
from the dam after the

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.060
offering of a prayer.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:40.360
And he essentially photographed
water by putting

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.670
love one water, thank you.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.410
And he began to notice that
whatever the messaging was,

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.800
whatever the consciousness of
the people who were meditating

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.940
over that water had, it
affected the molecular

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.480
structure of the water.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.530
So he reduplicated
the experiment

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:56.380
over and over again.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.880
He was criticized by the
scientific community for going

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.070
straight to the public and not
debating this further in the

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.950
scientific community.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:08.340
But whether or not you buy into
his theories or not, the

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:13.510
idea that our conscious thoughts
affect us not only on

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.010
a molecular level within
ourselves but the

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.679
people around us.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:21.360
And what I began to realize was
that I was talking myself

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.560
out of successfully rescuing
girls out of this life.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.350
And what I was talking myself
into by projecting fear, by

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:33.940
projecting doubt, I was
literally manifesting that.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:38.330
I was manifesting getting
caught wearing a wire.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:39.699
And it's a very dramatic
scene.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:43.409
They rip the wire from you, and
then they smash it, and

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:44.540
then the next thing
you know, there's

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.650
three guys at the door.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:49.254
And your hair, and this and
that, and do I fight back?

00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:53.179
And so all of that was something
that I was able to

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:56.290
actually manifest through
my fear of it.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.680
And I had to change
my thinking.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.010
So when I found the water
molecule study, I realized

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:06.520
that if I create positive
affirmations for myself, if I

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.720
have a can-do attitude instead
of a "oh my gosh, what will

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.800
happen if that happens?"
attitude, I needed people to

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.820
speak favor over me.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.150
I was out there maybe a little
bit too much on my own, and I

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:24.070
began to doubt and fear.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:29.340
Another analogy that helped
me was the idea that I had

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.840
reached a point where I was
crawling in this movement.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.150
I couldn't raise the funding.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.780
If I rescued a victim, I could
barely take care of that one

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.390
particular person.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:39.930
I needed wings to fly.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.710
I needed to find out a way to
move from my caterpillar

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:48.590
position into a position of
becoming a butterfly.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.000
And I did that by going to
graduate school and studying

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.350
the subject of the Jubilee.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:57.660
Now Jubilee was this ancient
musician who lived way back in

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:01.450
ancient Sumeria nearly
5,000 years ago.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.780
He's called the father
of all musicians.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.730
But today, we still call a good
party after his name.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.750
We still use his
name, Jubilee.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.470
The queen has a 50-year
anniversary.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:11.740
It's the Jubilee.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.710
So I went to graduate school.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.440
I studied the agent law of the
Jubilee, which was found not

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.480
only in biblical tradition
but in all the peripheral

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:20.970
traditions.

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:25.620
Because the musician Jubilee
himself was so ancient that we

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.030
find Jubilee in Tibetan
Buddhism.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:31.370
We find Jubilee in Christianity
and Islam.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:34.080
It's in Judaism.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.600
It's in Hinduism.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.540
It's found cross-platform
amongst all societies.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.400
So I essentially
wrote a thesis.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.490
I wrote a book.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.160
I had a dream.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.640
And instead of approaching my
dream with fear, I began to

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.300
put my vision in front of me.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.250
I had these little circles that
had chains broken, and

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.430
I'd put it up over my bed.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.290
And I'd wake up in the morning
and I would see there the

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:00.460
broken chains.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.210
And I would think to myself,
I'm going to do it.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.440
I'm going to do it.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.360
I would speak favor
over myself.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:12.340
At the time, I was working with
a rock band, and I found

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.990
some incredible musicians
who would help me.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.950
And we traveled to
the G8 summits.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.590
We asked all the other musicians
we could find to

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.250
sign petitions, and we set the
world record the biggest

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.460
petition ever created.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.710
It was millions and millions
of signatures.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:31.880
And we submitted it at the G8
summit in 1999 to Bill Clinton

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.100
and the political leaders to
drop Third World debt.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.190
And it was a huge success.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:41.670
So I had taken a few of the
little principles that I had,

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:44.250
which was positive
affirmations--

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.330
but not just positive
affirmations.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.190
Changing my mindset.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.580
It's one thing to have
a positive mentality.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:55.150
It's another thing to say, I'm
going to be transformed by

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.710
renewing my mind.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.980
So I began to try to think
of ways that I

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.700
could renew my thinking.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.880
The campaign was
a huge success.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.810
Bono took the lead.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:09.870
Perry Farrell and Bob Geldof
were big supporters.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.190
We raised a lot of money
and we parlayed that.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.060
Now the Jubilee was forgiving
debts and freeing slaves, and

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.030
I wanted to try to manifest
this in my life.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.040
So I sought out to first
forgive debts.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.590
And we forgave Third
World debt.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.560
We're still working today with
Rolling Jubilee that is an

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.170
organization that works to
relieve medical debt for

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.410
people who have fallen
into poverty.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:33.240
But the Jubilee was a
two-pronged thing-- forgiving

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.260
debts and also freeing slaves.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:41.455
In 1997, when I was working with
Michael P. Hale, I didn't

00:38:41.455 --> 00:38:43.080
even know where slavery
existed.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.680
I just knew that theoretically,
it was

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.090
something that I wanted to talk
about, the idea of being

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:51.970
enslaved to myself, my own
thinking, or my ability to

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.350
transform from that caterpillar
position to a

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.780
butterfly and renew my mind.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:57.690
So what did we do?

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:59.510
We went online.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:03.250
We used technology to find out
where there were slaves.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:06.040
So I essentially went into a
search engine and then I typed

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.450
in slavery, and I began looking
at a few links, and I

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.230
saw that there was
slavery in Sudan.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:19.160
So after we created a concert
tour, we did some festivals,

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.000
we raised some money, and the
next think you know, I was on

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.060
a plane on my way to this
country, Sudan.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.940
Flying over the Nile River.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.720
Crossing the border of Kenya
into Sudan, there's this city

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.650
called Lokichogio, and it's
sort of their last outpost

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.190
before you're going all the
way inside, where there's

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.930
really no more hospitals,
there's no more

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:42.270
infrastructure, no more
Coca-Cola, no

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.190
more bottled water.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:47.310
It's ceramic water filters
after this point.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.190
We land.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.540
The local military greets us.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.440
And at the time, I didn't really
know what I was getting

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.450
myself into.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:58.530
I just knew that I wanted to be
involved in freeing slaves.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.340
And so we land and the reality
hadn't really hit me yet.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.930
I was sort living--

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.420
it was kind of like "The Lion
King." The trees were similar.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.440
There was drum music playing.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.430
And I romanticized Africa so
much that when I landed, it

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.820
hadn't really hit me what
was about to happen.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:21.270
So we're landing, the plane is
there, and they begin loading

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.540
bodies into body bags to move
them on trucks out of the

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.650
region, because the civil war
between the north and south

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:29.060
was very bloody.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:33.540
And the Janjaweed, these
raiders, were being supported

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.010
by this group nobody had ever
heard of called al-Qaeda.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.610
And al-Qaeda was there, and
they were then looking to

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:44.560
subjugate people into slavery
to promote the well-being of

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.720
some of their sponsors.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.920
So we would unload the survival
kits and deal with

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.760
the murahaleen.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.870
We called them the Schindlers
of the Taliban.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.020
They were these humanitarian
Muslim guys who had helped to

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:03.610
devise an Underground Railroad
in Sudan, bringing the victims

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.890
out from the north, from
this place no one

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.350
had ever heard of--

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.650
Darfur.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.330
The slaves come out.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:15.610
You start to put a face on
slavery and to realize that a

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.600
slave is not the same
as a free person.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.610
A free person is responsible
for all their decisions.

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.700
Somebody who's a victim of
slavery, they have very little

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.520
responsibility in their life.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.290
And so when you begin to see
this humble spirit--

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:32.200
my first encounter with slaves
was really shocking, because

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.600
they would just look down and
then they wouldn't give eye

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.310
contact, and they would
just answer yes or no.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:39.560
They were very, very
submissive.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.440
Some of the children that we
encountered in the camps had

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.190
nothing at all.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:48.030
They had come back through the
Underground Railroad, and

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:51.080
along the way, someone saw
shorts or a shirt, would take

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.520
it from them.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.550
But ultimately, reuniting them
with their families after that

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.430
arduous journey was an
incredible moment of my life.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.980
I realized something about
myself, that whatever dreams

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:06.940
and goals that I had had before,
of having this big

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.790
music festival or doing
these things,

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.440
those dreams were fine.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.080
But the idea of liberating
people had superseded all my

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.090
other plans.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.380
And it became sort of my master
dream for my life, the

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.930
ability to take what I've been
given, the education that I'm

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:27.240
learning, and to try to use it
instead of, per se, pursuing

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:32.830
material things on my own, but
to help liberate others.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.140
I was a Forrest Gump.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.210
I was in the right place at
the right time when some

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.240
things were happening.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.580
I had hundreds and hundreds of
hours of interviews of slaves.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.540
And so we took our package to
the US government, and they

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.330
passed a law called the
Trafficking Victim Protection

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.050
Act of 2000.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:52.590
This was a big milestone.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:56.700
Because like the Emancipation
Proclamation, the Trafficking

00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:00.800
Victim Protection Act empowered
law enforcement by

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.890
providing nearly $500,000 of
funding for every single

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:06.400
jurisdiction.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.640
A lot of the contracts
went to me.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.460
And as I approached the work--

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.950
I first went to Nicaragua--

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:17.420
I had always been doing
slavery sort of

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.660
intellectually.

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.950
I was looking at the different
organizations.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:23.760
I was seeing how they worked
in task forces.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.210
This one's good at shelters.

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.340
This one's good at
investigations.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:31.830
This one's good at psychological
help.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:36.090
And I was completely analyzing
everything all the time.

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:40.560
But when I began to get the
contracts to do the

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.620
investigation in sex trafficking
assessments,

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.400
that's when I had to really,
really work on my mindset.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.560
Because fear could easily
creep back in.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.760
How many of us say, I
can't do that job?

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.410
I can't get that promotion.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:00.400
I can't be in this
relationship.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.320
I can't do this.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.680
I can't do that.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.910
I had to change my mindset in
order to be able to do the

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.210
investigations.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.040
So largely, that meant changing
my environment.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.320
Because in order for me to keep
a positive mindset, I had

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.420
to have a team around me.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.020
And I have a great team.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.320
And by changing my environment
and getting into an

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.330
environment that was going to
speak favor over my life, I

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:28.710
was able to change my mindset
properly and then begin the

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:35.250
process of essentially becoming
a vice agent in sex

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.890
trafficking investigations.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.790
I was in Miami and I met
somebody who would become a

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.940
little bit of a mentor for
me and inspire me.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.200
I don't know if you recognize
her picture, but her name is

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.420
Cedella Booker.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.110
And she's a very
famous mother.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.440
She's the mother
of Bob Marley.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.900
And so I was friends with her
godson, and we went to visit

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.480
her one day.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.050
And she pulled out her Bible
and began studying and was

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:04.170
very interested in slavery,
knew that I was working in

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.400
Sudan trying to free slaves.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.750
And we began a little study, and
I showed her the Tower of

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.500
Babel, and I showed her the
movement to free slaves in the

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.990
ancient world under the
prophet Elijah.

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:20.390
And we talked about the
different historical

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:22.670
characters who had played
a huge role.

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:27.010
And she brought up Haile
Selassie, whose famous line,

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:30.290
"Emancipate yourselves
from mental slavery.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:34.010
None but ourselves can free
our minds." And all of a

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:37.120
sudden, the idea that it's much
different than a positive

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.700
mindset to free your mind.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.730
To free your mind
is a different

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:41.900
thing than being positive.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:46.750
It means transforming the way
you're thinking, and no longer

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:50.130
conforming any longer to the
pattern of the world.

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:51.880
Because the pattern
of the world

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.900
puts us into our cubicle.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.760
It puts us into our position,
and it tells us, you do this

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.580
job, and that's your identity.

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.980
So to get beyond that, Mama B
basically said to me, you

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.810
should write your memoir.

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.870
If you think about what happened
with Bob Marley, she

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.260
had a situation with Bob Marley
where here's this young

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.020
man, he's living in
a place where

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.420
there's a lot of poverty.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.770
There's not a lot of opportunity
to travel or do

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:16.970
much there.

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:20.840
But what she did was speak
favor over his life.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.850
You can do it.

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:25.960
You can change the world
from right here.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.720
It begins with yourself.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.370
And she was so proud to talk
about how her and her son

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:33.950
spent a lot of time growing
up, and how he was very

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:37.470
inspired by the whole
idea of freedom.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:41.050
And that freedom for himself,
for his people, for his

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:44.070
country, for the world, was
a huge ideal for him.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:49.850
So after an hour of inspiring
session with Mama B, I left.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.400
And a little while later,
the phone rang.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.470
She had invited me back that
weekend for another study.

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:55.960
I said, sure, yeah.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.620
I'll study with Bob
Marley's mom.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:58.570
[LAUGHS]

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:03.700
And so I went back to the house
and she had this book.

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:07.910
And the book had been translated
into Hebrew.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:08.970
And it was her memoir.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:10.400
It was her life story.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.140
And she wanted to give
me the book.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.730
And she basically said to me,
you need to write your story.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.180
You need to write your story.

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.440
She spoke favor over my life.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:24.100
And that inspiration, for me,
helped me realize that if I'm

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.570
going to change my little ripple
into a Big Bang, I'm

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.290
going to need to use
technology to

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:29.830
get my story out.

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:31.990
And I'm going to need to use
technology to take on

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.380
organized crime.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.010
And I'm going to need to use
technology on myself

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:41.360
biologically to change my mind,
to change my thinking.

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.770
Because I'm scared.

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:44.410
I'm afraid.

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:46.700
I don't know if any of you
have ever looked down the

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:51.710
barrel of a gun, but it changes
the way that you

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:55.090
think, because you realize
how much of life

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.520
we're taking for granted.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.960
And so I did it.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.390
I wrote the book.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:08.910
From that point on, I began to
really work on myself in the

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:10.930
context of the investigation.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:14.840
So I went at it with
a vengeance.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.190
I was traveling 80% of the time
on one contract or the

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:21.090
other, for one organization
or another.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.820
Working in Cambodia, I would
work in the karaoke brothels,

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:29.410
singing karaoke to basically
children in the brothels.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.450
We would find a victim
in there.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.790
We would ask her to go get
all of her young friends.

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.020
They would all be rescued
by the police.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.240
Maybe a year or two later,
I would go back and be

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.220
reunited with them.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.960
Very proud moment, the
day that Jonty

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.320
graduated from high school.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.300
We had rescued her when
she was 13 years old.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.390
So when she was 17 and graduated
from high school,

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:54.300
they invited me to come
present her diploma.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.800
So I went and I presented Jonty
and the other girls

00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:58.850
their diplomas.

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:02.740
And I began to realize
that you know what?

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.510
I'm just one person.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:09.560
And as one person, I could have
an impact on the people

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.820
around me, the people that I
love, my family and friends.

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:18.430
Gracie's here, and Melissa's
here, and Sandy, and Michael--

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:21.180
these are people that I've known
for a long time and who

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.590
I love, that speak favor
over my life.

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:27.000
If I didn't have that, I
didn't have the right

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.720
environment, I don't know if I
could have reached the point

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.270
emotionally and psychologically.

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:33.510
Even today as I'm preparing
for the missions that are

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:37.270
coming up, I'm going to be in
that room again, wearing the

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:38.550
microphone.

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:40.010
The rooms are fully camera'd.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:45.560
But I have to essentially
work on myself first.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:50.520
And by renewing my mind, I
then prepare myself, my

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:56.080
vessel, to become a conduit,
to be able to take a power

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.220
greater than me and put it
through me into the work.

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:02.380
And that may sound funny, but
a lot of people, they sit at

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.820
their cubicle or they sit at
their desk, and they think,

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.880
this is just my job,
what I have to do.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.850
But I think that if you can
get beyond that kind of

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:12.070
thinking and start thinking that
this is just a conduit,

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.000
this is a vessel for me to
channel a lot more through my

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.720
life, it's very transformative.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.010
Travelled to Iraq, worked on
the slavery problem on the

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:23.700
border between Syria and Iraq.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.620
Very difficult situation
there today.

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:27.870
Traveled to Burma.

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.590
Doing human trafficking work, we
run into an entire village

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:35.740
of people who are starving to
death because they're cut off

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.920
from the war.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.450
I call Sandy.

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:39.720
Sandy, can you help out?

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.160
We have a situation and the
whole village is starving.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.240
So what does Sandy do?

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:49.700
She buys truckloads of rice and
olive oil and milk powder.

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:53.080
And we organize a convoy, we
risk it all, and we get the

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.110
village fed.

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:57.670
Just problem-solving along the
way in Haiti, after the

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:58.720
earthquake.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.790
You saw from the video, the
young boys that were carrying

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.760
cement after the earthquake,
and going

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.110
around with a SWAT team.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:10.030
You know, the prison collapsed,
and all the pirates

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:14.460
in the Caribbean who were in
jail got out in a single day.

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:17.540
And they went to this one place,
Cite Soleil, the city

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:21.980
of the sun, and they began
buying arms from UN traders.

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.750
And next thing you know, every
day we go in, there's these

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.060
exchanges going on.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.530
But here's these little kids
carrying cement blocks.

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:34.380
And it's remarkable, when
you think about it.

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:37.980
What both sides are struggling
to do is get better

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.310
technology.

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:42.290
The prisoners who had escaped
were looking for the best

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:43.930
technology in weapons.

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:47.150
The guards that are the SWAT
guys who we're working with

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:49.490
are asking us, can you
get us night vision?

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:50.580
Can you get us this?

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:54.770
Everybody's trying to scramble
to get the technology.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:59.990
But in a way, I see it
as the Dark Ages.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.210
Because we're scrambling to
get the technology to go

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:04.830
against each other.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:06.430
When are we going to be
scrambling to get the

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:10.950
technology to create the unity
and the holistic life that as

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:15.450
a human family we could
actually appreciate?

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:19.030
We arrested a bunch of suspects,
took them to jail.

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:21.630
And then we had the privilege
of reuniting these children

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:22.430
with their families.

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:27.820
And I don't know if you know,
but the gasp for breath when

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.310
they hug each other--

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:34.250
recently, we had this reunion in
New York, a young gal from

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:35.370
our operation--

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:37.150
I think that Sandy
mentioned her.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.840
We call her Veronica.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.630
But Veronica was in a
very dire situation.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:46.210
And when she was brought to
her mother, when they

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.580
embraced, that gasp for air--

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:49.730
oh, you'll see it.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:51.760
We filmed the whole thing.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.380
Same thing with young Arason.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.240
I'm still involved
in Arason's life.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:59.910
Early Last year, we got him
a bike and a cell phone.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.450
He's playing soccer.

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:03.980
Has a hurt leg from
carrying bricks.

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:07.440
His foot's hurt somehow, but
he's moving on his life.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.610
We always think of slavery
over there

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:14.870
from the ancient world.

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:19.160
We think of slavery, we're
thinking Cambodia, Haiti.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:23.960
But did you know that the
greatest demand for slavery in

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.360
the world is in the
United States?

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:32.480
It's the demand for slavery that
fuels the slave market.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:37.080
Who needs the slaves the most,
in terms of their economy?

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.220
It's us.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:42.410
We have an entire generation
of men who are learning

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:46.740
sexuality on the internet, which
is much different than

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.250
how it was 15, 20 years ago.

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:52.040
So nowadays when an
eight-year-old boy follows a

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:55.240
link in his email to something
he shouldn't be watching, it

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.985
changes his sexuality.

00:53:56.985 --> 00:53:58.830
It changes him.

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:01.490
It's not the favor that's being
spoken over him, that we

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:03.040
were talking about earlier.

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:07.030
So what we've done is we began
to try to use technology the

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:09.230
way that the traffickers are.

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:12.370
So I've spent the whole
winter in New York.

00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:15.190
And this is a picture
of our control room.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:17.540
You can see me there in
the room, waiting

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.480
for the girl to arrive.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:21.520
I went on Backpage,
and I worked

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:22.970
with Detective Baughman.

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:26.860
And the detective, he's an ace
at saying, this language, this

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:30.490
ad, it looks like it's
written by a pimp.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:32.360
And I think we should
put her on the list.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:35.590
So the next thing you know,
we've a list of 30, 40 girls

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:36.950
that we're going to call.

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:41.240
And then I call them, and
we arrange a date.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.370
The girl comes to
the hotel room.

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:45.240
I'm in one room.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.330
I've got the police
and security guys

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:49.140
in the other room.

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.430
And the room is wired,
I mean wired.

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:54.960
And very hot, because there's
all these big

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.490
police guys in there.

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:58.380
And the stakes are
really high.

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.810
It's illegal to solicit
sex in our country.

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:04.780
So if I say the wrong thing to
a question, if I make a wrong

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:10.120
response, I could be arrested,
or what we're doing could be

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.580
shut down by the police.

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.650
So I'm walking this
tightrope of

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:16.440
explaining to the girl that--

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.540
I create a mess on the bed.

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:22.240
I create a flow so that she
goes straight to the room

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.280
service table.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.760
I have staged a salad
that's been barely

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.625
eaten, and I'm hungry.

00:55:26.625 --> 00:55:28.070
And I'm ordering room service.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:32.120
So that we flow from the date,
from the encounter, into the

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.550
room service table.

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:36.450
And then I began to ask them
questions about their life,

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:39.670
and I begin to share my
challenges in my experiences

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:40.770
with their life.

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:44.900
And I'm think in my mind, if I
can create emergence with this

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:48.570
person, with others, if I can
connect her to Melissa, if I

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:52.400
can connect her to Sandy, I
began to visualize in my mind

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.340
to keep my vision in front of
me with the victim there.

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:59.000
And largely in the first
encounter, I listen and try to

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.720
develop trust.

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:06.150
I'll cut off the date right at
the hour, and I won't tip her.

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:09.472
If it's $200 an hour, $300 an
hour, or $400 and hour, I just

00:56:09.472 --> 00:56:10.750
give exactly that.

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:13.080
But I'm taking notes
the whole time.

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.190
Is she on her cell phone?

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:15.830
Is she texting?

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:16.850
What is she doing?

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:18.510
You know, what the pimps do--

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.930
when the girl walks in the room,
she's required in the

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:23.800
first three minutes to
text, I'm OK, to say

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.410
what's going on.

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:26.450
Then every three to five
minutes, they're checking in.

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:27.200
And you know why?

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:31.700
Because 80% of prostituted women
have violence done on

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.070
them by johns.

00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:34.720
So the women are scared.

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.180
A lot of them are shaking
and nervous in the room.

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:40.900
I try to make them feel at ease,
warm into the situation,

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.670
get to know them, talk to them
about my challenges, have them

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:45.390
talk to me about their
challenges.

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:48.370
I may even project a false
avatar on the young lady.

00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:52.270
I may say, oh, you're doing this
because you love sex and

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:54.030
you're probably going
to meet some Prince

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:56.050
Charming doing this work.

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:57.110
No, not at all.

00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:59.530
I mean, other people chose
this bag for me,

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:01.190
other people did this.

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:04.290
And by projecting a false
avatar, there's interrogative

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:06.120
techniques that we can use.

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.590
If you speak favor on somebody
and it's what they want to

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.560
hear, they'll say yes.

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.690
If you take something else,
a false identity, and you

00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:16.770
project it on them, they
will then correct it.

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:18.360
When she begins to correct
it, that's the

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.720
beginning of the interview.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.760
From there, we can determine
if she's a victim or not.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.220
And if she's a victim, then we
collect the evidence with the

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:25.640
cameras we have.

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.810
And we're using, largely,
HD cameras.

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:32.460
But I'm no longer wearing
the wire.

00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.900
Finally, my cellphone has
reached a point where I have

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.010
high definition on my cell.

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:40.406
I have my partner, Detective
Baughman, in the next room,

00:57:40.406 --> 00:57:43.040
and he's texting me just like
the girl's being text.

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.590
He's my lifeline.

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:46.740
She may go the bathroom
and he'll say,

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.540
she's in the bathroom.

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:48.360
Don't turn your back.

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.770
So I have to turn around to make
sure that I never have my

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:51.860
back to the victim.

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.090
Because I could be stabbed.

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:55.820
Something bad could happen,
god forbid.

00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:59.980
So I'm keeping my key on the
counter in front of me.

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:01.900
I'm keeping the mindset
in front of me.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.760
I'm thinking to myself
positive thoughts.

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:08.980
I'm projecting the renewing
of my mind on this person.

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.650
We're talking about deep
philosophical things-- about

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:16.430
freedom, about slavery, about
the use of her phone.

00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:20.540
Technology has become this
intimate companion in the

00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:22.620
human trafficking
investigation.

00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:26.130
And unfortunately, I'm here to
tell you that the pimps and

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:29.200
the traffickers are ahead
of the rescuers.

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.180
They're ahead of us
technologically.

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:37.310
They've found a way to use
anonymity and denial.

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:40.080
The technology has afforded
them, through the use of the

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:44.980
internet, to create anonymity
and denial amongst the johns.

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.630
And there's more johns in the
United States than there are

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:50.320
in any country in the world,
because we have the biggest

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.280
middle-class economy, and
there's more men willing to

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.530
buy sex in our country.

00:58:55.530 --> 00:59:00.410
The problem is there are not
enough women willing to

00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:03.010
satisfy the demand.

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:05.960
So what happens when
that happens?

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:10.830
What happens is the market
says, OK, let's

00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:11.970
make it more expensive.

00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:14.640
And so what happens is that
human trafficking networks

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:20.770
need to lure, coerce, corral,
and subjugate young girls into

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:21.420
trafficking.

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:22.710
And they do it on Facebook.

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:24.670
They do it on Instagram.

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:29.320
They do it on all the
popular platforms.

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.950
The thing is that I was excited
to speak at Google

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:35.300
because of all the companies
that I've seen-- and there's a

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.290
lot of companies out there that
have issues with slavery.

00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:41.370
All of us as Americans, we have
issues of slavery because

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:42.670
of a lot of our products.

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:45.780
Whether they're T-shirts or
tomatoes or chocolate or

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:49.380
whatever it is, slavery is
reaching its little fingers

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:52.240
everywhere in our
lives right now.

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.680
But the thing about Google is
that they're investing in the

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.170
intelligentsia.

00:59:56.170 --> 00:59:58.790
A couple of my friends who have
PhDs in human trafficking

00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:01.590
are working with Google to
look for solutions in

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:03.120
technology.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.970
There's some guys at USC who are
working on technology and

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:10.410
human trafficking to find ways
for us to utilize the

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:14.440
technology to identify the
victims and to rescue them.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:20.100
So if you look at the set-up
in New York, we've got some

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.690
sophisticated stuff.

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:24.050
But so do the traffickers.

01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:26.570
So do the pimps.

01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:29.120
This is a shot of Detective
Baughman, my partner.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.620
He's watching me in the other
room, and one of the

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.540
cameras is on him.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.915
And he's taking notes on every
single detail that occurs.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:44.150
So you know, when I look out
here, I'm not looking at

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:45.680
regular people.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.990
You are not regular folks.

01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:51.490
I'm looking at royalty here.

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:53.640
You are royalty.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.050
You live in an economy.

01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:58.770
You have an intellect.

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:01.420
You work at one of the top
companies in the world.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.450
I'm looking at geniuses here--

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:06.730
geniuses who can change
the world.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.730
It just takes getting
up off the chair,

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:10.560
renewing your mindset.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.640
But I really believe that if you
get out of the habit like

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.890
I was, of saying, I can't rescue
that victim, I can't

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:22.330
get legislation to happen, I
can't get out of this contract

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:24.720
with this nonprofit
organization.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.250
I can't--

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:29.890
and you start saying to
yourself, I can invent that

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:31.170
new technology.

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:34.740
I can go upwards
in my company.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.980
I can reinvent myself.

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.070
I can do better in that
relationship.

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:42.860
I think it's our ability to
speak favor over each other

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:46.510
and our ability to renew
our mind, that's where

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:47.880
the freedom is that.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.410
The more I get involved in the
issues of slavery, the more I

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:59.000
realized how enslaved I am to
my own addictions, to my own

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.780
old ways of thinking.

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:06.830
So in closing, I want to inspire
you to think about not

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:10.340
just positivity, not just
thinking positively, but

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:13.730
actually renewing your mind,
catching yourself

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.220
in moments of doubt.

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.780
I'm just one person.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:23.900
I'm a guy who thought he could
somehow learn about slavery.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.570
From there, I became someone
who thought, hey, maybe I

01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:29.840
could actually get involved
in the fieldwork.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.080
So I went from studying it
intellectually to then getting

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.220
involved in the fieldwork.

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:37.670
And then from there, I realized,
gosh, I'm just this

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:42.630
small fish in a big pond, and
I'm in Sudan, and how am I

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:46.160
going to change my little ripple
into something bigger?

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.810
Into a Big Bang?

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:51.950
And the answer is technology.

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:55.810
Technology with myself on the
micro level, the way I affect

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:58.710
the molecular structure of the
water in my body through

01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:03.010
speaking favor over my life,
but also changing the world

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:07.950
outside of me with speaking
favor over others, with the

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.030
mentality of renewing
the mind.

01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:15.530
With the use of technology
to create emergence.

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:16.320
Emergence.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.820
Because by yourself, by myself,
I can't do this work.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.630
I need Sandy.

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:23.110
I need Melissa.

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:25.980
I need Michael.

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.830
It's our emergence
that's going to

01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:29.350
create an end to slavery.

01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:33.140
We will continue to free
captives through our

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.600
interconnectedness.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:39.660
And so I want to thank you for
listening today, and I want to

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:44.630
encourage you to think about how
you can utilize technology

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:48.350
to create a greater sense of
emergence in your life.

01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:49.579
Thank you very much.

01:03:49.579 --> 01:03:55.210
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:57.720
AUDIENCE: Can you discuss
the extent of

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.150
the problem for boys?

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:01.160
AARON COHEN: It's
a good question.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:07.790
It's interesting how our society
almost condones the

01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:09.790
exploitation of women
and girls.

01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:14.720
Because when you see a very
young girl at a club, people

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.650
don't think twice about it.

01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:20.700
But when you go looking for
young boys, they're so hidden

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:25.280
away that you've really
got to be seeking and

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.930
finding to get it.

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:28.760
You've got to actually
know that's what

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.430
you're going after.

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:31.540
I've worked on some
investigations

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.510
regarding young boys.

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:38.170
And generally speaking, they
will take a young boy and they

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:43.070
will put him into a strip club
or a brothel situation.

01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:45.180
And then he's there cleaning,
or whatnot.

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.720
And then customers will come
in and someone will see and

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.580
say, you know.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.550
So it's similar with boys
and girls, the way

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:51.750
they utilize them.

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:54.060
But they represent
a much smaller

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.080
demographic than women.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:59.720
Of all the 27 million
slaves worldwide,

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.880
upwards of 80% are females--

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.730
and young females.

01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:08.730
So it is a problem with boys.

01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:10.960
It's a much more recondite
problem.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.880
It's hidden from everybody
and it's very

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.070
difficult to find it.

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:19.860
It's difficult to find it from
an investigative perspective.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:24.640
You can find it online,
no mistake about it.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.960
The will amongst society to do
something about it is not the

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.850
same thing as with women.

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:33.250
We're both accepting of the
slavery of women in our

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:40.450
society and we almost put
the boy issue away.

01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:42.370
Now from the law enforcement
perspective, there's people

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:43.220
doing something about it.

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.520
I'm glad that they are.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.930
I've worked on some assignments
myself.

01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:50.810
It's more difficult, and
more needs to be done.

01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:54.690
However, I think it's good
that we talk about human

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:56.830
trafficking and slavery in
the context of women

01:05:56.830 --> 01:05:58.060
predominantly.

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:01.960
Because after all, they make up
the vast, vast majority of

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.250
victims who are being
exploited.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.300
AUDIENCE: I was wondering how
closely you work with some of

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.210
these technology companies whose
products are being used

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:17.920
to sort of perpetuate
this worldwide.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.470
Do you help them monitor or
watch out for this on their

01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:23.260
systems, or train people within
these companies to

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.755
watch out for it and escalate
it appropriately?

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.820
AARON COHEN: Well, the question
regarding whether or

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:33.230
not we work with the companies
that have the issue, it's

01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:35.116
always a sort of a--

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:38.460
you can have an adversarial
relationship or a cooperative

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.086
relationship.

01:06:40.086 --> 01:06:43.950
And in the case of Craigslist,
we had an adversarial

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:44.700
relationship.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:48.760
Because you know, you go to
these people, you say, little

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.330
boys and little girls are being
sold on your web page

01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:54.020
and lives are being lost.

01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:55.450
Here's a whole list
of the victims.

01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:57.050
Here's a list of the
ones that died.

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:59.480
Here's a list of the ones who
are recovering, that were sold

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.080
on your service.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.540
And there's no return call.

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.410
There's nothing.

01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:07.080
And then there's some brazen
remark about how we can't

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.430
police the internet.

01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:12.340
We're in favor of
net neutrality.

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:15.500
So what happens is when people
are making a lot of money on

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.480
something--

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.450
we had a similar problem
with Backpage.

01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:24.920
Because Backpage, Village Voice
Media, Backpage owned

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.860
Village Voice Media.

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:29.870
So we organized some protests,
and we went down there and

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:34.820
protested at Village Voice
headquarters in New York, and

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:35.840
made a passionate plea.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.390
And what happened was that
the company sold

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:40.820
off its Village Voice--

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:44.110
it's almost like a mob
operation, where the mob would

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:46.370
have a restaurant and they
"own" the restaurant.

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:47.830
There's never any customers
there, but they

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.200
have meetings there.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.320
And then what happens is you
find out, OK, this is your

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:52.980
restaurant.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.820
Then what they do is they sell
the restaurant and move

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:55.950
somewhere else.

01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:58.210
So in a sense, that's
what happened in

01:07:58.210 --> 01:08:00.630
the Backpage analogy.

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:03.910
In terms of tech companies
that we're working with,

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:07.270
there's some great products
that Google has coming out

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:09.210
that I'm excited about.

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:13.040
A lot of the cloud services
and the ability to network

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.170
with people and have video
conferencing are huge

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:16.970
components for us.

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:20.359
If we could have greater access
to video chat, that

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:22.139
would be a huge thing.

01:08:22.139 --> 01:08:24.950
The other thing is cameras.

01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:31.770
We need to find a tech company
that can make a smaller

01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:35.640
smaller type of audio-recording
device.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.790
We have memory so small.

01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:40.810
Wouldn't it make sense to make a
microphone really small that

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:43.470
could grab all the
audio properly?

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:46.710
Because the audio becomes key
with law enforcement and

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:49.220
getting the warrant to
rescue the victim.

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:53.100
But we have cell phone
technologies which have

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.170
advanced tremendously.

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:58.330
And in New York, the New York
Police Department, they

01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:02.880
subpoenaed my video and my audio
recordings from one of

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.369
our investigations.

01:09:04.369 --> 01:09:08.240
The pimp was beating her up
and was caught on camera.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.979
The use of technology from the
street corner gets her

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.080
getting beat up.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.939
He goes into jail, and then
he gets out of jail.

01:09:15.939 --> 01:09:18.100
And I'm on the way to her, to
try to get to her at the

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.800
shelter, but he gets
to her first.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.090
If we had the right kind of
technology, communication set

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:27.310
up between the shelters, we
would have been able to

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:30.260
intercede on that
victim's behalf.

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:35.430
So most of the relationship with
tech companies has been

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:38.450
to show the problem online,
whether it was

01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:39.939
Craiglist or Backpage.

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:42.640
But in terms of companies that
are making products that are

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.270
functional in the
investigation--

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:46.600
of course Apple and Google.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.920
And I would like to see them
take a bigger role not just in

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.540
discussing this subject
intellectually or funding more

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.030
studies, but actually developing
technologies that

01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:01.590
will enable us to camera a room
and get audio and video

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:04.840
in a way where it doesn't
require an entire army of

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.350
wires and components
in the next room.

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:11.240
We're still in the Dark Ages,
a little bit, on the

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:11.910
technology.

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:14.700
And I know that the
technology exists.

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:19.330
So I don't have a sponsorship
with a tech company.

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:22.510
I've worked against a number
of the platforms that the

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:24.400
victims are being sold on.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.060
And I've seen other companies
step forward

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.970
and start doing things.

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:29.870
For example, Hersey,
there was an issue

01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:30.950
with chocolate slavery.

01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:35.190
But they're starting to look at
ways to utilize technology

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:38.780
in the Ivory Coast and in Ghana
to better monitor what's

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:41.850
going on on the thousands of
farms and whatnot, to sort of

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:42.640
try to intervene.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.240
So I think that the traffickers
are ahead of the

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.970
tech companies, because they
get the products first and

01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:53.970
begin utilizing them before the
tech companies have them

01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:57.210
in the hands of the human
rights activists.

01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:03.113
