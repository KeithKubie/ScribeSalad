00:00:00.806 --> 00:00:01.436
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: The Science of Learning

00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:05.966
and Development Initiative came
together to answer a question.

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:09.076
What science should we
pay attention to in order

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:11.686
to understand how learning happens?

00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:13.456
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Have a good day.

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:14.676
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond:
The Science of Learning

00:00:14.676 --> 00:00:19.646
and Development is really an
attempt to synthesize a huge body

00:00:19.646 --> 00:00:21.716
of knowledge that's accumulated
over many,

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:26.416
many years from the learning sciences,
from psychology and anthropology

00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:32.326
and brain science and put all that
together and understand how people,

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:35.976
in fact, develop and how they learn.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.726
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: There are
a few core principles

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.166
that define all of human development.

00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:54.056
The first is malleability, the unique
property of the brain to change

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:57.396
in response to relationships
and experiences.

00:00:58.056 --> 00:01:03.046
Neural tissue is the most susceptible to
change of any tissue in the human body.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:07.566
When children are born, their
brains are not fully developed.

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:12.726
The development of the brain actually
continues into young adulthood.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:18.336
It is relationships and experiences
that drive the development of the brain.

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:20.926
If children have the experience

00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:26.526
of adversity they will have uneven
development of foundational skills,

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:31.716
like self-regulation, relationship
skills that are prerequisites

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:36.626
for more complex skills like
perseverance and self-direction.

00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:40.936
These are the children who are at risk
to fall further and further behind.

00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:46.616
But what's most interesting is that
a child can become a productive

00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:51.336
and engaged learner from any
developmental starting point as long

00:01:51.336 --> 00:01:53.576
as we intentionally build those skills.

00:01:53.826 --> 00:01:56.676
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Turn to your
table group and discuss this.

00:01:56.676 --> 00:01:57.876
Come up with a statement.

00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:03.156
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: When we're able to
combine social, emotional, affective

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:07.066
and cognitive development
together, we are creating many,

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:12.776
many more interconnections in the
developing brain that enable children

00:02:12.946 --> 00:02:15.626
to accelerate learning and development.

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:21.516
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We got this,
guys. We got this!

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:25.166
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: As educators, we
have an extraordinary opportunity

00:02:25.556 --> 00:02:29.946
to shape the developing brains of
children and to create that kind

00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:34.116
of stimulus that drives the
integration of the brain.

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:36.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Life isn't all
about going at it alone.

00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:38.066
We're up there to support you

00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:41.986
when you don't necessarily have
the skills or tools that you need.

00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:44.376
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: The Science
of Learning and Development tells us

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:48.496
that school needs to organize
for strong relationships.

00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:51.256
&gt;&gt;Student: You look pretty, Miss Turner.

00:02:51.256 --> 00:02:51.916
&gt;&gt;Ms. Turner: Thank you, baby.

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:56.326
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: When a strong
relationship exists with a teacher,

00:02:56.326 --> 00:03:00.466
with a mentor, with an advisor,
with a school administrator,

00:03:01.346 --> 00:03:06.896
it actually can reverse the
effects of adverse experiences.

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:12.376
Children are amazingly resilient,
if they get that opportunity

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:17.666
for attachment, for comfort and for
problem solving with a caring adult.

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:28.186
&gt;&gt;If we walk into a classroom that's
really informed by these principles,

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:32.866
we'll see kids actively
engaged in their learning.

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:34.956
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What is this
graph telling us?

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:38.326
&gt;&gt;They will be using critical
thinking and problem solving.

00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:41.536
They will be putting ideas into action.

00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:43.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This one is much longer
than the other one you were using.

00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:48.026
&gt;&gt;They will have lots of tools and
manipulatives that they can work

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:50.546
with to help them understand the ideas.

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:55.266
As they undertake these tasks,
they're building both the social

00:03:55.266 --> 00:04:00.526
and emotional foundation and they're
also building cognitive abilities.

00:04:01.036 --> 00:04:04.646
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Any volunteers who
are open to a priority list?

00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:09.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, we have
Alex due tomorrow.

00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:11.296
&gt;&gt;These are all skills
that can be taught.

00:04:12.306 --> 00:04:18.716
These are as important as learning
your ABCs and your arithmetic facts.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.576
&gt;&gt;Student: It's 80 so
it has to be under.

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:21.400
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Nice.

00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:23.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So it's important
to understand

00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:26.106
that even though somebody says
something you might disagree with,

00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:32.296
everybody's contributing to this
shared dialogue in this safe space.

00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:39.356
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: Today, we have a
very big task in front of us,

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:42.246
but it is a very positive
and optimistic task.

00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:44.186
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good morning, friends!

00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:45.200
&gt;&gt;Students: Good morning.

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:46.976
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: Because
we now have a knowledge

00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:51.096
of how children become
learners and the opportunity

00:04:51.196 --> 00:04:54.436
to create an education
system that's informed

00:04:54.436 --> 00:04:56.326
by a knowledge of the developing brain.

00:04:56.326 --> 00:04:59.346
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So that's
collaboration and compassion.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:02.000
&gt;&gt;Students: Yay!
