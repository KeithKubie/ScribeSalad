[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:09.920
ALEXEY KOKIN: Hello, everybody.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.150
It's great to see you here.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.550
My name is Alexi, and I'm
with Google Play Business

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.460
Development team.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.820
We work with the top
developers across the globe

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.960
to help them grow
on Android platform.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.510
App quality in our Android Deca
System is top priority for us.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.210
If you have been following
our blogs and announcements

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.930
in this year, you probably have
noticed two important messages

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.860
that we gave--

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.310
one in Q1 and second
a few months ago--

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.210
that we are going to move away
from just installs and user

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.620
ratings in Google Play for
application rankings in Search

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.540
and other Google
Play collections.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.330
And we will start focusing
on more complex and focused

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.750
metrics, like engagement
or box performance.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.760
Today, we are going to
talk about in detail--

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.050
first of all, why it's important
for you to have a quality app.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.560
And we'll talk about what
new tools we have introduced

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.060
to help you troubleshoot some
issues in the applications

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.210
and also as criteria which
are measured towards your app

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.930
quality.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.020
And in the end, we will
discuss how can you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.090
benefit from having
a quality app,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.510
and what can really Google
Play give and reward you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.210
for investing a lot
of time and effort

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.790
and building quality
applications.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.010
First of all, let's
start from the basic--

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.200
why it's important to have
a quality application.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.140
There are a lot of
components that we

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.170
count towards the
quality of applications

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.370
inside Google Play.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.980
And we'll talk in more detail
about each and every of some

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.860
of those components today.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.970
So when we took a sample
of applications in Play

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.770
and measured their
performance, we

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.960
have seen that when
the application moves

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.010
from average app quality
to good app quality,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.380
they display an
amazing growth in some

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.490
of the most important metrics
for the application developers.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.340
For example, they have seen
up to seven times increase

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.500
in retention and up to six
times lift in the spending

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.759
side of applications.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.450
Those metrics alone can make
or break your application

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.670
in your entire
application business.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.200
So this is phenomenal,
and this is

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.880
one of the most
crucial things you

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.160
can focus on in growing up your
mobile application business.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.810
Our partners, with whom
we work on a daily basis,

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.670
they generally confirm our
ideas about applications.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.090
Some examples from them,
for example, [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.620
show significant
growth in user ratings

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.280
after performance improvement
of the applications.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.410
They already have a
high rating of 4.1,

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.170
and they managed
to grow it to 4.5.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.880
And that's actually
very great results.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.180
Those of you who work on
improving your application

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.750
ratings, you definitely
know how difficult

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.870
to grow when it's already high.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.010
Another partner, Zalando, they
have focused on reliability,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.820
and performance, and faster
launch, and elimination of bugs

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.050
make a lot of impact on their
business critical metrics.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.220
Not only they gain a lot of
traffic from Google Play,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.360
it also provided them
a positive impact

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.340
on the monitoring metric, on the
LTV lifetime [INAUDIBLE] users.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.620
It's clear for us that users
love great applications.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.410
They tend to use them more.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.140
And therefore, they tend to
use and poor them more goods

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.900
through such applications.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.010
And finally, the app quality
is the most important factor

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.370
for your application
rating in Google Play.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.570
Every Uber driver knows
that only one-star rating

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.510
hurts you more than a
five-star rating helps.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.810
And with the
statistics like that,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.010
50% of negative
reviews, as I mentioned,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.610
stability and box, and
60% of positive reviews

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.670
mention stuff like speed
design and performance.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.396
You know what to focus
on to get higher ratings

00:04:01.396 --> 00:04:02.520
and get a good quality app.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.700
Android Vitals is our
newest step in attempt

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.040
to help you build better
applications, which

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.410
we announced this May on
Google IU in San Francisco.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.660
This is an initiative by
Google to improve the stability

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.110
in performance of the
entire Android device

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.910
on entire Android Deca Systems.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.670
And you, as
application developers,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.350
are the important
part of this effort.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.070
We are starting by focusing
on the three main performance

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.840
areas for the requitals.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.260
Those are stability, and
battery, and renderings.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.990
By collecting a lot of
data from Android devices

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.745
all over the world,
we analyze and flag

00:04:41.745 --> 00:04:44.210
bad behaviors inside
the applications

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.730
to give you a little
bit more insight

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.970
how your app different
from other apps on Play,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.881
and what areas you should focus
on to improve your application

00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:55.380
quality.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.010
Our partners, again,
support us in this activity.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.110
And if you're speaking about
actual game or application

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.020
stability and performance
on device here,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.820
even the biggest
players on the market

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.960
can benefit on doing some actual
good work toward increasing

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.730
these numbers.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.230
For example, Kabam reports
massive growth on retention

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.750
after improving the
application performance.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.420
And everybody in this
audience should definitely

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.790
know how important
this retention

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.670
metric is for your application's
successful monetization.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.020
So our three main
areas-- our first

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.050
are is stability, where
we focus on crushes

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.300
and ANRs, Application
Not Responding--

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.050
when the application is
frozen for five seconds or so.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.270
Our second major
focus point is battery

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.440
because the main concern here
is not to overly, excessively

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.890
use battery of your device.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.170
And the third focus
area is rendering

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.800
because where you can really
enjoy your device when

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.620
everything is rendered
fast and smooth, at 60

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.000
frames per seconds.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.410
And a lot of
things, if you're UI

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.870
is slow one and
unresponsive, it definitely

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.540
removes some pleasure from using
the device for the application.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.750
So to track all of
those three major areas,

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.910
we've added new sections in Play
Console called Android Vitals.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.590
And so if there is
one thing you will

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.950
do after this presentation
is just you go and log

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.010
in into your developer
console, and check this section

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.300
for some new insights.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.560
I will consider my
mission a success.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.010
And if you will analyze some
of the data in this area

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.820
and plan some
performance improvements

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.020
based on the
statistic available,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.040
then, well, you are the best.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.380
And the best thing about Vitals
is that they already work.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.620
So you don't have to
implement new SDK.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.950
You don't have to
increase your APK size.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.700
You don't have to do anything
because those statistics are

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.220
available to you right
now for each and every

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.095
of your applications.

00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:05.660
We gather them from
Android platform

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.955
and from those users
who have opted in

00:07:07.955 --> 00:07:11.040
in sharing the diagnostic
information with us.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.220
So if you want to
help, you should also

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.310
opt in into this option
on your device too.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.330
It will help us,
and we will help you

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.900
with those data and statistics.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.750
So let's go to the
stability areas.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.620
And I probably will not be
focusing a lot on crashes

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.310
because each and every one of
you know how to handle crushes.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.732
You definitely catch them.

00:07:32.732 --> 00:07:33.440
You analyze them.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.970
You're trying to fix them.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.000
But ANRs, which we call the
application not responding,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.210
they happen when the
application freezes and stops

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.630
responding for input
because of deadlocks

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.340
or long operations
inside the applications.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.110
Those ANRs are definitely
disruptive for user experience.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.640
And they negatively
impact user behaviors.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.660
And other issue with ANRs is
that you typically cannot use

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.540
a crash report as the
key to catch them.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.750
But we can because the
platform reports ANRs to us,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.220
and we share this information
with you in Android Vitals.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.970
You can head over to the
ANR section of your console,

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.330
and you will see a lot of
information of the performance

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.570
and number of ANRs in different
job applications builts,

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.970
on different devices
and application,

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.470
and operation system versions.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.590
If there are a lot of ANRs
in one particular built,

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.670
we will definitely flag it
as with exclamation point.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:36.360
And we generally consider
that a lot means more than 5%.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.179
So if something
is above 5%, it's

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:43.630
definitely something to focus
on and to analyze about.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.720
There are a lot of additional
statistics in this particular--

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.381
here, you can see, for example,
your crash-free and ANR-free

00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:49.880
rate.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.360
And you can drill down to
see some additional stats

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.640
about how many
users were impacted,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:01.700
and what devices and Android
versions were affected.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.630
That's all about ANRs, but there
is one fundamental question.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.510
How much do they matter?

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.900
And we have found out that
they matter actually a lot.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.560
And we have analyzed some of
the applications on Google Play.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.830
And we saw that applications
with high ANR rates--

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.220
again, about 5--
they are around 30%

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.480
more one-day uninstallations
than more stable apps.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.650
So if you want to avoid having
a lot of uninstallations,

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.520
focus on those and
eliminate crashes and INRs.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.860
Even big developers,
for example,

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.470
like Twitter here is a
benefit from this information

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.840
and then benefit from
these statistics.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.170
And Android Vitals
and ANR help them

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.540
improve experience for actually
hundreds of millions of users

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.590
all over the globe.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.240
Next, to the battery--

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.190
it's a top concern
for us at Google,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.040
and our Android team
is working constantly

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.550
on making some good improvements
to increase the battery

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.430
life of each and every device.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.420
And the best way to
keep the battery alive

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:13.920
is to shut down most of the
features, most of the hardware,

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.330
which is not used right now.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.280
But you, as an
application developer,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.949
when you need some
additional processing

00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:21.740
power for your
applications, you definitely

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.100
can keep the device alive.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.060
And in case of
some trouble, there

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.260
are two bad behaviors which can
cost significant battery life--

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.200
stuck wake locks and
excessive wakeups.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.020
Wake locks-- you
definitely know that you

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.130
can keep the device awake
when you need some processing

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.330
power to do something
within your applications.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.050
There is a full wake lock,
which is not that bad.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.530
When the full wake lock
is performed on device,

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.710
the screen is on, and the
user is usually actively using

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.420
the device-- like
playing a game,

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.170
or driving a car with the screen
on, or watching some videos.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.684
And the user knows that,
well, he's doing something

00:10:59.684 --> 00:11:00.350
with the device.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.600
And probably, he wasted
all of the battery.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.360
So it's not a high
priority concern.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.650
The high priority concern
is partial wake lock,

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.910
when the screen is off,
but the application

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.670
is still doing something
in the background.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.770
And sometimes, this
activity can stuck,

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:21.960
and this wake lock can work
for really a long time--

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.660
for example, more than an hour.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.450
And when the wake lock is
stuck for more than an hour,

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.680
we definitely flag
it as a bad behavior

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.020
inside the applications and show
it to you in Android Vitals.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.420
Again, if you head to
the specific section

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.640
of the development
console, you can

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.730
see a lot of statistics,
where we show you

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.920
how many stuck wake locks
you've had in your applications,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.680
the particular build and the
particular Android version.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.635
The good behavior
is to have a wake

00:11:51.635 --> 00:11:53.520
lock for less than one minute.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.380
It's optimal for
battery-saving perspective.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.040
And if there is a wake
lock for more than an hour,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.190
it's something
definitely going wrong.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.410
Why is it important?

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.170
We had our own internal study
for all devices inside Google.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.820
And we have found out that in
30% of cases, when the user had

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.970
issues with the
battery discharge

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:23.020
and with a low lifetime value,
low lifetime of the device,

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.670
it was caused by those
stuck wake locks.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:30.100
So keep an eye on them,
and try to our solve

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.400
this in order not to create
a bad experience for users.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.150
Other things are wakeups,
when you can wake up

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.170
the device in a
specific period of time

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.270
to perform some
kind of operations.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.310
Again, if you do
this more often,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.280
it will drain
battery more rapidly.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:52.340
And we look at that as bad
behavior for 10 or more wakeups

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.130
per hour.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.370
So if you do it
10 times or more,

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.890
it's something
you can definitely

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:02.320
look after and probably try to
decrease the amount of wakeups

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.610
in this case.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.050
Again, there are
statistics which show you

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.040
which specific API
causes the wakeup

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.170
and how many times per hour.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.730
And the worst case
scenario is, of course,

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:19.300
if you have a wakeup,
which then becomes stuck.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.550
Then, it really means
that the battery will be

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.790
drained in a really fast way.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:31.190
So this is the main point to
avoid in terms of battery life.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.690
And the last thing, but probably
not the least, is rendering.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.170
And as I said
before, it generally

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.190
creates a very pleasant
feeling when the app

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.710
is running fast and smooth.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.770
We are tracking two
major points here--

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.990
the slow rendering
and frozen frames.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.570
And the slow rendering is
when 50% of frames, they

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:56.960
render with the time greater
than 16 milliseconds--

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.800
and a frozen frame, when
some specific frame is stuck

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.890
for 700 milliseconds or more.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.035
And if you have a lot
of those, again, we

00:14:06.035 --> 00:14:08.520
will flag it in the console.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.060
And you'll be able to see
how fast your UI is rendered,

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.810
and what is going on
with those frozen frames.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.220
In addition to
the frozen frames,

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.760
we will also note
the slow UI when

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.980
there is a UI thread which
has a lot of processing

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.670
activity going within
it, which decreases

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.050
the speed of rendering
of the entire interface.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.870
Again, this is
something to look for it

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.350
and probably move this
activity to the ground thread.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.840
So using Vitals to
identify and troubleshoot

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.410
app technical issues and
make the app more stable

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.930
is one thing which is
critically important now

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.900
when we're using it
actively to measure the app

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.790
success on Google Play Store.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:04.280
But there are other components
of application quality

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.580
which are equally important.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.060
And I'm going to talk about
them in the next session.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.550
So what's a quality app?

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.965
First things first--
reliability and performance,

00:15:13.965 --> 00:15:15.680
we already more
or less discussed

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.220
this using the Android
Vitals discussion.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.710
Then, there should be
some actual features

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.370
which users love.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.610
There should be some
beautiful design, which

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:29.430
follows our platform
guidelines, and as applications

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.790
should really focus on
supporting all the latest

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.100
features and technologies
platform has.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.950
This will create a wonderful
experience for the users,

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.280
and this will make the users
love your applications more.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.640
First things first,
the material design--

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.970
we have been speaking about
material design for two

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.410
or three years already.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:53.460
And in general, material design
got a lot of positive feedback

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.600
not only from Google itself,
but from independent designers

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.550
and developers all
over the world.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.000
There a lot of materials on how
to implement material design

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.080
and how to build
your applications in

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.170
according with our guidelines.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.280
And you can easily
find them online.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.370
Remember that just using some of
the pre-built components, which

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:19.110
are all provided to you
by material design team,

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.020
is not enough to
be fully compliant

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:22.950
with the requirements.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.554
In order to be really
design-focused,

00:16:25.554 --> 00:16:26.970
you should design
your application

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:32.100
from the ground up keeping the
main concept of material design

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:32.940
in mind.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.460
And having some
universal patterns

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.520
within the applications
on Android platform,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.270
having familiar patterns and
elements within the application

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.080
design really helps our
users to be more engaged

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.640
with applications on Android.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.480
And it really helps them to
start using your applications

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.240
faster--

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.910
result, big learning curve.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.430
Next thing, next big
thing is platform support.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.750
First of all, a quality
app is an up-to-date app.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.170
So you should always check
your application stability

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.970
and performance against the
latest version of the operation

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:10.690
system.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:14.319
And you should definitely
use the latest SDK

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.560
that is available to build
and compile the applications.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.910
In addition to that, there is a
lot of other Android platforms

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:21.740
out there.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.290
And the more of
them you support,

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.829
the better it is for
your application quality.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:30.340
Remember that there are plenty
of devices running on Android

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.720
out there-- wearables,
tablets, smart TVs, VR

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.490
devices, connected cars.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:41.110
Not every platform is of course
relevant for your application

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.870
use case.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.020
But when it is, consider
supporting the most relevant

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.320
platform because it will be
definitely a positive thing

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.740
for your application.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.070
For example, smart TVs, when the
user is using your application

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.410
not on a mobile device
but on smart TV,

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:00.790
the user tends to spend a lot
of time before a big screen.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:06.920
And it means a better engagement
for your entire application.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.490
Wearables-- wearables
are mostly--

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.940
I think in 75% of the
cases-- used for fitness.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.320
And if the user is buying
and using wearables,

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.410
he is definitely the most
engaged and most focused

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.420
users you can have
because he already

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.780
had several devices
which he uses frequently.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.170
Getting on the wearable
means your application

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.015
will stay not only on the wear
device, but on the smartphone

00:18:31.015 --> 00:18:31.560
too.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.750
And the users will return
to your applications

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.970
each time they go
for the workout.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:42.300
VR, there are a lot of
buzz words against VR,

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.780
and there are definitely
a lot of new use cases

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.750
which are emerging right now.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.870
VR has its own, very
specific usage pattern.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.620
So for example, users
will most definitely

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.510
have longer but less
frequent sessions

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.930
with your VR application.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:07.050
And there are a lot of new
ways to interact and display

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.710
your content to the users
within the virtual reality

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.000
environment.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.910
Next thing is monetization.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.690
And we definitely believe
that if a user loves

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.390
your application so
much, so he's actually

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.470
ready to pay for your
content or your services,

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.450
it's a great indication of
your application quality.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.230
So when you pass a
certain threshold

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.985
in selling your premium app,
or through in-app purchases,

00:19:34.985 --> 00:19:36.570
or through
subscriptions, we will

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.290
start counting it towards
your app quality rating

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:46.740
and supporting of Android
Pay for relevant scenarios

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.870
in the countries where
Android Pay is available.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.850
And I want to remind
you that Poland

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.370
is one of the first
countries in Europe

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.040
which actually launched
and supported Android Pay.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.170
It's all so great,
and you should

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:03.002
focus on experimenting with this
new and interesting technology.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.430
Next thing is to think
about the easiness of usage

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.430
for your application
for your users.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.100
Use technologies like Smart
Lock and signing in with Google

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.010
to enable the users
to create accounts

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:23.270
or sign in into your
profile faster and easier.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:27.770
And focus on communicating with
the users who are leaving you

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:33.170
feedback and maybe raise
some issues in their reviews

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.850
to keep your rating above four.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.760
So when your application
rating is four or more,

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.220
it basically opens you
each and every door

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.850
for all featuring activities
for collection inclusions

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:44.900
and stuff like that.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.010
So this is important.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:50.670
And talking with users in their
own language in the reviews

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.900
sections will help you
provide great feedback

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.550
and communicate with them.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.240
Moving from the application
itself to some tools

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.470
you have in your Google
Play listings and metadata.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:08.090
First of all, there are a lot of
things, videos, graphics, texts

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.880
you can add to your
Google Play listing

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.420
to make it engaging
and interesting.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.630
Then you can use A/B
testing to see what works

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.260
and what doesn't on
this specific listing.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.330
And you can beta test your apps
for alpha and beta channel.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.790
The Play listing has a
lot of things to work on.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.730
And when you're starting to
think about your App Store

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:37.350
optimization, this is your
number one destination.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:42.570
Title, I can feature graphic
videos and stuff like that.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.710
They all can be
localized and present it

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.830
to each user in each particular
country in their own language.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.160
This, of course,
does wonders in terms

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.470
of organic store conversion.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.770
And to see what works
and what doesn't, you

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.820
can use A/B testing to run
some experiments as globally

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.520
or in a specific
language and understand

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.780
what specific graphic
screenshot, or text, or title

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:14.940
works better for a specific
region and specific users.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.140
Why it's important?

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.920
Because it's one
of the best things

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.720
to improve your organic
conversion rate.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.540
17% for Wallapop here is not
the top number you can get.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:30.600
There are some developers who
get up to 30% more conversions

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.130
after fully optimizing
their Google Play listings.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.180
And remember, for
successful experiment,

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.670
you should have a
clear hypothesis

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.250
which you are testing.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.310
And you should have some
really different variations

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.900
of a design you are testing.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.090
They shouldn't be very
similar, or results

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:51.670
won't be very conclusive.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:56.080
And the last session
of our presentation

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.710
is to talk about what you can
get from creating the best

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.130
quality app.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.420
There are main things
and main benefit

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.020
of having a healthy app.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.800
It's through getting
more visibility in search

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.670
and automatic discourage tools.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.550
You can get featured by
our Google Play team,

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:19.360
and you can get recognized
and receive certain award

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.050
from our colleagues.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.590
So first thing first, is the
visibility, promotability,

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.020
and discoverability.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.460
The better your app
quality rating is,

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.590
and the better your Android
Vitals, and the better iUsers

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.420
review, the more
traffic you will

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.710
start getting from Google
Play Store organically.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:46.360
As I told in the beginning of
our presentation, engagement,

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.970
app quality, Android
Vitals crashes,

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.360
all things like that,
they impact the ratings

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.790
in, first of all, in the search.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:58.060
So when the user searches
for applications,

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.240
we use a lot of criteria
to rank applications.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.870
And having everything great
in terms of applications

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.880
will help you boost your
application to the top,

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.550
and get more traffic,
and get more visible.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.460
In addition to this, there are
a lot of different collections

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.980
inside Google Play Store.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.950
For example, an app like
Travelers, app for work,

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.880
app for leisure,
and stuff like that.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.420
And around 90% of
those collections,

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.800
they are now automated.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.490
So they are created through a
machine-running algorithm which

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:39.760
pick up applications and
group them for a similar theme

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.730
or similar functionality.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.420
And in order to get in
those collections more,

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.920
you should have a
better app quality

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.730
because those algorithms they
prioritize high-quality apps

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.670
before average quality
apps for inclusions

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:55.960
in those collections.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.930
And again, each and
every Google Play user,

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.590
they see a different Google
Play Homepage each time they

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.720
open the Google Play Store.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.550
And we try to shows
them the content

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.040
they might be more
interested in.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.740
So having quality apps
means you will be included

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.720
in more automated collections.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.250
And those collections
will be shown

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:19.930
to the users who are the most
relevant for your application

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:20.810
use case.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.400
And this will get you not just
regular installation, not just

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:30.560
regular organic traffic, but
focused and relevant traffic

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.110
with users who are more
likely to stay and use

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.156
your applications.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:43.740
Next thing is you can get
featured and be included

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.710
in those collections, which
are currently not automated,

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.260
and which are curated
and handpicked

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:54.330
by our merchandising team and
my colleagues within Google Play

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.850
Business Development
and Merchandising.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.840
Each and every app which
is nominated for featuring

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.200
goes through an extensive
review from our tech ops team.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.920
And tech ops team
analyzes its app quality,

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.050
analyzes its design
and its features,

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.450
and provides some
of the feedback,

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.470
and provides some of the
requirements for improvement--

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.170
which doesn't deliver to the
developers before the app gets

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:18.870
featured.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.110
If those requirements
are met, the application

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.660
is included in some of
our future collections--

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.270
for example, like new
and updated collections--

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:31.990
and get a lot of traffic
during the featuring period.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.190
Again, app quality
was always a factor

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:36.930
for our featuring requirements.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:40.980
And now, we have a lot of,
well, formal requirements.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.730
For example, your rating
should be more than four.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.680
You should have a good rating
in terms of Android Vitals.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.750
So getting your apps up-to-date
in terms of app quality

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.230
is the number one
priority and number

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:59.220
one required prerequisite
before getting featured.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.210
Again, featuring is usually
very important for developers

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.820
in terms of marketing
and optics perspective.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.030
So if you get featured,
it's a great story

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.560
for a Facebook post.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.480
And you can definitely
feel appreciated.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.430
But the traffic you can get
from, well, a week of featuring

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.720
is usually--

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.220
well, it's quite big of course.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.400
But the traffic
you get organically

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.010
from improving your
applications over the course

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.110
of several months,
of several years

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:31.070
of being prioritized in
searches, also included

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:35.580
in the automated collections,
is generally better, bigger,

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.920
and more valuable than this
one-time featuring boost.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.050
So working on app
quality for featuring

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.750
is great because it
gets you visibility.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:50.610
But long-term benefits
of having quality apps,

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.740
they deliver better
results over time.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:58.740
And the last thing
currently is you

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:04.230
can get recognized and get
specific award in the Google

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.800
Play.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.490
Currently, we have two types
of awards and recognitions.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.320
First of all, it's
Editor's Choice,

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.450
which is done by our colleagues
in Google Play Merchandising.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.740
And we usually give
the Editor's Choice

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.580
to the most trending
application.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.340
So if there is one app or
game which gets a lot of buzz

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.710
on social media,
which is new and hot,

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.190
it can get into
Editor's Choice and be

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.100
featured as an Editor Choice
application for the week.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.400
And there is
another award, which

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.590
is called Android
Excellence, which

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.920
we have launched just
a few months ago in May

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.610
of this year--

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.450
which showcases
best Android apps

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.480
on the platform, which
are the best in terms

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.170
of application quality,
design feature, reliability,

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.310
and user feedback.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.880
So getting the Android
Excellence Award

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:06.150
is quite hard in terms of,
well, effort and activities

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.690
you have to do in order
to get this recognition.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:15.990
But those awarded applications
are really the best Android

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.280
apps there are.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.490
And if you are looking
somewhere for inspiration,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.860
or if you're looking
for best practices,

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.220
just head out to the
Android Excellence

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.840
portion of the
Google Play Store,

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.380
and check it out because there
are definitely applications you

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.010
can check, you can download.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:39.450
And you can probably reuse
some of their know-how

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.000
in your own applications.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.270
That's about all.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.810
We will have some office
hours later this day.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.300
And if you have some additional
questions about how featuring,

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.190
how Google Play works,
how to get featured,

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.560
and how to improve your
applications quality, please

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.060
come in.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.330
And we can discuss
it one-on-one.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:04.200
Thank you.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.100
