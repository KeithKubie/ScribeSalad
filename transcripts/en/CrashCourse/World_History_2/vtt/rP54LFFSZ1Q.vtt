00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.729
Hi, I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:07.290
about our old friend, the rise and fall of
civilizations.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.000
And we're going to look at it through the
lens of War! No, just kidding, resources.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.540
Really Mr. Green? Haven’t we MINED
that topic enough?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.950
JMG: I see what you did there, Me From the
Past, and I do like your puns. I don’t like

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.130
much about you, but I like puns.
But we do talk a lot about resources and environmental

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.910
issues in this series, because, you know,
uh, they’re important.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.940
you know, because we just have the one planet
on which to have history, but today we’re

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.489
going to switch things up by looking at time
periods and regions, and a resource that we

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.199
haven’t examined before.
Rather than like food or animals or precious

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.179
metals, today we’re going to talk about
water, without which we wouldn’t have food

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.620
or animals.
And precious metals would be of very limited

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.269
use, because we also wouldn’t have humans.
And we’re going to travel to the classical

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.379
Mayan and Khmer civilizations in Central America
and South East Asia respectively.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.280
Well, we’re not actually going to travel
there because we don’t have the budget for

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.560
a time machine.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.960
So, not only would we die of thirst without
water, we also need to have enough of it around

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.000
to raise plants and animals, because, you
know, that’s how we eat.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.469
Some places get enough rain to support agriculture,
but the vast majority don’t, which is why

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.240
irrigation is often a requirement for building
cities and stuff.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.990
And then there are places on Earth that get
too much water, often because seasonal rains

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.829
cause rivers to flood. And in these places
people need to build dams and levees to control

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.740
the flooding and also to channel the extra
water to places where it can be useful.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.500
These kinds of projects, like, reservoirs,
wells and cisterns are all examples of water

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.289
control, or what some people call “hydraulic
engineering.”

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:38.810
hydraulic engineering was necessary, and people
have been remarkably ingenious when it comes

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.829
to agriculture. So, we know that we need agriculture
for cities, and what we call civilization,

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.780
and in most places, some form of hydraulic
engineering is necessary for agriculture,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.090
which means it’s necessary for everything
that comes after.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.520
But water isn’t only for drinking and eating.
Like, those of you who remember the Indus

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.200
Valley episode recall that Mohenjo Daro featured
a giant basin that we called the Great Bath,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.609
which historians believe had a ritual function.
And even if it didn’t, bathing is important

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.170
for keeping clean. You know, one of the things
that we use water for is sanitation and hygiene.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.810
And in dry regions the ability to control
water can be symbolic of wealth and power.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.730
I mean, look at Las Vegas.
Why do you think there’s this fountain at

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.510
the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas in the middle
of a desert? It’s a way of bragging. Look

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.850
at all of the money we took from you at our
casino.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.050
But, quite a while before that, the Mayans
managed to build a remarkably complex culture

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.480
in one of the world’s least hospitable regions,
and they couldn’t have done it without water

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.260
management.
Mayan culture reached its peak between 250

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.790
and 900 CE, and it was centered in the Yucatan
peninsula in what is now Mexico and reached

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.840
into parts of what today are Guatemala, Honduras
and El Salvador.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.430
The Mayans developed complex mathematics primarily
used to create calendars that do NOT predict

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.400
the end of the world. And they also had a
writing system, which described their religion

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.180
and their rulers, the Holy Lords, who were
both political and religious leaders.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.260
When the Mayan civilization collapsed it was
not because all the people died out – you

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.760
can still find many a Mayan today – but
because these Holy Lords lost their authority,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.000
At which point the Mayans stopped living in
their massive temple complexes. But we should

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.130
start at the beginning. Let’s go to the
Thought Bubble.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.340
So as we mentioned before, the Yucatan is
not an ideal place to build a civilization.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.040
Most of it is a karst plain with a bedrock
of limestone. The soils are poor and the water

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.420
table is too low to excavate wells without
modern digging equipment. There aren’t many

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.040
rivers and rainfall is highly seasonal, with
torrential downpours during the unpredictable

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.460
wet season and a long dry season.
Much of Mayan agriculture was small scale,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.800
but it produced enough surplus to provide
tribute for the Holy Lords. Archeological

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.170
records show that by 1000 BCE people were
digging ditches to drain swamps, and settlements

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.040
were built in such a way to capture rain runoff.
Tikal is one of the major Mayan centers that

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.110
has over 3000 structures in its 16 square
kilometer footprint. It took generations to

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.820
build and it “entirely lacked a natural
supply of water: no springs, rivers, or lakes

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.760
in its immediate vicinity.” So to supply
water for the estimated 60,000 people who

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.810
lived and worked there they created reservoirs.
But, a diverse environment meant diverse solutions

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.560
to water issues. At Edzna they built cisterns
to capture rainwater and canals to connect

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.010
reservoirs to the central ceremonial complex.
They were able to collect 2 million cubic

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.830
meters of water from runoff.
At Palenque, in the lowlands of Chiapas, Mexico,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.690
they built “aqueducts, dams, channels, drains
and a bridge,” to control flooding caused

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.240
by streams that fed the city. In all these
places, water management required a lot of

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.650
labor. How much of this was cooperative and
how much was coerced, we can’t really say.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.760
Thanks, Thought Bubble. Another thing we can’t
really know for sure is the role that water

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.200
played in Mayan politics and religion, but
we can make some educated guesses.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.970
Mayan art features a lot of water motifs,
so much so that one scholar has described

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.260
the Maya as “having a fascination with aquatic
iconography.” It is also possible that the

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.950
authority of the Holy Lords rested largely
on their ability to control water.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.180
Anthropologist Lisa Lucero suggests that the
Holy Lords controlled the reservoirs and distributed

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.700
water to the people during the dry season
in return for tribute in the form of food

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.540
and labor.
If this was true, it was a dangerous game

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.160
for the Holy Lords, because basing your claim
to power on an ability to bring rain can get

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.160
you in trouble when a drought comes along.
And, of course, that’s what happened. Mexico

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.810
can be particularly vulnerable to drought
related to our old historical actor friend

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.360
El Nino.
And scientists, oh it’s time for the Open

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.910
Letter.
But first let’s see what’s in the globe

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.470
today. Uh-oh, it is a warm swirl of water
off the coast of South America. An Open Letter

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:50.470
to El Nino.
Hey El Nino.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:02.510
Right, so scientists, using tree rings and
ice cores have figured out that the Yucatan

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.490
did suffer a series of droughts that correspond
to the decline of Maya power.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.760
As impressive as the Maya were, in some ways
they pale in comparison to the Khmer culture

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.139
that flourished between 802 and 1327 CE in
what is now Cambodia.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:53.139
The Khmer are best known for building the
temples at Angkor, most famously Angkor Wat

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.300
the largest religious building ever constructed.
But almost as impressive were the reservoirs

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.240
surrounding the temple complex, especially
the West Baray which is 8 kilometers long

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.460
and 2 kilometers wide and at one point held
more than 48 million cubic meters of water.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.260
The water issues in Cambodia are different
from those found in Mexico, but the amount

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.490
of labor and care that went into dealing with
them is the same. And like the use of water

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.380
in Mayan complexes, the function of the barays
is not fully known.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.650
On a functional level, it’s not clear if
they were used for irrigation during the dry

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.949
season or flood control during the monsoon.
And it’s also possible that they served

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:35.300
a religious function, being “an attempt
to recreate heaven on earth.”

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.449
We don’t know a whole lot about the people
who lived at Angkor except what we can glean

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:43.240
from a few of the relief carvings and a Chinese
written account from the 13th century, but

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.979
most of them were peasant rice farmers.
Angkor Wat was built by king Suryavarman II

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:52.419
in the 12th century, so it was a relatively
late addition, and came after the construction

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:56.430
of the West Baray a century earlier.
Modern archaeological techniques, including

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:01.120
imaging from space have revealed that the
barays and moats surrounding the temples,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:08.120
most of which are gone today, were linked
by a series of channels. What they don’t

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:14.680
reveal is their function.
Bernard Philippe Groslier, who characterized

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.290
Angkor as a “hydraulic city,” thought
that the barays were built to catch monsoon

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.400
water that would be used to irrigate rice
during the dry season. He was influenced by

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.100
Wittfogel and assumed that a great deal of
centralized control was needed to provide

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:33.100
food and water for a population that he estimated
at 1.9 million people.

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:36.999
Sounds like a good theory, but it was challenged
by anthropologist W.J. van Liere who argued

00:08:36.999 --> 00:08:41.469
that religious considerations probably determined
the layout of the barays because they were

00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:45.999
not well situated for irrigation.
Probably the best answer is that the hydraulic

00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:48.670
system served multiple functions, controlling
floods, providing irrigation, and creating

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.350
a sacred ritual space.
As with the Maya, we don’t know exactly

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.129
what led to the decline of the Khmer, but
environmental factors probably played a role.

00:08:57.129 --> 00:09:01.819
We know that monsoons weakened in the middle
to late 14th century, and also that droughts

00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:04.350
would sometimes alternate with intensely wet
monsoon years.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.449
It is likely that the increasingly complex
hydraulic system at Angkor just couldn’t

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:12.059
keep up with the fluctuations. This may not
have directly led to the end of the line of

00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:13.759
Khmer kings, but it wouldn’t have helped
them to maintain their power.

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:18.379
Humans can’t survive without water, and
just as it was a major concern for classical

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:24.279
civilizations, water control remains an issue
for the present and, especially the future.

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:30.430
One billion people do not have access to safe
drinking water and “by 2025 more than half

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.180
the world’s nations will face shortages
of fresh water...”

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.309
So, if we believe that environmental shifts
and failing water control systems led to the

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:45.389
collapse of classical civilizations like the
Maya and the Khmer, then we might be worried,

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:49.829
given our current voracious thirst and poor
record of water conservation.

00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:54.420
One lesson we might draw is that it’s a
bad idea to build cities in places that don’t

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.619
have water, Phoenix.
But, a look back at the past might give us

00:09:57.619 --> 00:10:01.279
reason to be optimistic. After all, the Maya
and the Khmer civilizations lasted hundreds

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.540
of years, and were able to provide water using
technology much less sophisticated than what

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.009
we have at our disposal. And we have something
else.

00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:10.550
As Steven Mithen, the author of the book on
which most of this episode was based has written,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.079
“we do have knowledge about the ancient
world to guide us in the present and future:

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.160
understanding the past enables us to see the
present more clearly.”

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.100
Now like all fans of history, I'm a bit biased on that subject, but I tend to agree.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.580
And so we need to understand that history is not just about humans interacting with each other,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:32.180
but also about the ways that humans interact with the larger world.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.800
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.920
Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis and

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.640
it's made possible by our Subbable subscribers, including our lead sponsor for today's video

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.700
Mrs. Booth, who wants to thank Sunda, Burgoon, and the SCHS World History AP students

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.380
or being awesome. And co-sponsored by Mike Burns from the Concordia School in Shanghai

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.700
I want to say a special thank you to all of our Subbable subscribers, especially the educators.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.740
And as we say in my hometown, don't forget to be awesome.
