Speaker 1:          00:05          You're listening to radio on New York public radio, public radio,W , N, y.

Speaker 2:          00:21          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:21          This is the sound of a what's, what's this exact title of the piece? 3,580 this is the sound of 3,580 I'm knocking on an object that artists, Terry Wilcox hopes will be here long after we all turned to dust. It's actually fast. The bedrock, the engineering is, it will always stay on a 200 mile an hour wind and maybe like right here, it's like a nuclear bomb. 30 years ago, Terry and a few cranes lifted this 40 foot stick and plunged it into this boulder that we're standing on, which overlooks the Hudson. The George Washington bridge is to our right. The sculpture reflects the sun like a mirror and it's made out of two metals, aluminum on the outside and magnesium. The pieces, the concept is simple. One day, many months from now. These two metals will be one, but phenomenon is they're mixing together. How do you mean physically there?

Speaker 1:          01:09          The layers where the metals are touching, they're physically intermingling, they're evaporating into each other. It's a process called diffusion and I've got to tell you how I heard about it. Uh, in 1968 they've opened some minor tomb and Egypt and they find golden led bars piled up in the corner. The tomb was about 5,000 years old and the bars had become a solid piece. They think it's happening on an atomic level, but they're not sure, but something is making the metals mix. Maybe just time, time cracks. Foundations are roads, borders erases anything. Man Creates civilization. Art, particularly art time hates art. That's why museums have restores. But here's Terry tried to collaborate with time. In fact, he says this piece won't be done until time takes the aluminum in. The magnesium infuses them together, which he calculates will take 1,495 years. In a sense that is when this clock will chime.

Speaker 1:          02:10          But until then, all you can really do is look at it. So we walk around this piece, oh, somebody made it up, up on this side. God bless you. Think they scaled up there on the bolt. Sure. Says a bill, Bill number 98 or something underneath bill 98 I got to park officials have slapped on some antique graffiti paint and some of those paints. The wet Terry pulls out a pocket knife and starts to chip away underneath the paint. We find more graffiti with the graffiti and we find a bullet hole. This is a bullet. Gosh, somebody shot your art. That's pretty funny. Do you think it'll make it [inaudible] d 3,500 year journey? I have no idea. What do you think the world will look like when this piece is finished? Do you think any of these buildings that George Washington Bridge will be there? These buildings? No. While I tried to get Terry to philosophize with me, a group of kids approach [inaudible] how old are you guys? 15. Nobody. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:25          how long did it take to, to Macon? Uh, almost two years. And when he explains that it won't be done until these kids and their kids and 72 generations yet to come are all dead and gone. The reaction is interesting. How come you guys would touch, I mean what makes you want to touch it and grab it, make it seem this real. They begin to touch the sculpture, put their palms flat against it. A few even hug it to not cite you. See, but understandable and it comes through helps from the scene impulses. Terry's art has the graffiti of wanting to leave something of yourself behind. Send something of yourself forward into the future as if to say, I was here if only furniture

Speaker 3:          04:21          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          04:24          I'm Chad, I've, I'm rod and this is radio lab. Today on our program stories and conversations with people who swim upstream and the river of time, even though it's an impossible task and speaking of the impossible, here's my cohost Robert Krulwich and in this hour we will be having an argument with time. We will talk to scientists who say that time doesn't exist. We will talk to stubborn people who argue that, but maybe it exists, but we're going to pretty much refuse to notice and we'll hear from a guy who thinks he can turn time around, turn it back or defeat it through sheer will. Then to get things started. Terry Wilcox, the guy we just heard from toward the end of our conversation, I asked him, what are you afraid of? A nuclear bomb maybe coming home, blowing everything away, your sculpture included and this is what he said,

Speaker 5:          05:09          no, what scares me are the guys out at Stonybrook. We were just at our dinner, two of these physicists who have the government funding and are trying to create a universe. I'm not kidding. You know, they're called like, you know what happened the last time a universe is created? And he says, yeah, they were kind of worried about that. They may do very well

Speaker 4:          05:26          odd things. It's Stonybrook, so it's e which is, um, the location of one of the big super colliders in the eastern United States at Brookhaven is called Robert Krulwich. Yeah. And so I went on the tour with the tour guide was named Todd. He was wearing, as I remember, a Hawaiian shirt and shorts. Now that it was a little freezing, but he said, all right, let's, let's, let me show you around so we can give you a little tour around our rig. It's two and a half miles around is almost the size of the Indy 500 race track and we drove alongside a tube. I guess that's what it was. It was maybe 2025 feet high, kind of like a tunnel covered with grass, just driven around the once and it took her, I don't know, about 10 15 minutes to get all the way around. Now imagine doing that 78,000 times a second and you're a prototype.

Speaker 6:          06:20          I have never been approached on, but this does sound a fast and because this is a collider, the idea here would be to have the proton collide or bump into something with such force in such violence that for one instant it gets very hot, hotter than the center of the sun, as hot as it got near the instant of creation. And that's why this is called the super collider.

Speaker 4:          06:52          The universe one day was there, right? You can't get before, right. That's mystery line and that's, that's what physicists call a singularity. Everything breaks down and principle. Unless, unless you're God, you can't look behind that because time doesn't even exist. Times he says to have meaning, then she want a chip toe right up to the beginning. You can't get to the actual beginning, but to the first instance, it's the instant after the beginning, right? We have a pretty good idea of how the universe looked up to a few seconds after the Big Bang and what we're doing here is we're getting down into thousands of a second after the big bang.

Speaker 4:          07:38          We're in a huge empty room. What roughly the size of a blimp hanger. A blimp hanger small blimp, and we are at one of the collision points right now, right? One of the collision points right now has only about 45 or 50 feet that way. That's the place in the collider where they expect to see these smash ups between two protons and it's at these points you should get just for an instant. The heat and the debris and the chaos. That's kind of like what the universe was like at the very beginning of time. This is the closest to the beginning of the universe you'll ever get. Give me a football and you can make a pass into the early universe.

Speaker 4:          08:20          There's a kind of a funny sense like of Eden that physicists have about the very first instance of the universe. Um, do you think that the beginning was more beautiful than now? I mean, now it's pretty nice, but for some reason I noticed that people who do what you do love the beginning. Well, why is that? They love the questions. We can explain in a physical sense using our little mathematical equations. Almost everything that we see now, what we try and do is we try and smash our rocks hard enough to get some glimpse of what happened then because that's the untold story. In the beginning, there was a kind of, um, simple beauty, very simple. So one of the motivating thoughts behind all these questions is, can I see it before it got complicated? Is that a part of this? That's, that's a deep part of it. The further back you go, you hope, the simpler the explanations become, the more beautiful. In some sense, the modern world is ruled by complexity and chaos. The interactions of billions and billions of particles ending up in this conversation among other things. And none of it is really predictable because it's very, um, it's, it's, it's complexity of its finest. So we're looking for the simple origins of things and then you get the, um, uh, in some sense being cast out of Eden by having all of those simple things coming up and creating very, very complex situations.

Speaker 4:          09:56          The world we have now has so many elements in elementary particles and rules and forces. It's messy. That's now.

Speaker 7:          10:03          Then it was just nicer.

Speaker 8:          10:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          10:09          moving right along. Here's a story about a guy whose like these physicists trying to move backwards to a simpler time. And his trajectory is not without its collisions too. He's not a physicist though. He thinks about physics. He's an artist. A painter sells paintings for thousands and thousands of dollars. But you might say that David McDermott's greatest work of art is himself, his obsessive devotion to living as if the president never happened. It's like standing at the shore and trying to keep the tide from coming in. It's impossible. But if you do it fiercely enough, it's also a little heroic Swedish producer. Marcus Lyndon visited David McDermott at his 19th century home in Ireland walking into David McDermott's house. It's like stepping into an old photo.

Speaker 9:          10:58          Brad [inaudible]. You're coming. I can go warm. We start in front of the fireplace. Fire Heat. Get your warm, very pointed. David wears a green flannel dressing gown, a white knight cam and a Fox spur around his neck. He sort of looks like a small old lady. When I sit and look into my fire, I can feel all the people that went for me and had their fires. That's the same fire that the earliest of human beings, right

Speaker 7:          11:32          looking at.

Speaker 10:         11:35          Most people do not need to live in the present. Most people don't need to live in the present. Everybody doesn't need to live in the present. You living in the past, I f I find secrets. I'm to learn his secrets, great things, useful, really good things. He shows me one of them. Well, for example, here's the chamber pot next to the bed. Yeah, at Blue Porcelain Bedpan. That's where the urine is. Through peeing through the night. He lifts the lid off and shows me his Pete from last night. Most people hold their urine through the night or they break their sleep and they have to get up and pass through the house to get to an electrified bathroom. By the time they get back to be completely broken, their sleep patterns, you can get out of your bed, you pee and you go back in your bed, but it's still enough time to stay in your dream.

Speaker 10:         12:40          He takes me to the bathroom to empty the bed pants. I mean here's a bit of something new. There's very few modern things. I mean here's something modern. You're just going to plastic this cap on the toothpaste. See Cause I was going to throw that away just to show you and I'll throw that away. Even though the toothpaste will dry at the top. You said that is what you've sacrificed, dry toothpaste, your the realistic fuel to get rid of that. How do you cope? This project seems so huge. It goes into so, so many details. So small details like the toothpaste, the cap being in plastic, but in the past was not put together by one person, wasn't put together by one person and I am in a position of having to cover all areas. And you think it's easy to put that 19th century world back together? Well, it's not at all. It's very, very difficult because there's no one around any any longer who all can do anything. I'm saying the past is so rich and so wealthy. Think that every year, 19 eight every year has some music, manners, science, magic, culture, architects. Every year

Speaker 11:         14:04          the contemporary people want to create more.

Speaker 10:         14:07          They can't even deal with what they have. Are we going to do the kitchen? Yeah. When he moved here a couple of years ago, he replaced everything new with something old. So you having fun now this was a whole modern kitchen and he ripped this out. He even had the newly renovated kitchen torn out out because it was too modern. There was a modern floor. I ripped the modern floor up and I found the old floor used to be a wall here and the door was, I made a conscious decision when I was 13 years old and I decided that I would never be able to compete in the modern world. I listened to my teachers at the school and they explained what the modern world was about and they told us that you had to constantly keep up with the moment, keep up with the moment, keep up with the moment or you would be destroyed by the society. And I thought to myself, well, I'll never be able to compete. I'm still cleaning up. Oh, I'm going to squish you some more. And so I thought, well, I'll go backwards. I'll talk to all the old people. I learn everything about the past and I'll go backwards.

Speaker 9:          15:20          I mean, I was already interested in the past. I loved history and I was very interested in what had come before. I looked at the photograph, the old photographs of my family and I thought, these are the same people, but what a different world. And I used to call the past when I was younger, I used to call it the place. Really. I called it the place and I would say I'm going to the place. And to me the place was the same as this world, but everything was was good. Eventually David stopped playing with kids his own age and instead stood outside beer halls and Harris alarms and talked to old people.

Speaker 10:         16:05          Cause there was a strange feeling I had when I was around these very old people. I felt like they knew something that I did know. I should tell you something else that is very interesting, which has to do with homosexuality and that is that I didn't see it in the world that I grew up in and I thought that homosexuality was something that didn't exist anymore. I thought that it was something from the past and it, and a lot of the books were medical books. It was all about treating it like it was a disease. So I thought it was some old disease that I had, you know, that was surfacing and I kept it a secret. I kept it a secret for you.

Speaker 9:          16:51          Like David opens up a closet and shows me these old costumes and party dresses from his younger days in New York. See, this is a shirt, 18th century and it's the exact same shirt that I just saw in a museum that belong to do or die. And this is so old that operate. It's just back in the 1980s he and his partner, Peter, were known in the art world as the time travelers. Did you ever meet anymore? I knew him. What was he like? He was a queen, but one point they were leading a group of 20 artists trying to recapture life in the 1920s horses in, in Brooklyn. We kept horses. We had carriages. We were riding all upstate on the road. These mad, worst carriages. That was something that was unbelievable. Now it's only him. Hello. Hello.

Speaker 10:         17:50          Well, oh, it's me and I'm sorry. And I'm waiting for this money to come in. You're not desperate, are you David?

Speaker 12:         17:58          Someone money. Okay. And paying him presents sort of a problem. An unhappy coalition between past and present. Let's not talk because we'll never get them on the buy side. Right. He refuses to use credit or the Internet, so he has to go to the bank to withdraw the cash in person. So we buy, David has lent me an old 19th century bike without any breaks. He bikes fast through the busy traffic streets of Dublin and I end up far behind him. We catch up later in the bank tellers nine so what was the other Russian boats? You have to withdraw money or, yes, I have to come to the bank to withdraw money when I need it because I insist on doing the banking old fashion. But don't if you're frustrated now when you're like right in the middle of a modern bank with a television going on and all these modern things surrounding us. No, it's just the way that you might have a nightmare. Yeah, this is, this is a nightmare. Leaving David's apartment, going to the bank and then returning is a little disorienting, like stepping in and out of a time capsule, safe and warm in his bedroom. He puts more coal on the fire and we sit down next to each other on the bed naked. Right now you're take that walk.

Speaker 10:         19:33          So in terms of time, I do believe that

Speaker 2:          19:39          we can travel in time. I'm not talking to you about actual time,

Speaker 1:          19:47          I'm trying to talk in terms of practical terms that everyone can participate in this, I call it time experimentation. Anyone he cleans can choose their period in history like watching a merchant ivory film and then stepping in

Speaker 10:         20:03          water to travel in time. We have to first except the principle. The time is here, has always been here and always will be here. In other words, this moment in time that we're experiencing has always been here and always will be. But this moment in time as you're listening now on the radio, on the asthma I voice comes across a wireless. This is a permanent fixture of the universe that I've always spoken on the radio and I always will speak on the radio and you will always be listening and you always have been listening. But, but Jake understand that concept. G understand the concept. I try to explain to him that I do his idea,

Speaker 12:         20:48          but only in theory. To me, time is linear. It just is. There is a past, a present and the future and you can't jump in between, but David says that way of thinking it's a trap. It's basically a death trap and you will die.

Speaker 9:          21:09          I love having you. You're, I'm having so much fun. We're in the library. The bookshelves are full of dusty, yellowed books, articles for documents and Scipio photos on one of the shelves, an old replica of a royal crown. This is probably something Midi with a red velvet. Then Jew was on the side. David tries it on. I can transform reality. This house and my man are with you. I am seducing you into the past. What do you think? I think it's, I think it's super interesting. We could be having still much fun in this world, you know, instead of the stupid world we're living in.

Speaker 7:          22:08          [inaudible] thanks to Swedish producer Marcus Lyndon. If you'd like to see pictures of David McDermott's artwork, check our website, radiolab.org I'm Jad Abumrad Robert Krulwich and I will continue in a moment. Okay. You're listening to radio lab on New York public radio, public radio, W and y c your school more to come.

Speaker 9:          22:36          Hello, this is Abdullah Lenay from Los Angeles, California. Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 7:          23:03          jet here with Rama Crow, which today on Radiolab stories and conversations about people who are defining time swimming upstream in the river of time, you might say. And there's an extreme group of people who say there's no such thing as time who deny it completely. We heard from one such person before the break. Here he is again. This moment in time that we're experiencing has always been here and always will be. But this moment in time, as you're listening now on the radio, this is a permanent fixture of the universe. That is David McDermott, uh, an artist, an eccentric one at that. So he's Kinda easy to write off. Well, I don't know. You don't have to write him off because let me write him back on. Very prominent physicist, Brian Green, for example,

Speaker 13:         23:46          professor of Mathematics at Columbia, author of many, many big fat books about this kind of stuff. He agrees with them. Well, here's the thing. Many of us who have thought about this have come to the conclusion that indeed the time that we seem to experience as a continuous flow is actually not a flow at all. In other words, I've always spoken on the radio and I always will speak on the radio. Each moment just exist. And you will always be listening eternally if you will. And you always have been listening. It's not that the moment comes to life at one moment in time that we call the present and then somehow drifts away into the past. Every moment is an is forever. But understand that concept. G, understand the concept. That's too weird. It's a tough idea. Let me just make it even tougher. Okay. Imagine if I go and just hold my breath that moment, which I just thought up. I think that moment could last in Brian's world forever. Have you exhaled yet? No. And the exhale could last forever. Somewhere you're always inhaling and somewhere you will be forever. Exhaling. A very, very strange notion, but it's the notion that some would argue was shared. My a guy I like to call Albert,

Speaker 14:         25:04          who Dane mentioned to [inaudible].

Speaker 15:         25:10          Well, it actually starts when Einstein was a child. Michio Kaku is professor of physics at City College in New York. We read a children's book, perhaps the most important children's book ever written in the history of the human race. It was a book written by a German guy, Aaron Bernstein, which asked the question, what would it be like to outrace a telegraph message in a telegraph wire? In other words, to outrace electricity.

Speaker 15:         25:34          This was only the beginning because in Einstein's head he thought of a different question. What would it be like to outrace a light beam? What would it look like? According to Einstein mythology, while normal boys worried about girls in jobs, Albert obsessed about light. For years. Then when he was 26 years old, finally he was about to go berserk. He told his friend best Besto that I am going crazy thinking about this problem for 10 years. Bern, Switzerland. That's where he and Besa were living at the time and working as patent clerk. The story goes one day, Einstein's riding the bus to work any gazes at the giant clock in the center of town. It's a very famous clock. Very pretty clock. You've probably seen pictures. No, lots of famous clock. Many people have speculated about that clock, but we found the letter a letter again to his friend bess.

Speaker 15:         26:23          I found the letters saying that yes, he was moving away from that famous clock tower in Bern, Switzerland, but putting past bicyclists, pedestrians and away from that big burn clock who's insistent ticking seem to rule the world below and then he had a thought. How would that clock look if his little bus suddenly zoomed off at the speed of light? You said, no, wait a minute. If this bus is traveling at the speed of light, then light from the clock will never reach me. Meaning the light from all the subsequent ticks on that clock would never catch up to his eyeballs. Therefore the clock will be at rest. The clock will be stationary forever, but strangely his pocket watch on his person. If you were to look at that, it would be ticking just fine. And then he said, quote, a storm broke in my mind, these are his exact words. A storm broke in my mind and the very next day he went to his friend Besso and says, I have solved everything. And what he said to his friend Beso, it's very simple but radical idea. Time beets at different rates, depending upon how fast you move.

Speaker 7:          27:33          If you go fast, your time slows down. Not just your clock but your time, your brain, everything about you, SLOs, and they've proven this. They've put clocks and airplanes flow in airplanes around the world had a clock in the ground when the airplane decelerated and landed and they compared the two clocks. They were different, a little different, but they were different. Now. Theoretically the difference could be thousands of years depending on how fast the plane was traveling, which raises a paradox. How can you have two completely different times and both of them, according to Einstein, are equally true, very, very puzzling. Because if you have a time that's true for you, right, and I have a time, it's true for me and they're different and they're different than what, what is it? What does time, what time do we have in common?

Speaker 16:         28:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          28:26          Einstein struggle with this very question from many, many

Speaker 15:         28:28          years and toward the end of his life going to miss you. Akaka, he dropped a hint for how he might've resolved it in his mind and it was at the funeral of his best friend Besa. Well, when vessel had died, Einstein gave half. What are the most moving eulogies? He said, time is an illusion that we who know. No, there is no distinction between the past, the present and the future. It's a very moving quote and he essentially saying that in some sense, Bessel, we'll live forever. Ever since then. We physicists have been trying to figure out what did he mean by that? Maybe Albert Einstein was mourning his friend here and just didn't want him dead. And this was just poetry. Yeah. But more likely it was, um, it was his guests about the nature of time, how to handle the contradiction of two very different moments, past moments present. Almost Brian Greene deals with this in his book, fabric of the Cosmos. The moments are they just exist and somehow it's the human mind in each moment that makes each moment seem real. December 31st, 1999 I was at a New Year's party and to this way of thinking,

Speaker 13:         29:43          I'll always be at that new year's party because that moment is, it exists. It's not that it's somehow goes away. My mind seems to organize things into moments that are gone in moments that have yet to be, but I think that's my mind. Organizing things. I don't think that's how the universe has put together the moments just are,

Speaker 17:         30:05          but look where that leaves us. That leaves us with everything that you've done in your life exists already. Yeah. Everything. Yeah. You're beginning your middle and your end. Every moment of time is out there. You're dead. You're dead somewhere. You're almost dead somewhere. Yes. There's no special. Now you are saying to me that there is no time, as I understand it, no time. Every moment of your life is already there. Eternally frozen. Every moment of my life is frozen. Every moment of my children's life is frozen and every moment of my great, great, great, great. Grandchildren's lives are already there and frozen and so the universe is a vast collection of nows now. That's right. And that that particular, no, that is just ridiculous. It just seems, first of all, it denies so many things. Denies the poetry of change. Don't you see what's terribly unsatisfying about that? That means you don't have any options. Yeah. Freewill is a very, a very difficult question to answer for a physicist. Are you happy with this in terms of free will? I'm very free. It was a very troubling issue. Well, you choose tonight to go to the movies and I say, let's go to see gone with the wind. You say, no, let's go see planets and tire of attack of the fraternity. The devils of the sheet levels. Don't you like to think that you're, that you have a real choice there?

Speaker 13:         31:37          I've gone to one. I would love to think it. Do I know for a fact that the thought and the impression of freewill is really real? No, I don't know that in my heart. I tell you, I don't really know that. I suspect it's real because it feels so real, but there are so many things about the universe that we thought were real until we learned that they weren't,

Speaker 17:         31:59          but what I want to know about the future is that I'm in some control of it. Yeah. I want to fall in love because I want to fall in love. I want to step across the sidewalk in front of that car because I want to commit suicide or whatever it is I want to do, and I don't want the have you or your pointy headed friends telling me that it's already there and I'm going to somehow move from instant, instant, all preplanned. Well again, the poetry disappears. Then the magic disappears and then most important of all, my command of myself disappears. Let me give you an old, the alternative

Speaker 13:         32:32          that reinstates some of the poetry, some of the freewill that you're longing for, and I got to, I long for the same thing and I do. I absolutely do. And I, and I feel like I have free will. I have, I feel like I have the ability to choose my next word. I feel like that can do that. Do I really have that freedom? I don't know. I think are doing. Perhaps that's enough. Just the illusion of the freedom. But anyway, let me paint a alternative, but highly related scenario. In quantum theory, some have suggested the so-called many worlds interpretation that the universe is not a single entity. There are many universes. We call them parallel universes. Each of the choices that you make is born out in one of these copies. All right, I'll give it to you. We're in a restaurant. I am sitting there and it's time for dessert. The waiter approaches and he says, would you like chocolate ice cream or vanilla? I think this over. If I choose vanilla

Speaker 17:         33:33          from then on, I'm in the Vanilla Universe, but if I choose chocolate, I'm in the chocolate units, so all the consequences that flow from my vanilla, I say vanilla and then somebody named Bonilla happens to come in and I fall in love with vanilla and I married vanilla. We have a lovely vanilla ethos, but if I choose chocolate, I go into a Mocha thing and I suddenly am living in the Caribbean. Right. All right, so this is a real divider for me. Don't you see that? This is like dumb. I mean like it's an easy, when you say dumb, can you just be more precise? There are many criticisms of this picture, but I want to know which one you have in mind. The reason I think it's done is is because it's like a pat solution. Like you say, okay, since I can't get you free will the old way. What I'll do is I'll give you a lot of universes so you can have it all. You can have the chocolate university, you can have the vanilla university.

Speaker 13:         34:21          A key thing is a key thing is this proposal which was put forward in about 1957 by a guy named Hugh Everett and then developed by many people price to whit and so on was not put forward in order to restore anything to do with free will. These physicists, very, very high powered create a physicist were studying quantum mechanics and they came to a puzzle. If quantum theory says there's a 30% chance you're going to pick the vanilla ice cream and say a 30% chance that you're going to pick the chocolate ice cream and say a 40% chance that you're going to pick pistachio, and yet when we look at the world and we look at what you do, you seem to choose one or the other. Where do the other possibilities that quantum theory said could happen? Where do they go? Do they just disappear? Did they disappear? Well, that is very hard to realize in the actual structure of quantum theory itself. You mean that physicists, when they order chocolate, do they then think, had I chosen vanilla my whole life could have been? No. They don't think that they say to themselves, at least the fellows that believe say, hmm, I chose Vanilla in this world, but there's another version of me that's now eating chocolate.

Speaker 13:         35:36          You guys are weird.

Speaker 4:          35:39          Well, hello there. My,

Speaker 18:         35:44          I've been alone

Speaker 4:          35:47          now to be fair to Brian at a quantum restaurant at a kosher quantum restaurant. That's really quantum. Are they really such things? I think for the purpose of this argument, they will be okay. Waiters will deliver you closed lids of ice cream and they won't tell you whether there's chocolate even though they both in there. They'll say mysteriously, I'm usually, I think I'll have chocolate. Chocolate pops into existence and vanilla goes away. So why? That's why quantum scientist wonder where things went because there's a mystery here, but that's another story. I'm sure your head is spinning. Yes, it is fitting. My head is spinning. D, do you feel it sometimes seems that Einstein was the point at which physics broke away from common sense? Everything you've just told me is utterly fascinating. And at the same time I really confusing. How do you live your life with knowing him? Do you compartmentalize everything that you study in this office?

Speaker 15:         36:34          Well, you know, um, late at night, um, I think about these things and it gives you the willies. I do think about the fact that there's an alternate meal out there. A clone of me except by chose totally different life paths and uh, yeah, I can write down the equations, the equations for these alternate universities where I exist in another universe. Perhaps Elvis Presley's still alive.

Speaker 19:         36:58          A man. And funny, I could ask that question. Is Elvis Presley alive and what are these universities? At that point I had to stop. I have to stop.

Speaker 7:          37:14          If this strikes you as a little too weird that there could be a bazillion Mishi was out there in the world in various universities doing various things all at once. One of them could be talking to me, but one of them could be talking simultaneously to, okay.

Speaker 17:         37:26          One of them might be impersonating. I was cause remember it an infinite number of universities, you can do an infinite number of things

Speaker 7:          37:32          that we should keep in mind. This is still just speculation. And as particle physicists, Lisa Randall likes to say,

Speaker 20:         37:38          I mean there's a big difference between physics and philosophy. You let that go away, you sort of lost. Um, the, the great thing that is there in terms of physics, which is the ability to actually make testable predictions about the world.

Speaker 17:         37:52          Oh wait, oh wait a second. If she wants a testable prediction about the world, there have been experiments and real science experiments I can thinking of one that was done in 1960 and was repeated over and over since then that examined freewill and time in a very interesting way. And by the way, this experiment created an uproar, especially among philosophers because it's kind of a doozy. It involves finger wiggling. So can I have a little mood music please?

Speaker 21:         38:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         38:20          the scientists invited a group of people to come to the lab and sit down and have their brains monitored. And then according to the neurologist vs Ramachandran, they turned to their subjects and they said, at any time you wish wiggle your finger. That sounds easy enough. Remember, by the way, that to wiggle

Speaker 8:          38:36          your finger takes two steps. First you have to decide to wiggle. Then you wiggle. So you have to think it before you do it, which takes what? Like a 10th of our millions of a second or something? Yeah, very short time. So you sit there and you think, okay, now I'm going to wiggle.

Speaker 17:         38:53          However, when we did this experiment, I may look back at the graphs of all the brains of the people who did this. What they found was your sensation that you asked your finger to your finger to wiggle your sensation. The will came a second after the brain kicked in. If you looked at my brain waves when I was wiggling my finger jet, here's what you'd see first. You'd see my brain getting ready to wiggle. There's a spike

Speaker 3:          39:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         39:18          or a blip is Ramachandra would say, that's my brain getting ready. And then second, you'd get a second spike showing the wiggle. So there's a blip.

Speaker 3:          39:28          Okay.

Speaker 17:         39:28          For Getting Ready. Yeah. And then there's a blip for wiggle. Now logic would tell you the way this should go is first I decide to wiggle, then my brain gets ready and then my brain wiggles. Right? But when they looked, what actually happens is before I decide to wiggle before my brain mysteriously is already getting ready. You, even though you think you're willing the brain to do something, it's your brain that's willing you to will. It's thinking ahead of you. And then your so called thinking is a postdoc. Rationalization. So I don't have any free will. You don't have any free both. That was the implication that the philosophers came by. Why can't you just say that? The brain is a, does a little bit of stuff before you aware of it. It just always does. It just takes a three quarters of a second to get going. This is fine for everything except the awareness or winning cause will by its very nature is a feeling that you are doing it. So imagine says Dr Ramachandran that you could, and it hasn't happened yet, but you could see your brainwaves in real time on a screen right in front of you in real time. Yes. No, the question is what's going to happen? Okay. I say, look, I want you to move your finger anytime you choose in the next three minutes. So you're sitting there thinking about nothing in particular.

Speaker 3:          40:47          Mm hmm.

Speaker 17:         40:49          Wait, whoa. I thought the wiggle was going to be just proceeded by the blip, but it was like a whole second before that. No, your brain is way ahead of you on this thing. Let's just to listen to this again cause it's a long pause.

Speaker 3:          41:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         41:04          we go. Then you say that blip was controlling me. Why the hell is free will even a simple thing like mowing my finger, I can't do on my own without the blood telling me ahead of time. You either going to say the blips controlling me or you're going to say the blip has ESP, but this gives you an experimental handle on something as a lose of his free will.

Speaker 22:         41:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          41:29          time here betrays fee will because your brain acted I head of your decision to act. You have no idea who's acting. It's just one of those weird, I don't think they've ever resolved this either.

Speaker 7:          41:43          Yeah, I dunno. Yeah. This, that's me very much in control of the pen in my hand. Beating it in the table. I just did that. Yeah. But if I were to put a graph in front of you, showing you your brain and there was a piece of your brain that anticipated that, and then what would you say? I would say that I'm their wrong. I guess. I don't know

Speaker 23:         42:11          if me, cause we have to take a break now. If we go to our fingers goodbye and we would think that we would think that it was our choice to legal. But the real question we should ask is who's who he clean?

Speaker 7:          42:58          chat here with Robert Krulwich Radiolab. We've been looking at the concept of time this hour, fighting against it, defining it and denying it. Our last story, however, Isabelle making peace with our place in the history of time. It comes to us from producer Ben Adair and it unfolds in a very, very old place. The Mojave desert.

Speaker 24:         43:20          These are old mining roads. Once upon a time hopeful and men and women looked for outcroppings of quartz iron, copper and when they found them. This is public land administered by the bureau of land management but BLM. They filed a claim and Doug follow e p 15 and you'll see the signs for the borough Schmidt tunnel between the years 1906 and 1938 a lone minor dug and blasted eight 2087 foot hole straight through a granite mountain. That tunnel was blocked. His name is Burro Schmidt and he first filed this claim in 1904 today. David airs digs here. He gets tours of Barista tunnel. He says, miners still roam news hills

Speaker 25:         44:06          and the way he got his name Burro, Schmidt, he always had two boroughs with them, Jack and Jenny. And of course once they died, a burrow didn't waste anything. So we ate them. And borough died in 1954. They had his, uh, funeral right in front of the tunnel entrance and a 1963, Tony and her husband came up for the next 40 years. She was up here and, uh, Tony died up here on her bed inside her house like she wanted to at the age of 95. That old woman is legendary. She was scared of nothing when she died up here. She didn't die alone. I was by her side and our granddaughter from Vermont was here too. And uh, but she never backed down from a fight. Uh, there was once when she was 75, she had a fist fight with a guy right in front of her house and she won the fight.

Speaker 25:         45:05          She cheated, but she wanted to fight. What'd you do? She had a role and nickels in her fist. But, uh, no, she never backed down from any fight. How long do you think you're going to stay up here? I gotta be out the 29th of this month. Really? Yeah. The BLM is going to take over the place and run it. They're gonna say burrows cabin. They're gonna Save Tony's house over there. Everything else is going to be bulldozed and cleared out, which is unfortunate because they're going to change the way history looks. This is basically the camp that an old woman built up. It's not supposed to be Disneyland. If you want Disneyland, that's an Anaheim. If you want a desert camp. This is just a way some of them look.

Speaker 25:         45:47          So this has been going on for a long time, this BLM stuff? Uh, yeah, quite awhile. Uh, Tony, since she lived here for so long, they didn't bother her. Uh, they just basically waited for her to die. She expected me to save the place and I was, I promised her that she would die on her bed up here like she wanted to. I kept that promise. The second promise I wasn't able to keep up. You know, I tried. In fact, a lot of people tried, Jeez, I'm never going to stop missing her. Never, you know, she was, there was no one else like her.

Speaker 6:          46:29          Mm,

Speaker 24:         46:30          David EHRs is gone now. But before he left, he looked over his ramshackle camp and told me, don't be sad. The days of the desert rat have already passed. What's here is just a corpse.

Speaker 14:         46:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          46:57          um,

Speaker 24:         47:03          people who spend time in then we'll have you start thinking differently about space. Huge stretches of land without a house, a telephone pole or high tension wire. You can close your eyes while sliding between mountain ranges at 80 or a hundred miles an hour. I'd love to drive death valley and a really fast car. A friend of mine said he really, really

Speaker 2:          47:24          fast car.

Speaker 24:         47:28          The valley is the best known part of the Mojave desert. Dropping down onto the valley floor from the West. You see huge salt flats below you. Reddish Brown mountains. Peak in the distance in between them. Huge washes of boulder rubble and sand flow into death valley like a dam bursting in extreme slow motion. The range is rarely in death valley. When I was there, a light drizzle caused a flash flood in mosaic canyon where sculpted marble walls dropped down hundreds of feet to it. Teeny tiny stream bed. The string fans out here and Mosaic Canyon is a temple of reds and whites arguing domes and voluptuous curves there at sinks down deep into the rock making hard stone look. Supple. Death valley exists in geologic time. The oldest rocks at bad water or 1.8 billion years old. Standing here watching the stream flow, I started thinking about that Mars rover. I thought about my girlfriend, my family and politics. Mosaic Canyon sinks a tiny bit deeper each year. 100 human empires will rise and fall in the time it takes death valley to notice our passing.

Speaker 16:         49:01          Yeah.

Speaker 26:         49:07          [inaudible] hell one each year can serve as a vacation. Everybody from the reality of another view.

Speaker 24:         50:09          Myrna Beckett is a dancer. She spent the first half of her life on stage in New York in her early forties she found this abandoned theater. She patched the roof, painted an audience on the walls, so the curtains, the costumes wrote the script and choreographed the dance. Saturday night sell

Speaker 10:         50:27          well, are there like many musicals, if you want to call one we did before. This was called the doll maker. Bought a doll shop. You can go and buy the perfect companion for life. Not have to bother with a real one is quite controversial. I made a few enemies out of it,

Speaker 24:         50:45          like the doll maker. The masquerade asks questions about identity, who we want to be versus who we actually are, and it sort of summarizes why a lot of people move out to the desert. There's a freedom here

Speaker 10:         51:00          in New York. It's like trying to paint on a canvas that's already okay

Speaker 24:         51:04          painted. Not out here.

Speaker 24:         51:51          nobody really knows who was first though. Anybody can tell you why. As city real estate spiraled out of control. Artists, musicians and old hippies have migrated here. The extreme south end of the Mojave desert tucked away around pioneer town, Joshua tree and Yucca valley are free spirits living off their art. Of course, the land grab is the cynics point of view and it's easy to feel jaded around young kids singing in old men. Drumming. Urban sophistication is when you refuse a strangers hug or laugh. No questions asked, but those who've dropped their cynicism will tell you this is a place of optimism and hope it's genuine. The woman cooking brought extra burgers to share. The climbers are back with their instruments. Looking for a company man, no experience necessary the Indians thing because it feels good. You can feel good too if you want. It's your choice.

Speaker 24:         53:01          Describe for me what we're looking at right here and tell me how you see that versus maybe how other people see it.

Speaker 27:         53:06          Well, yeah. Right now. What I'm looking at is a beautiful desert paradise with folders that has symbols of hands and symbols of people, of animals and spirits. See You, beautiful in front of me, tall reaching for the sky, reaching the pray to the Creator and the it looks all glimmering in the moonlight. When people are out here, they all their stress and worries and the problems go away. Their anxieties, fears just totally leaves them when they come out here, but it's just so hard with the society now. We don't know how to escape this control that they have over us, but when we're here, the moment it's just happy and everything blows away with the wind.

Speaker 28:         54:06          Some was bad and some was good. Some in the best thing could. Some have even try Andy's my Trump mind and a cane

Speaker 24:         54:47          In 1989 a sculptor named Noah Purifoy bought a ranch on the flats north of Yucca Valley. Periphery is probably best known for founding the watts towers art center in 1964 but he also made huge assemblage sculptures from lost and found desert objects. Some are serious but most are whimsical, all are in pretty bad shape. His first few years out here, periphery fought the elements, but later he incorporated their effects of sculpture is never done. He surmised after he built it, the weather continued the process. I went out to talk to periphery, but I was a day late when I got there. I phoned his assistant and she told me that he'd passed away the morning before she was devastated. After hanging up, I walked around his garden. I wandered down a sculpture, built like a hallway filled with old calculators, cash registers and boards with rusty nails sticking out. I stood there thinking about this man who had just died and I started thinking about those old miners, their desert way of life. I thought about Martin Beckett singing her operas for 36 years and I thought about death valley. The sense of time there that threatens to make everything we do here absolutely irrelevant. Everything

Speaker 24:         56:10          I've thought about these sculptures decaying, the minors disappearing, all the artists dying and every last one of us, the entire human race turning the dust blowing around the Mojave desert and the wind

Speaker 2:          56:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 24:         56:25          Noah Purifoy once said that after he finished his sculptures, they take on a life of their own. I'm going to hope he's right about that. I really need to believe it's true.
