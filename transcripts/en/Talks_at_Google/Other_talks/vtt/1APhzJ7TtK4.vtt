ELLEN WEST: I just wanted
to ask you what

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.000
drew you to this story?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.830
Was it a personal experience,
or what was it about the

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.760
underlying story here that made
you want to make your

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.790
first non-documentary?

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.090
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Well, all
three of those stories seemed

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.810
like they could be interesting
documentaries.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.590
And all three of those things
are based on things that are

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.800
happening every day.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.430
I'm sorry you were
freaked out.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.229
I love hearing when people say,
oh, it makes me want to

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.200
reach out and tell someone that
I miss them or love them,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.500
like when you have a dream, a
bad dream, and you wake up,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.480
and you suddenly inexplicably
want to call your mother or

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.110
sister, and they find it strange
that you're calling.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.820
I like that.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.070
I like that effect.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.820
ELLEN WEST: I mean, it does
have that effect.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.920
But it just makes me wonder.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.610
And I'm looking at at least one
other person I know who is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.830
a parent here in the audience
of all the times we spend in

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.950
our house, everybody on their
own device, and it really does

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.995
resonate in that way.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.610
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Yeah, I mean,
I don't think being on a

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.530
device is bad.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.850
I think it can just,
like, we have two

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.750
parallel realities now.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.570
We used to have just one,
the physical world.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.440
And now there's another one.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.120
And I think that other
one is very exciting.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.900
We're all dealing with
how much should we be

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.670
in that other one.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.850
I mean, 50 years ago, I don't
think there were 1,000 people

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.730
you could talk to in a second.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.300
You couldn't.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.680
You had to just sort of
hang out with the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.700
person in front of you.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.100
And now that you have the choice
of 1,000 other people,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.580
if that, more, who can I talk
to now, I can talk to

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.500
anyone right now.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.590
It's sort of tough to make those
decisions every minute

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.500
of every day.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.030
Where do you put your focus?

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.030
So I think it's a
challenge, but

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.710
it's an exciting challenge.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.640
ELLEN WEST: And did you help
work on the script and do

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.900
research for it, and how did you
develop these storylines?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.780
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: So the stories
were sort of inspired

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.080
from real live events
by Andrew Stern.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.480
And he fictionalized them.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.780
And then me, not knowing how
to make a fiction movie,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.560
really, I just set about it like
I would a documentary.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.700
So I interviewed a lot of people
that went through all

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.260
these things.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.960
I went through--

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.880
I interviewed people who had
gotten their identity stolen.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.910
And I interviewed people who
had worked on pornographic

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.950
chat sites.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.610
And I interviewed people who
were cyberbullies, one kid,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.530
actually, only.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.200
And I interviewed FBI agents and
a cyber crimes detective

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.370
from New York City.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.500
And I put all these people in
front of my actors, in case

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.050
they wanted to spend
time with them.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.650
And that was very useful.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.080
And once I really understood
what these people went

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.840
through, then we would go and
rewrite certain scenes in the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.370
script to make them reflect
reality better.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.020
So it's a sort of retroactive
documentary research that fed

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.950
back into the story lines.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.380
That's how we did it.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.020
ELLEN WEST: What a fantastic
group of actors you were able

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.030
to cast in the film.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.370
How did you go about getting
word out about this film and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.130
finding these people to bring
the characters to life?

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.530
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Well,
the financier is an

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.070
unusually risky guy.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.910
He just said to me and the
producer, just hire whoever

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.160
you think is good.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.810
So we just went after people
that we liked.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.970
Like, I had always loved Michael
Nyqvist, who has a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:38.620
small role.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.100
But he plays the guy in "The
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.310
in the Swedish film.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.810
I love him.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.330
He plays the journalist.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.180
So let's put him the
movie somewhere.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.690
And I've always loved
Jason Bateman.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.990
I always thought he was a very
magnetic guy who you can

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.730
really relate to.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.240
And I've never really
seen him do drama.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.670
And when I asked him, he said,
thank you, no one asks me to

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.370
do drama, ever.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.630
I wish people would.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.630
So I had him grow a beard
so that you wouldn't

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.290
notice he was funny.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.220
I was hoping that would help you
believe that it's someone

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.880
else, not the guy from "Arrested
Development." And

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.860
then other odd casting
choices, Marc Jacobs.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.740
ELLEN WEST: I was going
to ask about that.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.170
How did you convince him
to make his film debut,

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.915
particularly in a
role like that?

00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:26.370
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Yeah, he
doesn't really care what

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.630
anybody thinks, so he
just was up for it.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.550
He thought it was funny,
a challenge.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.760
He's a very brilliant, creative,
mind and always

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.690
looking for a challenge.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.980
And I've known him for years.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.910
And I actually had a friend who
was supposed to play this

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.900
role, the guy who
owns The Box.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.120
I'm sure you've all
heard of The Box

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.230
down on Chrystie street.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.770
His name is Simon Hammerstein.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.450
And he seemed like a good fit.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.970
And his wife told him
he wasn't allowed

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.940
to play that role.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.500
So I was just racking my
brain for a few weeks.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.270
And I came up with, maybe,
Marc Jacobs would like

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.240
to play that guy--

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.040
sort of bizarre thought.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.380
It just crossed my brain,
and he said yes.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.700
ELLEN WEST: So the internet as
sort of a source of deception,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.970
or a facilitator of deception,
seems to be a big theme-- kind

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.830
of the distance that it allows
people to deceive others and

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.350
to be something that they're
actually not in real life, or

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.440
to project an alternate self.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.200
I mean, do you think that's
different from

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.560
other forms of deception?

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.270
Is it just more faster?

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.120
Or what is it about the web and
technology, given that you

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.010
said you didn't consider this
an anti-technology film?

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.230
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Yeah, I mean
the themes of deception and

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.640
identity and false identity are
definitely strong in this

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.060
piece of writing that
Andrew did.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.870
But I also see other things that
are interesting that are

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.090
not necessarily negative.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.900
I love the scene where Jason
Bateman is connecting to that

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.870
kid, and they're actually both
telling each other the truth

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.820
for the first time
in the movie.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:14.280
They are being honest with each
other, though he thinks

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.810
he's speaking to a girl.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.094
So I think that's a giant truth
of the internet, too, is

00:06:21.094 --> 00:06:24.780
it can really connect you with
other people, like-minded

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.560
people, or people who are going
through what you're

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.550
going through.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.930
I think it's incredibly
therapeutic and helpful.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.750
And in that one scene, it
is, for both of them.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.300
It's funny, you make a movie,
and you have no idea, really.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.050
There's a lot of things
going on the film.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.725
And I'm hoping that it's also
about people communicating,

00:06:44.725 --> 00:06:47.380
and miscommunicating, and the
power of human relationships

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.230
at the end of the film, and that
you don't come away just

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.640
thinking, OK, well that's the
anti-technology film.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.280
But if people walk away thinking
that, I have no

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.300
control over that.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.415
But certainly, to make a movie,
a thriller, to make it

00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:02.530
a dramatic thriller, we've got
to pull some stories out of

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.280
the world that are happening
right now that are dramatic

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.140
and have to do with deception.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:17.520
In the case of the journalist
and the kid, I think that

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.630
theme was more about
exploitation.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.200
I could relate to that,
being a documentarian.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.780
You are always wondering whether
or not you are doing

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.910
the right thing by
shooting someone,

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.590
putting them on camera.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.250
To me, that was less about
the internet, really.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.320
And they just happened
to meet that way.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.530
I see we have a question.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.670
ELLEN WEST: We one
question here.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.200
HENRY ALEX RUBIN:
That's exciting.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.400
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
sharing the film.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.165
That was really powerful.

00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:43.630
I thought it was great.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.670
Just a question about
you personally.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.820
On the spectrum of being
connected versus not

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.270
connected, or how digital
are you personally?

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.630
Are you always connected with
multiple devices, or are you

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.650
a, I don't even own a smartphone
type of person.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.320
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Yeah, I, like
all of you in this room,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.050
struggle with how much time
I spend on my phone.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.370
And I'm sure that's true down
to every last one of you.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.960
And my friends, it's
the same question.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.030
Like I said when I sat down,
who do you focus on, the

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.460
person in front of you, or the
10 people texting you?

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.820
It's such a hard decision,
especially when you love three

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.930
of those 10 people texting
you, and one of

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.590
them is your mother.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.880
And you really have to get
back to your mother.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.309
But yet, you're sitting
with your father.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.429
And he's saying, stop,
get off your phone.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.360
These are the questions
everyone's asking

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.480
themselves every day.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.950
I don't think I'm alone.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.429
I was not on Facebook
for a long time.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.770
I am now.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.160
I am now.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.270
And I only have 100 friends,
which people laugh at me.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.260
But they are people I know.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.040
I am on Instagram.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.980
And I love Instagram.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.020
That's a lot fun to just check
out where everybody is and

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.280
what they're doing.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:58.760
Yeah.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.420
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.580
ELLEN WEST: Over here?

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.030
AUDIENCE: So I agree with both
of you how the internet can be

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.860
a vehicle for dishonesty, in
new ways, and honesty as

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.830
well-- as illustrated so
well in that scene.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.550
And I'm just curious, for you
personally, are you optimistic

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:21.190
or pessimistic about where these
technologies will take

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.835
us in terms of human
relations.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.610
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: I am
incredibly optimistic.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:29.620
I probably shouldn't be.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.780
I should be, like, the guy who
is saying get off your phone

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:33.990
because I made this movie.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.730
But again, I didn't make this
movie because of a message

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.980
that some people think it has.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.380
I made this movie because
it felt very real.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.470
A lot of the questions and
things in it felt very real to

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.880
me and like things that I'm
struggling with myself.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.080
I'm very, very optimistic.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.760
I'm very excited about
Google Glass.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.400
I think, for a filmmaker,
that is a radical thing.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.210
Is that what it's called,
Google Glass?

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.280
ELLEN WEST: Yeah.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.730
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Like, I
could put on glasses?

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.480
I've waited my whole life, as
a filmmaker, for glasses I

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.290
could put on and film
everything.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.320
I've always wanted a camera
in my eyeball.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.270
But the things that are so hard
to get on film are those

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.650
intimate moments between
people where someone's

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.800
embarrassed, or someone's
showing emotion, or

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.720
someone's in danger.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.710
That's when you put your camera
down as a filmmaker.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.550
You feel, as a human,
you're like, I can't

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.300
possibly film this.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.780
Someone's dying.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.010
Or someone is crying.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.200
Or someone's just had something
horrible happen.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.660
Put the camera down.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.740
If I'd had a camera in my
eyeball, I would have even

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:38.310
more beautiful scenes in the
film "Murderball." It would be

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.170
more intimacy.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.650
So I'm excited for all those
moments that are going to be

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.100
captured in the future by
filmmakers using that

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.850
technology.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.460
ELLEN WEST: We have
someone else here.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.750
AUDIENCE: Hi, I was curious in
the past how you've approached

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.800
the documentary subjects that
you've made, and then how this

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.260
experience of making a narrative
you think will

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.600
affect future movies, whether
those are narratives or

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.360
documentaries?

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.340
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Personally?

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.050
For me?

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.920
AUDIENCE: Yes, you know how
you use the documentary

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.655
approach in this narrative?

00:11:14.655 --> 00:11:16.590
If there's things that you
learned about the narrative

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.640
that you'd bring back if you're
making a documentary.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.380
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: It's funny you
say that because when my

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.170
partner Dana and I were making
"Murderball," we watched a lot

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.885
of sports films that we love,
movies like "Rudy" and

00:11:28.885 --> 00:11:32.740
"Hoosiers" and "Rocky" and
"Miracle." And we were

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.580
determined to make a movie with
"Murderball" that would

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.420
feel like a fiction movie that
would suck you in, and had

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.250
music, and had shots,
and had sequences.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.050
So it wouldn't feel like your
typical documentary that was

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.000
just zooming in on everything
from afar.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:55.220
But now I did the exact opposite
with this film.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.360
Everything was just
in front of me--

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.200
and usually, when you're
shooting a documentary, it's

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.950
always a struggle to just get
someone's face in focus.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.410
And so I found myself getting
annoyed with all the control

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.630
that I had.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.540
And I started shooting from
across the street, or shooting

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.760
through people.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.840
And then it felt more
real to me.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.560
It felt more like what I'm used
to seeing through a lens.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.550
But there are a lot of rules on
set that I learned that are

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.810
very annoying, like, you're
supposed to say cut.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.520
You don't say cut in
documentaries, OK?

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.480
You would never say that.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.330
So I just ended up just letting
the camera roll a lot.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.650
And what that was wonderful
about that was that it kept

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.110
the makeup artists, and the hair
people, and the booming

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.280
people with their mics, and the
guys tweaking the lights,

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.720
it kept them away.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.390
Because when you're rolling,
they don't ever want

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.620
to be in the frame.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.340
So they just stay at bay.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.620
And then I could play.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.680
And the actors could
do whatever and go

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.030
wherever they wanted.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.650
And I shot most of this movie
with two cameras, which means

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.070
they could interrupt each other,
or they could play the

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.650
scene this way or that
way, you could

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.390
always cut it together.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.040
And that was the way that I took
back control over the set

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.240
because the machinery of
moviemaking is really heavy.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.920
There's cables everywhere, as
I'm sure you guys have seen.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.010
Everything's contrived.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.400
There's nothing real
about the process.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.110
So what I would do, especially
with the kids, is I would move

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.550
the cameras back, far, and
sometimes, I would even put a

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.650
light, like there's a light my
face now, I would hit a light

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.060
towards them so they
couldn't even see

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:34.970
where the cameras were.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.280
I did that quite a lot.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.120
And then they would forget that
the cameras were even

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.050
filming them.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.780
And I would say, go again,
go again, go again.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.320
And by the fifth or sixth take,
they were just acting

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.790
like themselves--

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:46.750
clowns.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.110
And then I got good footage.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.030
ELLEN WEST: And how much of it
was, I mean, letting them--

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.860
sticking to the script and doing
variations on that, or

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.420
is it like Woody Allen?

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.740
Here's a general thing
of where we're

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.790
going in this scene.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.720
And some big points we want to
hit, but leaving it up to the

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.660
actors to interpret their
characters and the situation.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.280
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Well, we
started with the script.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.300
And then we got further
away from the script.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.890
And I would just tell them
to do it in their words.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:21.440
Sometimes, for certain scenes
that required more emotion, I

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.160
just wanted to see what they
would come up with.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.260
Most directors, the idea of
directing is very aggressively

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.480
dominating and imposing your
will or viewpoint on people.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.600
And I, because I come from
documentaries, thought of my

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.940
actors, well, they're real
people, they have instincts.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.070
Let's see what they
do before I even

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.740
influence them in any direction.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.640
Let's just see what their
instincts are.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.160
And that's how I operated.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.410
And then, if there were things
that I felt were fake or

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.560
needed correcting, then
I would step in.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.540
But I never spoke
before a scene

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.610
because these are humans.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.800
And these stories are human.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.090
And let's see what they
come up with.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.990
Let's see how they play it.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.400
So in fact, if anything, I
found myself allowing the

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.230
actors to be more than telling
them what to do,

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.720
if that make sense.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.170
ELLEN WEST: I just want to
switch gears a bit because in

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.990
looking at your bio and then
talking with you a bit before

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.070
we did this screening--

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.280
we're an advertising company,
which is, I mean, people don't

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.470
realize that Google is.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.760
And looking at your resume and
the things you've done, I

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.070
mean, how do you go from making
a film like this, or

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.730
serious documentaries that
are so intense, to

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.590
doing Burger King?

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.270
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Advertising
is really fun.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.440
And I love it.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.920
And I do it every day.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.820
It's my day job.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.780
And I really love trying to
make real things look

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:53.990
beautiful or make beautiful
things look more real.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.445
That's a lot of the challenge
because so much of advertising

00:15:57.445 --> 00:15:58.570
is so contrived.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.740
And as you all know, nobody
wants to sit through

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.300
advertising.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.430
So we're all trying to figure
out ways to not watch or not

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.930
listen to advertising.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:11.470
So how do you get into that 1%
of ads that cut through?

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.670
I think the Google Glass
thing cut through.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.230
It became more than
just an ad.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.000
It became like news.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.200
That's exciting,
ads like that.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.470
And I've been involved in a lot
of campaigns like that,

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.705
that it felt like social
experiments.

00:16:24.705 --> 00:16:27.670
Like I did Whopper Freakout,
where we took the Whopper off

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.170
the menu, and we filmed
people freaking out.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.750
That was one of the ads I did.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.510
Or I just did this Coca Cola
campaign where we went around

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.460
the world, and we really found
real people who do good.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.760
And so there's a guy who
puts up swings in poor

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.210
neighborhoods all over.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.640
And it just transforms
the neighborhood.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.000
And that's what he does.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.350
He's committed his
life to that.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.230
And there's another girl who
plants trees in crap

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.920
neighborhoods that are
very industrial.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.530
And there's another guy who
got rich off an insurance

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:01.340
company that he sold.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.420
So he gives 1,000 pounds to
a stranger every day.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.579
And he's been doing
it systematically

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.810
for, now, over a year.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.410
And so we found these people.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.150
And I got to interview them
and hang out with them.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.650
Obviously, it's about selling
sweet water in the end.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.890
But it was sort of a great
experience to put all these

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:27.470
people who do cool stuff
up on screen.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.850
Those are the kinds
of ads I love.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.730
ELLEN WEST: Cool, Brendan?

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.310
AUDIENCE: Hi, like to your point
you just mentioned, your

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.720
visual style has a very kind
of cinema verite approach.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.450
Do you think that, going
forward with any future

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.115
non-documentary features you
make, or even a documentary,

00:17:45.115 --> 00:17:48.050
do you think that you're sort
of stuck in your ways now?

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.200
You found a great niche.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.250
And you know exactly what--

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.510
a Rubin movie is going
to look like this?

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.390
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: I love
that, a Rubin movie.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.090
That suggests that I'm going
to make another one.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.920
Yes, I mean, I reverted, to tell
you the truth, being on

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.800
set, if I'm to be really honest,
I had no idea what I

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.080
was doing at first.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.360
I'm very comfortable
with documentaries.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.920
And the politics of fiction
film, and the hierarchy of the

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.820
crew, and all that, can be very
daunting and off-putting.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:29.730
And everything is so contrived
in that atmosphere of a set

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.350
that getting into place, a
safe place, where you can

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:37.400
allow actors to feel safe and
be real is a huge challenge.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.240
It's much easier to do it in
a documentary form because

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.950
people are just living in the
world, and you're just

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.350
sneaking around zooming
in on them.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.790
I prefer that.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.240
I reverted to that making this
movie, to that way of being.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.770
So yes, I think I have a way
that I feel comfortable

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.317
shooting things and I'm
going to stick to it.

00:18:56.317 --> 00:18:58.480
ELLEN WEST: So we won't be
seeing you make "Iron Man 4"?

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:01.860
No?

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.960
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: I
don't think so.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.030
I don't think I would do well
making a movie like that.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:12.470
I think it would look really
strange and eavesdropped.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.360
I'm not sure it would
look good.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.010
I don't know.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.300
Plus, I think those movies are
fun, but they're not what I'm

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:19.890
interested in.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.470
I love the idea, whether it's a
documentary or an ad that's

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:28.430
60 seconds or a fiction movie,
really, what's the most

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.120
exciting thing for a filmmaker,
for me, is emotion.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.060
And if you can get that, if you
can create that in 60 or

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.980
90 seconds, and you can create
that at the end of a fiction

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.760
movie, then that's exciting.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.910
That's the stuff that sort
of gets under your skin.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.060
That's the stuff that you think
about two days from now.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.400
All that other stuff is noise.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.450
There's so much noise
out there.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.520
I think it's, for me, at least
in my experience, it's when I

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.870
feel something that
I remember it.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:58.440
ELLEN WEST: So do you have a
next project that you're

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.810
starting, in the middle of?

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.220
I mean, how does the process
work for you?

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.300
This is now out and getting
a great reception.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.430
So what do you do next?

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.270
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: I'm about to
do to Spain, where I'm going

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.900
to paint a Volvo truck red,
bright red, and then we're

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.610
going to send it through
Pamplona with the bulls

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:19.550
chasing it.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.570
And we're going to see if this
driver can handle all the

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.940
turns on the bull run.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.850
And we're going to
do it for real.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:26.455
So that'll be fun.

00:20:26.455 --> 00:20:29.260
So I'm leaving tomorrow
to shoot that.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.090
ELLEN WEST: We want to thank
you again for coming and

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.300
sharing your film with us
on a Friday afternoon.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:33.950
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Thank you.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.200
Thanks for staying, you guys.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.990
ELLEN WEST: And good luck
with the Volvo.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.240
HENRY ALEX RUBIN: Thank you.
