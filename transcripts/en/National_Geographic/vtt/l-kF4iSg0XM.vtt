00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.633
He said he's feeling
tinges of, like, game time.

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:14.600
I think there's a
chance he goes tomorrow.

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.066
There are remote
cameras because we

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.633
want to stay out of Alex's line
of sight when he's doing it.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.867
OK, everybody knows what to
do if something goes wrong.

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:35.200
Josh, just to confirm,
who should Mikey call?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.467
The easiest thing
would just be 9-1-1,

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:40.033
and that wheel will
get kicked into gear,

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.867
and tell them what you know.

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:42.934
A climber.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:44.934
Yeah.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.000
All right.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.260
No mistakes tomorrow.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm worried that tomorrow's
going to be, like, you know?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.767
Like, Alex's existence
will be over.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:11.667
I was Like, oh, I have to be
prepared for that outcome.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:15.266
And I have to realize that
that is a real possibility.

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:20.567
Oh, god.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.433
It'll be enough [inaudible]

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:33.567
Remember when
you said you were

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.633
going stand up for my goodbye?

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:36.333
Oh is it time?

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.900
- Yeah.
- Oh.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.967
But you don't
have to stand up.

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:39.800
But you have to sit up.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.133
[exaggerated groan]

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:47.033
[inaudible] is laughing.

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:49.200
No, now you're never gonna go.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.033
[kissing]

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:51.967
Mm.

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:54.834
OK, drive safe.

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:56.567
Ciao.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:57.233
[inaudible]

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:58.300
See you later.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.467
I mean, I didn't
ask her to leave.

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:17.300
I mean, I would never
ask her to leave.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.033
But, you know, I
think she kind of

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:23.300
understands that it's probably
easier for me if she's gone.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.400
I don't-- the whole, like,
saying goodbye thing,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.900
I'm like, I'll probably
see her in, like,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.700
five days or something.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.633
It's not like goodbye.

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:36.200
It's just goodbye
for a few days.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.300
You know.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.033
I mean, there's just that,
like, weird thought of,

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:49.200
like, don't fricking let that
be our last hug, or whatever.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.433
You know, like, I shouldn't
be having that thought.

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:56.700
[sob]

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.033
Of, like, what if
something happens.

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:06.400
Like, what if I
don't see him again?

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.967
So you're like, why do
you want to do this?

00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:16.500
Like, it's this
totally crazy goal.
