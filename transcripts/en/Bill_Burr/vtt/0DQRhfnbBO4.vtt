1
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.420
BHey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.060
It's time for the Monday morning podcasts for Monday.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.720
Fucking May 22nd.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.750
Is that a record for how quickly I said the f word? Uh,

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.440
I'm actually doing the podcast right now, riding in a car.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.383
I'm not driving.

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.420
I'm on my way to a New York City cause I have to do some promotional stuff here

8
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:28.470
for a efforts for family that's coming out this week, right? Or next week,

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.110
May 30th. I don't know what, so this begins, oh,

10
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:37.111
Billy red face shown his freckled puss on anything I can get myself on.

11
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.960
Um, you know, so whatever. I'm driving in New York and you know something,

12
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:47.370
there's all this fucking traffic and I going to take an early flight tomorrow

13
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:48.870
back to La and don't have time.

14
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:52.720
And my wife just sent me this whole thing on what successful people do and they,

15
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:57.450
they, they fucking, you know, they uh, I don't know what they do. They,

16
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.790
they, they know how many minutes are in a day.

17
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.590
Evidently there's 1,440 minutes in a day and they use this wisely and they

18
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:08.610
delegate, right? They delegate shit. Like, I don't want to do that.

19
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.200
You know how to do that. Right. All right, I'll pay you to do that. You know,

20
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.440
a small portion of what the fuck I'm making. I got to get better at.

21
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.020
Then in order to delegate though,

22
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.040
what you have to be is you have to be social and uh, you know,

23
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.820
that's not my thing. And I said I had a couple of drinks. Other than that,

24
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:29.450
I'm kind of a curmudgeon. I don't know if you've noticed.

25
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.580
I'm a little bit grumpy, but a fucking cruising now.

26
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.340
What other traffic though?

27
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.410
Now watching this will be like a Thursday when it does going to get to do the

28
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.380
whole hour. Um, so anyways, I just got back from, uh,

29
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.770
my tour up there in Canada, work with Nate Craig who murdered it.

30
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.500
If you don't believe me, ask anybody who was in Winnipeg,

31
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.480
Saskatoon and uh, Regina.

32
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.880
And uh, first of all, I'm very proud that Nate and I did a show,

33
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.520
two shows in Regina, and neither one of us went with the easy joke. No,

34
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.100
we did the stupid rhymes with fun. Nobody's like vagina, Vagina.

35
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:12.860
What's up with dad? I thought there was going to be a giant Twat here.

36
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:17.420
Sinkhole flash thing. We are kind of left it alone and

37
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.380
um, I don't know. We had a great time for questions. Let's just back it up here.

38
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.470
Okay. We start off in Winnipeg.

39
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.070
I told the people at Winnepeg that I wasn't going to tell people this,

40
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:31.340
but I just think there's so off the beaten man path. It's fine.

41
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.050
The cuisine in Winnipeg, it's fucking insane.

42
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.430
All right. Jesus. What's the, was the name of that place? We actually,

43
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:43.120
I didn't have time to go this time. I, uh,

44
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.420
ordered from this place, the peasants something or other.

45
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.000
It was my little list of places to go. Scrolling down to Winnipeg.

46
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.140
They, I thought that was going to be a bunch of traffic. Oh,

47
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.130
he's just blocking

48
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.830
<v 1>me up. The driver. Yeah. I peasant kitchen.</v>

49
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.610
Get the torchy air if you're ever there. T, O. R. T. I. E. R. E.

50
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.710
It's French pork pie and a,

51
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.080
then we went to the tallest poppy for breakfast the next day. And, um,

52
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.250
I wouldn't have known about either one of those shout out to, uh,

53
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.130
a Canadian by the name of Ed Robertson.

54
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.890
You might've heard of them plays in a band.

55
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.290
I think he's in a garage band or something like that. You might've heard of him.

56
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:30.980
I Dunno. I'm just fucking with you. Um, so anyways, uh, the food

57
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.490
<v 2>was unbelievable up there and uh,</v>

58
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.260
the shows were awesome.

59
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.960
Played in this old theater and I forget the name of, I don't remember.

60
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.400
It's been around since like 1900 and up top. They have like the,

61
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.060
the same old shitty seats they used to have back when everything was segregated,

62
00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:50.331
you know,

63
00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:53.390
and all the white people were downstairs and anybody else had to walk all the

64
00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:56.540
flights of stairs to go upstairs, you know? And what's the result?

65
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.270
What's the result have 50 years later,

66
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.850
white people are getting their asses kicked in sports.

67
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.670
You know why we got no quads, we don't have any glutes.

68
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.660
That's why our acids is so flat. We just used to walk into the theater.

69
00:04:08.661 --> 00:04:12.020
We were on the ground level and everybody else had to walk up. Right.

70
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.950
That's why we get our asses kicked from the Gridiron to the Dojo. It's true,

71
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.520
but all comes back to going to see Harry Houdini and not having to work for it.

72
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.423
Um,

73
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.860
so we were actually there and it wasn't cold as shit like the last time and a,

74
00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:31.790
you know, try out some new stuff. Everything was going great. Um,

75
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.560
went to bed the first night and have a drop of booze. How about that? Huh?

76
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.160
Didn't smoke a cigar. You know, there was Cuban cigars, but you know,

77
00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:43.310
it's Canada, so they got Cuban cigars, but there's no place to smoke. Uh,

78
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.661
they're very, uh,

79
00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:49.490
they're very hostile against smokers or they just maybe like overly protective.

80
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.260
They sort of helicopter parent with smokers up there. And you sort of,

81
00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:56.450
I guess allowed to do it outside. Although I did not,

82
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.410
I didn't think I really saw anybody smoking anywhere. Um,

83
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.160
so anyways, we did that Gig and uh,

84
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.690
the next one on the docket was we drove up to [inaudible] Saskatoon of speaking

85
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:13.790
of which there was these two or three concept, the Winnipeg show.

86
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.090
I thought they were booing me, but they were just going to,

87
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.880
I don't know why we were in Winnipeg.

88
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.350
I guess that's short for Saskatoon for like Cleveland,

89
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:27.930
the land up there, I guess they call it the tune or they just yell out tune.

90
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.810
I have no fucking idea. But we, uh, I thought they were born me. So, you know,

91
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.120
I got off stage and I was just like, Jesus Christ, man.

92
00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:39.980
I thought that was a good show, you know? Um, but I was like, no,

93
00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:42.620
no, no. They were yelling tune. I'm like, what's two?

94
00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:46.790
And they was four for Saskatoon. I was like, all right, we're in Winnipeg.

95
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.490
They're like, oh, yes, sorry. Sorry. That's a big thing in Canada. Everybody,

96
00:05:52.491 --> 00:05:53.660
sorry, I'm, oh, sorry.

97
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.670
Like there's waitress was clear on our table and you know, plate is empty.

98
00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:01.040
And when she goes to clear that, she goes, oh, sorry, sorry.

99
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.670
It's like you're apologizing for,

100
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:09.140
do you brought food to me and now you're taking it away on, you're apologizing.

101
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.910
It would all the time. Sorry. I'm sorry. Get the puck out. Sorry.

102
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.500
Um, so anyways, we did the drive up from, uh,

103
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.510
from Winnepeg to Saskatoon, the one that everybody was saying, hey,

104
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.600
getting ready, what the hell is that stuff? Ah, Jesus,

105
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:31.280
that's not pleasant is it? I'm sorry. Sorry, I picked it up.

106
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.430
I'm going to be ridiculously pleasant on this, you know,

107
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.690
fuck those cops who yelled at tune in Winnipeg. Sorry.

108
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.620
<v 3>Um,</v>

109
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.660
<v 2>it's funny because everyone was saying I was going to be dreading that drive,</v>

110
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.570
you know, like an eight hour drive and a, so we start,

111
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.960
me and Nate start driving up and we're just hitting all these bugs and shit.

112
00:06:49.961 --> 00:06:53.770
But I got to tell you, man, it was beautiful and uh,

113
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.190
both loved the drive. You know, we live in La,

114
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.600
we're just smashed in with a zillion other people. It's nice to get out there.

115
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.610
What a beautiful country candidate is. Good Lord. Um,

116
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.740
all these, these farmhouses, all of this land,

117
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.620
it was beautiful. And all I just kept thinking was,

118
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.570
I would love to fly a helicopter out here.

119
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.410
Cause if he had a problem he could land at anywhere as opposed to when I'm in

120
00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:23.290
La, I'm looking for fucking soccer fields and playgrounds and opened this,

121
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.303
not kids there.

122
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.810
If I ever had a problem and I'm just up there,

123
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.690
it was just like just wide open spaces and I wasn't that bad at driving.

124
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:34.870
He didn't like seven hours.

125
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.110
We took the one lane highway instead of the two lane highway.

126
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:42.280
So we had a lot of fun like peaking around trucks and shit trying to pass him a

127
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:45.820
lot of farmers like driving these giant tractors down the fucking street,

128
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.040
<v 3>you know. Um,</v>

129
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.521
<v 2>I dunno, I,</v>

130
00:07:50.521 --> 00:07:55.521
I got a bunch of pictures of shit that I saw every like every mile there though

131
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.930
there was a barn that looked like it was going to fall down and there'd be some

132
00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:01.180
guy who just had like a zillion fucking cars

133
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.300
or tires or something all piled up in his yard. It was really a,

134
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.270
it was pretty interesting. And I was just thinking those guys from gas monkey,

135
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:10.451
you know,

136
00:08:10.451 --> 00:08:14.800
if they ever pull all the fucking cars out of barns down in the states,

137
00:08:14.801 --> 00:08:18.970
they could just go up to Manitoba and Saskatchewan. They'd find, I saw a number,

138
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:23.320
I saw a 65, uh, I'm driving like 70 miles an hour too. And I still saw it.

139
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.770
So 65 Ford Galaxy, I don't know if it was the 500 might've been, no,

140
00:08:28.771 --> 00:08:33.090
I think it was a 64, actually 64. I know he's telling the fucking rain man.

141
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.000
Right, right now. So anyways, and then we get up to fucking Saskatchewan,

142
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.810
Saskatoon and uh, we only had one show that night.

143
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:44.350
So of course I went out and got absolutely fucking hammered.

144
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.970
Hammered at this bar. A lot of tattoos, a lot of tattoos up in Saskatoon.

145
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.973
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

146
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.780
<v 2>a lot of tattoos. Sorry.</v>

147
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.213
<v 3>Um,</v>

148
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.260
<v 2>but it was a town, it had this amazing park and um,</v>

149
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:03.460
which I forget the fucking name of and I got up the next day cause I sham all

150
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.800
those years, they haven't yet paper route.

151
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:06.450
Like I can only sleep for so fucking long.

152
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:08.130
I just sort of naturally wake up so you know,

153
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.630
I didn't get to bed till like two in the morning.

154
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:12.840
I still woke up at like eight 30 and I was staying at that.

155
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.360
They're fucking a red room hotel.

156
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:19.110
There is this beautiful old hotel that looks like you could have shot the

157
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:23.510
shining in there and uh, it's right next to this long parking.

158
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.850
I just was watching to get a little mini waterfall.

159
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:30.360
I watched these pelicans trying to fish.

160
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.140
I saw some geese for some baby geese walking around.

161
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.760
It's crazy for all these years of living in New York and La.

162
00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:40.310
I was just sitting there geeking out and there was some old lady standing there

163
00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:44.270
looking at the goose and Rakusus like putting its fucking head down looking at

164
00:09:44.271 --> 00:09:46.430
her and I'm thinking that's like an aggressive posture.

165
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.300
So I walked away but I was also looking, sorta laughing,

166
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:53.780
like thinking that goose was going to fuck the old lady up and then thinking

167
00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:56.690
like, what would I do because that would be bad. I mean,

168
00:09:56.691 --> 00:09:58.040
I can't walk away from the Old Lady,

169
00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:00.680
but I also don't want to slap the shit out of this goose in front of all of its

170
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:05.120
children. So a sort of a tense little moment there, right in nature. And now,

171
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.580
fortunately a cooler heads prevailed and everybody went their separate ways.

172
00:10:09.581 --> 00:10:13.540
But the, I don't think you'll lady knew how close she came. You know,

173
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.900
she had a big grin on her face as the thing was like duck and downloads.

174
00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:21.490
So she's kind of ducking down, like imitating it. Um, you know,

175
00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:23.860
like she's looking at a gorilla and she's pounded in her chest and I thought for

176
00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:25.960
half a second, like I was going to see some like, you know,

177
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.270
some fucking old lady bird MMA action, you know.

178
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.960
Um, but you know what? She's so fucking older,

179
00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:36.280
but she knows how to kill a goose.

180
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.070
She's probably went out in the backyard and I can do that shit.

181
00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:42.930
They just walk up and they grab it by the neck and then they do the spin move

182
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.880
and then they just hold on to the next of the body spins.

183
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.090
And it just breaks the fucking thing's neck. Um,

184
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.930
she looked like she was old enough that she actually lived during those times,

185
00:10:52.931 --> 00:10:55.960
you know, back when you earned your meal, you know,

186
00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:01.240
like you knew the name of the thing that you killed. It was like a pet, right?

187
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.370
And weird dreams probably slipped into your fucking sexuality somehow.

188
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.420
You're like dressing up like a bird when you fuck or something like that in some

189
00:11:13.421 --> 00:11:17.980
weird thing where anytime you get abused, you know, file sexually,

190
00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:22.000
I don't know what it is, it ends up making you some Weirdo in the wreck. Um,

191
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.100
so anyways, I ended up doing, so I walked up and I went over the hill,

192
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.810
that river there, whatever the fuck it is,

193
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.470
like walking along these trains tracks and I got to be honest with you,

194
00:11:33.471 --> 00:11:36.410
I was a little nervous about that because it was this old kind of wooden bridge

195
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.660
and I was just thinking, uh,

196
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.270
someone would walk by me and I always kind of made eye contact and like braced

197
00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:47.400
myself because I've just was nervous that someone's just going to grab my legs

198
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:51.840
and throw me over. I remember seeing a movie a long time ago, this guy did that.

199
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.610
He was a psycho and he went hiking with these people and they didn't realize he

200
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:57.020
was a psycho. I think he'd already killed people in.

201
00:11:57.021 --> 00:12:01.690
Then he went up there and uh, he went to like take a picture of this woman,

202
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:05.890
this couple or somebody pushed both of them off the fucking cliff. Um,

203
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.090
and it was so eerily done that I'm like,

204
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:12.010
this has to be based on a true story.

205
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.550
Cause usually that's not good enough for Hollywood dance to be some dramatic way

206
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:18.040
they kill you rather than just some creepy real way.

207
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.260
Um, so I was walking across that, that beautiful nature and everything.

208
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:27.340
Then it was just, you know, worried someone's going to just,

209
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:28.550
I dunno,

210
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.810
just grabbed me by my ankles and tossed me right over before I realized what was

211
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:36.460
going on. You know, typical shit had to be so busy trying to save my cell phone.

212
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:38.200
I wouldn't even think about myself before I went over.

213
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:39.640
I don't think I could've landed a dog, you know,

214
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.230
I don't think I was that high up.

215
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.200
<v 3>Um,</v>

216
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.033
<v 2>what does that say about me then?</v>

217
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.350
I'm going through nature and I'm thinking birds are going to tackled ladies.

218
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:49.700
If somebody's gonna throw me off a bridge,

219
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.033
<v 3>uh,</v>

220
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.060
<v 2>or just awfully conscious cause I know the fucking drivers listen to him. Uh,</v>

221
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.310
anyways, plowing ahead here. Uh,

222
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.570
then we did the drive down to Regina and I don't know, I don't really have any,

223
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.160
we went to some fucking bar. Why don't you know where the Hell I was drinking?

224
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.190
It's the same place they hadn't lunch and I fucking went into, uh,

225
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.960
when I was in Saskatoon, it's right, right out front from the, uh,

226
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.350
from the red rum in that I was staying at. And Oh my God,

227
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:25.120
that place was a shit show. And this is fucking earliest.

228
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:28.510
We walked into the bar and the guy goes, can I see your driver's license? I go,

229
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:32.230
yeah. And then he goes to scan the thing and I like blocked it with my hand.

230
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:35.800
I go, dude, on scan my id, where are you gonna go? You know,

231
00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:38.890
it's just for us loving me, but the fucking media, but fuck out of here.

232
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.130
He was scanned Nate stuff. It's just like,

233
00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:47.710
I like just the liberties that people take with your Id.

234
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:50.680
I don't let go of my id any more. Let me see your id and I just show,

235
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:53.140
I hold onto when they go to take it as this check go. Just read it.

236
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.180
I don't give people my id. You can look at it, you can read it. Um,

237
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.310
you know, when they check into hotels,

238
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:05.020
they always go to grab it from me and I hold onto it. I know that all, sorry.

239
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:09.970
Sorry. Can I see it? I go, I don't want you to type any information into your a,

240
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:13.960
you know, oh, we just do that. So the next time you stay here, now you don't,

241
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:17.170
you take it and then you sell it and then someone else gets it.

242
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:20.890
And then all my fucking shits out there. And next thing you know, you know,

243
00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:21.724
I don't know what

244
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.200
somebody defaults on a house and fucking Regina and the banks are coming after

245
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:29.680
me. I don't know where. I just know it's not a good thing. So, um,

246
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.180
we went in there. Oh my God, those people were fucking party. It was,

247
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.820
it was some sort of holiday weekend up there. I don't know what it was for,

248
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.010
but a lot of tattoos, lot of tattoos,

249
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.620
a lot of sleeves, lot of fucking tattoos. And uh,

250
00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:51.590
I just kept drinking and drinking and drinking and I vaguely remember bringing a

251
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:51.980
hockey

252
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.880
<v 0>stick over is a Sherwood that blew my mind because I had not seen one of those</v>

253
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:59.240
since I was a kid, you know, and they did shots out of it.

254
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.520
And uh, I don't really remember much after that. I just met bud.

255
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.010
<v 2>I walked out by myself. I do remember that, I think. Yes.</v>

256
00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:14.440
And then the next day I woke up and I did the whole stupid walk.

257
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.240
And when I was done with the walk, there was this little double decker bus

258
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.070
and I was starving. I didn't know whether it was a good breakfast play sank,

259
00:15:24.071 --> 00:15:24.904
just said fuck it.

260
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.910
And I walked up to the double decker bus that they turned into this fucking

261
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.570
little restaurant thing and I had a hot dog for breakfast.

262
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.800
It folded up with a a mid chocolate chip ice cream counter

263
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.540
and I sat alone on a fucking park bench eating an ice cream cone, Saskatoon,

264
00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:47.380
Saskatchewan

265
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.470
hung over his shit and just laughing at myself like,

266
00:15:53.471 --> 00:15:56.650
what kind of a fucking life on my living. So as I'm sitting there,

267
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:01.540
this nice Canadian couple pulls up, right? They both thought bicycles.

268
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.890
One of them was towing a kid and I just see what the one guy, you know,

269
00:16:05.891 --> 00:16:08.460
they're all like Flander sick. That's how nice they are up there.

270
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.670
And he just goes, he pulls up, he's like, oh, oh no.

271
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.870
<v 0>Oh No. And I'm like, what's he looking at?</v>

272
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.650
They turned around and I looked back the, you know,

273
00:16:16.651 --> 00:16:17.760
the little busting that they had,

274
00:16:17.761 --> 00:16:22.761
the hotdogs and the ice cream and like 40 children's jet just showed up,

275
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.940
brought up by like the teachers or something.

276
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.180
It's like they were going to be out of ice cream and hotdogs by the time these

277
00:16:27.181 --> 00:16:29.340
people order. It was fucking hilarious.

278
00:16:29.341 --> 00:16:32.610
I beat the Russian just by like 30 seconds,

279
00:16:32.611 --> 00:16:34.950
but like they were just all know, Geez,

280
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.450
well I guess we got here at the wrong time. No, no, no. Sorry. Sorry. It's okay.

281
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.240
It's all good. You eat everything. I don't need nourishment.

282
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.030
They were like even apologetic like that. It was so,

283
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:51.710
I always forget how loud and obnoxious I am and my fellow Americans are until I

284
00:16:52.051 --> 00:16:55.740
go to like other countries, like I don't want to be the gay shit, not Americans,

285
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.820
because I was up there and he just kept talking about how nice the people are up

286
00:16:59.821 --> 00:17:02.510
there and I was like, dude, fuck these people. They've, they've Ryan, when they,

287
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.680
when they lose, you know, a playoff series. Okay,

288
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.840
they're just as racist or just as fucked up, blah, blah.

289
00:17:09.841 --> 00:17:12.480
By the time we got to Regina, I was like, all right, you know what?

290
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.410
These are really nice people. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you.

291
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.270
All right. I'm stubborn.

292
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.750
I don't want to be yet another person that travels to another country and then

293
00:17:21.751 --> 00:17:24.720
comes back here to tell everybody how everything in this country is wrong.

294
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.990
You should see how they make a grilled cheese sandwich up there.

295
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.290
I mean it's just so everything's like fuck it better.

296
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.180
It's like really? Is that why everybody's always paying attention to us?

297
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.480
You know, if we stink so bad,

298
00:17:39.481 --> 00:17:43.650
how come you know the name of our president and we don't know the name of your

299
00:17:43.651 --> 00:17:47.360
president? Huh? Want you think about that one for a second? General Bill?

300
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.680
Cause you guys dropped bombs on us all. Fair enough.

301
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.320
<v 2>All right, 17 minutes. This is like the fucking old days right now.</v>

302
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:03.780
If you'd like to know I'm going over the Manhattan bridge.

303
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.780
I'm looking at my old digs way back in the day up the street.

304
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:15.550
I used to live in Yorkville. Think that's what it was called. And it was Rosa,

305
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.650
that depressing fucking Roosevelt Island Queensboro bridge.

306
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:22.290
I walked across that day one time I was so sick of going to the gym.

307
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:24.610
I was just like, you know, I ran down. I didn't run for another time.

308
00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.030
I fucking walked down, walked over the bridge.

309
00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.300
And there's no way to walk on a bridge and not think about that Saturday night

310
00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:33.900
fever, the fucking idiot. You know,

311
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.020
I love how he was too cowardly to get into that fight.

312
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:41.400
And then he's going to do a headstand on the Verizanno bridge. That's still,

313
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:46.000
by the way, that's still one. And uh, that goes from Brooklyn to stat.

314
00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:50.430
Now see if I still remember, this goes Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan, Williamsburg,

315
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:54.000
then Manhattan. Hey Sir. Is this still a Brooklyn?

316
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.550
I mean system Manhattan or Williamsburg. Williamsburg. How, sorry. Williamsburg.

317
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.350
My fault. So it goes Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg,

318
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.300
Queensborough and then I don't know what the fuck else is up there.

319
00:19:06.301 --> 00:19:10.900
There's some sort of foot bridge ish. Triborough bridge or some shit.

320
00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:13.750
They probably renamed it. You know, at this point,

321
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.640
it's not the Jackie Robinson fucking bridge. It's probably named after some,

322
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.040
some lady, you know,

323
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.300
I dunno what some lady fucking showed in clam. I show [inaudible]

324
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.180
she was considered brave. You know the, every, twice,

325
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.630
every bridge login they get, I don't do it. Fucking vagina, joke and vagina.

326
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.150
Now I'm going to do it out on a, on a bridge. It's wrong.

327
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.403
<v 3>Okay.</v>

328
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:42.580
<v 2>Um, so anyways, oh my God. Alphabet city. Yeah. Now it's like all nice</v>

329
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.380
Tom Skins, square pack, all the memories of coming back. You know,

330
00:19:48.381 --> 00:19:51.290
I've been gone from this city for so long that there's a lot of it that I don't

331
00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:52.340
even recognize. Like,

332
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.910
I mean obviously the empire state building and that type of Shit Times Square

333
00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:57.751
and that type of thing,

334
00:19:57.751 --> 00:20:01.860
but it's like just a completely different from the city that I moved to.

335
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.060
Like Times Square was fucking scary when I moved here.

336
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:08.430
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

337
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.720
<v 2>So we just drove by,</v>

338
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.280
just drove by us and was driving like 30 miles an hour with the sun roof open

339
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.920
with their cell phone out the top of videotaping. But

340
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.960
I guess I'm podcasting but I'm not driving. Right or do you want to film it all?

341
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:31.860
I'm sorry. Sorry. It's okay. Sorry. Um, I'll let it for you.

342
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:34.980
I won't charge her anything. I'm Canadian. Um,

343
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.570
how funny is it that they're that nice and then you get them out on the ice?

344
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:43.800
That's when it all comes out. Right. Fucking crosscheck into the neck.

345
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.110
What was said? Flanders gets his glasses off,

346
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.240
puts on a different kind of sweater and you'd better keep your fucking head up.

347
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.800
That's Canada, right inside. Please do a drawing of fucking Flanders as a fuck.

348
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.750
A good for the fucking, I don't know,

349
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.191
the Thunderbay Lamas, whatever,

350
00:21:01.191 --> 00:21:06.140
whatever the name of your teams are up there in the fucking lower levels,

351
00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:09.650
the minor leagues, whatever you call. Or there'd be,

352
00:21:09.651 --> 00:21:12.230
every fucking Canadians are saying, I made it to thunder bay and the,

353
00:21:12.231 --> 00:21:14.870
I don't know, I wasn't good enough to get in the NHL.

354
00:21:14.871 --> 00:21:16.580
So I tried to fight my way into the lake.

355
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:22.190
I know I'm doing a bad Canadian accent. I apologize. But uh,

356
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.440
<v 3>okay.</v>

357
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.060
<v 2>Anyways, whatever. Do I remember long time ago,</v>

358
00:21:26.061 --> 00:21:30.890
Jeff Ross hosted a comedy show live from Thompson Square Park.

359
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.720
And I remember thinking that was so fucking Badass.

360
00:21:35.721 --> 00:21:39.260
Anybody that was performing there cause alphabet. See,

361
00:21:39.261 --> 00:21:43.010
like before I even came here, people were saying how scary that was.

362
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.550
Like Thompson Square was just like the city had just given into like,

363
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.180
I mean it was like, that's a subway goal by a or something. Um,

364
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.830
it was just like a tent city. Like I walked by one time and it was just like,

365
00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.400
uh, I was trying to mask the fear of my face plus, you know,

366
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:05.180
rubber neck and just wanted to see what it looked like. And uh,

367
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:10.370
it was like junkies, homeless people just fucking mentally ill people.

368
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.380
It was like, it was like the beginning of a bad like hair metal video.

369
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.600
You know, when they used to try to do those apocalypse ones,

370
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.110
they were all basically loosely based on the escape from New York.

371
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.110
People coming up on a man holes even what's his face did that Michael Jackson

372
00:22:24.111 --> 00:22:27.860
did it. It looked like it was like the thrill of video except uh, you know,

373
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:30.523
it was real

374
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.870
get away. Um, anyways, I'm going to read some advertising characteristic.

375
00:22:38.871 --> 00:22:41.290
Getting car sick. Um,

376
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.200
it was funny about having a kid is your screensavers all become your kid and

377
00:22:45.201 --> 00:22:47.260
every time you pick up your phone you just, you know,

378
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.850
you're around other adults and they have no idea.

379
00:22:49.851 --> 00:22:51.560
You're looking at your kid and you just go play ball

380
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:58.220
and you try to turn it into a cough. Excuse me. Because as a man,

381
00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.180
you're not allowed to show love. Um, all right,

382
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.990
content live reads. Okay, here we go. Oh, look at this. Look at this.

383
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.310
Live from the fucking Williamsburg Bridge.

384
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.110
It's old zip.

385
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:14.723
<v 3>Okay, a recruiter.</v>

386
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.690
<v 2>The driver's gonna think I'm nuts. Uh, are you hiring well, are you,</v>

387
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.620
do you know where he posts your job to find the best candidates?

388
00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.320
Talk about the challenge of finding great talent and,

389
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:27.570
or the approach importance of finding great talents

390
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.040
to a successful business. So I think people know that. Yeah, you guys,

391
00:23:32.041 --> 00:23:33.870
you guys didn't know. You know, when you're hiring people,

392
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:36.210
you don't want to fucking moron to come in,

393
00:23:36.211 --> 00:23:39.840
especially if they're running the register, you know, or your new CEO.

394
00:23:39.841 --> 00:23:42.990
You don't want to dope. You want the best person possible.

395
00:23:42.991 --> 00:23:45.530
So it'd be nice if you could, you can pick from,

396
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.610
<v 1>you know,</v>

397
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.120
hundreds of thousands of people rather than whatever mouth breather answers your

398
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:54.500
ad in the local paper. Uh, how's ZipRecruiter is different with sip?

00:24:06.861 --> 00:24:10.820
That's why ZipRecruiter is different unlike other job sites is it

403
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.340
doesn't depend on candidates finding you. That one was creepy.

404
00:24:16.341 --> 00:24:18.620
That was like a ghost went by. It finds them. In fact,

405

over 80% of jobs posted on ZipRecruiter get a qualified candidate in just 24

417
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.120
A zip recruiter. Novae. All right, car shield.

418
00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.160
I have no idea what this is.

419
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.250
Is this a bra for the front of your car so you don't get rocks up on it?

420
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.290
Sooner or later your car will break down. It's a fact. Every car,

421
00:25:25.291 --> 00:25:27.870
truck and SUV owner knows if you're lucky.

422
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.800
It happens while still under the manufacturing manufacturer's warranty and the

423
00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:34.920
repairs are covered. If it happens after the warranty expired,

424
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.090
although you could be out of pocket thousands to get it fixed.

425
00:25:39.091 --> 00:25:44.091
That's why getting extended coverage from car shield.com is a good idea.

426
00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:49.730
A new engine or new transmission could cost over $5,000 transmission doesn't

427
00:25:50.251 --> 00:25:53.550
cost $5,000 all right?

428
00:25:53.551 --> 00:25:56.070
You can go on youtube to figure out how to fucking pull an engine.

429
00:25:56.071 --> 00:26:01.071
You could do it even as simple repairative sensor chain cost over a thousand

430
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:06.240
dollars skip that hassle man, cause shield makes the whole process like dead.

431
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.790
Canadian whole process process. Sorry. Easy.

432
00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.660
You select your favorite mechanic or you can even go to the dealership to do the

433
00:26:12.661 --> 00:26:13.494
work. That's cool.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.400

437
00:26:24.241 --> 00:26:28.800
roadside assistance and a rental car while your you always just in the shop so

438
00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:32.580
you're not left stranded out in the cold or you guys could maintain the fucking

439
00:26:32.581 --> 00:26:35.370
engines. It's funny,

440
00:26:35.371 --> 00:26:39.000
the engine blocks made out of fucking steel sounds. The transmission,

441
00:26:39.001 --> 00:26:43.020
if you just keep it looped up, I mean theoretically it could last,

442
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.500
but who knows? Who's kidding, who. You're not gonna fucking do that. Are you?

443
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.160
So get cars, shield. If your car is three to 12 years old,

444
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.010
it doesn't mean you have to pay high repair bill bills.

445
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.630
Car Shield administrators have paid out close to 2 billion in claims and they're

446
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:01.290

499
00:29:52.511 --> 00:29:54.550

unsupervised little kid acting like he had a gun. No,

501
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.610

They're leaning up against a dirty poll.

508
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.740

516
00:30:52.701 --> 00:30:57.701
Back in the day I used to do this fucking room called surf reality and uh,

517
00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:03.170
it was the beginning of the AllSeen and the level of talent.

518
00:31:03.171 --> 00:31:05.150
This was before you could start your career,

519
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:09.590
start a privileged career in the fucking old rooms where there was like,

520
00:31:09.591 --> 00:31:10.424
no heckling,

521
00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:14.420
let's just support and give somebody at least 20 minutes to get to a fucking

522
00:31:14.421 --> 00:31:16.760
punchline. This was like club comics going down there.

523
00:31:16.761 --> 00:31:19.580
And then just some Weirdo people that you know,

524
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.370
just were just totally different. But all the comics loved them.

525
00:31:22.371 --> 00:31:24.350
And I used to do a place down here called surf reality.

526
00:31:24.351 --> 00:31:27.020
And I remember every time I got off the train and I walked over here,

527
00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:31.640
I used to fuck, I was convinced I was gonna get mugged. And uh,

528
00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:36.140
I bought this jacket from the army navy store in a black fucking hat trying to

529
00:31:36.141 --> 00:31:38.930
look like I was in nom or some shit. And uh, you know,

530
00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:44.000
keeping my head down so they didn't see the fucking Ron Howard look on my

531
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.253
goddamn face, you know.

532
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.693
<v 3>Um,</v>

533
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.190
<v 2>you know, what's great about this is, is as I look out this,</v>

534
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:55.000
I might be able to do a whole podcast and not bring up what is happening to my

535
00:31:55.001 --> 00:31:59.800
Boston Celtics, Jesus Christ. Everything that I feared finally happened.

536
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.470
I told you guys when he first started watching him, I'm like,

537
00:32:02.471 --> 00:32:06.700
how could a team that doesn't really have a center that doesn't rebound,

538
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:11.710
is not good playing d in the paint and lives and dies by the three?

539
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:16.540
How can you win in the NBA? But they did and I bought into it.

540
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.590
And you know what a big bucket of reality hit us and gave us the old right

541
00:32:20.591 --> 00:32:24.460
there, Fred. I don't know if game three is tonight, but after watching game two,

542
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.180
Jesus Christ, I was, I was so excited.

543
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.360
Least we got the number one pick next year I'm going to go out on a limb and

544
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:32.560
say, maybe we should get a center.

545
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.860
What are you guys sick of, man? You still believe Kelly Olynyk.

546
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.630
<v 0>If the rest of the team can somehow get us to game seven,</v>

547
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.760
I'm warning you people in Cleveland Right now,

548
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:48.500
you better watch out for Kelly Olynyk.

549
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:52.580
That is a bad man and games seven games one through six,

550
00:32:52.581 --> 00:32:56.540
he's fucking horrific. But you get that man to game seven lucky seven.

551
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:57.200
That's who I,

552
00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.200
that's what I call lucky seven with this Kobe 11 elevenths brings to Celtics to

553
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:07.060
have in some shit. I don't know if it rhymes. It's true. Um, I don't know.

554
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.700
After game two, I'm wondering if we're even gonna make it to game four.

555
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.100
I mean we lost by 54 fucking points.

556
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.700
That's like some shit that happens when you're like in middle school.

557
00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:22.780
<v 4>Um,</v>

558
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.900
<v 0>but his, there's a part of me that actually enjoys this because,</v>

559
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:28.200
<v 4>um,</v>

560
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.910
<v 0>I'm rooting against the warriors and I think it bugs Lebron and the Cavaliers</v>

561
00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:34.410
that we were the number one seed,

562
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.160
I think it bugs him that they acted like we even remotely had a shot against

563
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.570
them. And I know Isaiah's has, we

564
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:43.890
<v 2>just found that out. But come on, he's heard. So what we only lose by 34 points.</v>

565
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.880
Um, I think they just got a chip on his shoulder,

566
00:33:47.881 --> 00:33:51.390
did the defending champs and nobody is talking about them like they are.

567
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:56.360
And everybody's up the fucking ass. You know, the old, the bosses sell to two,

568
00:33:56.530 --> 00:34:00.250
they're a number one seed just trying to sell this series right now.

569
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.520
Everybody's out there talking about the fucking,

570
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.370
the filthy Golden State Warriors,

571
00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:10.000
kicking people in the balls and blowing out fucking ankles and shit. Um,

572
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.140
I mean, has it been a more boring western conference or Eastern conference?

573
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.780
Matchups I mean, these things have just been absolute blowouts.

574
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.640
I bet they calling up stern again and he's going to get those mobbed up for

575
00:34:23.641 --> 00:34:25.740
Epson, then fucking start fixing some games again.

576
00:34:25.741 --> 00:34:28.650
Just so they don't lose out on all this ad money because these things are just

577
00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.613
going to go,

578
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:34.200
they're going to go for games rather than they haven't 14 games possibly of ad

579
00:34:34.201 --> 00:34:38.640
money. They're going to have the bare minimal eight, you know, and these owners,

580
00:34:38.641 --> 00:34:41.940
man, they got a lot of money they have to pay out to these players. You know,

581
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.180
they spend a lot of money with their hookers and all that type of shit.

582
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.570
You know, getting the fucking tummies talked,

583
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:52.980
lap band surgery and all this ship getting their faces yanked back so they can

584
00:34:52.981 --> 00:34:56.580
keep banging the underpaid cheerleaders or whatever it is that they do.

585
00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:02.430
So everybody, I've, everybody's is basically waiting for the finals and um,

586
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.700
I don't know, man. I, I don't want to jinx it.

587
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:10.200
I'm going to shut up cause I already jinx the fucking city of Washington

588
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:16.100
by just saying I don't want to jinx it. But, uh, I think, uh, uh,

589
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:17.340
I'm not going to say what's going to happen.

590
00:35:17.341 --> 00:35:19.980
I'm just saying what I would love to see. I, I want to see the Cavaliers win.

591
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:25.040
I want to see them go fucking back to back and I want to see that fucking

592
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.770
Dream Team of a, I don't know, I can't say a bunch of free agents. Just,

593
00:35:31.771 --> 00:35:36.240
I don't know. I'm just all cunty because I wanted to see the fucking,

594
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.660
I wanted to see the thunder, see if they could get by him.

595
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.200
I didn't want to see the fucking,

596
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:46.140
one of their best guys just join the Goddamn team. Um, can you imagine that?

597
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:48.000
Like back in the day. You know,

598
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:52.410
like when Larry Bird steals the ball from Isaiah can imagine the next year,

599
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:56.700
like Isaiah Thomas was a Celtic then we just like kicked the shit as a fucking

600
00:35:56.701 --> 00:35:59.160
guy staring at me. Like, why I'm doing this recording right now.

601
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:06.290
I just waved down and he continued to stare at me and now I'm feeling like,

602
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.740
uh, now I'm feeling weird. Oh,

603
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:15.390
I guess he was looking at the car. It's sunglasses on Jesus Christ.

604
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.980
Is this guy a fucking robot? Why is he looking at me?

605
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.280
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

606
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.940
<v 2>he's got a minivan and you just stay. I'm in a SUV.</v>

607
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.550
I guess if you have a minivan, you fucking,

608
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.750
you take your sunglasses off to look at an SUV, right?

609
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.920
The minivan is sort of the ball is SUV

610
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:43.340
and the SUV. Sort of the one ball of like a, I dunno, full sized truck.

611
00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.470
I don't know how it works. I'm not a redneck. I'll fuck day.

612
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.610
The Handmaid's tale on Hulu. Is anybody watching that?

613
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.450
I came home the other day and my mother in law, she always,

614
00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:58.640
she watches all these shows that I would never see.

615
00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.470
She started to watch one about the,

616
00:37:00.471 --> 00:37:04.520
it was about this girl who committed suicide and left like a tape that she was

617
00:37:04.521 --> 00:37:08.660
watching. That one I would say it's like little house in the prairie meats,

618
00:37:08.661 --> 00:37:11.890
like an s and m video. It was really weird. I got,

619
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.130
I don't know what was going on like they would,

620
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.860
they would like these nuns and they were trying to escape this thing and one of

621
00:37:15.861 --> 00:37:19.160
them makes it on the subway and the other one doesn't and then next thing you

622
00:37:19.161 --> 00:37:21.290
know they got her tied down in there beating her feet.

623
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.250
How do you get that job?

624
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.230
You official like feet beater.

625
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.140
I could see like back in the day, you know what I mean? Back in a while.

626
00:37:36.141 --> 00:37:38.510
Maybe this was, no, this was seems to be like in the future.

627
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:43.400
Do you realize that there's people out there that they're born in at some point

628
00:37:43.401 --> 00:37:45.350
when they try to figure out like what am I good at?

629
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.370
Like the answer to that ends up being torturing other human beings.

630
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:53.610
How fucked up is that? Right. You know what I mean? Just like,

631
00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.870
it's kind of like being like a comedian either funny or you're not.

632
00:37:57.871 --> 00:37:59.290
You can't teach somebody to be funny.

633
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.560
And then there's like the like tortured some.

634
00:38:02.561 --> 00:38:07.540
You just can't teach somebody to be able to do that. Just like block it out.

635
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.290
If somebody's fucking screaming this I,

636
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.780
you've sitting there screaming and crying,

637
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.440
that guy's just just whacking the shit out of her feet.

638
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.920
I always come always as my alarm. Like Jesus crying, what the fuck?

639
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.970
What the hell you're watching? She always left. She's like, I don't know.

640
00:38:21.971 --> 00:38:26.930
I just put this on. All

641
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.040
right, so here we go. Jesus Christ. You know,

642
00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:31.690
I got to give it up to the graffiti artists.

643
00:38:31.691 --> 00:38:33.610
Like they've really taken it to another level

644
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:40.020
in certain tattoos I've noticed, you know,

645
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.810
there's like that high level tattoo artists are amazing.

646
00:38:42.811 --> 00:38:47.811
But the problem is is most people that get tattoos don't have a lot of money.

647
00:38:48.151 --> 00:38:48.984
So like,

648
00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.130
you know what's the worst is when you see somebody go into a tattoo parlor and

649
00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:55.470
they're looking at shit on the wall and it's just like, dude,

650
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.330
that's going to be on your body for life. You don't even have like a,

651
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:03.360
you don't have an idea, you don't have a theme and see a,

652
00:39:03.361 --> 00:39:04.194
I don't know,

653
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.700
kind of like a butterfly with like a B.

654
00:39:08.701 --> 00:39:11.490
And that's what's going to end up happening. If you look on a wall,

655
00:39:11.491 --> 00:39:13.050
it's either going to be a skull.

656
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.580
What sets star Tattoo that everybody has that red fucking black one.

657
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.330
I don't know. Like three comedians that have them.

658
00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.870
A couple of boy band guys have them. I don't know what it is.

659
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.050
Maybe it's an anime thing. I have no idea. That's my new word enemy.

660
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:32.310
Cause I'm watching that fucking one punch man. Uh, anyways,

661
00:39:32.311 --> 00:39:35.610
let's get back to the Celtics. Holy fucking shit. You realize we have lost,

662
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.193
<v 3>I think</v>

663
00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.860
<v 2>we've lost by like a total of like, like north of 80 points</v>

664
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.040
in the first two games. Definitely north of 70. Like,

665
00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:49.760
if you took all the,

666
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.170
if you just had the Cavaliers win by one end game one and then one in game two

667
00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.620
and you just gave him all those other points, like they would not,

668
00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:00.680
they could have me in there. Oh, who's kid? No, me.

669
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:05.660
You get to be in there for about a quarter and a half. It's all tied up. 78, 78.

670
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.963
<v 3>Um,</v>

671
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.510
<v 2>Jesus Christ. I mean this is like one,</v>

672
00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.680
this is the worst beating a Celtic team has ever taken in my life in the

673
00:40:14.681 --> 00:40:17.770
playoffs. Uh, the, uh, the other closest,

674
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:19.990
most humiliating one to this was,

675
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.410
I don't know if a lot of people don't remember this during the Larry Bird era

676
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.410
and it was the last year of Bill Fitch. She'd kind of lost the team.

677
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.600
I guess they blame the coach. I don't know how,

678
00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:33.930
but we got swept by the Milwaukee Bucks and I remember we lost game one and we

679
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:37.150
lost game two and then we lost game three and I just kept thinking like,

680
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:38.710
they're going to turn it on and they're going to turn it on.

681
00:40:38.711 --> 00:40:43.270
And then they lost game four and that team had Larry Bird, Robert Parish,

682
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:48.070
Kevin Mchale a, I don't think we had Dennis Johnson at that point.

683
00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:51.010
And I'm trying to remember who was on the box was Sidney Moncrief.

684
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.220
<v 3>I Dunno who else? Um,</v>

685
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:56.121
<v 2>dude,</v>

686
00:40:56.121 --> 00:40:58.970
I'm so psyched that I already got 40 minutes of this fucking podcast done cause

687
00:40:58.971 --> 00:41:02.900
I have no god damn time. Like I was supposed to be at this thing that I'm doing.

688
00:41:02.901 --> 00:41:07.760
I was supposed to be there 25 minutes ago. It's five 55.

689
00:41:07.761 --> 00:41:09.260
It's supposed to start at six 30.

690
00:41:09.261 --> 00:41:13.730
So there is some pa right now freaking the fuck out.

691
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:15.933
<v 3>And um,</v>

692
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.540
<v 2>there's nothing I can do about it. I'll get someone else to street.</v>

693
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.020
The other fire engine,

694
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.430
this is just like the fire chief got a little pickup truck.

695
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.063
<v 3>Um,</v>

696
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.290
<v 2>oh, they've got a fire engine there, by the way, dude.</v>

697
00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.980
Do you see that fucking lunatic, which is plowed into the,

698
00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:40.940
uh, all those people in Times Square. What the fuck is wrong with people?

699
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.010
Geez, I didn't want to like talk about it to give anybody fucking ideas.

700
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:49.670
Let's get off that subject. Oh, the Adidas store. I love Adidas.

701
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.830
I've always been an Adidas guy. I don't mind Nike, you know, I don't like it.

702
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:59.630
I was like the Adidas better. You know why? Because no one knew.

703
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.840
Like everyone knew Adidas before Nike came along. If it's Nate Nike,

704
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:05.870
I don't know what it is. Oh Wow. Look at this. This is down here.

705
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:06.740
The old fucking

706
00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.690
I all subway stop when I used to live on the upper east side and I used to come

707
00:42:11.691 --> 00:42:14.240
down and go to the comedy cellar in the Boston Comedy Club.

708
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:19.120
What the fuck? Astor place. That's what I used to get off.

709
00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.480
And that's when he started looking up all the names of these people.

710
00:42:22.481 --> 00:42:24.790
Like who then what is Astor place?

711
00:42:24.791 --> 00:42:29.320
And I found out about the astro family and they just all just bunch of fucking

712
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:32.950
slumlords all the statutes. I just started looking them up.

713
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.990
I learned about the triangle shirtwaist fire

714
00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.260
people jump into their fucking deaths cause somebody locked the door to the,

715
00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.220
uh,

716
00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:47.220
look that one up triangle shirtwaist fire actually read a book on it.

717
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:51.280
And uh, it was just, I don't know why. I did. It was,

718
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.850
it was the most uncomfortable book since I read, I read the book,

719
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.520
the perfect storm and um,

720
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.930
if you don't want to buy the book, just fucking open it up and just,

721
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.220
there's a chapter,

722
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.720
maybe like a three page thing maybe where the guy describes what happens when

723
00:43:08.721 --> 00:43:13.340
you drought them and it's just like, I dunno, you fucking blood goes cold man.

724
00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:14.780
It's fucking freaky as hell.

725
00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.690
Do you know whenever they find those guys in the caves and he's had this goofy

726
00:43:19.691 --> 00:43:20.501
smile on their face,

727
00:43:20.501 --> 00:43:25.210
like those divers decided to fucking swim into a Goddamn cave.

728
00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:31.810
That just then what I love, they're dumb enough to do that.

729
00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.090
And then some poor bastard has to go in there,

730
00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:39.670
has to go in there and try to fucking find them.

731
00:43:39.671 --> 00:43:40.750
Why did they just leave them? Why do they,

732
00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:45.730
why don't they just leave them down there? What the fuck?

733
00:43:45.731 --> 00:43:48.430
I don't understand. You know what I mean? Just fucking leave him down there.

734
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.640
Why do you get to spend all that money to go get a swam into a cave?

735
00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.410
He went into a cave underwater. Like, what the fuck are we supposed to do?

736
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.980
And that's somebody God damn job. They gotta go down and fish.

737
00:44:02.981 --> 00:44:04.360
You going down there, no one.

738
00:44:04.361 --> 00:44:06.100
You're going to see a dead body when they find them.

739
00:44:06.101 --> 00:44:08.560
I guess they always have this goofy smile on their face because of the last

740
00:44:08.561 --> 00:44:10.600
thing is your body releases.

741
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:14.980
I don't all this dopamine or some shit. I felt like John Rogan right now,

742
00:44:14.981 --> 00:44:18.700
except I don't know what I'm talking about. A dopamine and you know,

743
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:23.620
one of those drugs that those fucking ravers take releases that shit. Right?

744
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.070
And they feel this, this level of euphoria,

745
00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:30.130
like the end of your life level of euphoria.

746
00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:34.240
And the next day they'd just eaten like a bowl of Apple Jackson. They did like,

747
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.980
just burst out in tears because it's so fucking depressing cause they fucked up.

748
00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:41.610
They only know what it feels like to dive whichever deadly after you go through

749
00:44:41.611 --> 00:44:43.800
the horror or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah under the water.

750
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.360
I guess it's a nice experience like, hey man, that wasn't that bad.

751
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:54.750
Um, let's drive. Thanks. I'm out of my fucking mind. I know it. Uh, we're,

752
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:59.040
we got 44 minutes, 44 fucking minutes. Oh, Jesus.

753
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:02.010
I used to go down here and I used to do hot 97,

754
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.570
you know, back in the day when everything was fucking crazy,

755
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.550
like three times a year,

756
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:11.580
rappers would see they have like a gun battle in the fucking lobby.

757
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.700
And I would go down there and whenever I was doing, uh,

758
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.930
whenever I was doing Caroline's, you know,

759
00:45:18.931 --> 00:45:23.700
and I used to headline Carolines on like a Tuesday night and they would, uh,

760
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.720
Louis Faranda used to have to pull the fucking curtain, you know,

761
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.770
so wouldn't look bad. And, uh,

762
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:36.750
I was doing talents rooms and a, so let's do the white in the black room.

763
00:45:36.751 --> 00:45:39.330
So I used to come down here and I used to try to get some people that maybe saw

764
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:40.330
me open for a

765
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:45.840
talent or drew Frasier or fucking Gerald Kelly,

766
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.340
the New York Kings,

767
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:50.830
<v 4>um,</v>

768
00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:54.160
<v 2>rob Stapleton, all of them. I used to do that rooms. Uh,</v>

769
00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.330
well, one of the most fun times in my career that I had was,

770
00:46:00.331 --> 00:46:04.680
was doing that stuff. Uh, nobody knew who the fuck I was to go on stage,

771
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.920
you know, expect now people come out, they know who I am.

772
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:10.800
So then it's like I have to work to lose them.

773
00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:16.410
What back then I actually had to fucking earn it. And uh, you know, believe me,

774
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.230
I, I, I look back on those days finally, but I don't,

775
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.640
I don't miss not selling tickets.

776
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:27.270
So whenever I come back here, I always think about all of those gigs.

777
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:28.740
Um,

778
00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:33.740
Capone used to have this room Nell's on 14th street and it was the greatest

779
00:46:34.201 --> 00:46:34.921
fucking bar,

780
00:46:34.921 --> 00:46:39.921
but it was such a hard room for me that one in Labar bet talent had that one and

781
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.060
that one, that fucking room, every time I went there, it was like, I bombed.

782
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.450
Next time I killed, I bombed, I killed. And I,

783
00:46:47.451 --> 00:46:51.990
I can never figure that roam out was I going after Work Party?

784
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:57.870
And I used to go up there white as hell. And it just either they, you know,

785
00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.820
you had basically in the black rooms you have,

786
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.830
you have your opening joke and then that's it. They,

787
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:07.230
they black people had their very much like Sicilians where it's like you're dead

788
00:47:07.231 --> 00:47:11.980
to them. You fuck up once that's it, you're dead to me over. There's this,

789
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:15.580
this relationship is done and there's no, there's no, uh,

790
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:17.910
there's no repairing it. Um,

791
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.660
which is why it's amazing what's her face.

792
00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:25.320
The Fuji Chick there started to get booed on the Apollo and then fucking turned

793
00:47:25.321 --> 00:47:29.680
it around. The hell's her goddamn name, you know,

794
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.780
<v 0>amazing voice. Cutest health. Four hours late to our shows.</v>

795
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:39.250
Lauren Hill, Lauren Hill. Um,

796
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:42.730
whenever I hear the Fuji Music, that reminds me when I first moved down here,

797
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:46.300
that and, uh, old tank claim 36 chambers.

798
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.830
And what else? What else was I listening to back then?

799
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.600
I Dunno. Okay. Now if this guy's driving like a fucking maniac,

800
00:47:55.601 --> 00:47:59.490
I think he's sick of my podcast here. Um, how far away are we?

801
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.730
Another five minutes. Another five minutes. You know, they're freaking out, man.

802
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.900
What fuck is he going to? Oh yeah, I got to,

803
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:11.230
I look like I look like I just came from Saskatchewan.

804
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.170
They're going to take pictures, so I can't be looking like that.

805
00:48:14.171 --> 00:48:17.590
I got to look like a, at least bathed today.

806
00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:20.830
<v 3>Um,</v>

807
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:23.550
<v 0>oh dude, I got a fucking 6:30 AM flight today. Oh,</v>

808
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:27.460
not that puts me in a goddamn mood. My show didn't get done until 12,

809
00:48:27.461 --> 00:48:30.340
and of course I had to go out and have a couple of pops to celebrate the end of

810
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:32.980
the tour. Um, I want to thank everybody who would seriously,

811
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:34.660

Everybody that came out and a tooled Saskatoon, sorry about the,

813

814
00:48:43.931 --> 00:48:48.430
I had a great time. I'm definitely those three cities and now part of my tours.

815
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:51.070
<v 3>Um,</v>

816
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.800
<v 0>now I feel I can go right across the whole southern part.</v>

817
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.280
So I was telling people the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do,

818
00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:02.050

819
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:05.500
fucking nine foot lady with no clothes on. Do you see that?

820
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:09.970
She had her ass hanging out of the bottom of her fucking dress

821
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:16.930
like a sand trap. Somebody fucking divots in it. Sorry. Sorry.

822
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.480
I'm sorry. I'm not that.

823
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:24.580
Our many price and we stopping to get gas. We tried to make a left. Oh, okay.

824

825
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:26.803
<v 3>Okay.</v>

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.480
<v 0>Yeah. Let's go. Let's go.</v>

827
00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.560
We get behind the one polite cab driver in the fucking city here.

828
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:36.963
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:45.893
<v 3>All right.</v>

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.750
<v 0>You mean a left? We're going to a left here.</v>

834
00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.153
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

835
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.880
<v 0>yeah, at idiot. Yeah. I like you. You're like me.</v>

837
00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:57.994
They don't leave.

838
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:59.220
<v 5>Especially with Sunday you got,</v>

839
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.850
it's like dressing Jurassic Park all the times when it comes out.

840
00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:07.390
<v 0>Forgive me if you're one,</v>

I love what you'd say and Trashmore of a and more entertaining.

842
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:13.420
It makes me feel more normal cause that's all I do.

843
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.240
Don't you take part of it is because we feel like, you know,

844
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:19.420
they don't know what we're doing. We're too wrapped up in ourselves.

845
00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.800
Or do you think they're morons

846
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.710
<v 5>when you right and and underlining people is wrong. They makes you weird. Right?</v>

848
00:50:28.581 --> 00:50:29.630
Bill's Barn Burger.

849
00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:32.770
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

850
00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:36.080
<v 0>Oh, there's some flier fan in there with the Clo Jeru Claude,</v>

851
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:37.540
whoever you say his fucking name.

852
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:39.430
<v 3>I said hotels right in the front.</v>

853
00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.090
<v 0>Oh, okay. Right here. All right dude. I'm going to jump out and I'll be around.</v>

854
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.730
All right. I'm just gonna. I'm gonna. I'll be, I'll be back down in like,

855
00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.520
I'll be so good at this. I don't think there's a place for me.

856
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.510
You have to circle. Yes. I think you've got my phone number, right? I just,

857
00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.900
I think that's tense. Did you text me? Let me call you now. Yeah, call me now.

858
00:50:58.901 --> 00:51:02.770
So then I got it. Then you call me. I was showing him the front. Okay, cool.

859
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:04.121
All right. You know what?

860
00:51:04.121 --> 00:51:07.570
I'm going to call these people and I'll let them know that I'm coming over.

861
00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:08.091
I don't know why.

862
00:51:08.091 --> 00:51:10.810
Why the fuck do I have to be in an hour early for a God damn podcast?

863
00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:15.940
Like in a warm up my voice. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck shit. Right.

864
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:19.420
Um, so your phone ringing, my phone ringing.

865
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:21.743
<v 3>Is that you?</v>

866
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.750
<v 0>No, that's not me. Somebody say hello.</v>

867
00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:26.980
Unless we're in that fucking movie with the guy from Beretta.

868
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:28.740
You ever see that movie?

869
00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.610
The guy who killed somebody or maybe killed somebody got out of jail.

870
00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:35.130
He played Beretta. Remember the, they call them,

871
00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:40.380
the guy did like twin peaks or something. Come on.

872
00:51:40.381 --> 00:51:43.310
You know that not Mulholland drive. What's? What's sick?

873
00:51:43.311 --> 00:51:47.280
Remember the guy from Bretta don't go to bed with the price on your head.

874
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:51.720
No, I'm gonna call you. Don't do it. Hey,

875
00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:56.180
why don't you just give me a phone and I'll do it. Don't say my number here. No,

876
00:51:56.181 --> 00:51:58.860
it's not three one. Oh, come here. Just give me the gun.

877
00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:05.210
Why do you have one glove on? I'll let you drive and glove and I,

878
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:07.370
Michael Jackson. Then I use the left hand moves

879
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.900
right with Michael Jackson. I love it. If you got frame, you got frank. I,

880
00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:17.880
you know something. I actually think he did too. You know what? Yeah.

881
00:52:17.881 --> 00:52:22.410
You can't fucking molest a bunch of white kids even if you became white. Yeah,

882
00:52:22.411 --> 00:52:26.280
and get off on it twice. But California couldn't.

883
00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:28.010
They couldn't nail down OJ, right? Oh,

884
00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:31.070
they just want to do a one is the reputation.

885
00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.640
That's all they just want you to do. All right. Having said that,

886
00:52:33.641 --> 00:52:36.280
would you leave, would you, would you, if you had a kid,

887
00:52:36.281 --> 00:52:38.200
I don't know if you have kids, you wouldn't leave him with Michael though right

888
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:42.400
now they're all day cause they could fight him off

889
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:48.730
on that side so you can feel free to take all your time. I'll be right here.

890
00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:52.470
He just pull up to your house, Huh? Right. Stomping his foot.

891
00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:55.600
Then your fucking kids gotta go up. Alright, I got to hit pause on this.

892
00:52:55.601 --> 00:52:59.500
I'll do the last eight minutes later. All right. Back. Do I need the what back?

893
00:52:59.501 --> 00:53:02.670
Your package? The back. Oh yeah. That's where my best one. My show clothes.

894
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.630
They're in eyes. All right, let me help you. Yeah,

895
00:53:04.631 --> 00:53:07.150
there's like regular clothes and then there's headlining clothes.

896
00:53:07.151 --> 00:53:11.380
I got to get on my head planning. Okay. All right.

897
00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:13.850
Okay. I'll talk to you. It's in a minute.

898
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.790
All right. I'm back. I'm back. Oh, for freckled.

899
00:53:21.791 --> 00:53:25.980
Fucko is back here. I did all my press that I had to

900
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.330
<v 6>do. I want to thank everybody over at vulture fest, everybody treated me great.</v>

901
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.280
They had a fun time going back and forth.

902
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:36.330
One of the women over there was giving me shit about how bad the Celtics were

903
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:39.000
playing and a, you know,

904
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:43.170
and I was just agreeing with her and then she just kept trying to do a dig on

905
00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:44.460
the Celtics and I go, you know,

906
00:53:44.461 --> 00:53:47.340
I really don't appreciate your little passive aggressive comments on the

907
00:53:47.341 --> 00:53:51.720
Celtics. I'm admitting that you kicking our ass. And then she laughed going, ah,

908
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:56.460
you caught that. So I go, you know, we're part of Ohio. You're from, I mean,

909
00:53:56.461 --> 00:54:00.720
she goes, oh, I'm not from Ohio. I go, wait a minute, you know, from Ohio,

910
00:54:00.721 --> 00:54:05.310
how are you a Cavaliers fan? She goes, I'm a Lebron Fan. I'm like,

911
00:54:05.311 --> 00:54:07.380
get the fuck Outta it. She goes, yeah, no.

912
00:54:07.381 --> 00:54:10.920
I was a fan of his when he went down to Miami,

913
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.520
and I'm a fan now that he's gone back to Cleveland. He said, it's like,

914
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.290
you know, found out she's from Washington DC. I'm like,

915
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:22.920
you're a fucking wizards fan. She goes, Ooh, I don't want to do that. It's just,

916
00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:27.750
you know what, I actually respect it on some level. I think that she's a,

917
00:54:27.751 --> 00:54:28.584
a,

918
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:31.590
<v 7>you know, if,</v>

919
00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:35.480
<v 6>I guess if they're all going to be free agents and piling on with each other,</v>

920
00:54:35.481 --> 00:54:39.530
then you might as well be like a free agent fan then it doesn't fucking matter.

921
00:54:39.531 --> 00:54:40.364
Right.

922
00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.030
<v 7>I Dunno.</v>

923
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:43.560
<v 6>I don't know when it's brought out. I'm just joking around.</v>

924
00:54:43.561 --> 00:54:46.350
We had a great time giving each other's shit and then I got to sit down.

925
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.990
They um, it was pretty cool.

926
00:54:48.991 --> 00:54:51.960
They actually showed the first episode of season two and from what I heard,

927
00:54:51.961 --> 00:54:54.630
people really liked it. I of course was not in the room.

928
00:54:54.631 --> 00:54:55.950
I didn't want to deal with that.

929
00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.070
<v 7>And um,</v>

930
00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:03.920
<v 6>and then we went and we did a, uh, I went in,</v>

931
00:55:03.921 --> 00:55:06.540
I did at the interview in front of the crowd that just saw it and uh,

932
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.510
handed out some free tee shirts. We had these,

933
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:12.290
these condoms made up efforts of family condoms and stuff. Handed them out,

934
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:16.850
people liked those, took some pictures afterwards is great interview, you know,

935
00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.720
just great questions. And that type of thing was a lot of fun. And uh,

936
00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:22.190
knocked it out. So, oh Billy boy,

937
00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.850
he's going to be hit in the fucking hotel by he assumed who as you tell him,

938
00:55:25.851 --> 00:55:30.590
I get lifted here. I got to knock out another fucking five minutes.

939
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.860
I might do it tomorrow morning. Maybe I'll do that. You know,

940
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:37.430
cause it doesn't make a difference because you guys,

941
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.150
I gotta watch the Celtics Man. How much are they down by?

942
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:47.570
All right. Watch. I even had to turn on a TV anymore. Watch now. Yes.

943
00:55:47.571 --> 00:55:51.170
That's what I want to do. I want to watch now. I want to watch now.

944
00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.310
You want to watch? I want to watch TV.

945
00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.550
Setting the world on fire.

946
00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:02.870
How much are we down by Kelly Olynyk for the love of God.

947
00:56:02.871 --> 00:56:05.120
Pretend it's fourth quarter game seven.

948
00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:08.150
Whatever the fuck it is you have to do.

949
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.880
<v 7>All right, come on.</v>

950
00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:17.370
<v 6>All right. This is football. You guys really gonna listen to me. Channel Surf.</v>

951
00:56:17.371 --> 00:56:18.390
You don't want to hear this shit.

952
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:23.130
I'm going to watch the Goddamn game and I know dude, live, commentate live.

953
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.983
Not doing that.

954
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:27.580
Someone's just sit here watching these people getting the fucking shit kicked

955
00:56:27.581 --> 00:56:32.110
out of them. Isaiah is out. I mean we could potentially,

956
00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:37.850
we could lose by 40. Oh my God.

957
00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:41.210
All of a sudden just having a number one draft pick just seems a lot different.

958
00:56:41.211 --> 00:56:43.640
I knew all these fucking people going, like, I'll tell you right now,

959
00:56:43.641 --> 00:56:45.290
the Celtics Somalia player way,

960
00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.340
I was at least smart enough to say we're more like a player and a half away.

961
00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.090
Meaning we needed two players.

962
00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:55.570
I remember a few months ago where they were trying to suggest if we got Carmelo

963
00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:01.040
Anthony like we'd have a legitimate shot to take out.

964
00:57:01.041 --> 00:57:04.970
Fucking I want said the Lebron James, the Cavaliers.

965
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.140
But that's really what it is. Um, I don't think we deal with that.

966
00:57:09.141 --> 00:57:11.210
I'm going to watch this game. This podcast is going to be like,

967
00:57:11.211 --> 00:57:12.710
I owe you three minutes. Okay.

968
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:15.740
I really don't because I've done a bunch that are over an hour, but um,

969
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:20.320
I gotta upload this Shit. I got an early flight cause I've got to go out and uh,

970
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:23.990
get back to my wife and daughter. That's it. Thank you guys for listening. Um,

971
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:30.100
and please tell everybody on May 30th thatF is for family is coming out and I'm

972
00:57:30.531 --> 00:57:33.650
going to be doing a bunch of press, so I apologize if you see my stupid face,

973
00:57:33.651 --> 00:57:35.810
a little bit too much out there. I have to do it.

974
00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:39.530
I got to put on the monkey sad monkey hat a little fucking,

975
00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:45.110
you know, do my little fucking dance and, uh, over the next couple of weeks,

976
00:57:45.111 --> 00:57:48.380
but I'm, you know, going to be trying to, I don't know.

977
00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:52.040
I'll be trying to let you guys know where I'm gonna be at if you give a shit.

978
00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:56.300
All right? That's it. Go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on Ya on Thursday.
