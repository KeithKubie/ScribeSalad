00:00:00.707 --> 00:00:02.705
- [Instructor] We are
asked, "What is the constant

00:00:02.705 --> 00:00:06.872
"of proportionality in the
equation 4y is equal to 8x?"

00:00:07.723 --> 00:00:11.025
Pause this video and have
a go at this question.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:12.419
All right, so we might be used

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.469
to seeing constants of proportionality

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.356
when we have equations in
a slightly different form.

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:19.449
A constant of proportionality is

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.502
what do you multiply x by to get to y?

00:00:22.502 --> 00:00:23.979
So y would be equal

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:27.562
to our constant of
proportionality times x.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.711
But this isn't written in that form,

00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:36.194
so what we do is
manipulate it a little bit

00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:38.166
so that we can see it in that form.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.857
And the obvious thing is we
just need to solve for y.

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:44.567
So right now it says 4y is equal to 8x.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:45.716
Well, if we wanna solve for y,

00:00:45.716 --> 00:00:48.572
we can just divide both sides by four,

00:00:48.572 --> 00:00:52.016
and we are left with y is
equal to eight divided by four,

00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:54.151
which is two times x.

00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:57.919
Well, now the constant of
proportionality jumps out at us.

00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:01.169
To get y, we have multiply x by two.

00:01:02.048 --> 00:01:04.811
That is our constant of proportionality.

00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:06.894
Let's do another example.

00:01:08.214 --> 00:01:11.924
Here we're asked, "Which
equation has a constant

00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:15.287
"of proportionality equal to 1/2?"

00:01:15.287 --> 00:01:17.238
Again, pause the video.

00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:19.782
Try to answer it yourself.

00:01:19.782 --> 00:01:22.498
Okay, so I'm just gonna
go equation by equation

00:01:22.498 --> 00:01:26.177
and calculate their
constants of proportionality

00:01:26.177 --> 00:01:28.458
and see which one has a constant

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:30.734
of proportionality equal to 1/2.

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:33.189
So this one right over here,
choice A clearly has a constant

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.085
of proportionality of 1/8,
so we can just rule that out.

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:39.420
Equation B right over here
clearly has a constant

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.036
of proportionality of four, not 1/2,

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:43.830
so we can rule that one out.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.770
Let's see, the constant of
proportionality for equation C,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.617
if we wanna solve for y, we
could divide both sides by six.

00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:55.784
And so we're gonna get y
is equal to 3/6 times x.

00:01:56.748 --> 00:01:59.800
Well, 3/6 is the same
thing as 1/2 times x,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.857
and so there you have it.

00:02:00.857 --> 00:02:03.574
We have a constant of
proportionality of 1/2.

00:02:03.574 --> 00:02:05.155
That's the choice I like.

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:07.329
And we can verify that
this one doesn't work.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.070
If you wanna solve for y, you
divide both sides by three,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.896
and you get y is equal to
nine divided by three is 3x,

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:19.462
so here our constant of
proportionality is three,

00:02:19.462 --> 00:02:21.893
so we can feel good about choice C.
