00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.780
We just saw how to fetch a
single document using an HTTP

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:04.910
request.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.300
These documents can be
any kind of data, really.

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.140
But on the web,
everything usually

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.300
starts with an index document.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.980
The index document
is what the server

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.380
will send back to you
if no explicit file is

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.030
to find in the request.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.420
By typing at URL in the
address bar of the browser,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.160
the user is
instructing the browser

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.920
to open a new connection
to the server identified

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.730
by the hostname in the URL and
getting the document specified

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.679
in the path of the URL.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.280
In this case, the server will
respond with the index.html,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.710
and the browser can
start parsing it.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.340
This is a really
interesting step,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.070
and the browser does
a number of things

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.901
to handle the received data.

00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:43.400
Check out the link
in the instructor

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.339
notes for an explanation
on how this works.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.470
After the browser has
parsed the response,

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.679
things start to
get a little wild.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.479
As the browser is
reading the index.html,

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.359
it will probably find references
to other documents needed

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.339
to properly display the website.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.040
These can be images, style
sheets, JavaScript files,

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.539
videos, you name it.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.079
For each of these resources,
another request is sent,

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.109
and once a response is
received by the browser,

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.200
this entire process of parsing
and potentially sending

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.420
new requests is repeated.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.390
That also means that
each of these resources

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.450
can, in turn, pull in
additional resources.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.280
Each landing page
will have its own set

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.030
of dependencies, like images,
CSS, and JavaScript files.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.400
That means that
visiting a single URL

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.530
can send off many more requests
than you might be aware of.
