00:00:00.237 --> 00:00:03.237
(provocative music)

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.830
- Hi, Bill Mobley for
The Brain Channel again,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.350
and, really happy today to be talking

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.260
about a topic that I think

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.083
bears a lot of careful consideration.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.440
It's a topic that relates
to cognitive decline

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.440
in an aging part of our population

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.400
that's not as well
featured as it should be,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.691
and that's the Latino community.

00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:35.180
At UCSD we're really making
efforts to do a great job

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.750
in understanding more
about cognitive decline

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.290
with aging in Latinos.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.980
And we're doing more than that.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.730
We're trying to prepare for a future

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.580
in which we have young investigators

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.790
who are really highly-skilled
in carrying out such studies.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.410
So I'm today with Alison Moore,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.120
who is professor of medicine

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.130
and chief of geriatrics and gerontology,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.270
Hector GonzÃ¡lez, who's associate
professor of neurosciences,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.120
a brand new faculty member

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.980
who's done terrific work in this domain,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.920
and then, Maria Marquine,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.060
who's assistant professor of psychiatry.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.930
And we'll talk with all of them.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.563
But I thought maybe I'd start with Hector.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.610
Tell us a little bit about you,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.680
about what you've been doing,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.060
and about your passion for this topic.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.060
- Well thanks, Bill.

00:01:24.914 --> 00:01:26.820
I am a neuropsychologist by training

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.690
and I've been in this
work for a long time.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.000
I actually will say that I've been

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.140
studying Latino health
and aging all of my life.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.950
It's something very
important to me personally,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.660
but also it's very
important for my family,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.070
and my loved ones and my community.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.320
So, I feel very strongly
about the topic of

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.383
health among my community.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.660
I think what you said is really important,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.520
that, here we are in California,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.160
the largest state in the Union,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.370
with a 40% population that's Latino.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.120
And, as you also said, that
we really don't know that much

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.660
about the health and
aging of this population,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.360
especially with regards to
Alzheimer's disease and research

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.823
or and other dementias.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.440
We've been very successful

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.040
with getting large studies supported

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.840
by the National Institute of Health.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.320
The problem is, though,
that we just have not

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.713
been able to attract
high-caliber scholars.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.170
You mentioned that I came early,

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.347
or recently here to San Diego
and I'm delighted to be here.

00:02:41.347 --> 00:02:42.883
And I think it's wonderful

00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:46.260
that UCTV's picking up this story,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.720
because it's such an
important topic to the state

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.520
and also to the nation.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.440
And I think things have
changed since I was here

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.010
a couple decades ago.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.450
So, with that in mind,
this is a wonderful place.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.270
It's nice to see that attention focused

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.760
on Latino Alzheimer's dementias.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.510
And, this is a fantastic place.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.740
The problem has been that we just

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.800
don't have enough scientists in the field.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.223
We have a underrepresentation
of Latino, Latina,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.790
research scientists, professors,
scholars in the field.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.350
And this is the beauty of this
project we'll talk about here

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.050
is that this is a direct mechanism

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.040
how to build up the scientific workforce

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.203
in a population that's understudied.

00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:36.810
And there's great need

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.190
to understand dementias
in this population.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.710
- Hector, let me ask a
little bit more about

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.793
the project and about your passion.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.760
My recollection is that
the percent of those people

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.450
who are involved in studies in AD

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.043
that are Latino is tiny.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.290
And so, is one of the ideas that,

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.290
if you have folks that are
trained in this domain,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.340
and specifically folks that are diverse

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.030
and specifically folks that
are Latino, that those numbers,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.000
that participation in the
community, might increase?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.833
- I hope so.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.423
This has been my passion
throughout my professional career.

00:04:25.447 --> 00:04:28.363
So I've dedicated my life to this work.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.940
And I think that that
should or would be the case

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.550
with other Latino scholars, scientists,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.010
that because of that relationship,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.470
that passion to understand and help,

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.250
which is very endemic in our population,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.920
that that kind of synergy,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.570
if we can create that kind of
synergy, that kinda workforce,

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.680
then I think we would be able to

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.820
make a big dent on that problem

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.470
of the dearth of underrepresented
minority scholars

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.833
or scholars interested in
Latino health and aging.

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:12.670
- In other words, how can we really

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.890
understand the problems they have

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.540
unless they're part of our team,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.810
essentially part of what we do,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.690
the sort of folks that
interact with us daily

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.100
to really ferret out
these research questions?

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.330
I guess that's part of it.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.160
- That's part of it and I think, too,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.340
is that it's been my experience in

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.820
that, having grown up
a minority in the U.S.,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.120
having grown up in southern California,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.900
has given me insight into what it's like

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.680
to grow up as a minority.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.200
And I think these are
some fundamental questions

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.033
that come up in the research

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.230
and that I've used in the research,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.730
to help study the problem
and look for solutions.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.220
So I think it's that built-in insight

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.550
that is really a key ingredient

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.590
and what I see as a valuable resource

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.590
in recruiting, retaining and promoting

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.670
diverse scholars in the
scientific workforce.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.810
- That's great.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.270
Alison, tell us about you,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.390
about how you got here
and about your interests.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.690
- Thank you Bill.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.030
I'm, too, grateful to be
here in this important topic.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.703
I came here not very long
before Hector, actually.

00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:29.123
I was really pleased to be,

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.800
and really thrilled to be
part of this center and

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.630
we got the idea for the center,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.220
it came out as a request for applications

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.090
in standard NIH way.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.640
And this was a version of
the center Hector and I

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.290
had both been part of in
our former institutions,

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.530
Hector at Michigan, me at UCLA.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.160
And it was a center always with the idea

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.160
that they wanted to identify and train

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.890
underrepresented minority scientists

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.503
to do work focused on minority aging.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.780
In this new version of
it, they wanted to focus

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.840
specifically on Alzheimer's
and related dementias.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.600
So when I got here, I'd had the experience

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.490
of being part of one of these centers

00:07:12.772 --> 00:07:17.180
and knew that UCSD was a super
powerhouse in neurosciences,

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.660
and I'd met a few of
the people in the ADRC.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.533
So, I thought, why not try
to write a center grant here?

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.580
So, I'd had the experience of, again,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.290
being part of the center
at my former location

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.835
and, with the support of a
lot of the people in the ADRC,

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:39.170
and Jim and Hector and being
inspired by Latino scientists

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.170
like Hector and Maria, I really
wanted to work with them,

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.460
collaborate with them,
to put this together.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.330
We also partnered with
San Diego State University

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.340
because they are a
Hispanic-serving institution

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.710
and UCSD hasn't had quite the history

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.400
of minority engagement, I'm gonna say,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.953
as has that institution.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.600
I also knew from my prior
work with Rick Morris

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.140
that would make it a stronger center.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.450
So we did that.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.090
We've partnered with
SDSU and were successful

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.780
in getting this application together.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.440
And so, we were funded
and started the center

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.513
just in the last several months.

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:22.740
It's been our first year
still figuring it out,

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.037
but it's gonna be great.

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:29.037
The idea is to train
three investigators a year

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.730
from different places.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.990
It doesn't have to be
just to SDSC or UCSD.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.380
It can be other places,
ideally in the area.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.470
And they get funded for
a year to do a project

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.730
focused on Alzheimer's
and related dementias

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.940
in minority populations.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.280
The focus of our centers,

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.063
Hector has said, is Latino dementia.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.650
We train them and the idea is really

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.826
to help them be successes
in their academic careers.

00:08:56.826 --> 00:08:59.180
They get hands-on training

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.180
and Maria can talk about that a bit more.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.940
She's experiencing it. (laughing)

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.610
But we really, again,
that's the whole point

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.630
is to create a new
generation of investigators

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.890
who can carry on this important work.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:11.920
- Terrific.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.123
What challenges do you see in
the success for this program?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.300
- Number one, I would say is pipeline.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.520
Do we have enough people

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.520
who are underrepresented
minority scientists

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.833
who can participate in this program?

00:09:25.943 --> 00:09:27.690
At my last institution,

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.000
this program had been
around for about 15 years

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.960
and that became a challenge
to find enough people who

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.260
really were honestly
underrepresented minority candidates

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.093
to be part of it.

00:09:38.093 --> 00:09:40.260
So I perceive that could be a challenge.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.240
Again, we're in our first year.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.930
We still have a pretty
new, very new thing.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:45.763
So we'll see.

00:09:45.763 --> 00:09:47.210
So that could be a challenge.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.120
I know UCSD is really working hard

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.690
to diversify its scholarly workforce.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.363
So I hope that helps us.

00:09:57.544 --> 00:09:59.950
I think that's gonna probably
be the biggest challenge,

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.260
is actually getting enough
people to participate.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.610
- My sense is that it's a more
general challenge to attract

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.943
such folks into science,
medicine and science,

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.883
and that, probably,
visibility in the community,

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.270
sort of indicating to kids
who are in grade school

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.980
or even in high school, hey
you could be a scientist

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.240
studying really an important problem.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.470
Probably it starts there.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.470
My guess is that the pipeline
gets bigger as you go younger

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.774
to try to bring people
along to feel that they,

00:10:37.774 --> 00:10:41.987
yeah, they too, could be just
like you when they grow up.

00:10:41.987 --> 00:10:43.410
(Alison chuckling)
Right?

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.600
Good.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.600
And here is Maria, who is
beginning this process.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.350
Tell us a little bit about
you and your background,

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.630
but also what kinds of
things you wanna do now

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.350
under this program, Maria.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.330
- Let me see where to start.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.540
I came to the U.S., or I moved to the U.S.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.236
about 20 years ago now.

00:11:02.236 --> 00:11:06.910
And I also trained as a
clinical neuropsychologist.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.410
I first went the clinical route.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.590
So I was first primarily a clinician

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.193
and seeing patients in clinic.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.280
Being that I'm from Uruguay
originally, I'm bilingual.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.238
I speak Spanish and English
fluently, hopefully.

00:11:22.238 --> 00:11:23.328
(all laughing)
Sometimes I think

00:11:23.328 --> 00:11:25.343
I don't speak either one well.

00:11:25.343 --> 00:11:27.123
But, I try my best.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.630
Working as a clinician,

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.940
was that I really started to understand

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.573
the need for science in our community.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.090
I experienced it firsthand,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.760
seeing patients come through
the door and I was trying to do

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.210
clinical neuropsychological
evaluations and diagnosis,

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.940
and it was very hard to do

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.060
because we didn't have
the tools to do that.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.300
We were forced to use, not forced,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.040
because there were no available norms for,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.310
especially for Spanish speakers

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.540
or English-speaking Hispanics,

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.640
which made it really hard
to make these diagnoses.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.530
I had a number of people
come through my door,

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.060
that they had been diagnosed
with dementia 10 years prior

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.850
because the appropriate
norms had not been used.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.380
And I evaluate them and I'm
like, you're doing pretty well.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.130
It's just that a person
would come through my door

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.410
that had no education

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.510
and they were comparing the performance

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.130
with somebody with a
high school education.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.810
And so, that opened my eyes
to how big of a need there was

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.530
in the community in
create these instruments

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.510
and in understand Latino cognition broadly

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.150
and in aging, particularly.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.610
When I was doing clinical work,

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.660
I was at Rush University Medical Center

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.870
and I started collaborating in research

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.870
with the Rush Alzheimer's Center there.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:49.650
And that's really what
made me want to move

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.960
to the research realm.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.280
So, we then moved to
San Diego with my family

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.370
and I joined UCSD about six years ago.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.430
And I saw the opportunity
to make the switch

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.520
to do science and do research,

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.790
and not only be at the
forefront of clinical care,

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:11.190
but creating the knowledge
that would help clinicians

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.850
and would help healthcare providers.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.550
So, that's how I got into the field

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.970
of neuropsychology research

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.600
and Latino cognition in general and aging.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.600
When I got here, I joined a fellowship

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.530
at the HIV Neurobehavioral
Research Program,

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:26.980
the Department of Psychiatry,

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.160
to do research in aging Latinos and HIV.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.403
So that's much of what
I've done until now.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.970
With the aging HIV population,

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.330
there's been an increased
interest in Alzheimer's disease

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.290
from that realm.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.180
And I had my earlier experience
in Alzheimer's disease

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.307
when I was trying to do both the clinical

00:13:48.307 --> 00:13:49.500
and the research work.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.070
So that's kind of my background
and how I got where I am.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:58.070
What really drives me to this
type of research is, again,

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.470
the understanding that it's very needed.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.613
Personal as well.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.070
I think most people have
been touched by Alzheimer's

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:10.970
one way or another and so,
that became very personal to me

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.340
when some family members were diagnosed.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:18.340
And I wanna be part of
trying to find the answers.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:23.940
In my research here at UCSD,
what I've been finding is that

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.240
the way that, sometimes, we try to

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.170
tackle and try to understand
what Alzheimer's disease is,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.700
or what predicts Alzheimer's disease

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.090
or problems with cognition,
is not always the right one

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.460
because it's being looked at from one lens

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.520
of a specific ethnic or racial group,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.740
and looking at factors that
might be predictive of problems,

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.470
looking it through this one lens.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.550
But there's many different
ways to see the world,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.420
and I think when you can see
it through the Latino lens,

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.570
is then you can start seeing
what might be important things

00:15:02.082 --> 00:15:04.650
in that area and how can we
look at things differently

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:09.370
so that we can find answers
that help that population,

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.230
the Latino population,
but everybody as well.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.480
- So you discovered a gap.
- Mm-hmm.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.070
- So you were doing clinical
work and you discovered,

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.280
my goodness, people are coming to me

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.090
who've had a diagnosis of dementia

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.840
and they don't have dementia.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.770
And, there was a gap there in being able

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.370
to actually deliver a tool, a test,

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.610
that could accurately say,
do they have dementia or not.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.240
So, you saw that gap and then

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.580
you, basically, are
trying to fill that gap.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.230
And there are actually
two gaps, aren't there?

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.490
One is the lack of
tools and understanding.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.780
But the second is the gap between

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.700
wanting to do research and
knowing how to do research.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.300
Because just because you're a clinician

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.060
doesn't mean you know how to do research.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.990
So this program then helps
with both gaps, does it not?

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.850
- Absolutely, absolutely it does, it does.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.640
I think the program is
providing an infrastructure

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.270
that I hadn't found before.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.640
I think the didactics that
Alison was referring to earlier

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.043
have been fantastic.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.810
I don't think there's
anything like it here at UCSD.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:16.987
I've been searching for it

00:16:16.987 --> 00:16:21.800
and there's nothing focused on that area.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.620
And so I think that's been great.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.240
I think the mentorship has been fantastic.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.360
I think what really is the
best thing of all, though,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.880
of having a center like this,

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.740
is kind of the, how do I put it,

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.100
like the feeling that like
somebody cares, you know?

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.660
Somebody thinks this is important.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.070
- Yeah.
- Somebody thinks

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.360
this needs to be done.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.910
And that's not always found.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.210
I think, as I'm sure
Hector had this before,

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.670
had this experience before,

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.393
is that, coming from a
different background,

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.810
it sometimes can be a
little bit alienating

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.990
or a little bit kind of
like, how do I fit in?

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:07.330
And having that infrastructure,
I think gives that.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.640
- Having people who understand,

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.060
not just that there's a problem, but that

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.550
it takes a sensitivity to this culture

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.220
to understand that problem fully.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.350
- Mm-hmm, you put it beautifully, Bill.

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.183
- Oh no, thanks.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.270
But it's just true for all
of us, isn't it really?

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.870
To me, it's not so much a,

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:28.040
We all have a culture.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.370
There's always, for all
of us, there's a context

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.170
in which we've grown up
and live our lives and

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.100
it always feels a little bit frightening

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.810
when you go to a different context

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.830
and people don't quite
understand what you're saying and

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.940
you kinda look for friends.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.460
You kinda look for people who kinda

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.970
know what you're saying when you say it.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.210
And so, the fact that UCSD
can give that a happy home

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.270
is really a compliment to you guys

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.970
and to you as a beginner,

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.730
but to people who have been around,

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.540
understand the problems and are

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.040
making this a better
place for people to learn.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:09.040
So Alison, here's Maria and
she's this great new learner

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.680
and so, how do we help
her at the next stage?

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.150
What comes next for people like Maria

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.650
who now wanna build their career?

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.820
Not just train, but build their career.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.870
- We'll hook them up with
people like Hector (laughing)

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.000
who has a lot of grants and a lot of data

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.370
for her and others like Maria
to use and build their careers

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.800
with the papers and
write ancillary studies

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.200
and also mentorship to build careers

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:44.413
in different paths,
perhaps, different topics.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.340
Mentorship is super
important in my experience.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.840
So, you take great people,
you give them great training.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.410
You have to have mentorship, I
think, every step of the way.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:00.410
I still get mentorship from
many people in different topics.

00:19:03.198 --> 00:19:05.260
So, you help them.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.430
You support people

00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:11.340
and that can make the difference I think.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.670
- I think the mentoring
thing is really critical.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.440
I mean, I agree with you.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.900
I've had several really
terrific mentors and

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.720
I make the comment, you should
never let a good mentor go.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.943
Stay in touch with them.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.170
Call them, write them
and send them an email.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.003
Get their input.

00:19:28.003 --> 00:19:30.060
Because, the more they know about you,

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.290
the more they really can
sort of give you some advice

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.130
about your career direction.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.270
So you're a mentor.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.103
- Yes.
- And you'll

00:19:37.103 --> 00:19:37.936
continue to mentor.
- One of my favorite

00:19:37.936 --> 00:19:40.510
things to be and to do.
- Yeah, yeah that's great.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.360
Hector, what about you
and your role in this

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.910
and what you'd like to see happen

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.643
here at UCSD more generally?

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.380
- Maria hit it on the head is that

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.670
that sense of community is here

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:52.960
and just to build it further.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.140
I mean, it's a small community.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.980
I'm fortunate to be also

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.300
at the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's
Disease Research Center

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.050
where we do have a strong focus

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.830
on Latino Alzheimer's disease.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:11.803
And we have the support of
our good chair, Jim Brewer.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.210
And feeling that you're welcomed here,

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.680
you're valued here and part of a community

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.943
is something we need to build further.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.220
It's good now, but we
could make it better.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.790
So that's, I think, the value
of this training program is,

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.490
it doesn't exist, so let's just build it.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.300
There's no way we can just wait around

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.780
and it'll just come to us.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.780
So, I think this is a great opportunity

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.120
to be able to build that community

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.610
and a strong community
too, because we have

00:20:51.015 --> 00:20:53.360
such great science here at UCSD

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.250
and we really need to
take it to the next level,

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.610
and I think this is a
fantastic place to do it.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.710
- So, Maria, look ahead 20 years,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.130
and see yourself in the
context of the folks

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.560
that you'll be working with.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.000
How will the world be different
for Latinos who are aging

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.120
as a result of the kind of
work that's being done here?

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.580
This is a dream of course.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.030
This is a best case.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.410
- I think best case scenario is,

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.090
there'll be very little of it.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.550
So very few people with Alzheimer's.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.830
We'll find a way that we
can prevent it or treat it.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.670
If you ask me, that's my ideal--

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.503
- Good.
- world, where we can

00:21:34.503 --> 00:21:38.640
find a way that it's
hardly happening anymore.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.490
I think that's gonna be very tough.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:45.193
So, if we, that cure
that has not been found,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.480
I hope that we built enough
knowledge, enough understanding

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:56.580
to support not only the person
with Alzheimer's disease

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.513
that's Latino, but the families.

00:22:01.972 --> 00:22:03.022
We always talk about,

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.130
Alzheimer's just doesn't touch one person,

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.780
it touches the family, especially
in the Latino community.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.920
So I think I would like to see

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.230
that we have knowledge,
understanding and resources

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.350
to support those communities.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.090
I think, sometimes, it's overseen

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.520
how much practical help is needed.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.230
I think the knowledge is number one,

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.260
but practical help, resources,

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.360
in a community that might
have less resources,

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:39.360
less access to care, less
opportunity to buy into care,

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.720
that we can provide that for
everyone that might need it.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.510
- And it's a great dream.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.720
Of course everybody in the world

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.173
wants the dream of no
Alzheimer's to be true.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.060
But I think it's especially
important that you guys

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.810
are doing the kind of work that makes sure

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:00.810
that Latinos benefit to the
same extent as non-Latinos

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.920
in those advances that will come,

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.650
and that, one day, we'll
all be able to say,

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.090
wow, Alzheimer's disease?

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.610
Yes, I remember that.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.723
It used to be a problem, but
not anymore for any of us.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.460
Thank you all for being here,
Alison and Hector and Maria.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.780
Appreciate your being here and
the great work you're doing.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.911
