00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.940
I'd like to introduce you guys to some,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.077
it's an online coding, actually,
framework sort of thing.

00:00:08.077 --> 00:00:10.840
This is JSFiddle.net.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.740
Your Knockout documentation actually
encourages using JSFiddle and

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.270
just play with all the Knockout
functionality, right?

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.540
Just to get used to it.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.800
So you don't have to start coding your
project right away using Knockout when

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.650
you are not too familiar with it.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.460
So I understand that you need to get
comfortable with the framework before

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.060
you go ahead.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.710
One of a very basic example that was
given in the Knockout framework,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.890
I just personalized it and
saw how I could play around with it.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.780
So let me show you, so the first block
that is right here on my left hand side,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.060
is the view,
which is your HTML elements.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.570
As you can see I have a div that has
two paragraphs and a header element.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.305
And then I have my JS code,

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:05.635
JavaScript code right below
that that defines a view model.

00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:10.049
And I have a CSS which is on
the right hand side of my screen.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.316
That is just giving a set of
formatting styles for my page.

00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:19.319
And whatever you see on the right bottom

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.236
is the result that you get
out of coding all of this.

00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:29.510
So as you can see i have declared a
paragraph element that has a first name.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.650
And another paragraph element
that has the time of the day.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.498
And what I've done is,
I've just added a text box input.

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:40.238
So I did input data bind.

00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:45.180
Data bind is the variable
that performs data binding

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.572
with your JavaScript,
with your view model.

00:01:49.572 --> 00:01:55.006
Whenever you want to access this
property, you can access using.

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:57.142
&gt;&gt; So basically binding these up again.

00:01:57.142 --> 00:01:58.164
&gt;&gt; These bindings, exactly.

00:01:58.164 --> 00:02:03.133
You are actually giving my first
name an id called first name.

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:07.173
So here as you can see I've
given value colon first name.

00:02:07.173 --> 00:02:10.139
So this can be taught as an id for this.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.855
And now if you go and see my view model,
my view model is just a class.

00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:19.655
And I'm passing my first name and
time of the day into that.

00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:24.185
And what I do is I create
properties inside my view model so

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.950
which is called this.FirstName.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.050
Which is accessing the firstName
from the paragraph element.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.140
And it says equals =
KO.observable of first.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.465
So whatever I pass into
the first variable goes into my

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:45.800
this.firstName which automatically
gets updated in the paragraph element.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.690
And there is another one,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.520
which is this.time which actually
binds it to time of the day.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.668
And it says, track observe
the time of the day input and

00:02:58.668 --> 00:03:02.180
assign the value that is
passed inside this class.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.600
And here,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.660
the next line is very interesting
because it's called ko.computed.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.370
So computed is another property that
is very similar to the observables, but

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.930
what it does is it essentially computes
the values of other observables.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.810
And it gives you a result.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.790
So as you can see, you have two
observables: time and the first name.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.560
What I am doing in greeting is,
I am adding the time and

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.390
a comma and the first name and then
giving this to the greeting element.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.200
So this dom element,
as you can see, is a header too.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.470
And it has the word good in it already.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.320
And then you have a span element,
that has the greeting that goes inside,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.930
followed by an exclamation.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.980
And once I finish coding
the ViewModel class,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.980
there is a line of code that says,
ko.applyBindings of new ViewModel.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.415
So applyBindings is
very important because

00:04:10.415 --> 00:04:15.005
this is the line that
actually makes Knockout work.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:20.160
So if you do not have this line,
your application might not run.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.175
A lot of times students
actually miss this part.

00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:29.179
So ensure that you do have
the the applied bindings,

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:34.463
which is essentially creating
an instance of your ViewModel class.

00:04:34.463 --> 00:04:36.510
And it's passing in information.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.800
Here Iâ€™m just passing Poonima and
Morning to it.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.620
So when I run this, what you can see is,
it's as good morning Poonima.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.440
So it gives me a whole
new message right here.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.420
So here as you can see I'm going to
change the first name to Gauril and,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.530
see it's evening here.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.570
And then it changes
the message from your view,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.250
which is whatever the user sees.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.320
So that actually changes
depending on that.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.510
I can probably give another
one here as well and try out.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.920
I'm going to say Good Night, Gauril.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.420
And probably run this application again,
it's going to give Good Night Gauril.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.010
So as you can see, you can update
the data from the JavaScript

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.920
as well as the user point of view and
this is going to change.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.690
This is one of Knockout's
very important functionality.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.248
So as you can see,
you can actually create any observable

00:05:44.248 --> 00:05:49.680
data and
then you can updated on your user view.
