CHRISTA ESSIG: Hi, everybody.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.090
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.780
We're really excited
about the panel

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.080
we have in celebration
of "Go Beyond the Grain."

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.010
So what is "Go
Beyond the Grain?"

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.770
And just a little bit of
background-- the Google food

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.830
team does a campaign every
year on whole grains.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.020
And this year, in celebration
of the Year of the Pulse,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.610
we've included pulses.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.610
So we're going
beyond just grains.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.290
And we want to talk about how
good grains and pulses are,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.950
not only for your
body and health

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.550
but also for the
environment, and also how

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.940
they can be really delicious.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.510
So this panel is a
perfect representation

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.000
of tying that all together.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.990
And with us today, we have Minh
Tsai from Hodo Soy Beanery.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.800
This is Minh.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.940
And he will talk about the
culinary side and how delicious

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.380
soy and pulses can be.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.550
And then we have Liz Carlisle,
author of "Lentil Underground."

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.560
She'll talk a lot about
the history of and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.670
including into food systems
in general, and sustainable

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.250
agriculture, and how
pulses and lentils really

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.890
are a big supporter of
sustainable agriculture

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.800
and in support of a
healthy ecosystem.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.170
And then Larry Kushi is a
nutritional epidemiologists

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.670
with Kaiser Permanente
and is here--

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.760
will talk a little bit
about the health benefits.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.340
So without further delay,
I'm going to pass it

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.360
on to our panel leader, Liz.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.300
And thanks everybody
for joining us.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.132
And thanks so much to our
speakers for being here.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.840
LIZ CARLISLE: Thank
you so much, Christa.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.430
And thanks for all of you
taking your time here,

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.800
present with us in the
room and then remotely,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.560
to talk about the
wonders of pulses.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.630
So probably we should start
with a really basic issue, which

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.760
is what is a pulse, right?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.740
We're not talking about this.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.310
We're talking about a food.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.220
So here in the group
assembled here,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.126
who can tell me what a pulse is?

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.789
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.120
This is why you came, right?

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.610
This isn't a word we
use very much in the US.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.580
This is more of a European term.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.270
But it means the edible
seed of a legume.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.720
Now that begs the
question, what is a legume?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.600
So these are plants in
the bean and pea family.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.130
And they share a
really important

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.310
botanical characteristic that
actually makes a big difference

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.679
for sustainability
and for health.

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.470
But the reason we're
talking about it today

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.600
and the reason we're using this
somewhat unfamiliar term pulse

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.350
is because, as
Christa said, the UN

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.650
has declared 2016 the
International Year of Pulses.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.920
Why does the United
Nations care about pulses?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.500
And why do they want
people to be aware of them?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.450
Two main reasons--
one of them has

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.560
to do with environmental
sustainability.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.450
And one of them has to
do with human health.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.850
So first on environmental
sustainability--

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.594
and here I'm going to show
you for a minute this slide.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.250
All right, so here
we have this graph

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.020
from the Environmental
Working Group

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.490
showing the carbon footprint
of various common foods

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.220
in the American diet.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.620
So why do we see
these pulse crops

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.920
near the bottom of this graph?

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.760
So you see very low
carbon footprint

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.130
associated with things like
lentils, tofu, dry beans.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.420
All of these are pulse crops.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.930
All of these are legumes.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.400
Well, let's start with something
that's a little bit more

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.040
common in terms of
the way we think

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.390
about environmental
health and what we eat.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.010
So anybody here
trying to eat locally

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.740
for environmental reasons?

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.310
Yeah.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.643
So lots of different reasons
you might eat locally-- you

00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:43.270
might want to support
local farmers.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.110
You might want to support
wonderful local businesses.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.130
You might want to get
to know your farmer.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.230
It might be about
relational eating.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.070
But we also have this notion
of the carbon footprint

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.280
of our food having something
to do with food miles,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.920
how far it's traveled.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.860
So a group of researchers
looked into this.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.440
And they found that actually
only about 4% of the greenhouse

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.750
gas emissions associated with
the average American diet come

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.230
from transport to
final point of sale.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.470
That's the metric that we know
as food miles-- only about 4%.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.550
In contrast, 83% of
emissions happen before food

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.399
leaves the farm gate.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.170
Much of these emissions
are associated

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.600
with livestock production and
then also nitrogen fertilizer.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.215
So why nitrogen fertilizer?

00:04:30.215 --> 00:04:32.210
Well, it takes a
lot of fossil fuel

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.270
to make synthetic
nitrogen fertilizer.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.740
And so the question is, is there
an alternative to livestock

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.060
production and using
all this fertilizer?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.522
And the answer is yes.

00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:44.230
And that's what we've
been doing for most

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.790
of agricultural history.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.960
We've only had this
synthetic fertilizer

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.870
since the early 20th century.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.510
Farmers have only
been using that since

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.450
about the mid 20th century.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.710
And what people did before
that is they had these plants,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.920
these leguminous plants,
that could pull nitrogen out

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.540
of the atmosphere, where
it's extremely abundant,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.870
and then work with
bacteria in the soil

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.310
to convert that nitrogen
into a plant available form,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.680
into fertilizer,
and not only use it

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.370
for their own fertility-- we'll
come back here for a moment

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.050
to the graph, yes, but also for
the fertility of the following

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.860
crop.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.390
So they would leave
this nitrogen fertilizer

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.740
in the ground so that
the following crop

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.380
would have access to it.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.450
So this was an alternative
to chemical fertilizer.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.790
And it's been accessible
to farmers for all

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.470
of agricultural history.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.700
So this is a way to
get out of the carbon

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.930
footprint of the livestock
system, the carbon footprint

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.300
of nitrogen fertilizer.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.770
So it means that legume crops
and legume based pastures,

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.310
so pulses and their
pasture crop friends,

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.610
use the 35% to 60%
less fossil energy

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.470
than chemically
fertilized grains.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.410
So to go back to
the graph, that is

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.860
why the carbon footprint of
these pulses, of these legumes,

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.180
is so low and why they're
so important for sustainable

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.120
agriculture.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.816
And that's just one of the
many environmental reasons.

00:06:05.816 --> 00:06:07.690
They're putting fertility
back in the ground.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.400
They're helping
build soil health.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.820
They're absolutely
critical to a food

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.930
system that's sustainable
in environmental terms.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.620
They're also critical
to human health

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.460
and to a food system in
which all people have access

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.230
to sufficient, healthy,
culturally appropriate food.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.133
So I'm going to move
to the next slide here.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.670
I work with lentil farmers.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.330
Why am I so excited
about lentils?

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.460
Well, I come from Montana.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.570
Grain agriculture has been
the norm there for some time.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.430
And for all the reasons we just
talked about environmentally,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.080
lentils are the key to
making that grain agriculture

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.780
system sustainable.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.390
And that's just one
legume in one place.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.540
So this is true of other
legumes in other places.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.780
The genius of this relationship
between grains and legumes

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.320
is not just about the
nutrition of the soil

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.560
or about environmental
health, but also

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.329
very much about human health.

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:03.370
So you're going to hear
some great examples later

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.670
from Larry.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.170
But I want to talk
just a little bit

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.544
about lentils and some things
that I have learned since I

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:10.430
started working on them.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.490
So you probably know
that these crops

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.470
are really high in protein.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.690
You might know about fiber.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.000
So lentils offer
more than a third

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.490
of the recommended intake of
fiber in a half cup portion.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.140
But these pulse crops are also
really high in micronutrients.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.370
So a half cup serving
of lentils provides

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.170
45% of recommended
daily folate, which

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.090
is necessary for the production
of red blood cells and protein

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.114
metabolism.

00:07:36.114 --> 00:07:38.030
You've probably heard
it's important for women

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.090
of childbearing age
because of its role

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.950
in the developing embryo.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.620
Also a cup of
lentils has potassium

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.390
comparable to a
banana-- potassium

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.610
important for electrolyte
and fluid balance

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.400
as well as muscle
and cardiac function.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.200
And this one was probably
the most surprising to me--

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.800
antioxidants.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.550
So I would normally
think of something

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.880
like blueberries or acai.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.740
But it turns out
that lentils actually

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.480
have 56% more antioxidant
capacity than blueberries.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.980
So these are these
nutrition-packed foods

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.850
that have been really
important staples

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.090
for working people for all
of agricultural history

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.330
more or less.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.240
And then the other
thing-- so we talked

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.540
about environmental health.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.880
We talked about human
health and public health.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.190
But they're also totally
delicious, right?

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.230
These crops that have
been used for all

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.440
of agricultural history.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.789
So they have 10,000, some
archeologists 18,000 years,

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.320
of culinary traditions
associated with them

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.460
from all over the world.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.140
So on that note, I want to
transition to our next speaker.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.920
And I want to tell you a
little bit about his story too.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.620
So we're going to hear
now from Minh Tsai, who's

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.400
the founder, director,
CEO of Hodo Soy.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.910
And Minh, as a child
in Vietnam, often

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.920
took morning strolls
with his grandpa

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.450
to the neighborhood tofu shack.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.340
The freshness and
artisanal quality

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.480
of the soy milk, tofu,
and yuba of his childhood

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.130
eluded Minh for many
years when he came here

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.600
to the United States.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.090
But finally in 2004,
he founded Hodo Soy

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.370
with the simple mission
of crafting the highest

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.750
quality, best tasting, freshest
soy milk, tofu, and yubs--

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.230
tofu skins-- possible.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.500
These days, Minh remains
actively involved

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.790
in the production and innovation
of tofu as well as being

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.440
tofu's ultimately ambassador
by working with the chefs,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.650
teaching tofu craft
and educating,

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.120
culinary students to
grow the next generation

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.410
of tofu officionados.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.140
Before becoming
Hodo's tofu master,

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.370
Minh spent 10 years in strategic
consulting and finance.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.340
And he graduated from
Columbia with a BA and masters

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.660
in economic development.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.020
Minh--

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.590
MINH TSAI: Thanks, Liz.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.330
I haven't had that formal
introduction for a long time.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.226
It sounded kind of funny.

00:09:55.226 --> 00:09:58.760
Because these days,
I'm a tofu maker.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.710
My name is Minh Tsai.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.430
If you don't know me, it's OK.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.670
Because you're eating
my tofu at Google.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.832
In fact, our tofu is in all
your campuses in the West coast

00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:10.290
as well as in the East Coast
and other parts of the country

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.850
as well.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.560
The reason I really
enjoy these types

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.260
of forum with Liz
and Larry, who's

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.190
going to come on later and
talk about health-- so I get

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.410
to talk about the food part.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.710
Because usually when I give
a talk by myself, you know,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.055
I'm somewhat of a hack when
it comes to all the data

00:10:30.055 --> 00:10:32.820
that Liz talks about and a
hack in all the health part

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.000
that Larry talks about.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.580
So now I have all the support.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.060
Before I start, I'm going
to play you a video.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.520
It's called "Tofu Disrupt."

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.200
It's an event that
we've done recently.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.000
And I'll play the
video, and then I'll

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.030
come back to it to talk
about how we get people

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.980
to eat more pulses, more beans.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.600
But essentially, the
video is a series

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.720
of event called Tofu Disrupt.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.590
And the idea behind it is
to really educate people

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.860
about beans and in this
case, tofu in particular.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:11.080
Tofu has a really short history
in America, less than 50 years,

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.270
relative to its
history in Asia, which

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.320
is several thousand years.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:21.600
So in our education, we
basically want people not just

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.170
to understand the history of
where tofu comes from, but also

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:30.840
how we in the US use tofu
and how the use of tofu

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.940
really change our perception
and taste of tofu.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.857
So I assume many
of you eat tofu.

00:11:38.857 --> 00:11:40.190
That's why you're at this event.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.670
And you eat beans.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.190
But tofu wasn't really
consumed very much

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:51.200
here by the American
public until the late 70s.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.340
And the reason for
that is because tofu

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.250
was introduced here by the
Japanese and the Chinese

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.980
more than 100 years ago.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.510
But it remains in the
enclave, you know,

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.580
in the Chinatown
and the Japan Town.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.560
The reason for that is
because there was very little

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.020
interaction, like, American--
the public doesn't really

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.880
go into Chinatown
grocery store to shop.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.940
That's one reason.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.020
But the second reason is tofu
is one of these food that's

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.462
not really packaged.

00:12:23.462 --> 00:12:25.170
You know, we're so
used to packaged food.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:25.230
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.970
-Wrap the bean curd
like prize cheese.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.670
So for me, I wanted
tofu to be a canvas

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.770
for really innovative chefs.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.476
And that's why we
have these events.

00:12:38.476 --> 00:12:39.101
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:40.544
My name is Minh Tsai.

00:12:40.544 --> 00:12:42.468
And I'm a tofu maker.

00:12:42.468 --> 00:12:44.392
Growing up in Vietnam,
my grandfather

00:12:44.392 --> 00:12:48.750
would take me to the tofu shack
where we bought freshly made,

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.010
delicious tofu every day.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.510
The memory of that
tofu was my inspiration

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.510
for starting Hodo
Soy 10 years ago.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:01.286
At Hodo, we treat tofu making
as both an art and a science.

00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:05.160
Our focus is on making the
highest quality tofu possible.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.825
So we start with
the best organic,

00:13:06.825 --> 00:13:09.570
US grown soybeans we can find.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.000
We select beans with a specific
protein and fat content

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.996
to produce what we believe
is the ideal mouth-feel

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:18.658
and flavor.

00:13:18.658 --> 00:13:21.460
We soak the soybeans
overnight and then grind

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.340
and cook them to extract
the rich soy milk.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.470
To this, we add a traditional
mineral coagulant.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:32.540
Then we hand wrap the bean
curd like prize cheese

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.730
and press it into a variety
of textures, soft and firm.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:42.700
The result is tofu that's
creamy, nutty, and rich.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.900
But making delicious
tofu and yuba

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.320
is only one part of what we do.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.385
At Hodo, we're also
educators and ambassadors

00:13:50.385 --> 00:13:52.320
of all things tofu.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.570
We want to disrupt
the pervasive idea

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.480
that tofu is just an ingredient
in Asian food or a bland meat

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.460
substitute.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.165
So I started a series of
events called Tofu Disrut.

00:14:04.165 --> 00:14:05.840
Well, welcome to Hodo.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.430
We're going to do a quick tour.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.840
Come on in.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.600
My mission is to take
chefs on a deeper dive

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.850
into the art and
science of tofu--

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.520
So anybody want to make tofu?

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.350
--to show them
the transformation

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.510
from beans to liquid,
from liquid to solid,

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.270
and how this process influences
tofu's various textures

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.080
and flavors.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.496
And then press it down.

00:14:28.496 --> 00:14:30.830
-[INAUDIBLE] the box does that.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.340
-This is where the
muscle comes in, guys.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.940
Take this off.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.970
There you go.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.770
-I want to reveal the
true versatility of tofu

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.910
as a canvas on which to
create a supporting a player

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.090
or a delicious star ingredient.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.090
-All right.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.890
-Tofu Disrupt is meant to
inspire the chefs to create

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.470
entirely new dishes
that highlight

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.540
tofu's wide range of flavors
and textural profiles.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.970
-So I chose to do this dish
and use the okara, which

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.820
is normally, as
Minh told us today,

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.254
given to farms for animals.

00:15:05.254 --> 00:15:07.170
So we started trying to
make porridge with it.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.670
And then we started smoking it
and adding onions and garlic,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.790
and I feel came up with a pretty
tasty product with something

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:13.930
that is normally discarded.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.460
-I'm Moroccan in heritage.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.750
So I kind of went a
North African route.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.810
And I fell in love with the
nama yuba was just like mind

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:21.310
blowing.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.300
The other day I tasted it.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.300
And I was like, wow, this
is an amazing product.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.820
-I did a parsnip
cooked in soy milk.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.270
I'm serving with a parsnip cake.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.530
-I wanted to use the firm
tofu and incorporate it

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.850
in a very traditional Filipino
dish, which is pork adobo.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.460
-I wanted to think
of a dish that

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.890
would mimic the textures of
burrata, so some fresh soy

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.780
milk, coagulating it.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.660
That's all going to be
encased in a sheet of yuba.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:53.430
-My goal is to redefine tofu as
a complex, cuisine-transcending

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.830
ingredient.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.770
To do that, I want to
reacquaint chefs with tofu that

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:02.090
is deeply traditional, expertly
crafted, and a foundation

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.770
for culinary innovation.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:08.950
At Hodo, we believe the
possibilities for tofu

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.014
are endless.

00:16:10.014 --> 00:16:12.747
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:20.232 --> 00:16:21.240
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.656
MINH TSAI: What
do you guys think?

00:16:22.656 --> 00:16:24.610
That looked pretty good, right?

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:25.870
We just did one in New York.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.030
I just came back.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.000
And it was a bigger
event than the one

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.690
we did in San Francisco.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.550
But the reason we did
these Tofu Disrupt events,

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.350
it's really to not
just educate the public

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.250
but also to educate chefs.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.830
You know, I was
talking earlier about

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:46.400
how tofu was introduced here
less than 50 years ago even

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.350
though it was already
in the Chinese

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:52.850
and the Japanese enclaves
50 years before that.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.180
When tofu was
introduced to the US,

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.390
it was very much
introduced as a vegetarian

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:03.420
food, a food that would save our
planet from over-consumption.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.540
And I believe in that.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.270
I believe tofu can be a
great vegetarian food that

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.569
will save our planet, not just
from an ecological standpoint,

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.460
but also from the
health standpoint.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.359
But for me, the fact that it
was so-- it was introduced

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.410
so narrowly as a vegetarian
food and more importantly,

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.960
as a meat substitute, was really
a wrong introduction, you know?

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.575
Because the people who
introduced tofu to America

00:17:28.575 --> 00:17:30.350
as a meat substitute
really didn't

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:34.960
understand the chemistry and
the culinary aspect of tofu.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.280
So for about 40, 50
years, we Americans

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.350
end up eating tofu that's
firm or extra firm.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.270
And, you know, it's not
very tasty that way.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.170
And then we also never
invested the time

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:52.510
to educate the chefs
on how to use the tofu.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.310
So instead of growing,
tofu basically

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.720
remained more or less
just this mystery food

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.310
that's not very tasty.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.440
I mean, I'm sure some of you may
have had it from your parents,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.407
from your grandparents.

00:18:03.407 --> 00:18:04.990
And you probably
thought, I'm probably

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.580
never going to eat this again.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.850
So our goal at Hodo
for the last 10 years

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.090
is, yes, we want to
tell you that tofu

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.560
is really healthy and very
different from soy protein

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.000
isolate and all the
mock meat out there.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.540
But we also want to
tell you that put

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.230
in the right hand, our
hands, or a chef's hand,

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:31.222
and in some cases in your hands
now, tofu can be delicious.

00:18:31.222 --> 00:18:33.980
You know, people will
eat it if it's delicious.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.650
So our mission is to
craft a high quality

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.560
ingredient for chefs to
make it more delicious.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.340
But we also have
a line of products

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.220
that you can find in the
grocery stores that are selling

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.363
like hotcakes, you know?

00:18:46.363 --> 00:18:49.620
We just recently
launched a Mapo tofu.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:55.110
And Mapo tofu is the third
most popular Chinese dish

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.060
in any restaurant.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.000
And we just launched
one just last week.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.560
And it's really out-selling
everything else.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.900
Why?

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.970
It's because it tastes good.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.620
It's because the
ingredient is good.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.870
LIZ CARLISLE: Well, thank you.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.790
I think Minh has convinced you
that you want to eat pulses.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.410
You definitely want to eat tofu.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.950
And I think Larry
will convince you

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.450
that you not only want to do
this because it's delicious,

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.010
but you're doing
yourself a favor as well.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:26.350
So Lawrence H Kushi is
director of scientific policy

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.740
at the Kaiser Permanente
Northern California

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.420
division of research.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.790
Prior to joining the
division of research,

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.200
Dr. Kushi was at
Columbia University

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.690
where he held the Ella
McCollum Vahlteich

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.970
chair in human nutrition
in the Department

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.100
of Health and Behavior
Studies, Teachers College.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.820
And he was a member of the
Herbert Irving Comprehensive

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.950
Cancer Center at Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.150
Dr. Kushi is internationally
recognized for his expertise

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.590
in nutritional epidemiology.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.510
And his research interests
focus on the role

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.920
of diet and nutrition
in the etiology

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.370
of coronary artery disease
and breast and other cancers.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.680
He serves on a grant review
committee for the American

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.830
Cancer Society and has served on
various American Cancer Society

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.380
committees to develop guidelines
for the dietary prevention

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.530
and management of cancer.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.040
Dr. Kushi has also served
on review committees

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.570
for the Epidemiology and
Disease Control study

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.200
section of the
National Institutes

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.370
of Health and the integration
panel of the breast cancer

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.950
research program of the US Army
Medical Research and Materiel

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.446
Command.

00:20:31.446 --> 00:20:33.570
He was formerly the chair
of the food and nutrition

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.420
section of the American
Public Health Association

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.490
and on the executive
committee of the American

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.940
Society of Preventive Oncology.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.780
So trust this guy when it
comes to your long-term health.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.500
Larry Kushi--

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.140
LAWRENCE KUSHI:
OK, thank you, Liz.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.460
That was more than I expected.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:56.810
So in any case, thank you,
Krista, the farm-to-table--

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.230
is that what the program is
called-- for the invitation

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.350
of-- I've got some slides.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.680
Being an academic sort
of leaning person,

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.460
I sort of lean on these
slides presentation.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.330
But don't take that as being any
more formal than anything else.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.160
So why don't we show these?

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.850
And then we'll switch back
to showing the panel, OK?

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.010
So what's up with protein foods?

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.030
OK, I'm going to
zip through these

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.520
and not necessarily
spend a lot of time

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.860
on any particular thing.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.630
Start off with a little bit
of a disclaimer-- whatever

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.590
I say here is not--
doesn't represent

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.480
the views of Kaiser Permanente
in any official capacity.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.610
It's just me, OK?

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:50.730
So every five years,
the US government,

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.730
the Department of Agriculture
and the Department

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.430
of Health and Human
Services, put out

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.770
these dietary guidelines.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.940
So this year was the year
that the dietary guidelines

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.720
were reissued-- 2010 than
2015, which usually means

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.400
around the end of that year.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.420
So this was actually
issued pretty much

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.050
in January, early January.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.860
And one of the things
I'll just point out

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.190
is that they talk about a
healthy eating pattern, OK?

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.370
So here are the major
elements or food groups

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:23.800
that the dietary guidelines say
are part of a healthy eating

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.830
pattern.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:31.090
OK, so one of these things
does not look like the other,

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.790
as they say in "Sesame Street."

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:39.610
So which of these things doesn't
quite look like the others?

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:40.510
AUDIENCE: Protein.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.090
LAWRENCE KUSHI:
Protein, yeah, exactly.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.540
So this would be kind of
like-- for those of you--

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.910
since we're at Google,
I'll use this analogy.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.672
But this would be kind of
like your smartphone screen

00:22:53.672 --> 00:22:54.630
and the different apps.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.612
And it says YouTube,
and sort of Google Maps,

00:22:57.612 --> 00:22:59.570
and whatever these things--
and then this thing

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.670
says JavaScript or
something like that.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.920
So protein is not a food, OK?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.300
It's not something that we go to
the grocery store and purchase,

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.075
you know?

00:23:11.075 --> 00:23:13.010
And so why is it there?

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:18.360
It's basically a history
of the US government

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:26.000
and basically combining
animal foods and legumes

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.920
into one group.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.490
And so these little
sort of crescents

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.150
here come from the
previous graphic

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.951
that was used related to the
dietary guidelines, which

00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:39.450
is here.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.991
And basically it
does the same thing.

00:23:40.991 --> 00:23:42.490
There's that protein group.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:47.119
OK, so combining these different
foods into the same food group,

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:48.160
does this make any sense?

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.200
OK, here's your beautiful Angus
cow, part of the protein food

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.520
group, so to speak.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.230
Here are a bunch of legumes,
part of the protein food group.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:06.140
OK, so do these really look like
they belong in the same food

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:06.994
group?

00:24:06.994 --> 00:24:08.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.160
Only a nutritional
biochemist would really

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.200
think that these two
are the same thing

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.670
or are similar enough that
they really should be combined.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:22.730
So one of the things that is
a key component of why those

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.480
don't belong together is
that the meat side of things,

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.470
particularly the red
meat and processed meat,

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.610
is actually something you
shouldn't be eating a lot of.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:34.500
Whereas the legumes
are actually something

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.770
you should be including
in your diet, something

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:38.970
that you should be eating.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.290
So here's a report that
was published last year

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.650
from the International
Agency for Research

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:47.430
on Cancer, which basically
links meat to cancer risk.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:53.370
It's now a class one carcinogen
as recognized by IARC,

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.430
in the same category as
tobacco smoke, asbestos,

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:01.260
et cetera, in terms of being a
clear causal agent for cancer

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.036
risk.

00:25:03.036 --> 00:25:06.110
Now one of the things
that I've been involved in

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.230
is volunteering for the
American Cancer Society

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.380
and chairing, in this case,
the last time that they updated

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.080
their guidelines for
cancer prevention--

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.490
nutrition and physical
activity for cancer prevention.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.640
This is the actual
reference if you're

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.280
interested in that,
published in 2002.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.900
But here's basically what
we said on this committee.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.980
We said that there are basically
these four main sort of things

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.830
that one could potentially do
for cancer prevention-- achieve

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.860
and maintain a healthy
weight, be physically active,

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.930
consume a healthy diet with
an emphasis on plant sources,

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:45.010
and limit alcohol
beverage consumption.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.180
So if we look at the
healthy diet portion,

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.010
then basically we say things
like limit consumption

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.254
of processed and red meat.

00:25:53.254 --> 00:25:55.170
Eat at least two and a
half cups of vegetables

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.120
and fruit each day.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.340
Choose whole grains
instead of refined grains.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.520
Each one of these statements has
a lot of scientific literature

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.160
behind them.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.530
We don't explicitly talk
about legumes there,

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.720
but we probably should
next time around.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.550
This is a comparable report
from the World Cancer Research

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.132
Fund, which is based
in London in the UK,

00:26:14.132 --> 00:26:16.340
and the American Institute
for Cancer Research, which

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.910
is based in Washington DC.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.620
This was published in 2007.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.620
And they're going to be
updating this and releasing it

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.184
in a couple of years in terms
of their updated guidelines.

00:26:27.184 --> 00:26:29.350
So their recommendations
are basically very similar.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.890
They're looking at the same
scientific literature published

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.030
around the world.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.550
And so if you look at the last
point on this particular slide,

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.600
eat more of a variety
of vegetables, fruits,

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.150
whole grains, and
legumes such as beans.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.700
So clearly they
call out legumes,

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.740
which we probably should
have, but we didn't.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.140
And they also say limit
consumption of red meats--

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.660
so very different
messages for these things

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.690
that, at least in the
dietary guidelines,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.620
US dietary guidelines graphic,
are lumped together in the way

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.180
that they're talked about.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.756
So let's take a
look at this, OK?

00:27:03.756 --> 00:27:05.630
Limit consumption of
processed and red meats.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.642
That's what we said as the
American Cancer Society.

00:27:08.642 --> 00:27:10.100
And the World Cancer
Research Fund,

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.320
at least in an updated
report specifically related

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.960
to colorectal cancer, they
say the evidence is convincing

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.080
that these things increase
the risk of colon cancer.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.480
OK, so let's take a
look at this just as one

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.940
example of how we and the
World Cancer Research Fund

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.480
come up with these sorts
of recommendations.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.170
So in colon cancer,
colon cancer rates

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.100
vary tremendously
around the world.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.670
It's like 40-fold difference.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.710
And these are just select
areas around the world.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:43.400
The top line are
African-American men and women

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.910
in the United States, who
have among the highest

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:47.660
rates of colon cancer
around the world.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.820
The third one down is people
of European descent ancestry

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.600
in the US-- also very high.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.720
Down below are
like India, Madras

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.900
here, Chiang Mai in Thailand,
et cetera-- wide variation

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.832
in colon cancer rates.

00:28:05.832 --> 00:28:10.120
Now published in 1990 was the
first prospective cohort study,

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.940
which means a bunch
of people were

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.360
enrolled, in this case nurses.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.950
They were given food
questionnaires 1980.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.190
And then they were followed for
six years and determined who

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.740
developed colon
cancer and who didn't.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.560
And so the nurses who reported
eating red meat as a main dish

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.470
every single day compared with
those who reported very rarely

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:36.570
eating red meat, they
had a two and a half

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:39.470
fold greater likelihood
of developing colon cancer

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.000
over that six year period.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.230
And you can see
the more frequently

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.060
the meat was consumed,
the greater the likelihood

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.350
of developing colon cancer.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.710
So this is the first such
study designed to look at this.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.770
There were a couple
other studies

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.780
of different study design
that provided clues

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.604
that this might be going on.

00:28:58.604 --> 00:29:00.770
There have now been a couple
dozen of these studies.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:04.030
So this is a meta analysis
of these perspective studies.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:05.860
And I'll just say,
here's the conclusion--

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.590
"High intake of red
and processed meat

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.130
is associated significant
increased risk of colorectal,

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.870
colon, and rectal cancers.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.920
The overall evidence
from prospective studies

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.120
support limiting red and
processed meat consumption

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.010
as one of the dietary
recommendations

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.270
for the prevention of
colorectal cancer."

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.310
So highly consistent
findings across all

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.520
these different studies
that are conducted, not just

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.840
in the United States,
which that first one was,

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.060
but in Argentina, Australia,
various parts of the United

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.910
States, and China, and
Japan, and other places.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:39.580
So let's look back at sort of
colon cancer trends over time.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.450
Here's India, Mumbai.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.260
There's a cancer registry there.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:48.070
Very low rates-- continues
to be low as time goes on.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.390
Here's the United States,
Connecticut as an example,

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.160
one of the cancer registry.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.080
Again, among the highest
rates in the world,

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.930
generally speaking.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.750
These are rates of men.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:01.320
Let's take a look at
Japan-- very low rates

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:06.880
just back in 1960, now among
the highest rates in the world.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.480
This is Shanghai in China--
similar trends going on

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.830
as we saw in Japan,
but delayed a bit.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.480
There are things,
very powerful things

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.890
happening in the
world that result

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.670
in these changes
in disease rates.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:23.500
This is with women.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.020
You see the same pattern.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.900
Rates are a little bit lower,
but basically the same pattern.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.580
So in India, of course,
cows are considered

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.170
to be sacred at least
in some contexts.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.720
And so you'll often see him
wandering around the city

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.720
streets and that type of thing.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.010
The first McDonald's that
was vegetarian was in India,

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.360
you know?

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.150
So what's been going on in
these other Asian countries that

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.532
resulted in this type of change?

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:59.450
Maybe something like this--
not to specifically point

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:01.740
to those golden arches.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.330
One colleague says, you know,
when you see the golden arches,

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.050
you're looking at
the pearly gates.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.670
You're not far from
the pearly gates.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:14.420
So any case, if we look
at actual food consumption

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.510
from the Food and
Agricultural Organization,

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:21.110
then you can see, again,
Japan increasing consumption

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.590
of these animal
products, in the US,

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.020
very high levels, in India,
very low levels-- directly

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.234
parallels these colon
cancer rate trends.

00:31:30.234 --> 00:31:32.705
AUDIENCE: And that's
combined [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:32.705 --> 00:31:35.080
LAWRENCE KUSHI: Yeah, it's
all of them combined together.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.788
Because that was the
easiest thing for me

00:31:36.788 --> 00:31:40.007
to pull out for the purpose
of this particular slide.

00:31:40.007 --> 00:31:41.001
Yeah.

00:31:41.001 --> 00:31:43.545
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] separate
red meat from these other--

00:31:43.545 --> 00:31:45.920
LAWRENCE KUSHI: Yeah, so the
question is, should red meat

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.200
be separated out?

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.390
Ultimately, yes.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.390
Because the health effects do
differ among different animal

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:52.260
food products.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.800
And red meat is probably, and
processed meat in particular,

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.450
is probably the worst thing.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.337
But yeah.

00:31:59.337 --> 00:32:00.920
And fish, we probably
should be eating

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.110
some on sort of
regular basis if one is

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.510
going to eat animal products.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.350
And milk there's a lot
of controversy about,

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.810
and same with eggs.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.870
And we can go into some
of that if you want,

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.070
even though that's aside
from this whole question

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.280
about pulses.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.470
OK, so looking at the
pulse side of things,

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:25.580
this other part of this
protein foods sort of group,

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.690
this is an analysis that
we did way back when,

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:32.040
when I was at the faculty of
the University of Minnesota.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.320
And if we look at sort
of the turquoise bars,

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.970
people who reported
any tofu or soy intake

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:42.360
had about a 25% reduction
in developing breast cancer

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.870
over about a six or seven
year period than people

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.260
who didn't report any.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.770
So this is from a study of women
in Iowa, about 40,000 women--

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:55.080
actually about 35,000
in this analysis.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:59.400
But what's the problem with
doing such a study in the US?

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.550
So thanks to people like
Minh Tsai, tofu, et cetera,

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.370
is more widely available now.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:10.260
But in Iowa, less than
3% of these 35,000 women

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.880
reported eating any tofu
or soy foods, right?

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.220
And so if you actually
want to look at this,

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.950
you don't have much power,
as you say, statistical power

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.930
to look at it, which is ironic.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:25.860
Iowa produces tons of soy.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.595
But most of it goes to
feed the pigs, you know?

00:33:28.595 --> 00:33:33.080
So Iowa's also a big
pork producing state.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.056
So in order to actually
look at this question,

00:33:35.056 --> 00:33:36.430
it's better to go
to a population

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.060
where people eat a fair amount.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.020
And there's variation.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.140
So here's a study in Shanghai
that I was involved in.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:47.070
And you can see that basically,
women who reported more soy

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.640
consumption compared
with less soy consumption

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.540
had somewhat lower
breast cancer risk,

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:56.270
not statistically
significant, but still there.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.500
This is their soy
intake as reported

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.750
when they were adolescents, a
clear relationship-- high soy

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.990
intake, lower likelihood
of developing breast cancer

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.332
a few decades later.

00:34:06.332 --> 00:34:08.540
And there are other studies
that have looked at this.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.020
Here's a meta
analysis, again, of

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.139
these various several studies.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:15.230
This one-- basically,
these dark squares

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.940
are the high versus
low relative risk.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.639
If the dark square is on this
side of this vertical line,

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:25.010
then that means that the high
intake results in less breast

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.989
cancer than the low intake.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:28.600
If it's on this
side, then it means

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.340
high intake is higher
rates of breast

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.659
cancer than the low intake.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:36.460
But overall when you combine
the results across all of these,

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.420
and most of the studies show
higher of soy intake, less

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.870
breast cancer, then you've
got this relative risk,

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:47.340
which is here-- 0.71, about a
30% reduction in breast cancer

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.469
comparing high soy
intake to low soy intake

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.540
across these various studies.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.840
This is the same thing--
studies Western populations,

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.330
where there's not much
soy intake being consumed

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:00.020
except in hidden things
like sort of soy lecithin,

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.420
and as flavoring, and whatever.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.870
And so there's not
much variation.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.090
You don't see too much.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.760
Anyway, so I'll skip over this.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.630
These are of the same,
sort of another way

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.480
of looking at meta analysis,
but conducted by other people.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.475
But soy intake and
other diseases-- this

00:35:16.475 --> 00:35:18.070
is from studies
in Shanghai again,

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.486
the Shanghai Women's
Health Study,

00:35:19.486 --> 00:35:22.530
which has been following
75,000 women in Shanghai

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:24.490
for a number of years.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:28.640
Decreased likelihood of
cardiovascular disease events,

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.090
less diabetes, half
the diabetes rate

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.820
of people with high soy
intake versus low soy intake,

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:38.960
less bone fractures-- so a lot
of sort of effects of this.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.880
Now is it the soy per
se or a dietary pattern

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.649
that includes soy?

00:35:43.649 --> 00:35:45.690
You know, it's a little
hard to disentangle that.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.480
But clearly, dietary
patterns that include regular

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:55.230
consumption of soy foods are
better for you than dietary

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.120
patterns that don't.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.420
So as was mentioned earlier,
Year of the Pulses--

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.410
that's this year.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.940
The United Nations has
just described that.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.820
So this has also
already been mentioned.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.280
But each one of
these statements,

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.910
like our dietary
recommendations,

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:16.190
a lot of literature that
supports each of these--

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.850
but pulses are
highly nutritious,

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:21.480
as Liz mentioned,
economically accessible,

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.860
contribute to food security,
important health benefits.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.147
I just demonstrated or
pointed to some of them

00:36:27.147 --> 00:36:28.480
specifically in the soy context.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.950
But this can be extrapolated
to other arenas as well-- lots

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:35.990
of evidence that legume
intake in general

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:39.120
is great for cardiovascular
disease risk, et cetera,

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.590
for lowering risk.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.480
Foster sustainable ag, and
contribute to climate change

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.330
mitigation and adaptation,
and promote bio-diversity--

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.850
so these are all important.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:54.910
So when you look at that food
group, it's kind of like, OK,

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.720
it's not really an
appropriate food group.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.520
But to the extent that some
parts of it, don't do that.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.130
OK

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:03.330
Cows going to the
slaughterhouse--

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.385
they say, my only consolation
is that by eating us,

00:37:06.385 --> 00:37:07.510
they're killing themselves.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.420
And that's pork,
the meat of the pig.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.310
It makes an excellent
substitute for tofu.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:17.850
This is where we should be.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.900
Instead of thinking
about legumes

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:25.740
as a substitute for red meat, it
should be the other way around.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.530
When we go on an airplane,
the default sort of meal

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.460
that's-- of course, you don't
get meals anymore domestically.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:36.190
But internationally, it should
be something that's vegetarian.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.640
And then if you want
to have the meat, that

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.740
should be a special meal
option or something like that

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.540
rather than the way it is now.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:49.660
So anyway, we can go into more
detail about other things.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:53.140
I will say-- I mentioned
this at the last panel

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.060
that I participated in with Liz.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:00.190
But I'll just say
that just recently, I

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.905
was at a couple of conferences,
cancer related conferences.

00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:04.710
I do cancer research.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.600
I heard Vice President Biden
talking about the cancer

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.730
moon-shot, et
cetera, and what we

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:13.070
can do to accelerate
advances in cancer research,

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:16.630
decrease the cancer
burden, et cetera-- a lot

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.650
of interest in all
this sort of stuff

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:21.090
that's happening in
cancer centers and stuff.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:25.640
The work that my other two
colleagues here-- the work

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.600
that they're doing is going
to have a much bigger impact

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.450
on impacting cancer rates
than those targeted therapies

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.500
and other things that are
being-- that lots of money

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.530
are going into.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.320
Because they're having a
direct impact on these risk

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.320
factors, these
dietary changes, that

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:48.110
will actually result in
impacting cancer rates.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:52.870
And so it's like, I bow
down to these people.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:56.240
You know, compared with what I
do, sitting in conference room

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.440
or at my desk in a
computer room or whatever

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.091
and analyzing data--
anyway, thanks.

00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:03.590
And--

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:04.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.130
--have them join us.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:08.390
LIZ CARLISLE: Thank you.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.906
And ask us questions.

00:39:09.906 --> 00:39:11.780
I always have lots of
questions of these two.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.276
But yeah--

00:39:13.276 --> 00:39:15.570
AUDIENCE: So thank you
so much for being here.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.350
LIZ CARLISLE: Let's make sure
we-- yeah, repeat the question.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:19.270
So the question is
basically, would this

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.910
look different, this red
meat, all of these red meat

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:26.050
statistics, if we weren't in
a concentrated animal feeding

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.440
lot but actually working
with pastured meat,

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.460
with grass fed meat?

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.610
What's the difference?

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:34.260
LAWRENCE KUSHI: So
the direct answer

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.770
to that question is,
we don't really know.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:39.410
Because most of these
types of studies that I do,

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.260
these epidemiologic
studies, don't

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.340
ask about that type of detail.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:47.090
But I will say that the fact
that these findings have been

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:50.840
seen consistently
around the world,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.140
in countries which have
different sort of animal

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:58.660
husbandry regulations, maybe not
necessarily how much cows come

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:04.930
from feed lots versus sort of
out in the pasture, range fed,

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:06.480
or whatever.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.340
But the fact that some of the
other practices-- you know,

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:15.510
people often talk about things
like the use of antibiotics

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.740
and to help-- low
level antibiotics

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.550
to help feed the cows, or
hormone implants, or whatever.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.440
We see similar findings
in Europe or in Japan,

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.470
for example, as in the
US where here in the US,

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.960
most beef cattle are given
estrogen sort of implants

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.410
or estrogen analog implants
like Zeranol or something.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:40.170
Whereas those same
implants are banned

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:45.662
in those countries because of
potential human health effects.

00:40:45.662 --> 00:40:47.120
But we see the same
sort of effect,

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.080
which suggests
that it may not be

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.810
driven by those specifically.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:54.210
I mean, they may have
some role on some level.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:57.790
But it doesn't describe
everything that's going on.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:59.730
So it doesn't directly
answer your question.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.500
But it does point to the
fact that there-- consistent

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.780
finding in different
countries suggest

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.980
that it's probably cows.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.860
LIZ CARLISLE: One
thing that I think

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.270
is really interesting to
bring up about pastured meat

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:18.650
and grass fed production is that
if our whole country switched

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.760
exclusively to grass
fed production,

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.380
we would all eat
a lot less meat.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:27.480
So that may be the most
powerful health effect.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.650
MINH TSAI: Yeah, I agree.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:32.550
I think one of the
issues that I see

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:36.280
as a food manufacturer
in the US is

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:42.440
that we have several fascinating
tendency in the United States.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.390
One is whatever we
think it's good,

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:47.130
we tend to just eat a ton of it.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.490
So there's this term moderation.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:52.931
It's almost lost in
our consciousness.

00:41:52.931 --> 00:41:54.880
You know, one of
the reasons we did

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.230
Tofu Disrupt from a culinary
side is to say to the public

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:04.940
here that you don't necessarily
have to think of tofu as

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.530
strictly a vegetarian food.

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.560
Because believe it
or not, in Asia,

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.770
it is often eaten with meat.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:13.290
But it's very proportionate.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:16.370
The meat is just a
very small portion.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.750
So perhaps portion
control is the answer

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:22.800
here and not necessarily
even tofu, or vegetarian,

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.780
or legumes for that matter.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:30.960
So I think I would be
curious to learn more

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.110
about the cases of
Japan, for example,

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:38.590
the quantity consumed and
the frequency of consuming

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.500
red meat.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.945
I think they will have
actually a greater impact.

00:42:42.945 --> 00:42:44.320
Because I don't
think necessarily

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.150
that the Japanese are eating
less tofu necessarily-- maybe.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:51.250
But I think proportionately,
everything else

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.160
they're eating in
greater quantity.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.037
So that's my concern.

00:42:56.037 --> 00:42:57.620
LAWRENCE KUSHI:
That's actually right.

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.470
The sort of soy food, generally,
sort of consumption Japan

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:02.580
hasn't decreased.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.207
But the meat intake has gone up,
sort of rice intake has dropped

00:43:07.207 --> 00:43:08.540
and some other things like that.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.300
Yes.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.610
AUDIENCE: First of all, Minh,
you came here in October.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:15.720
And you did a really
lovely dish with Chef Liv

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.700
where you mixed the ground
tofu and ground pork.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.850
And you had that
same spiel about how

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:22.890
you don't have to replace meat.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:24.930
But you can flavor
it with those tofu,

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:27.430
and you're already
decreasing meat consumption.

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:30.670
So thank you for
that back in October.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.129
But for Dr. Larry-- correct?

00:43:34.129 --> 00:43:35.920
LAWRENCE KUSHI: You
can call me Larry, yep.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.670
AUDIENCE: OK, Larry.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:43.000
I've done a lot of research on
dietary guidelines globally.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.320
And it's fascinating
how consistent

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.790
the world is inconsistent
with these food groups

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:54.690
and how protein, for
example, here how we group

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:57.360
it is very different in
different parts of the world.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.020
But nutrition all comes
from the same science.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.270
So obviously the government
plays a part or food preference

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.010
like in India.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.010
And I'm sure you've
seen Switzerland

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.170
with their new guidelines.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:12.210
And they've taken out the
red meat recommendation

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:15.900
and I'm sure have
lower cases of cancer.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:19.500
And I wonder if the
United States is slowly

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.430
moving towards that?

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:25.960
Could you see them pulling out
pulses as their own food groups

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.350
or kind of recommending
red meat less and less

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.456
these guidelines are updated?

00:44:31.456 --> 00:44:33.940
LAWRENCE KUSHI: Yeah,
so there are-- at least

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.860
in the US dietary guidelines
context, there are two phases.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.710
There's sort of the
scientifically updated

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:40.150
review that happens.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:43.830
And then a different
group of people

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:47.140
take those and translate those
into the actual guidelines.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.360
And so that second process--
while the first process

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.830
is semi-political in terms of
who gets onto that committee--

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:58.350
different interest groups
nominate various people,

00:44:58.350 --> 00:44:58.890
et cetera.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.160
But the work that
they do is largely

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.350
sort of apolitical,
sort of review

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:05.480
of the scientific
literature, et cetera.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.050
And so the report that they
put out-- in this case,

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.250
it came out a little
over a year ago--

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.890
to inform what become
the dietary guidelines is

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.100
largely apolitical.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.200
The next step is not, you know?

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.850
And so what ultimately becomes
the dietary guidelines,

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:23.930
there are a lot of
competing considerations.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:27.310
So the US Department
of Agriculture,

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.080
as great an organization it
is for a lot of the things

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.740
that they do, they
have competing

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.290
and contradictory
sort of priorities.

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:39.200
And one is to promote human
health through good food

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.840
selection and food
security programs

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.810
like the school lunch
program, and food stamps,

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:44.934
and other things like that.

00:45:44.934 --> 00:45:49.820
And the other is to help support
the agricultural industry.

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.710
And so sometimes--
I mean, way back

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:56.670
when, when we didn't know that
red meat actually was bad,

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.610
those didn't
necessarily conflict.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.280
And sort of food security
issues were more paramount

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.770
than chronic disease risk.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:06.140
But now they do conflict in
terms of the overall mission.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.680
And so it's pretty hard for the
USDA to say, eat less red meat.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.720
And in fact the last
time they actually

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.980
said that in any sort
of official publication

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.080
was in 1979.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.970
They've changed it
to these euphemisms

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:24.020
like choose lean meats or
other things like that.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.110
So they don't-- their
official publications in terms

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.590
of guidelines, et cetera,
don't really say that.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.590
But I will say that
generally speaking,

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.140
the trend that you are talking
about has been happening.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:38.370
Because in the last
dietary guidelines

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:42.930
and in the current dietary
guidelines, 2010 and 2015,

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.740
they now explicitly recognize
that vegetarian eating

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.900
patterns, Mediterranean
eating patterns,

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.270
are actually healthful
choices, you know,

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:52.820
that these are not things
that, you know-- I mean,

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.650
back when I started studying
nutrition or whatever,

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.470
vegetarian sort
of concept of that

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:03.290
was, like, considered to be
sort on the way extreme sort

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.340
of wacky sort of thing.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.080
And now even though
people-- there still

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.120
aren't large numbers of
vegetarians proportion wise,

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.780
it's now considered
to be healthful.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.840
So it's not-- so I think it's--
elements are definitely moving

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.590
in that direction.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:18.278
Yeah.

00:47:18.278 --> 00:47:21.240
MINH TSAI: I'll just add
something really quickly.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.400
I don't have the type of
data, scientific data,

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.080
that Larry gathers.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.370
But what I've noticed
based on having been around

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:31.920
and making tofu for
more than 10 years

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.240
is that with the
advent social media,

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.100
of information, that you
guys help foster at Google,

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.170
people are just more
knowledgeable about the food

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:44.420
that they consume.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.680
So now it's a matter of
getting that data out

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.460
there like the way
Liz and Larry are

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:54.880
doing-- so Liz on the ecological
side, Larry on the health side.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.985
So my job is just to
make it taste good.

00:47:56.985 --> 00:47:58.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.980
You know, that's the
trifecta right there, right?

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.290
So if people can
understand that,

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:07.290
OK, this is the ecological
impact with your decision

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:08.950
when it comes to food.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.850
Larry can give you,
this is a health impact.

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:14.590
And I can tell you,
like, this is great.

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:15.660
Our tofu is amazing.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.570
But don't eat it every day.

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:21.990
You know, eat it
proportionately with other food.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:24.250
And have a balanced diet.

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.950
So I think that's something
that to Larry's point

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.360
when he finished is
that's prevention right

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.980
there of any form of disease.

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:34.390
So that's what we try
to do as a food company,

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.930
as a responsible
food company, too.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:40.622
So I see the trend in the US
actually being very optimistic

00:48:40.622 --> 00:48:41.580
because of information.

00:48:48.376 --> 00:48:50.500
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming
to talk about the tofu.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.030
I really enjoy
drinking the soy milk.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.860
I've been drinking
it over a year now.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.600
It's a very great
substitute for milk.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.010
And one question
I have for you is

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.220
there's couple way
to make soy milk.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:07.820
One is I saw on your
video you could boil it

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:11.070
and then-- I mean, soak it
with water, and boil it,

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.302
and then take the skin
off-- one way to do it.

00:49:13.302 --> 00:49:14.760
I think this is
similar to what you

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.690
can get in the supermarket
with the unsweetened soy milk.

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:22.940
Another way to do it I saw is
using a blender, a high speed.

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:25.150
And then just run it.

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:32.580
And you drink including the
skin of the milk, of the bean.

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.270
One thing I read
on the internet is

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:39.650
about if you eat a lot
the skin of the bean,

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:41.480
it could affect your health.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.970
I like to hear your
thought on that.

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:46.069
MINH TSAI: I'll leave
the health part to Larry.

00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.610
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:49.380
MINH TSAI: But as far
as making soy milk,

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.190
you need to make soy
milk to make tofu.

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:55.250
So as a tofu company, we
make the soy milk first.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:58.440
And the way we make it
is quite traditional.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.630
And when I mean
traditional, what I mean

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:05.280
is we make it in a way
where we don't waste.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.240
We make it in a way where
we do-- we give respect

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.560
to the beans, which means
we actually grind the beans.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:15.580
And we cook it with the ground
up slurry of the bean itself

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:16.590
for the flavor.

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:20.220
You know, we don't run away
from the flavors of the beans.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.380
Many soy milk you get
in the supermarket

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.610
don't have the beany flavors.

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:29.170
I like people to try to really
drink soy milk with that legume

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:30.140
flavors.

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.270
Because I think you
can get used to it.

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:38.180
In Asia, soy milk is prized
for that actual fragrance

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.630
of the beans.

00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:42.200
So I think we'll
get there in time.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.060
And then for me, we also
try to make a soy milk

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.000
with high fiber.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.980
I would prefer to actually
leave all that fiber in there.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.380
Because I think it's
actually good for digestion

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:55.080
to have the fiber.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.960
So if you can use a blender
and make it at home,

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.020
and you can actually
blend it fine enough

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.900
to have the fiber go
through your system,

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.380
I think it's healthier.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:08.330
Now make sure you use organic,
non-GMO soybeans so that-- that

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.040
would be what my suggestion is.

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.010
But Larry can
chime in and as far

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:16.310
as the health impact of
eating the entire legume.

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:18.710
LAWRENCE KUSHI: It does taste
better with the skin in it.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:19.095
Yeah.

00:51:19.095 --> 00:51:19.886
MINH TSAI: Perfect.

00:51:19.886 --> 00:51:20.880
LAWRENCE KUSHI: Yeah.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.860
I just say, you know, that's
probably the better way

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:25.480
to consume it.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:30.630
But sort of including some tofu
or whatever and other soy foods

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:33.930
that are derived from other
parts of the soybean--

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.020
I think that's great.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:39.900
So as we saw in the video, the
yuba or whatever-- you know,

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:44.070
there are other parts in the
whole sort of soy processing

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:44.610
process.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:45.990
You could do this all at home.

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:47.781
Actually, we used to
when I was growing up.

00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:50.830
We used to make tofu at home.

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:52.360
Because it wasn't
readily available,

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.990
except like in the Chinatown.

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:56.800
So you would go to
there or whatever.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:01.380
And so actually one of the
first tofu companies in the US

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:05.500
was started by some students
of my parents, Nasoya,

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:09.550
which started in Massachusetts
way back when, you know?

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:13.780
And there's others that
sort of grew from that.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.650
But in any case,
it's definitely--

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:18.820
if you can eat
the whole soybean,

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:21.800
even if it's in different
foods, that's great, you know?

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.610
If you blend up the soybean, the
whole soybean, as you're making

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:27.636
soy milk, that's great too.

00:52:27.636 --> 00:52:29.010
MINH TSAI: So as
far as you know,

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:32.580
there's no long term effect
on health including the--

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.390
LAWRENCE KUSHI: So I'm
guessing-- total guess here,

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:36.660
so don't hold me to this.

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.920
But I'm guessing that
the suggestion there

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.940
might be related to things
like protease inhibitors,

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.430
and phytic acid, and some
of these other things

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.470
that in theory might
bind some minerals

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:53.456
and sort of inhibit
absorption if you

00:52:53.456 --> 00:52:56.790
have more of the outer part
of the soy bean sort of as

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:59.260
part of what you have.

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.680
Those things, while there's
some truth to all that,

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.580
those things are also
probably some of the reasons

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.800
why eating these
products, legumes

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.500
in general and whole
grains as well,

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.720
are helpful for cardiovascular
disease risk, heart disease

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.220
risk.

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.000
That's where a lot of the
antioxidant properties

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:19.920
come from.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.810
That's where sort of the
ability to potentially

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:28.090
sort of inhibit--
in the soy context--

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:30.140
inhibit sort of
cell proliferation

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.930
or some other things that
probably play a role in cancer.

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:36.860
So overall, I mean, there
may be these individual sort

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.210
of possible sort of
negative health effects.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.530
But overall, it probably
actually contributes

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:44.135
to why these are
healthful foods.

00:53:44.135 --> 00:53:46.080
MINH TSAI: I'll tell
something funny.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:51.310
We actually all over the world
eat legumes very similarly.

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:54.220
We actually rehydrate
them often and then

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:58.800
we slow cook them for our
body to actually absorb

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.350
all the nutrients of
the beans, whole beans.

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:05.020
Tofu is totally an
accidental discovery.

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:08.250
Somebody was cooking beans
in a pot with excess water

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:10.370
and decided to flavor
it with something

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:15.070
that's acidic, which turns that
protein liquid into a solid.

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:20.360
So if you think about-- I
mean, eating organic carrot

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:24.200
with the peel on is so much more
nutritious than peeling it off,

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.172
for example.

00:54:25.172 --> 00:54:27.130
So the fact that you're
eating the entire bean,

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.772
it's probably good.

00:54:28.772 --> 00:54:31.650
AUDIENCE: I hear lots of
concerns around high content

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:33.180
of estrogens.

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.280
And I'm not sure is this
in general a concern?

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.760
Is it conventional soy
versus organic soy?

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.630
Or what are your
thoughts around that?

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:44.100
LAWRENCE KUSHI:
OK, so Minh maybe

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.900
has some other ideas,
or maybe Liz too.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:46.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.570
MINH TSAI: I'm not allowed
to speak on this one.

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.250
LAWRENCE KUSHI: OK.

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:53.550
So one of the things that
soybeans in particular,

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:58.100
compared with other legumes,
is pretty much sort of known

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.670
for, in a sense,
is relatively high

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:04.720
what are called phytoestrogen
content and isoflavones, which

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.380
soy beans are
really great source

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:14.250
for, concentrated source
of are phytoestrogens,

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:19.870
meaning that they have
potential estrogenic activity.

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:22.220
So genistein is one
of these isoflavones.

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:24.740
Daidzein is another one.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.740
And there are a couple others
that exist in soy foods,

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:33.180
and also in some other legumes,
as well as some other foods.

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:37.940
OK, so the question
really is, OK,

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.370
does consuming these have
a negative health impact?

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:45.240
Now it's clear that if you
take genistein, or daidzein,

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.960
or whatever, and you put
it in tissue culture,

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.610
and you've got these
cells-- you know,

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:51.940
these MCF-7 cells
or whatever, which

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:57.200
are sort of estrogen-sensitive
breast cancer cells,

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.810
then the cells will proliferate.

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:00.640
They've got estrogen
receptors on them.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.705
The isoflavones bind to those.

00:56:02.705 --> 00:56:05.150
It causes a cell proliferation.

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:07.700
If you do the same kind of
thing, you take a xenograft

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.800
and you stick it on to an
animal or something like that,

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.980
and then you give them a
lot of these isoflavones,

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.950
that tumor is going to start
growing or whatever, OK?

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:22.770
But what actually happens in
real life in human beings?

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.460
As the studies
that I showed you,

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.980
breast cancer risk,
which is in fact

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:34.110
related to endogenous
estrogen levels--

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:36.960
if anything, people who are
eating soy on a regular basis

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.350
have lower likelihood of
developing breast cancer.

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:41.390
And now there's
three or four studies

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:44.320
that show that women with
breast cancer, including

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:48.570
hormone receptor positive
breast cancer who have more soy

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:51.990
intake compared with the
less-- not going overboard,

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:53.560
but more compared
with less-- they

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:58.370
actually have better prognosis,
lower recurrence rates

00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:01.550
and better survival rates.

00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:05.010
So this theoretical
sort of concern

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:09.000
that you can demonstrate
in tissue culture

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.220
doesn't translate
into what actually

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.640
happens in human populations.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:17.390
And so if anything, eating soy,
including women with hormone

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:19.770
receptor positive
breast cancer, it's

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:21.800
probably-- it's
certainly not something

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.550
to avoid that you need
to be concerned about,

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:29.620
despite what a lot
of people say there.

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:35.430
So anyway, that's one sort of
general thing that I'd say.

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:36.930
LIZ CARLISLE: My
lay interpretation

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:39.690
of this data-- and I've been
really interested following

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:43.410
this discussion-- is that it
reinforces this recommendation

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:45.850
that we should eat
whole foods, that there

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:49.040
is some genius in the
combination of compounds

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:53.600
in actual plants that is
destroyed when you isolate

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.855
compounds from those
plants and eat them

00:57:55.855 --> 00:57:58.230
by themselves, that there's
something very different that

00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:01.416
happens when a human
metabolizes that.

00:58:01.416 --> 00:58:02.290
LAWRENCE KUSHI: Yeah.

00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:03.047
Yeah.

00:58:03.047 --> 00:58:03.630
I would agree.

00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:05.296
Actually, there's an
upcoming conference

00:58:05.296 --> 00:58:07.090
at the National Cancer
Institute next week

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:09.190
about dietary patterns
and where research

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.250
should be moving in
terms of really thinking

00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:13.250
about the whole
combination of things.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:17.270
There's this whole concept in
some of the nutrition research

00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:22.110
area of food synergy, which
is combinations of nutrients

00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:24.480
and different foods
and how that may

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.230
be more important
for health than sort

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:28.380
of looking at isolated
individual compounds

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.960
like genistein or whatever.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.610
So I think there's
growing recognition

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:34.910
that, yeah, when we
think about these things,

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:37.090
we should sort of
step back and not

00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:43.000
focus on individual nutrients
per se or dietary components.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.060
MINH TSAI: And I think,
on a culinary note,

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:48.680
I think whole foods
just taste better.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:51.560
The least processed
it is, actually,

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.840
if you teach people
how to cook with it,

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.560
it actually tastes so much
better than processed food.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.070
We eat process food
because we want

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:01.880
to keep it for long shelf life.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:05.970
We eat processed food because
it's cheaper in many cases.

00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:08.085
But many of the
processed food like one

00:59:08.085 --> 00:59:10.210
of the-- one of the cheapest
form of processed food

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:11.770
is soy protein isolate.

00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:13.170
It's in everything.

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:16.390
But it was never meant
to be a food, you know?

00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:19.220
It was supposed to be a paper
coating, a paint coating.

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.720
But it was never
meant to be a food.

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.079
But some genius thought,
hey, this is super cheap.

00:59:23.079 --> 00:59:24.870
And I can add some
flavor to it and turn it

00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:26.435
into like mock hot dog.

00:59:26.435 --> 00:59:27.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:32.550
So now you have something that's
like $1.99 that is soy food

00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:35.991
but is not necessarily as
healthy as eating whole beans,

00:59:35.991 --> 00:59:36.490
you know?

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:39.210
So try to eat as little
processed as possible.

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:42.780
Same with meat-- that's why
processed meat, it's up there.

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:45.520
So all right, that's all I'm
going to say about health.

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:46.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.480
Because Larry is here.

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.880
And on that note, I'm going
to hand it back to Liz.

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.213
LIZ CARLISLE: Thank you so
much all of you who are here,

00:59:52.213 --> 00:59:54.310
all of you who are here
watching us remotely.

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:57.724
Liz Carlyle, Dr. Lawrence
Kushi, Minh Tsai--

00:59:57.724 --> 00:59:59.390
feel free to ask us
questions afterward.

00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:02.550
You saw our emails
on the slides.

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:05.600
[APPLAUSE]
