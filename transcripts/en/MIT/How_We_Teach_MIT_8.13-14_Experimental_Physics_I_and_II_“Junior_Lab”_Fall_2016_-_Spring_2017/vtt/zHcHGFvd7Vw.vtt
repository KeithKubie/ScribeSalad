JANET CONRAD: So the
course is three hours long,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.250
and it meets twice a week.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.720
We also have one extra
meeting on Friday

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.550
that they can come
in if they want to.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.770
And during that time, there
are very few lectures.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.280
We start out at the beginning
with just a few lectures.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.570
There's lectures on
how to give a talk.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.500
There's lectures on
lab safety, of course.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.730
There is a set few
lectures at the beginning.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.850
But after that, the
students immediately go out,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.550
and they start working on
their different experiments.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.500
And what I do is I go
around from group to group.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.600
The lab groups are
always two people.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.300
And so I go around
from group to group

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.570
and, most of the time, what
I do is ask them questions.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.880
"What are you doing?"
is a good start.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.980
And then from there,
they'll tell you

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.180
where their problems
are and so forth,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.120
and you can help
them figure it out.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.286
One of the things you're
teaching them, for example,

00:00:58.286 --> 00:01:00.780
is how do you debug a
system, which by the way,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.920
is the same for debugging
code as debugging hardware.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.020
The approaches that you
take are exactly the same.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.710
So that's what I
do actually when

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.160
I'm in the lab itself and
I'm coaching them along.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.560
If they don't look like
they've actually tried,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.970
I encourage them
to give it a try.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.760
If they come up
with a question, we

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.850
talk a lot about how it is that
they might test the question

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.780
that they've thought of.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.033
And so, that's the kind of thing
that I do in the lab itself.
