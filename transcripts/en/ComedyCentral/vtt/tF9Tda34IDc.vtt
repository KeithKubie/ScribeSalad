We shouldn't be here.

I'm Roy Wood Jr.

who nurtures us, protects us,

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.530

- So this story takes place in
19...

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:02.228
Let's see, I think 1964,

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:05.932
way back in the way-back
machine.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:11.104
Khrushchev was our Putin.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:14.240
Johnson was our Trump.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:19.645
Cars were, like, boats.

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:23.249
Kids were fat.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:26.719
And dads were veterans

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:30.923
and they drank sometimes.

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.258
We were poor; 11 kids.

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:34.827
I had 11 kids in my family.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.063
I was tenth; I just slid out.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.799
I was...

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:44.403
I was home before my mom
from the hospital, so...

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:48.841
I to fend for myself, but...

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:52.111
It was winter in Minnesota,
St. Paul, Minnesota,

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:55.081
1122 [...] Avenue.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.949
That's what--you remember where
you lived when you were a kid.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:02:03.422
That's--no numbers since then
can I remember, but...

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:05.625
So it's like a winter day,
and--

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:09.862
but not bad, but not freezing,
but not livable.

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:11.197
And...

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:15.535
You know, me and my brother
Tommy,

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:17.470
who was two years
younger than me,

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:18.804
and we were the last two kids.

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:20.373
I was 10 and he was 11.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.943
We weren't expected
or planned for or...

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:28.347
We were just, "Oh, my God,
we have two more."

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.486
My parents were both older,
and I just remember it well.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.821
We lived in the projects but
didn't feel bad

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:37.890
living in the projects then.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:39.892
We had lawns.

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:41.694
There were flowers.

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:45.565
On my dad's lawn, because he
was notorious.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.034
People were terrified
of my dad.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:52.405
So he just had to put a string
and sticks around his lawn

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:55.841
and nobody ever kicked it over
and I just went,

00:02:55.874 --> 00:03:00.846
"Oh, my God.
He's a monster to them too.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.515
He's a monster."

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:06.719
Sometimes I'd kick it over, and
he'd go, "What the hell?"

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:09.755
Anyways, my dad goes,
"Hey, kids."

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:10.990
That's how my dad talked.

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:15.194
[nasally]
"Hey. Hey, you guys.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:16.429
That was the talk back then.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:19.865
"Hey, what the hell you--
Ah..."

00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:23.603
"All right, kids, hey, you want
to go up to Joe's?"

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:28.407
Joe's was a gas station that
sold the cheapest gas.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.778
I don't know where he was
getting it, but...

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:34.747
Anyways, my dad goes,
"You want to go to Joe's?

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.917
I need to get some gas and get
some bulk oil."

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.586
Now, you gotta be old to know
what bulk oil is.

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:45.191
It's the oil that already has
been used,

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:49.395
and they run it through, like,
a strainer

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:53.566
and then you can purchase it
for 10 cents a quart,

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.702
and my dad knew a value
when he saw it.

00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:59.572
So we had a car that burned a
lot of oil so he would get it.

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:03.109
But he said, "Do you wanna go?"
I go, "No, I don't want to go."

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.744
And my brother--I go, "Tommy,
you don't want to go."

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:05.878
He goes, "I want to go."

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:08.881
"You don't want to go.
You're not going.

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:11.651
Shut up, please."

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.886
"Louie, why don't you go?
We'll just go up there,

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.255
no big deal, huh?"

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:18.724
And I know--I know what
my dad's up to,

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:20.126
'cause he can't get
out of the house

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.427
unless he brings the kids,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.462
'cause otherwise he'll drink,

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:25.564
and that--my mom knows that.

00:04:25.597 --> 00:04:26.632
She knows that.
She goes,

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:27.967
"You're just gonna go drink."

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.604
He goes, "I'll bring the kids!"

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:34.674
And I wanted to go,
"That won't stop him!"

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:37.943
"He's gonna drink!"

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:40.346
And so we get up there,
it's starting to snow,

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.948
we got a big
Bonneville station wagon

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:44.850
which is...
gigantic.

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:46.819
And we get the bulk oil.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:50.456
"You guys hungry for...
[mumbles]

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:53.592
Candy or soda or something?"

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:57.697
"No, we should get home."
I was that kid.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.467
"Mom's worried about us,
I'm sure, by now.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.836
She said you're a derelict."

00:05:05.337 --> 00:05:08.174
"Oh, is that so, Louie?

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:11.777
Well, have you ever been
in a war, Louie?"

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.380
"I'm 11."

00:05:14.413 --> 00:05:18.851
"Always some excuse with you,
Louie.

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:21.287
You guys, why don't we go over
to the Moose Lodge here?"

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.891
Do you know--Moose Lodge is
like a private club, sort of.

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:29.862
But anyone can come in at
certain hours.

00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:32.131
So we go in the Moose Lodge
there.

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:34.500
No moose
except one on the wall

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.536
that did not look well.

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:39.305
And we sit at the bar,
you know,

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:42.508
and I'm very against this.

00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:44.543
That's the kid I was.

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:45.911
I'm sitting there,

00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:47.580
I'm in between my dad
and my brother.

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:50.216
"You want something, Louie?"

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.751
"No.

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.719
"I don't want anything.
We shouldn't be here.

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:56.489
We should call mom and tell her
we're coming back right now."

00:05:56.522 --> 00:06:00.192
"Oh, you goddamn baby."

00:06:00.225 --> 00:06:02.762
"You're a baby."

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.497
So...

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.865
"You sure you don't want
root beer?"

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:09.368
"I don't want nothing with beer
in it."

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:11.070
This is the kind of kid I was,

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:14.840
just a little, I don't know,
bitch, I guess, in some ways.

00:06:14.873 --> 00:06:16.709
I don't mean that in
a female way,

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:22.448
but I can say it now because
I play a woman on TV, so...

00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:24.717
So...
[scattered applause]

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.919
I go, "I don't want anything."

00:06:26.952 --> 00:06:30.556
And then my dad goes, "Hey,
Tommy, you want something?"

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.258
"He doesn't want anything.

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:36.395
We're in a pact. He's not gonna
go along with it."

00:06:36.428 --> 00:06:37.897
"You sure?"

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.399
Tommy of course goes, "Yeah,
I want something."

00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:41.901
And he keeps--my dad keeps--

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:44.570
and he's getting a shot
and a beer each time.

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:46.906
He drinks his beer,
and he goes back a ways,

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.908
and I go, "Whoa."
I never realized

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:54.146
that he had that ability
to go that far back.

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:56.248
It must have been a war thing.

00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:59.318
"I can't go--I gotta--so they
can't shoot me.

00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:00.787
I stay down."

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.390
So he's drinking the shots.

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.058
"You sure you don't want
something, Louie?"

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:09.295
"What about a Orange Crush?"

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.297
"No."

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.332
"Hey, how about a pickled egg?"

00:07:13.365 --> 00:07:18.471
"Ugh, maybe."

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:21.440
Never. Who wants a pickled egg?

00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:23.809
Who's eating the pickled egg?

00:07:23.842 --> 00:07:26.412
Who's at the bar and going,
"God, is that a pickled egg

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:27.947
"in a jar?

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.282
"The one that guy just stuck
his hand in

00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:31.851
"to get a pickled egg out of?

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:35.688
"God damn it, I want a pickled
egg.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:39.825
"Can I just get a pickled egg?

00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:42.695
Do you have any bread I can put
the pickled egg on?"

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:47.633
On and on.
Finally I go, "Tommy,

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:50.102
"it won't be long now.

00:07:50.135 --> 00:07:53.772
Couple more, he's going off
the stool, I'm pretty sure."

00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:57.443
Boom.
He goes off the stool.

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:59.712
The guy goes, "That's it!"

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.981
Like, the guy who gave him
all the booze.

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:03.482
"That's it!

00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:06.485
All right, I need you guys
out of here."

00:08:06.518 --> 00:08:08.187
"Where are we gonna go?"

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.990
He is so plastered, and now
if it's your father,

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:13.993
you're humiliated,
you're upset,

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:15.995
but there's a lot of humor
in my family,

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:18.063
so I'm laughing.

00:08:18.096 --> 00:08:22.635
In that sick laugh thing like,
"What about to me?

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:26.705
"Why do I have a sick dad?

00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:30.342
Why isn't Carl's dad a prick?"

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:31.810
So here I am.

00:08:31.843 --> 00:08:33.546
Now, my dad was very funny,

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:36.649
and he goes, "I'm all right.
I can drive.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.584
I drove a tank!"

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.390
I don't trust you.

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.424
"I got it, Louie.
Don't--

00:08:45.457 --> 00:08:48.727
"Louie.
Louie."

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.828
"Louie!"

00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:53.032
"Louie, yeah, that's right.
Ha."

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.234
Dads, when they--my dad when
he'd get drunk,

00:08:55.267 --> 00:08:59.271
he should fall over, but he had
a gyroscope

00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:00.539
that somehow kept him up.

00:09:00.572 --> 00:09:04.176
He just...

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:05.945
And he'd look at you.

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:09.281
"I'm all right."

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:11.183
No, you're not.

00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:13.218
We get in the car.

00:09:13.251 --> 00:09:16.722
I'm telling you, the snow
is a foot now.

00:09:16.755 --> 00:09:18.057
He gets in the driver's seat.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.460
I get in the middle.
Tommy sits there.

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:22.895
I go, "You ready to go home?"

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:25.932
"I'm ready to go home."

00:09:27.432 --> 00:09:29.602
"Dad?"
"I got it!"

00:09:32.437 --> 00:09:34.573
Now we're going down.

00:09:34.606 --> 00:09:37.576
I go by my grade school, Ames.

00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:39.378
I go, "Dad, why don't you just
let me out?

00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:41.280
I'll just stay until morning."

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:42.748
I honestly said that.

00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:44.583
Why don't you just let Tommy
and I out here?

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:46.919
He just--"No, no.
We got it, Louie.

00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:48.587
What are you worried about?"

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.756
Now we're all over the road.
We're going...

00:09:50.789 --> 00:09:53.225
There's no other car out there.

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:55.094
It's beautifully--it's really
like I going,

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:58.597
God, this is really beautiful
out.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.066
But I'm in trouble.

00:10:01.099 --> 00:10:04.436
I'm 11. I don't have a
learner's permit.

00:10:04.469 --> 00:10:07.773
I'm steering the car.
We're going down the thing.

00:10:07.806 --> 00:10:09.074
We got three roads to get by.

00:10:09.107 --> 00:10:10.776
We go by the witches
haunted house

00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:12.277
that we used to walk by in
school.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.279
You always have some kind of
weird thing.

00:10:14.312 --> 00:10:16.915
"That's where the witches are.
They're gonna..."

00:10:16.948 --> 00:10:18.317
If you have a little brother,
you need that.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.319
"They're gonna get you!"

00:10:20.352 --> 00:10:22.955
Anyway, and...

00:10:22.988 --> 00:10:24.857
And we're going down the hill,

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.759
and we have a pretty steep
hill,

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:29.595
so we turn and now we're almost
home.

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:30.696
Just at one more turn.

00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:33.465
1122 [...] is right up there.

00:10:33.498 --> 00:10:35.534
I can't see it, but...

00:10:35.567 --> 00:10:37.036
And then my dad,

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:39.371
all of a sudden, he just--
the car stops,

00:10:39.404 --> 00:10:40.639
and he just passes out.

00:10:40.672 --> 00:10:42.041
And I go, "Oh, my God."

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:44.043
And the windshield wipers
are going.

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:47.646
There's only this much open to
see,

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:49.848
'cause only where my dad's
alcohol breath

00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:53.852
is clearing the window.

00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:56.822
And I'm going, "I guess I
could walk from here,

00:10:56.855 --> 00:11:01.326
but, ugh, I hate to walk."

00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:06.732
Even as a kid I go, "Oh, could
you pick me up?"

00:11:06.765 --> 00:11:08.333
We'll get two people then.

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:11.870
Anyway...
And so...

00:11:11.903 --> 00:11:12.871
Anyways, my dad...

00:11:12.904 --> 00:11:14.640
[coughs aggressively]

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:16.508
I heard it, and I go, "What?"

00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:19.078
"Oh, I'm back."
Oh, thank you.

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:23.415
Thanks for the cough choke,
Dad.

00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:25.884
So he wakes; I go, "Okay, we're
almost home."

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:29.488
Step on the brake and I'll
guide the car home.

00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:30.823
Just take it easy.

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:34.760
He hits
the gas all the way down.

00:11:34.793 --> 00:11:37.896
We fly back.

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:41.667
Catch me if I do happen to...

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.402
It'd only hurt at first.

00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:51.110
And I flew back, and my dad
gunned the car;

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:53.779
it had never gone so fast ever.

00:11:53.812 --> 00:11:56.548
We're at least going
50 miles an hour,

00:11:56.581 --> 00:11:59.017
and we lived 1122 [...]

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.119
and right across the street was
a big woods

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:02.387
that we had B.B. gun fights in.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.289
And boom, we hit the curb.

00:12:04.322 --> 00:12:06.892
The car went up.

00:12:06.925 --> 00:12:09.094
I don't--honestly, I just went,
"Oh, my God.

00:12:09.127 --> 00:12:12.564
"Hey. What?

00:12:12.597 --> 00:12:13.999
What?"

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.104
I think I said, "Shit!"

00:12:19.137 --> 00:12:22.108
"Don't swear, Louie,
for God sakes."

00:12:24.776 --> 00:12:28.113
Yeah, we landed in the--
all the snow.

00:12:28.146 --> 00:12:30.215
Whoo!

00:12:30.248 --> 00:12:31.817
You know, it was we were--
I go,

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.752
"This is like a snow globe.
This is like--

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:38.590
We are--somebody's shaking us.
We're..."

00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:41.727
And this was a big hill
that I had to get up now,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.162
because we were down
in the gulch.

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:46.265
And we had ice that,
for a week--

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:50.736
so we could slide
on cardboard.

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:52.171
That's what we slid on,

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:55.007
but we had ice that we'd take
buckets of water,

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.745
"No one will ever get up this."

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:03.115
So Fat Louie is going,
"Here we go."

00:13:03.148 --> 00:13:05.484
I get up to it.
I get about halfway up,

00:13:05.517 --> 00:13:10.189
and I go, "I am losing my grip,
I'm losing my grip."

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:11.790
And I just go on my back
and go down.

00:13:11.823 --> 00:13:14.960
Whee!

00:13:14.993 --> 00:13:16.461
I did it, like, three or four
times,

00:13:16.494 --> 00:13:20.332
'cause I just go, "I'm just
gonna enjoy this."

00:13:20.365 --> 00:13:22.601
And then finally I got up to
the very top,

00:13:22.634 --> 00:13:23.802
and there was a road.

00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:26.338
That's right--
there's my house.

00:13:26.371 --> 00:13:29.641
And the neighbor came by.

00:13:29.674 --> 00:13:31.810
"Hey!

00:13:31.843 --> 00:13:33.378
Are you guys okay?"

00:13:33.411 --> 00:13:37.149
"Everything's perfect!

00:13:37.182 --> 00:13:39.952
We got it!
Go ahead!"

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.520
"You sure you don't need
any help?

00:13:41.553 --> 00:13:43.222
"We don't need any help!"

00:13:43.255 --> 00:13:45.958
That was my role in the family.

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:49.962
Deflect, deflect, deflect.

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:53.832
"We don't need any help.
It's under control.

00:13:53.865 --> 00:13:56.902
Someone shot our tires out!"

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:02.074
I didn't want those people
to help,

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:04.042
'cause it's a family thing,
in families.

00:14:04.075 --> 00:14:06.912
It's your dad;
it's your situation.

00:14:06.945 --> 00:14:12.017
It's your family.
You went into the woods.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.852
It's not even explainable,
really.

00:14:13.885 --> 00:14:16.188
It's just...

00:14:16.221 --> 00:14:18.090
We finally get up it
across the street,

00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:20.158
and I go in the house.

00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:22.661
And my brother Roger is there.

00:14:22.694 --> 00:14:24.930
"What's going on?"

00:14:24.963 --> 00:14:26.064
Dad drove into the woods.

00:14:26.097 --> 00:14:29.234
"Oh, for God sakes."

00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:32.037
Everybody has that voice in our
family, so...

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.874
Even mom.
"Oh, my God."

00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:38.710
My mom was really mad.
She was...

00:14:38.743 --> 00:14:40.913
She just went...
"Mm."

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:48.086
And said to my brother,
"Go get him. Go get him."

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:51.056
Tommy's in there.
I tell him to stay.

00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:52.858
I said, "Don't get out, Tommy.

00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:56.128
Just stay with Dad."

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:59.898
And then, he went in, and he
was able to drive the car out.

00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:02.234
My dad--they brought my dad in.

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:03.936
He was drunk, so drunk.

00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:06.071
Sat in the chair.

00:15:06.104 --> 00:15:08.206
I was sitting there because
when you're 11

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:09.608
you have to think about stuff
but you can't really

00:15:09.641 --> 00:15:14.813
contemplate it very well.
You just go, "Huh.

00:15:14.846 --> 00:15:18.917
"I'm starving.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.555
Should I eat the egg?

00:15:23.588 --> 00:15:27.092
My dad rustles out of his
deep, you know,

00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:29.461
drunken stupor.

00:15:34.599 --> 00:15:36.234
[groans deeply]

00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:39.571
[coughs aggressively]

00:15:39.604 --> 00:15:42.774
He's alive. He lives.

00:15:42.807 --> 00:15:46.111
My brother, Rog, is standing
right next to him.

00:15:46.144 --> 00:15:49.114
He goes, "Hey, buddy.

00:15:49.147 --> 00:15:52.517
"Hey, you wanna go to Joe's
with me?

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.654
And get some bulk oil?"

00:15:55.687 --> 00:15:59.291
And I never got to go with
my dad again on any trip alone.

00:15:59.324 --> 00:16:02.160
I hope you enjoyed that.
Thank you so much.

00:16:02.193 --> 00:16:03.996
[cheers and applause]

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:07.366
I love you, Dad!
Love you, Mom!

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:11.536
Forgive your dad.
He didn't mean it.
