00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.460
Okay! Y’all have been working towards this moment
for weeks.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.400
You’ve learned about emotional influence.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.600
You’ve prepared your questions, alternatives,
and remember: clear goal, full hearts, can’t

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.600
lose.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.980
If you need to brush up and rewatch those
videos… now’s your chance.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.140
Because it’s go time.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.100
It’s time for you to get your head in the
game and figure out your personal negotiation

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.100
style.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.369
You gotta learn how to collaborate and what
cheap shots to watch out for.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.070
You have to learn the rules by heart: how
to start, pose a counter offer, avoid pitfalls,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.250
and make sure everyone is playing fair until
the deal is done.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.470
I’m Evelyn from the Internets.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.090
This is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.920
And it’s time to negotiate.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:53.420
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.500
Negotiations are all about resolving conflict
through collaboration.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.000
You’re not actually trying to “crush
the competition.”

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.180
I mean, sometimes, you’re in a completely
distributive negotiation with limited slices

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.750
of proverbial pie.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.380
And there are a few things you can avoid to
make sure you don’t get the smallest piece.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.149
Say it was 1978 and you wanted to open an
ice cream parlor in Burlington, Vermont with

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.149
a friend.

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.530
Maybe you’ll call it something cute like…

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.530
Ben and Jerry’s.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.079
You’ve found the perfect spot: an old gas
station in the central part of town.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.999
Since it’s a funky building that fits your
style and gets heavy foot traffic nearby,

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.609
you’re willing to pay $1400 a month for
rent.

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.950
I’m making this up, but work with me!

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.000
And you’ve prepared for negotiation.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.520
So you know your alternative: a boring, smaller
storefront down the road for $1200 a month.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.390
And your target: $1400 a month.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.799
You need to start off strong.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.469
So, first, you shouldn’t start a negotiation
with a range of prices.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.040
If you offer a range, like $1200 to $1600,
you’ll lose leverage.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.079
Your negotiation partner will just pick the
price that works in their favor.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.149
Basically, they only hear $1600 a month because
that gets them more money.

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.369
Don’t open with your target either, because
you probably won’t get it.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.520
Your collaborator is looking out for their
interests too, so they’ll try and counteroffer.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.430
Especially if it’s a situation where people
expect to negotiate, like over salary.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.450
That’s also why you shouldn’t take the
first offer you’re given.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.610
It’s probably not your collaborator’s
resistance point or their target, and you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.610
could get a better deal.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.190
The first number in a negotiation matters
because our brains are weird and don’t like

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.190
randomness.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.240
We latch onto ideas and make up significance.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.280
It’s kind of like why we’re so good at
seeing shapes in clouds or coming up with

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.290
constellations.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.020
Astronomers looked at a bunch of stars and
were like, “I mean, I guess that could be a scorpion.”

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.120
In business negotiations, people get trapped
by anchoring.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.790
Even if a first offer is completely arbitrary,
your wacky brain is going to think that number

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.400
is important and use it to inform the rest
of the negotiation.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.960
So if the owner of that old gas station starts
by asking for $2000 a month, take a breath

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.630
and think about whether or not the offer is
fair.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.280
Because of anchoring and your irrational brain,
you may feel like you have to go closer

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.220
to $2000, even if your original offer would
have been $1200.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.880
So don’t jump right in!

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.260
Take time to propose a counter offer, and
don’t bargain against yourself by backing

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.350
down right away.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.870
If you start with $1200, don’t go “wait...wait!

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.980
$1500” just because they have a surly look
on their face.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.120
It doesn’t mean they’ve hit their resistance
point and are walking away.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.010
They’re probably just thinking!

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.830
So be patient, be confident, and you may find
they’re willing to make a deal.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.820
And if you’re suddenly talking rental dates,
rental price, and refurbishment, try to

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.070
move away from bargaining and toward an integrative
negotiation.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.460
To find those creative solutions, listen more
and talk less.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.600
Negotiations are scary.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.570
You may be nervous you won’t walk away with
what you need, or maybe you just really hate

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.570
silence.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.040
But filling the gaps by talking a bunch isn’t
going to give you any more control -- you’re

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.760
just showing your hand without getting anything
in return.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.110
Not to mention, you’re missing out on opportunities
to understand the other person’s side.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.400
Like my boy Powerline says: “If we listen
to each other’s heart / We’ll find we’re

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.330
never too far apart / And maybe love is a
reason why / For the first time ever, we’re

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.979
seeing it eye to eye”

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.590
For a truly innovative solution, just look
at when Stevens Aviation and Southwest Airlines

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.590
both used the same slogan, “Just Plane Smart.”

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.340
Instead of spending thousands of dollars and
years in court, they realized they both

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.199
just wanted brand recognition.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.169
So they competed in a televised arm wrestling
match for the slogan, and both got huge bumps

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.169
in sales.

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.169
Y’all, I’m serious.

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.180
That’s what happened.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.039
Look up the “Malice in Dallas"

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.020
Now, you probably won’t be solving any slogan
disputes anytime soon, but negotiation strategy

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.930
matters a lot when you’re figuring out
salary.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.330
Sometimes, companies offer bonuses instead
of higher pay.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.660
And any money is great, especially if you’ve
got student loans.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.009
But having a higher annual salary will help
your bank account more than a one-time bump.

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.440
So it’s better to negotiate.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.960
Let’s go to Thought Bubble.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.620
You’ve just graduated from U.C.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.639
Santa Barbara with a degree in criminology.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.199
And you got an offer from the area’s premiere
psychic detective agency.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.970
Even though it’s a relatively small firm,
you think you could get your salary raised

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.039
by another $5000 per year.

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.800
You’re not in the interview anymore.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.520
They want to hire you, so you’ve got some
power.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.340
Every person brings value to a company, and
you deserve to get paid what you’re worth.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.319
So now it’s time to talk about what you
bring to the table... without acting like

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.789
a hostile Lassiter.

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.300
And the ‘I-We’ strategy can help.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.699
It sort of flips the script.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.770
You still advocate for yourself -- that’s
the “I” part.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.720
But you focus the conversation on how your
skills benefit the company and how the negotiation

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.469
serves everyone’s interest -- that’s the
“We” part.

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:56.050
When the HR coordinator, Burton “TT Showbiz”
Guster, offers you a $5000 signing bonus,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.889
you bond over your shared Super Sniffer abilities.

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.580
You listen carefully to all he’s offering,
but then counter with a $5000 dollar salary bump.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.380
You talk about how your honed psychic skill
set could give your boss a break from interrogating

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.090
perps and give him time to sip pineapple smoothies
on the beach.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.610
Then, mention how your negotiation skills
could help the agency get into crime scenes

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.259
without resorting to hopping fences.

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.289
By the end of the conversation, the HR coordinator
is convinced, and offers you that pay bump.

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.150
You’re a big believer in giving everything
a good night’s sleep.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.689
So the next morning, you accept the offer
of an extra $5,000 a year… and a day off

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:34.080
for Scare Fest to boot.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.920
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.740
Any job offer is exciting, and you may want
to take it right away.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.029
But it’s worth taking time to think, weigh
your options, and prep if you want to negotiate

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.029
more.

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:48.509
If you want to talk about an offer at home
first, it’s never okay for a company to

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:49.979
ask who you’re talking to.

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.400
You could talk to your cat for all they’re
concerned.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.120
But not everyone got the memo that you should always play nice in a negotiation.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.100
Just like with emotional influence, there
are unscrupulous characters who will try to

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.800
use hardball tactics to convince you to take
a not-so-good offer.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.860
It’s tempting to act like the tough guy
if you’re afraid of losing out or aren’t

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.819
used to asserting yourself, but hardball tactics
erode trust and don’t always work.

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.550
We want to teach you to fend them off like
an experienced negotiator.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.479
So it’s time for a bit more defense against
the dark arts.

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.990
Ultimatums -- like “if you don’t buy this
remembrall now, I’m out of here” -- and

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.550
other bluffs are risky, because you’ll lose
credibility if you don’t follow through.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.599
They’re also just… annoying.

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:36.530
Remember how you hated “my way or the highway”
as a kid, even though you did need to eat

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.530
your veggies?

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.849
If someone gives you an ultimatum, downplay
or reword it with something like, “I know

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:46.400
you’re reluctant to pay more than 100 galleons
for this old wizarding journal, but it really

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.809
is a rare item.”

00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:52.180
That way your negotiation partner saves face,
because they probably weren’t going to

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.180
walk away.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.669
People may also may try to skew a negotiation
in their favor by lowballing or highballing

00:07:57.669 --> 00:07:59.520
you with a ridiculous offer.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520
Remember anchoring?

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.129
It’s really easy to fall prey to, even if
you try to avoid it.

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:05.650
Our irrational brains, y’know?

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:11.479
If you’re offered 50 galleons for your 600-galleon
Firebolt to “get it off your hands,” that’s

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:12.479
lowballing.

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:17.219
And if someone says they won’t take less
than 1500 galleons for a 600-galleon Firebolt

00:08:17.219 --> 00:08:20.339
because it has “sentimental value,” that’s
highballing.

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:23.939
Either way, don’t get swayed by the dramatics.

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:28.219
Use research to show you know your offer was
reasonable, like the other broom prices in

00:08:28.219 --> 00:08:30.169
Diagon Alley thrift.

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:33.990
Or re-anchor the negotiation with the price
you were originally going to offer.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.709
And just like there are loyal Hufflepuffs
such as myself, there are also Slytherins

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:41.830
who may be a little more... intentionally
deceptive.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:46.300
Your gut may tell you when something feels
off, so be on the lookout for people who avoid

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.959
your questions, change the subject, answer
a question with a question, or use their charisma

00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:52.959
to flatter you.

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:57.360
If you’re buying a home, asking about problems,
and are suddenly directed away from the

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.620
elegant marble bathroom, you may want to press
harder.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.320
You may not have any Veritaserum, 
but liars don’t really practice their stories.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.680
So if you ask the same questions different
ways and take notes, you may spot contradictions.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.030
But even the most noble of us can fall victim
to bad behavior.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.210
Nobody’s perfect.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.470
Negotiations are stressful, so if you panic
a little, you might start evading questions.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.930
If your brain really starts to go haywire,
you can take a quick break.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.449
To avoid misdirecting people or looking like
you’re trying to hide something, prepare

00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:30.839
answers to difficult questions ahead of time.

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:35.389
And sometimes, there are things you just can’t
give away, like your target or resistance

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:36.389
point.

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:38.779
But you still want to be honest and upfront.

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:42.600
Maybe you’ve got an NDA and are selling
12 Grimmauld Place.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.720
If someone asks who the owner is, you could
say “I... can’t answer that question,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.380
but I could talk about other ways to accommodate
your interests.”

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.340
And don’t think of yourself as the bad guy,
just because you want to negotiate.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:58.120
It may feel a bit uncomfortable at first,
especially if you’re not used to asserting

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.120
yourself.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.339
And that’s OKAY.

00:10:00.339 --> 00:10:05.320
You have every right to own your space on
this planet and ask for what you’re worth.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.420
And I’m telling you now if you haven’t
heard it recently: you’re worth a whole

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.420
lot.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.870
You don't have to be great at negotiation
to come away with a higher salary, a cheaper

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.630
broom, or the perfect ice cream store.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.290
You’ve got nothing to lose, plenty to gain,
and just have to be willing to try.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.350
So if you remember nothing else:

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.019
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:25.639
Be willing to negotiate.

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:30.370
Ice Ice Baby: Stop, collaborate, and listen.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.920
Take time to counter, don’t bargain against
yourself, and avoid getting caught in anchoring.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.380
Don’t play hardball.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:43.420
Good cop, bad cop is for the movies, not the
negotiation table.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.130
Defend yourself against deception and other
unscrupulous dealings by paying attention

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.130
and asking questions.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.170
We already know you’re working hard to get
where you want to go.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.920
So next time, we’ll help you work smarter
by setting some effective goals.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.550
Crash Course Business is sponsored by Google
and it’s made with the help of all these

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.010
nice people and Thought Cafe is our amazing
animation team.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.350
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:09.509
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:14.560
stuff like the Dear Hank and John podcast,
where John and Hank Green give dubious advice

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.000
to listeners’ questions.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.470
Also, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.699
the series at Patreon; a crowdfunding platform
that allows you to support the content you

00:11:24.699 --> 00:11:25.699
love.

00:11:25.699 --> 00:11:29.240
Thank you to all of our patrons for making
Crash Course possible with their continued

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.220
