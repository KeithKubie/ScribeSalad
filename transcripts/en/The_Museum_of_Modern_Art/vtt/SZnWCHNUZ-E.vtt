00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.520
So there's 112 copies on the table right now.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.080
I know it looks like a lot, but...

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.360
It's better than 200.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.420
Yes, yes.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.960
So I think we'll see how we go, how it goes.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.460
Okay.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.140
Umm

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.900
So this is Liv, our intern from Publications.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.400
Hi, nice to meet you.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.940
Hi.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.780
Hi.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.740
So I think she's gonna help, basically...

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.520
With the passing.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.560
Yes, passing the books to you.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.240
So what I'm gonna sign is the half-title page.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.800
Which is this page here.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.120
That first one? Okay.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.740
So what more do they have to do here?

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.040
What more?

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.880
Well, they have, I think, first, to see if
this is also good.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:24.369
And then I think they have to first remove
the mats in order to place the numbers.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.439
And then bring back the mats...

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.330
And what holds this against the picture?

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.880
This is where they're going to put some double,
double tape, etc., so it's going to be flat.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.880
That's also one of the...

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.880
Right.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.060
So the tape will be behind this?

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.420
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.420
Okay.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.830
That was, in fact, one of the...

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.020
This has to be completely flat.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.520
Yeah.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.760
That's one of the...

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.120
[laughs]

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.340
issues of having such a long case

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.280
is to keep the overmat flat.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.240
When I was asking you about what do you do

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.160
how do you put corners on a picture that's ragged

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.520
I was actually thinking of Joe a la Hollywood.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.880
And what did they?

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.040
what did they do in the end?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.620
They put something along the bottom.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.300
Oh, yes.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.980
And did you see what they did for the...

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.860
The Muybridge?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.660
In general, what kind of light do you prefer?

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.500
Do you prefer kind of overall...

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.240
or do you prefer something that would be more focused

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.720
on the prints and objects?

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.980
Umm.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.410
I think this is slightly different...

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.410
These two will be...

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.230
Well, in fact, these three will probably be
treated differently because of the natural

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.590
light coming in.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:13.160
And something that will be maybe more classic
and intimate in the first part of the exhibition

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.860
and probably more, maybe, focused on some
walls.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.560
It's just something I've had no experience with.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.050
Well, you did many shows.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.660
But I never was asked about lighting.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.790
I think we're pretty good.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.580
Of course, they need to fix it, etc.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.520
But I don't think that that will be that different.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.260
Here, in terms of light levels, I don't know
where we are, and this is something also

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.720
we must check with LeeAnn.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.960
So what do we do, Stephen?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.960
Do we remove the other picture or do we keep
it a little bit tighter?

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.740
One option would be...

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.680
Where the tightness seems most noticeable
is this space to the corner.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:24.120
So if you were to move that one and this over,
like that...

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.980
Or we could take it out.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.710
So that's one possibility.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.120
Let's try to take it out and see how it looks.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.440
Okay, let's bring it back.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.480
What are these for?

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.480
The other material that we have, the cameras,
the books.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.380
Okay.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.740
Oh, right.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.820
So the big boxes are probably for the cameras.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.200
These are for the...

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.140
For some books, magazines, placemats.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.080
And where are they gonna go?

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.100
They are going to go...

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.900
Each time there's a small text, there's a
case, an object...

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.000
I see.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.040
...that is connected to it.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.980
So, Kristen, what was Peter saying about the
Ukraine and the double-sided frames

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.420
...that he thought that?

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.600
I think they're coming back today

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.660
and then they will fit them...

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.340
But we're gonna get the two remaining walnut
frames today.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.220
After lunch we can do those.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.920
Maybe we could have one bench here.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.920
That's a possibility.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.760
We could put one here and one in front of the photographsâ€¦ if they make us have two.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.520
Yes.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.940
I don't think we should have anything here.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.040
I think it would be bizarre, sort of strange
to have the...

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.600
It would be strange to have a bench and to have...

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.760
It started over.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.480
Yeah.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.340
It's cool.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.120
Each one has 10, and they're different.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.160
For my sixth birthday, I had an uncle who
knew I was interested in chemistry

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.260
and thought I would like darkroom work.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:47.280
So he got me a Kodak darkroom set that had
trays and developing tank and chemistry

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.540
and an instruction book.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:57.000
In the late '60s, I wound up with a bunch
of friends in New York who are all from Amarillo, Texas

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.080
and in the summers, they would go back.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:06.640
And in, I guess, '69, started going to
Amarillo with them

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.740
and saw a part of the country

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.870
that was completely unfamiliar to me.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:21.150
I knew the coastal cities, but nothing in
the middle, and I loved hanging out there.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.490
I'd spend the summers there and wanted to
explore it more.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.040
And so decided to start exploring the country,
and that's how the road trips began.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:40.400
I was interested in vernacular uses of photography,
and out of that interest came the show that's

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.680
recreated here, "All the Meat You Can Eat,"
which was from my collection and the collection

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.820
of two other friends.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.410
And the postcard, "Amarillo" postcards, which
were also shown here.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:56.500
And so I was interested in how photography
was used in our culture and what it meant

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.620
in our culture.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:04.270
And so that's why this varied collection became
"All the Meat You Can Eat" and why I produced

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.310
my own set of postcards, but I was also interested
in snapshots.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:15.750
I like snapshots because although they have
their own visual conventions, there are occasionally

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:23.370
snapshots that are free of convention and
have a life and spontaneity that's really

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.810
wonderful, and I wanted to refer to that.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.790
Five of them probably mine.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:35.380
But this was this show at the Smithsonian,
an American Bicentennial show, in '76 on American

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.380
architecture.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.780
Come on, let me take a picture of you.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.280
I'm not gonna put it yet...

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.440
[Laughs]

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.600
Because I don't want to give up yet any surprises.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.220
Oh, I have to put my Yankee hat on.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.160
Yes.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.780
Okay, I'm gonna go.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.200
Ginger's waiting.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.260
Have fun.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.060
We're gonna go off together.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.500
Nice work.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.760
I'll see you Wednesday and Thursday?

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.900
I'll see you Wednesday.
