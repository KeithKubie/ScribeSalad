(swoosh)

00:00:01.354 --> 00:00:02.290
(mouse click)

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.610
- [Announcer] This program is presented

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.240
by University of California Television.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.600

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:22.708
(upbeat music)

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.423
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.400
I'm Mary Comerio, Professor
of the Graduate School

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.310
in the College of Environmental Design

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.370
and Chair of the Hitchcock
Professorship Committee.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.210
We are pleased, along
with the Graduate Council,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.780
to present Lucy Jones, this year's speaker

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.720
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.420
As a condition of this request,
we are obligated and happy

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.090
to tell you how the endowment
came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.020
It is a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.640
this campus is linked to
the history of California

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.580
and to the Bay area.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.840
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the Army,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.120
came to San Francisco during the Gold Rush

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.730
where he opened a thriving
private practice in 1885.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.620
Charles established a
Professorship here at Berkeley,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.100
as an expression of his long
held interest in education.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.450
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.410
still treasured in San Francisco

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.550
for her colorful personality
as well as her generosity,

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.260
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.020
to establish a Professorship
at UC, making it possible

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.730
for us to present this series of lectures.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.250
The Hitchcock Fund has become

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.070
one of the most cherished endowments

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.320
of the University of California,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.470
recognizing the highest distinction

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.800
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.660
Thank you, Lillie and Charles.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.183
And now, a few words about Lucy Jones.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.100
Dr. Lucy Jones has
served as a seismologist

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.150
with the U.S. Geological Survey

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.010
and visiting Research Associate

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.300
at the Seismological Laboratory
at Cal Tech since 1983.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.450
She created SAFRR, Science
Application for Risk Reduction,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.480
Project to innovate and
protect the safety, security,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.310
and economic well-being of the nation.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.020
Major products of SAFRR, I guess
we should say that acronym,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.610
include the ShakeOut Earthquake Scenario

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:48.440
and the Great Shakeout,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.470
a public emergency preparedness event

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.520
that began with five million people

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.850
in Southern California in 2008

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.590
and has expanded to more than
24 million people annually

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.530
around the world in 2013.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.920
The ARkStorm Scenario is
a model of a great storm

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.870
in California and there's
a SAFRR Tsunami Scenario.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.150
So these things have brought
huge public awareness

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.810
to disaster preparedness.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.160
In 2014, she served in
a special assignment

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.850
as the Mayor's Science
Advisor for Seismic Safety

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.640
for the city of Los Angeles,
applying the results

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.120
of the ShakeOut Scenario
to increase the resilience

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.380
of the city.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.630
The Task Force recommendation
included retrofitting many

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.860
of the city's older concrete buildings,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.480
planning water backup systems
for the Fire Department,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.320
and building a solar-powered
wireless network

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.950
to backup cellular and digital service.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.690
On October 9th, 2015, just last week,

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.930
Jones celebrated a triumphant moment

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.560
as the legislation was passed

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.410
requiring the mandatory
earthquake retrofit

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.400
of 15,000 buildings in Los Angeles.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.150
I have to personally tell
you this is a really big deal

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.110
and this was not easy.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.190
And Lucy deserves a huge
amount of the credit

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.290
for the kind of coalition
she put together.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.950
She received a Bachelor of
Arts degree in Chinese Language

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.830
and Literature, Magna Cum Laude,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.260
from Brown University in 1976.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.390
At Brown, she also studied physics

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.360
and began to gravitate towards geophysics.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.360
In 1981, she had her PhD
in Geophysics from MIT.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.510
She is a fellow of the
American Geophysical Union,

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.010
member of the Resilient America Roundtable

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.790
of the National Academy of
Sciences and previously served

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.480
on the California Seismic
Safety Commission.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.680
She has received numerous awards

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.480
including the Meritorious Service Award

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.660
from the Department of the Interior,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.920
an Ambassador Award from the
American Geophysical Union

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.960
for outstanding contributions
in policy and public service.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.400
In early October, Jones was
awarded the Samuel J. Heyman

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.400
Service to America Medal
in services often known

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.810
as the Oscars of government service,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.710
they're called the
Sammy's for those of you

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.020
who don't know that award,
recognizing Federal workers

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.220
who have made notable
impact in the United States

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.330
and around the world.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.500
And I should add that
she has just been given

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.833
a Distinguished Alumni
Award from Brown University.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.410
Would you thank you me and the host

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.240
Department of Seismology in welcoming

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.628
Dr. Lucy Jones to Berkeley.

00:05:32.628 --> 00:05:34.878
(applause)

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.350
- Thank you, Mary.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.030
And I'm glad to be here.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.030
And it's been a extraordinary
time in the last month,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.627
especially being able to
see this significant step

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.310
in seismic safety for
the city of Los Angeles,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.750
and I do hope that it's gonna end up being

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.070
a significant event for the whole state.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.800
I'm really think that we're gonna be able

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.800
to use this opportunity to
advance across the state

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.260
and maybe eventually across the country.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.080
We're seeing a shift in how
people think about disasters.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.230
And that's the really fundamental issue

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.010
is this something that you can't predict

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.940
and who knows what's gonna happen

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.190
or is it something that's inevitable,

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.550
it's just a matter of
when and there are things

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.210
that we can do about it.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.820
And I've spent a lot of my
work over the last decade

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.370
is trying to help that
shift in opinion happen.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.670
And it's a combination of a lot of things.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.080
Part of it is about how we
as scientists communicate.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.870
We like to focus on what we don't know,

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.100
'cause that's what's interesting,

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.940
that's where we do our work.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.960
When we communicate to
the public that way,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.730
we often end up communicating
that we don't know

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.930
instead of focusing on the
things that we do know.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.130
And what I'm gonna talk
about today is the process

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.520
of creating disaster scenarios

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.150
as a way of helping our
communities better understand

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.160
what science has to tell
them and how they can be used

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.720
to be making better choices about this.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.750
And I'm gonna focus primarily
on our first scenario

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.420
which was to create an earthquake

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.040
on the southern San Andreas Fault,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.980
really focused on Southern California,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.830
and look at how we put
together the information

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.950
and then, to a certain
amount, about how it was used.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.350
A lot of it is applicable
for other disasters

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.750
and for other regions.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.930
And, in fact, the SAFRR
Project is just now coming

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.160
towards the end of creating a scenario,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.730
a comprehensive scenario,
for the Hayward Fault.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.290
We all know that we have
earthquake risks here.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.350
We've had the science
of what's the hazard,

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.280
what's the shaking, but
integrating it over a range

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.820
of disciplines to better
understand what it means for us

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.810
as individuals and as
communities gives us the support

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.050
for moving forward some
of these policy decisions

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.343
that we wanna have.

00:08:11.456 --> 00:08:15.050
So, let's start with why we
would be wanting to do it.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.010
I'll just remind you.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.160
Now we, this is the way a seismologist

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.180
or a geologist sees California.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.080
All of those red lines are some
of the faults that we have.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.460
And those faults are what make
California California, right.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.330
Because of the San Andreas,
we have the San Francisco Bay,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.580
because of the frontal fault,

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.510
we create the Sierra Nevada Mountains,

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.920
the San Gabriel Mountains are there

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.860
because of the Sierra Madre Fault.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.160
The faults are what make
California a place we wanna live.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.680
Without it, we'd be a desert.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.560
It's our mountains that
are trapping our moisture.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.510
And especially for those of
us in Southern California,

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.180
the faults trap the oil
which is how the whole city

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.640
got started in the first place.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.210
So they're all part of
what our reality is.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.430
If we wanna live here,
we have to learn to live

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.710
with the earthquakes.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.890
So, we need to learn
to live with that risk.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.210
And what is the nature of the risk?

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.560
In general, most people are afraid

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.200
of dying in an earthquake.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.370
The reality is if you look
at your chance of dying,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.660
if you were a regular skier,

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.090
you have about a one in ten
thousand chance of dying

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.210
because of skiing,
unless you wore helmets,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.330
and then you bring the rate
down to a certain extent.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.040
Your chance of dying from lightning

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.160
is about one in 80 thousand.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.570
That's how many Americans
will die this death.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.800
You know, it's a weird sort of statistic.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.490
What death do you die?

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.760
You know, one in two Americans
die from heart disease.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.100
All right?

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.100
One in 80 thousand die
by hitting by lightning.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.430
Presumably, you only die
once, so you can use this

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.020
as a pretty robust statistic.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.470
For dying in an earthquake,

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.817
it's about one in 125 thousand.

00:09:53.817 --> 00:09:55.720
And it's a hard number to get.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.310
They are extremely infrequent.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.270
How many people are really gonna
die in the next earthquake?

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.020
How far have we got and all this?

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.020
But in general, our one is
earthquakes are cause fear

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.220
out of proportion to
the risk to our lives.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.020
And we have done a pretty
good job of installing,

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.860
you know, working with life
safety in our building code.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.820
So your chance of dying in an
earthquake is not very high.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.840
This really isn't about dying.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.380
It's about living and
what life is gonna be like

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.090
after the earthquake and will
the city keep on working?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.110
So we have defined what
we've been aiming for

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.440
as urban disaster
resilience, having a city

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.240
that still functions after the earthquake,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.950
after the disaster.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.700
And as society has become more complex,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.570
that's become a more
difficult thing to do.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.160
So part of what I'm gonna
be showing today you is

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.160
how we go and look at urban
life as a system of systems

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.810
and the ways in which disasters
can disrupt those systems

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.173
that make life work.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:07.460
We've done this primarily
through the ShakeOut Scenario

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.750
where we chose one particular earthquake

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.720
and went and built together a picture

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.750
of what it would be like in the event.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.660
And you notice, I've got a
lot of different disciplines.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.260
To actually get an accurate picture

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.640
of what this is gonna be like,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.000
you need to invoke a very
wide range of scientific

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.407
and social science disciplines.

00:11:28.407 --> 00:11:31.460
You know, the seismologists
can tell you what the fault is,

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.240
and often, we'll do
that, and we'll give you

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.427
a pattern of shaking and say,

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.210
"There, we're done,
there's your scenario."

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.050
In fact, that doesn't tell a human being

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.360
what happens to them.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.830
You go to the engineer and they'll take

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.697
what the seismologists do
and then they say, you know,

00:11:42.697 --> 00:11:44.270
"Here's what happens to all the buildings

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.020
and all the infrastructure,
there, there's the picture."

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.750
It still isn't making
connections to people.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.670
It's only when we take it up through

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.530
all of the social sciences
where we really think about

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.440
what happens to people and to communities

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.770
that we start connecting and
giving people the information

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.800
that allows them to make
those policy decisions.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.940
Just wanna make a point.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.380
This is how we created
it for an earthquake.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.110
For instance, here's
how we put it together

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.750
for a storm scenario.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.720
You've got the same basic concepts.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.270
You have kept earth science, engineering,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.600
and social sciences.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.530
We have different pieces
as we go along here.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.610
On both the storm and the tsunami,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.760
it became a lot more interesting

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.150
'cause we had to think about
the role of prediction.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.660
And earthquakes, you know,
we don't predict 'em.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.000
We don't have to think about that.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.310
But in fact, like on a storm,
what the prediction says

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.940
determines a lot about how
flood control management

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.240
happens, for instance.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.130
One of the things I didn't
understand until I went in

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.920
and looked at is like they
actually get to choose

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.500
where to flood in many cases.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.130
We have flood control.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.100
If you have a flood exceeding the capacity

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.530
of your flood control,
somebody has to decide

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.580
whether to breach this
levee or that levee,

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.460
where to let the water go.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.120
So it becomes a much more complex system.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.560
And as somebody said,
"Imagine if you could go

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.710
and bottle up your earthquake shaking

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.000
and sell it the next summer.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.550
You end up with a whole different picture

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.910
about how it gets managed."

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.540
And of course, in flood management,

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.420
every bit of water that goes past the dam

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.910
doesn't get to be sold the next summer

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.450
and it leads to whole
different sets of dynamics.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.960
All right.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.270
So taking our picture of an earthquake,

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.170
we now need to put it into a system.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.000
This is the beginning of a city.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.350
Underneath all of our buildings,

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.070
we have a whole network of pipes.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.070
We have water systems.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.380
We have sewer systems.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.680
Tend to be the oldest
things in our community.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.690
They get put in before
the rest of the city.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.140
And on top of this, we go
ahead and we put our roads,

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.280
we put the houses that we're living in,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.680
we're putting the buildings
that we're working in,

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.280
we're putting in our
manufacturing centers,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.610
our power systems,

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.400
our communication systems,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.200
our transportation systems.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.200
And all of those systems are
there to support human society.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.350
So if we want to look at
the impact of a disaster

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.380
and inform people how
they can make choices

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.700
to move from that, we have to look at

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.263
how all of these systems interact.

00:14:10.533 --> 00:14:13.530
And I must say, as a
scientist, I'm a bit frustrated

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.740
at the simplicity of the
analysis that we've been able

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.000
to accomplish so far.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.210
It's an awful lot of hand
waving and approximations

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.370
that as a scientist, I'd much
rather be more analytical,

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.860
but we tend not to be.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.060
But as I said, at the beginning
of the earthquake scenario,

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.090
we need to start with
the earthquake itself.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.200
And so we started from these models.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.680
What I'm showing you is our animation

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.600
of what we expect the
earthquake shaking to be,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.940
having set up a lot of parameters
to define the earthquake.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.630
I'll start with one point.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.110
The next earthquake will
be different than this

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.770
because we had to make so many assumptions

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.680
and it's never gonna be exactly that.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.430
And that was a really hard
thing for the scientists

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.880
to get past.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.360
They wanted to say, but, you
know, it's not gonna be this,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.480
or it's not that and why did you say this.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.240
And what we have to do here is say

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.950
we've picked a plausible scenario
and be able to understand

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.020
that this is the type of thing

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.500
that we need to be planning for.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.830
Notice how much I've been talking

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.030
'cause I'm having to use up the time.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.120
A big earthquake like this
happens on a long fault.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.690
We estimated it to be about--

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.540
We chose a 200 mile long system.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.170
And the rupture propagates up this.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.220
In real time, it is 75 seconds

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.460
from the start of the earthquake
until the strong shaking

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.830
makes it into the Los Angeles area.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.160
So just by the way a little bit of plug

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.530
for what goes on here at Berkeley.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.690
This is why early warning is
a particularly effective thing

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.260
when we're talking about
really big earthquakes.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.660
You have a lot of time
within which to work.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.600
But the other thing to
notice here is the scale

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.150
over which the strong
shaking happens, okay.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.290
Here, when you have a 200 mile long fault,

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.740
it means you have 200 miles

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.840
that's actually producing the energy.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.330
And in Southern California, we
have almost 10 million people

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.860
that are gonna be receiving
extremely strong shaking,

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.020
intensity nine or 10, that
was the level of shaking

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.020
that we had only in the worst
shaken parts of the valley

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.380
in the Northridge Earthquake.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.590
It's really, you only had it, I think,

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.770
up in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.520
Maybe a little pocket in Santa Cruz

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.270
and a pocket in the Marina District

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.830
in the Loma Prieta Earthquake.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.730
Here, because the fault is so long,

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.410
we're gonna be putting it
through much larger territory

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.460
and it's territory on which people live.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.910
So when we look at what this
earthquake can do to us,

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.500
we get a really sobering picture.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.890
And I'm, at this point, I'm
basically just jumping over

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.380
all of the work that
went into analyzing this.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.550
But we started with
all of these geologists

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.450
understanding the shaking
and the landslides

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.670
that would be going through it.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.530
And we come up with a conclusion

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.590
that we've got about 300,000 buildings

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:09.270
will be moderately damaged,
defined as losing 10% the value

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.153
of the building.

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:16.070
And because of that building
damage, we are going to end up

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:19.810
with some substantial
other types of damage.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.420
One in 60 people having no place to live,

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.780
53,000 injuries bad enough
to go to the Emergency Room

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.230
at a time when we're probably losing

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.480
at least one third the
capacity of our hospitals

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.480
due to damage to the hospitals,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.100
1800 deaths.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.820
You see, it's not a very big number

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.510
compared to the rest it.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.960
It does unfortunately assume

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.890
that all of those 53,000 injuries

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.760
are getting the medical
care that they need.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.760
And if that gets really impaired,

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.853
we could be raising the number that way.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.320
It's also potentially not the worst thing

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.040
that's gonna happen to us

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.120
because when we looked at
what happens to our utilities,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.110
we ended up coming to the conclusion

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.530
that it was gonna take us six months

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.840
to get all of the pipes
in the ground fixed.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.010
Remember, I said those pipes
are one of the oldest things

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.060
that go on in a community.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.070
70% of the pipe in Southern California

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.460
is something called AC pipe,
which is a nice way of saying

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.880
asbestos concrete, but
people don't like the word,

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.020
put the word asbestos next to their water,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.180
so they don't usually use that term.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.520
But those are a particularly brittle type

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.810
and it was when Southern California

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.050
happened to be developed,
it was a very common way

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.180
of doing it.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.490
Because of that, such extensive
loss to our water systems

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.280
when we got all the
water people in the room,

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.940
you know, looking at the damage,

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.510
how many breaks did we
think we would have,

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.770
and working it out, and there was a moment

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.557
at which one of the guys
from the water company said,

00:18:48.557 --> 00:18:51.160
"But wait a minute, how much pipe is made

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.870
in the U.S. each year?

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.960
Aren't we all gonna be
competing with each other

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.307
for the same product?"

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.240
And that's where we end up
coming to the conclusion

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.130
it's gonna take us six
months to get it made,

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.700
get all of the pipes
repaired across the region,

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.953
even with them working
as hard as they can.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.340
And then the other part that we recognized

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.180
is the roll of fire following earthquake.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.683
People in San Francisco
know that pretty well.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.330
And there's actually a professor,

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.020
he used to be here a
Berkeley, Charlie Scawthorn,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.200
who's one of the, probably
the expert in the world

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.530
on fire following earthquake.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.570
And we engaged him as part of this process

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.410
to say what did we think the
role of fires was gonna be.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.430
And he came to the
conclusion by extrapolating

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.750
from the rate of fires in Northridge,

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.900
the much larger area, so many more people

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.740
receiving the strong
shaking, he said 1600 fires

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.040
large enough to call the Fire Department,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.210
1200 of which would
grow beyond the capacity

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.470
of one fire engine to respond.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.610
We don't have 1600 fire
engines in Southern California.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:01.550
We are going to be facing the probability

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.110
of fires getting out of control.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.740
As he went and tried to model
this, he ended up concluding

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.980
that the fire losses
actually double the losses

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:10.893
for the region.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.300
It was so extreme that
the state geologists said

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.790
you can't be right, this can't
be, we can't go with this,

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.910
it's just too much.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.720
And we ended up convening a
special group of Fire Chiefs.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.070
We got the L.A. Chief from Northridge,

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.420
the Oakland Chief from Loma Prieta,

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.740
a few other Fire Chiefs around the state,

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.060
to sit down with us and
go through this analysis.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.610
And they came to the
conclusion that, in fact,

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.330
we, if anything, it was an underestimate.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.790
So we see the potential for
fire following earthquake

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.300
as being the overwhelming issue

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.660
that we are going to be
dealing after the earthquake

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.313
and water problems compound it.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.990
We also ended up with
business disruption costs

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:58.550
that are potentially,
again, double the losses

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.150
because of the loss of business.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.440
And that's with a very minimal analysis

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.260
just on the impact of loss of
water and loss of electricity.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.660
And as we looked at what's
going on in the modern world,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.860
we struggled to quantify it,

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.550
but we recognize that telecommunications

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.630
has changed the nature of business.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.210
If we wanna keep our businesses open,

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.040
we have to have telecommunications.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.750
We have to have connection
to the internet.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.940
And we have actually been
creating new vulnerabilities

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.963
like at the time of Northridge,

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.000
our grocery stores had warehouses

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.600
in the inland empire.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.827
They, out in the Fontana
area, for those of you

00:21:36.827 --> 00:21:39.690
who know Southern California,
there were major warehouses

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.040
for the grocery store chains

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.580
from which they would deploy food

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.310
and go out to their
different stores each day.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.360
When we had the earthquake
and disrupting things,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.900
the food's there.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.060
Because of the internet,
we no longer have that.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.120
They do a just-in-time economy.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.100
They can decide each day
exactly how much needs

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.000
to be shipped into Southern California.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.700
It's not cost effective
to have those warehouses.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.930
They're all gone.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:08.060
All of our food now crosses the
fault to get to us each day.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.660
When the San Andreas moves
and disrupts the import

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.450
across those areas, when
those freeways are gone,

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:15.960
we don't have a stockpile of food

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.520
on our side of the fault anymore.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.730
So we're recognizing that communications

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:23.230
has changed the nature of
where our vulnerabilities are

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.703
and we're trying to
understand it in more detail.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.470
So I can show you the type of things

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.410
of how we've tried to
understand the impact

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.600
that these things happens.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.510
So let's look at damaged buildings.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.310
We know we're gonna be
having damaged buildings.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.480
What does that mean to the rest of us?

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.870
Well, we damage it from a variety of ways.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.280
We have shaking, we have fire,
and actually water damage.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.400
There were two billion dollars
of losses in Northridge,

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.363
that was out of 40,
came from water damage.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.980
Because of it, you have significant
short-term consequences.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.730
You lose life, your businesses close,

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.720
you don't have a place to live.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.070
How do you get rid of those problems?

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.690
Well, you need to take on
quite a few different actions.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.600
You need to get rid of the debris,

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.230
you need to be able to
have power to do that,

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.000
you need to have transportation
to get the debris out

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.510
and bring the new supplies in,

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.790
and you need people that
are able to be there

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.120
to work on those.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.470
If you don't get your buildings back,

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.410
in a long enough term,
what do you end up with?

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.020
You end up with significant
business disruption,

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.110
you have people that end
up giving up on the region

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.600
'cause they don't have an
adequate place to live,

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.010
and the other big thing,
and this was very important

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.950
in getting Los Angeles to
understand what the issue is,

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.770
is that each damaged building affects all

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.280
of the buildings around it.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.970
We often see after an earthquake

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.540
that a badly damaged building
will cause red tagging

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.800
of the adjacent buildings
because it's just too dangerous

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.920
to be in there during
the aftershock sequence.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.310
So what we have is, damage to one building

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.450
affects everything around it.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.960
And this is a really
important thing to understand

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.333
and to really work with
because it means that the,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.030
we have left the cost of
retrofitting buildings

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.400
solely to the owners.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.120
But the cost of not
retrofitting lands on all of us.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.120
And this is one of the sort
of societal aspects of it

00:24:18.853 --> 00:24:21.550
that we really need to grapple
with if we wanna move on

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.213
to a safer society.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.680
Let me also take a moment out of this

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.010
because this was a very important thing

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:30.660
of what we looked at.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.120
Many people don't know that
our building code does not try

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.720
to give us a building that you
can use after the earthquake.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.080
Absolutely modern building
designed to the current code

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.000
is trying to make sure that
you can crawl out alive.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.010
It's saying try and not collapse.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.993
But if it's a complete
financial loss, oh well.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.560
And even getting out alive, we, in fact,

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.700
you know there's, it's
not actually perfect.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.410
It's not guaranteeing it.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:03.800
It's saying let's have a 90%
chance of not collapsing.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.070
Well, if you say you have a
90% chance of not collapsing,

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.550
you're actually accepting a 10%

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.543
of our current modern buildings
collapsing in the shaking.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.760
That's what it actually means.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.370
Once you aren't looking
at an individual building,

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.973
but you're looking at
a group of buildings.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.420
And in addition to collapsing,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.000
there's also impairment
of buildings, right?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.410
A building may not damage anybody,

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.850
but it's gonna be red
tagged and you can't use it.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.880
Yellow tag meaning you
only get limited use,

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.080
you're not going in during the

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.400
immediate aftershock sequence.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.630
If you look at the history in California,

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.480
what we see is that on average

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.930
for every collapsed building,
we've had 13 red tags.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.200
And for every red tag, 3.8 yellow tags.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.020
This is data from
Northridge and Loma Prieta.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:59.010
63 impaired buildings for each collapse.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.210
By comparison, the Napa
Earthquake that just happened

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:05.780
had a similar level, 57
impaired buildings per collapse.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.580
So what does this mean if we
have a really big earthquake?

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.680
Well, it's not a 10% collapse
rate because that's only

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.820
in the strongest shaking
and not everywhere

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.660
gets the strongest shaking, but Dr. Porter

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:21.550
from Colorado took the
distribution of shaking

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.140
in the ShakeOut Earthquake and compared it

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.720
against the design criteria and estimates

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.430
that we're talking about
a 0.8% collapse rate

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.360
for modern buildings.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.500
Well, when we now put
that across the scale

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.303
of Southern California, if we
scale up with those red tags,

00:26:39.303 --> 00:26:42.550
0.8% collapse rate means
10% of our buildings,

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.860
new buildings, red tagged

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:49.290
and another almost 40% yellow
tagged and impaired use.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.283
How do we keep our businesses
going in this situation?

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.930
And as a really concrete example of this,

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:00.536
this is a picture of the city
of Christchurch, New Zealand.

00:27:00.536 --> 00:27:02.117
In 2011, so this--

00:27:02.117 --> 00:27:07.117
It's a city of about 400,000
people, modern skyline.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.800
In 2011, they had an earthquake.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.900
It's, in fact, only a magnitude 6.3.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.010
It was, in fact, an aftershock to a seven

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.440
that had been out of town,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.080
but the 6.3 was right
under the downtown area.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.800
This picture, amazing picture,

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.133
taken during the earthquake itself.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.770
The building code in New
Zealand is like ours.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:30.573
It's a life safety code.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.730
And it said make sure
you can crawl out alive

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:35.563
and it worked.

00:27:35.563 --> 00:27:38.180
This is essentially their
designed earthquake.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.820
People, there were
really only two buildings

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.790
that caused a significant loss of life

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.570
in the modern buildings.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.440
One of them was, in
fact, an older building.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.100
One of them should not have
been allowed to be built.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.800
They see what the problems were.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.050
Basically, the code worked
as it was supposed to.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.650
Only 185 people died
in those two buildings.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.570
1800 buildings had to be torn down

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.120
over the next several years.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.560
They didn't kill people.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.460
They met the code objective.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.570
But they were a total financial loss.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.893
And this is what
Christchurch looks like now.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.360
They lost their downtown
because of the same code

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.150
that we've said is enough for us.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:24.150
Take this picture, imagine
this in Los Angeles, okay.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.830
What will it be like
when this is what happens

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.243
to our downtown?

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.850
Or to Oakland, or to San Francisco?

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.280
This is the way we have
chosen to build our cities.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.610
And we said it's not worth the extra money

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.940
to make them be usable.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.510
And, you know, sometimes,
we're thinking it's maybe

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.170
only a couple percent
increase in the total cost

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.673
of a project to instead of having this,

00:28:49.673 --> 00:28:51.893
have a building you can use afterwards.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:58.380
And this may be saying life safety,

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.880
but you know, I went to New
Zealand actually last month.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.310
They asked me to come down and tell them

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.430
about the L.A. Project.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.057
And in the discussions
there, somebody said to me,

00:29:08.057 --> 00:29:12.210
"You can't treat life safety
as what just what happens

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:13.660
in the earthquake.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.090
My brother died in the
year after the earthquake

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.460
because it was so bad, he just gave up.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.210
My cousin killed himself in
the year after the earthquake

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.680
because he couldn't handle
the financial losses

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.860
that he was facing.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.470
Life safety isn't just what
happens in the earthquake."

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.550
So, this is the picture I've
been taking to Los Angeles

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.500
and saying, "Is this
the city we want to have

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.777
after the earthquake?"

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.670
For all the problems of the buildings,

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.560
the water is probably a bigger one.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.560
If we take the same sort of analysis,

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.200
what is it gonna be like to
be needing to get your water

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.000
by buckets for weeks after the earthquake?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.110
Another person in New Zealand said to me

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.880
his house had been fine, he really was one

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.890
of the lucky ones.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:03.020
He said, "I didn't know
how much water it takes

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.190
just to live.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.650
I'm spending two hours a
day getting enough water

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.597
for my family to function."

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.970
'Cause when you look at what happens

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.610
to your damaged water
supply, it can happen

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.610
for a variety of reasons.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.700
You break the pipes with the shaking.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.350
You could offset the water
coming into the region

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:27.680
through fault offset, and
chemical accidents can cause

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.203
a lot of contamination.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.530
Chemical accidents is a
sort of odd way of saying it

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:36.720
because one of the big issues
they've seen in Christchurch,

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.003
all those broken water pipes
run next to broken sewer pipes.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.583
Yeah, that's enough.

00:30:42.583 --> 00:30:44.833
(laughter)

00:30:44.833 --> 00:30:46.003
So, what happens?

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.260
You've obviously got the
life loss, loss of shelter,

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.410
you can't run your businesses,
they do extra damage

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.760
to the buildings, and it
really gets in the way

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.010
of the medical response.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.140
You need clean water to have a hospital.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.900
To get it going again, you
need a lot of these resources

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.270
that are already impaired.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.470
You have to have transportation.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.030
The purification systems, you know,

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.560
they have some portable systems.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.527
Like the American
Waterworks Association said,

00:31:14.527 --> 00:31:15.410
"We got this covered.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:16.270
We have portable systems.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.560
We'll bring them in."

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.973
We have four of them in the country.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.840
You got the scale of this.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.190
There's no way it's gonna be working.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.790
And of course, you need a
lot of manpower to do it.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.920
If you go for a long time without water,

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.320
you end up with really big consequences.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.463
You cannot reopen most
businesses without water.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.540
Beauty salon, a
restaurant, most businesses

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.680
can't open without water.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.430
And then there's the personal issues

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.933
that you face as well.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.820
How many of you would
be willing to stay here

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.650
when you haven't had a shower in a month?

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.860
And what are the public
health consequences

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.610
of nobody having a shower in a month?

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:01.120
And what you see is you end up,

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.670
this is the one way you're
most likely end up losing

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.230
your population for a region.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.620
If we go in and look in
Los Angeles, in particular,

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.700
we have a couple of specific issues.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.070
This is the Elizabeth Lake Tunnel.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:18.020
This is the original aqueduct,
the Los Angeles aqueduct,

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.720
as in Mulholland and, you
know, the Chinatown movie,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:25.720
the water coming in from the
Owens Valley to Los Angeles.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.930
This tunnel was built in 1908

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.290
and it crosses the San Andreas Fault.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.390
This is where it crosses the fault.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:39.690
Nine foot wide wooden tunnel
and we expect the fault offset

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:44.240
to be about 15 feet and
this aqueduct is going to be

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.510
completely gone after the earthquake.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.080
There are three other
aqueducts bringing in water

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.460
to Californ, into Southern California

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.330
and the Water Districts have said

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.640
we don't have to worry about this.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.510
We have four aqueducts.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.010
So we lose one in an earthquake.

00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:59.560
We've got three others.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:04.220
And we were like, um, you do
know that a 200 mile long fault

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.193
breaks all of them.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.070
The most likely earthquake
is going to take them all out

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.483
and they haven't been addressing this.

00:33:12.923 --> 00:33:15.770
The other issue that we have, though,

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.350
is if you, we look back at
the Christchurch earthquake

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:22.300
and what happened with them
with their water system.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.280
We discovered, I mean, there's,
they in general have pipes

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.910
like we do that wide spread
breakages during the earthquake.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.430
They also have an experiment
with two and a half kilometers

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:37.200
of a type of polyethylene
pipe and none of it broke

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.570
in the earthquake.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.600
There's also a type of
pipe being created in Japan

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.933
that does very well in a earthquake.

00:33:42.933 --> 00:33:47.690
This is called earthquake
resistant ductile iron pipes

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.130
and Professor Tom O'Rourke at Cornell

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:51.750
has been doing a lot of research on this,

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.940
has been working with
the city of Los Angeles.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.680
And we are now recognizing that we need

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.380
to shift out our pipes and
try and make them be ones

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.960
that won't break in an earthquake.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.410
Let me finish this just looking
at the same sort of thing

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.023
by looking at communication networks.

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.180
Again, we have damage
from cellphone towers.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.580
We've separate the fiber.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.740
Phone lines get overloaded.

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:20.870
With they get broken
for a variety of reasons

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.650
between the shaking and the fault offset.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.540
For instance, two thirds of
the internet connectivity

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.350
for Southern California
to the rest of the world

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:33.230
crosses the San Andreas
Fault in fiber optic cables.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.010
It would be extremely easy
to make those resilient

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.770
to fault offset because fiber optic,

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:41.610
you can just coil up extra
wire and you move the fault

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.130
and it now just gets a bit longer.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.050
Fiber optic you could do
that, but it hasn't happened

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.460
up until now.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.280
So again, it's a place
where there's a lot of ways

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.343
in which we can lose our connectivity.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:56.400
It's very difficult to
have much of life anymore

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.200
without communications.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.890
Again, we need the manpower
and the transportation

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:02.720
to be able to bring it together.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.620
And the longterm consequences
are both business disruption,

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.640
but also emotional hardship.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.720
We have a society that does not accept

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.670
not communicating anymore.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:15.520
What we saw in Sendai, Japan,

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.280
when they had the magnitude nine in 2011,

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.060
they lost their
electricity, people stayed.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.750
After 48 hours, they lost the backup power

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.920
to their cell networks and
all the cellphone's out

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.640
and that's when they started seeing

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.340
large numbers of people getting
up and leaving the region.

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.330
If they couldn't communicate,
it was cold, it was wet,

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.500
and they, you know, no lights,

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.370
but they couldn't talk to anybody,

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.000
that ended up being the final straw.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.160
And here in Southern, in
California, we don't have 48 hours

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.240
of backup power.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.990
Our communities have not been willing

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.640
to have backup generators up
at all the cellphone towers.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.960
So we, in general, have about
four hours of backup power,

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.440
after which we lose our cellphone towers.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.490
And when we really look, the
other thing that's coming in

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:06.020
is just about every system we have now

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.783
depends on internet functioning.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:11.830
My guess, you know, I'm
sure the internet's working

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:13.400
after the earthquake.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.150
The problem will be whether
or not we can connect to it.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.290
And there's a lot of these systems

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:19.940
that if they can't connect,

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.930
they aren't going to be operational.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:25.070
And it's hard, again, to keep
modern life going at this.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.760
So what's at stake in all of this?

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.440
The other part of this
is really understanding

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.820
that the core issue is talking about

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.170
our economic dependence.

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:39.170
So if you look at a region, you
expect the economic activity

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.110
to be growing with time.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.270
If you don't, it's called a recession.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.820
During an earthquake, you lose assets.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.160
Things get broken, you
know, things are destroyed,

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.680
but you also lose business.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.640
Without water, without power,
businesses stop functioning.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.560
You stop creating economic wealth.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.060
What we are trying to do
is recover quickly enough

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.300
that we get back to where we were.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.260
Within a year or two is
considered really pretty good.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.570
And in fact, we have seen situations,

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.900
if there's enough money
coming in after the event,

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.090
if people have insurance,
if FEMA is active,

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.230
really the situation after Northridge,

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:20.150
we saw the economic recovering
going really quickly.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:23.210
People hired contractors,
they hired subcontractors.

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.740
We were really back up
within about two years

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.120
from where we had been.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.320
It doesn't have to happen that way.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.840
You can have a response,
if the response is delayed

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.090
and things become too difficult
and you lose population

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.270
and people move out, then
you end up with a situation

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:43.230
where you really can't get that
economic engine going again.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.260
Or if you don't have assets coming in.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.620
You know, if we have,
FEMA doesn't write checks

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.890
the day of the disaster
anymore like they did in 1994

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.930
and instead of having
40% insurance coverage,

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:56.160
we now have about 10% insurance coverage.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.490
Who's gonna be able to
pay to repair their house?

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:00.710
How do we get things moving again?

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.340
And when you look at the
difference in the areas

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.490
under the curve, you can see

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.720
that having that delayed
economic response can be

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.720
a much larger economic impact
than the disaster itself.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.820
As an example of this, we
were able to get the data

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.680
for New Orleans.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.290
Here's data comparing
the economic, the GDP,

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:28.587
of Nashville and New
Orleans from 2002 to 2012

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.850
and you can see that before
the hurricane hit in 2005,

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:36.820
causing 80 billion dollars in losses,

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.370
Nashville was actually a bit
smaller than New Orleans.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:41.280
They're comparable though.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.380
They're similar size
cities in a similar area.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.900
When you look then for
the next seven years,

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.500
the total losses by
saying what's, you know,

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.300
that New Orleans should have at least

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.300
had the GDP of Nashville.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.640
You end up estimating 105
billion dollars in losses

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.320
in just those seven years
and we're continuing to lose

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.670
at about 15 billion dollars a year.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.310
The longterm, you know, after a decade,

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:09.010
the economy is maybe 20%
below what it would have been

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:11.420
if the hurricane hadn't happened.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.580
So this is what we're
worried about in California,

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.190
the level of disruption that we will face.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.960
How do people stay when this is going on?

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.850
I also found in Los Angeles,
it was really useful

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:25.650
to consider what happened
in San Francisco.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:28.380
Here's data from 1906.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.470
1905, San Francisco was
five times the population

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.970
of Los Angeles.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.570
And, you know, it was the
economic center of California.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:41.000
Everything went through San Francisco.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.680
The decade after 1906 is
the largest growth decade

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.710
in the history of Los Angeles.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:50.080
People gave up on San
Francisco and went south.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.930
By a decade later, and there's
of course new population

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.700
coming into California,
but they didn't come

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:56.730
to San Francisco.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.620
They came to Southern California.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.530
And within a decade, Los Angeles is bigger

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.450
than San Francisco and of course now,

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.510
it's about five times the
size of San Francisco.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.360
So, you know, that's just an anecdote,

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.150
but this is the type of
thing we're looking at.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.760
And in fact, take the other
end of the population data,

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.490
we actually saw the only times,

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:18.850
there's only four years in
the history of Los Angeles

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:23.250
that the population's
gone down, 1971 and 1972,

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.960
which were right after the
'71 San Fernando Earthquake

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.070
and 1994 and '95, right after Northridge.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.763
The only times we've ever lost population.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.690
So how do you try and make them resilient?

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.550
We defined a set of
critical infrastructure

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:42.790
and said that these need
to function well enough

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:44.390
to keep the system going.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.750
We're not trying to make them perfect.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.210
We're trying to get them good enough.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:50.430
Because from this critical set,

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:54.083
we developed a set of
systems that define our life.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:59.120
And all of these are part
what makes a society work.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.580
We can cope with a little bit of loss.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.050
For instance, if we lose some buildings,

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.430
but we still have the internet,

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:07.990
we have people that can telecommute.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:09.770
And even though their building may be out,

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.140
that doesn't mean that that business

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.070
is completely shut down.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:17.270
Or if we lose water, but we
still have transportation,

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:22.270
we can bring in water to drink,
which will work for a while.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.090
And then so these are the
areas that we're looking at

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:28.040
and then we also, of course,
have sort of these wildcards

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.270
of internet and cell towers
where we aren't completely sure

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.560
of how the things play out.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.810
So this is how we put together a picture

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:39.670
of what the disaster could do to us.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.450
And by putting it
together in this framework

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:43.613
and saying this isn't just about

00:41:43.613 --> 00:41:46.210
will this fault move or not, it's rather,

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:49.120
eventually the fault will
move and this is what's going

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.390
to be happening to our society.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:54.500
We've been able to get
engagement in Southern California

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.023
for moving forward.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.020
As Mary said, we create, I
worked with the Mayor's Office.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:04.230
We created a Resilience By Design Program.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:08.100
Out of this, we had recommendations
for how to move forward,

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.910
a series of proposals for
retrofitting the different types

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:13.840
of bad buildings that we have.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.930
And as of last Friday,
all of the mandatory

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.490
retrofit ordinances were passed

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:23.070
and the voluntary ratings
system, it's voluntary,

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.070
but the city is in the process

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:27.370
of rating all of its own buildings,

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.670
will be disclosing that
information to the public

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.600
to try and get the discussion going

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.670
about what does it mean to
have a good or a bad building.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:39.720
We know which buildings are
most likely to fall down.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.980
Wouldn't everybody like
to have that information?

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.470
Well, maybe the building owners

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:45.110
don't particularly want
people to be having

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:49.480
all that information,
but it's better, yeah.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.313
I'm a scientist.

00:42:50.313 --> 00:42:51.830
I think knowledge is always better.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.120
We've discovered that, in
fact, the population really,

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.180
in general, does want to
know and the city is trying

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:01.270
to promote this approach by
going with this rating system

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:03.320
and disclosing all the information.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.200
There's also a wide variety of proposals

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.340
that have been put in to
fortify the water system.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.173
Here are these--

00:43:09.173 --> 00:43:10.827
This is actually the San Andreas Fault

00:43:10.827 --> 00:43:12.370
and the California Aqueduct.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:13.280
It's sort of astonishing.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.430
It actually runs down
the fault for a ways.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:20.770
So proposals to how to strengthen
the aqueduct crossings,

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:24.550
improve the pipe system, and the last one,

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:26.460
which is potentially
the most important one

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.980
and maybe isn't obvious, where I say

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.280
a Resilience By Design Program.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.840
From here on out, there's now
a Resilience By Design Program

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.740
at the Department of Water and Power

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.580
and every project they
undertake is being evaluated

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.983
for the impact on our seismic resilience.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.760
Moving forward, and
then telecommunications.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.600
In some ways, we discover the
problems weren't really as bad

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.860
as they might have been.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.610
But there are some very big things.

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:56.080
One of them is our cellphone towers.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.040
50% are on buildings and
generally our older buildings

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.810
more likely to come down.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:03.150
So, but we do have free standing towers

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:05.750
and we are requiring
now that those be built

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.330
to a life safety standard, not just a,

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.337
I mean a functionality standard,

00:44:10.337 --> 00:44:12.020
and not just a life safety standard.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.530
Right now, cellphone
towers are life safety.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.440
Make sure you can crawl out alive.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.460
Who do they think's living
in cellphone towers?

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.720
I mean, it's sort of a bizarre concept.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.420
And so we're saying no, they actually,

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.083
we're gonna be aiming towards
usability of the towers.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:31.170
And from this, we're hoping
to really move forward.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.373
The city of Los Angeles
has adopted all of these.

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:38.190
I actually, and I would have
been happy if half of it

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.023
had made it through.

00:44:39.023 --> 00:44:41.210
The fact that all of them
seem to be going forward,

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:44.450
to me, is incredibly astonishing.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.820
And I think it's gonna make a difference.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:50.570
We're also seeing, the Mayor's
really been reaching out

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.000
to the other cities.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.690
I have them coming to me as well.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:57.320
We are looking at, there's
a dozen other cities

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:00.160
that have asked about
getting more information

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.790
to move towards some of
the ordinances themselves.

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:07.180
I thought I would end this
by just teasing you a bit.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.300
I couldn't give you the full thing yet,

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.200
but we're starting to do
the same thing for up here.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.380
We're creating The Haywired Scenario

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.770
because of the impact of the Hayward Fault

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.173
on the digital economy.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:23.190
And it's going to be released
in April of this year.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.210
So again, the same sort of pictures.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:26.840
You know that you've got the fault,

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.200
but what does that mean
in terms of the shaking

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.540
that you're actually
going to be receiving.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.203
And the scary thing,
this scale is actually,

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:40.800
I believe it's in, it's
accelerations in the,

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.650
you know, it's twice the force
of gravity showing up here

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:44.963
in the Berkeley area.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.910
And in the process, we're trying to create

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:51.470
a lot of the same sort of
information that I just showed you

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.160
for Los Angeles.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.020
We're also trying to
expand in a couple of ways.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.950
One of the ways is to try and focus more

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:59.550
on some of the issues
raised by aftershocks.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.490
So just what we saw in Christchurch,

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:04.010
the ongoing sequence of earthquakes

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.110
caused a whole other set of problems.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:09.030
So we're creating a synthetic
aftershock sequence.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:11.350
That's all, again, it's a plausible,

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:12.630
sure it isn't gonna be different,

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:15.970
but part of the plausible aftershock

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:19.090
is plenty of aftershocks on other faults.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.340
That's a thing that we tend to forget

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:24.400
is that most aftershocks are
off the ends of the faults,

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.340
sometimes they're on different faults.

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:31.340
So we created a
statistically viable sequence

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.130
that matches all of the
characteristics that we see

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:36.630
and it's a part of the planning

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.330
that could be able to be used,
will be focused on that area.

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.650
We're also getting modeling
from Charlie Scawthorn

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:43.900
about fire following earthquake.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.624
And I thought it looked bad in L.A.

00:46:45.624 --> 00:46:46.750
Whoo!

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:48.720
This is really a big issue.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.030
And San Francisco, of course,

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.130
has an alternative fire fighting system.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:56.460
Looking at developing more of
the capacity in the East Bay

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.470
is a really big piece of this.

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.670
And just one other sort
of piece of information

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:04.088
to give you this sort of idea
of the things we're doing.

00:47:04.088 --> 00:47:07.730
25,000 people trapped in 5,000 elevators.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:10.970
So again, get that earthquake
early warning in there

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:12.430
and get those elevators stopped

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.860
before the earthquake
shaking comes through.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.660
There's 25,000 people that
are not gonna be spending

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.400
a couple of days trapped
in a little metal box

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.310
wondering what's going on.

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:24.807
So, thank you.

00:47:24.807 --> 00:47:27.057
(applause)

00:47:31.191 --> 00:47:32.024
- [Audience Member] Hello.

00:47:32.024 --> 00:47:33.080
- Hi.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.040
- [Audience Member] Hi, thank you so much.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.920
This is fantastic.
- Thank you.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.390
- [Audience Member] I'm a
volunteer with city of Berkeley

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:39.990
for Emergency Preparedness.

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.420
I do a lot of this stuff.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.790
I recently visited Christchurch

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:46.870
and I was just really intensely
moved by seeing the downtown

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:50.570
as I imagine you were four
years after the earthquake.

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:52.210
Still abandoned buildings.

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:55.323
You can still see the search
and rescue marks on buildings.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.140
What I learned speaking
with the City Planner

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.970
in Christchurch was I learned about

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:04.720
the residential red zones
where they actually purchased

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.420
and demolished 8,000
homes in what he called

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.590
a strategic retreat
that they will not allow

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.900
any structures to be
built on that land again.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.550
And I'm curious if that's
something that anyone in,

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.070
you know, California talks
about or thinks about?

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:23.010
- Okay, the red zones in Christchurch are,

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:24.700
they have a compounded problem.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.820
They had extensive liquefaction

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.650
that came with the earthquake
so it was one of the reasons

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:33.790
that there's that much
damage in spite of the size.

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:37.300
But it also literally
sank the area, all right.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.014
So much material came out
through the liquefaction

00:48:40.014 --> 00:48:42.970
that they then had to cart
away, the elevation went down

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:47.500
and the regulations in New
Zealand do not allow building

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.560
within the 50 year floodplain.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:53.350
And by sinking, they actually
moved whole neighborhoods

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.350
down into the 50 year floodplain.

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:58.660
And they ended up making the
decision to buy people out,

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:02.283
keep them out of there, and
move onto the other regions.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.620
It's unlikely that we're gonna end up

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.260
in a similar situation.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:10.610
Number one, liquefaction at that scale

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.990
requires a very high water table and the--

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:15.310
It requires rain.

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:19.000
The good part of a drought
is it really reduces

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.561
the risk of liquefaction.

00:49:20.561 --> 00:49:22.710
(laughter)

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:27.710
And so we don't really have a
comparable situation to that.

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:31.500
And it becomes a very difficult question,

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.400
what is an appropriate level
at which to keep people out?

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.903
And the decision has
been made in California,

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:41.700
the logic makes sense to me to say,

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.100
you can't say stay away from the faults

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.060
or otherwise we move out, right?

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:49.290
There are over 100 faults in
the L.A. metropolitan area.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.510
Everybody's within five
miles of an active fault.

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:54.920
So, you gotta accept
that you're near that.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.390
What you can do is say
don't build right across

00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:58.940
the active trace of the fault

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.610
and have your building ripped apart.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:03.550
And that's what we call
the Alquist-Priolo Act.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:07.740
The problem is is that really
is only about being exactly

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:08.720
on the trace.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.840
And so the way the law works
is you say if you're near,

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.827
you've gotta go in and dig and
figure out where the fault is

00:50:13.827 --> 00:50:16.100
and make sure you don't stay on it.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.040
The problem with the
implementation of that is

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.060
you can hire a geologist
to tell you where it is.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.930
You don't like his
result, you throw it away

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:25.610
and tell him to go away
because you signed,

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:27.470
he signed a nondisclosure
agreement with you

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:28.303
when you did it.

00:50:28.303 --> 00:50:29.390
And you can then submit it.

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:32.260
Find another geologist to
give you a different answer.

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.910
Not that that happens all
the time, but the situ--

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:36.743
We allow it.

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:42.180
And if it were up to me, I
would keep our current situation

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:45.350
in California saying only
across the active trace

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.480
that we actually ban construction,

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:51.370
but I'd say that anytime a
registered geologist is hired

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:54.870
to do a report, it cannot be
under a nondisclosure agreement

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:58.760
and the results of the report,
as terms of his registration,

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.280
get given to the State
Geologist and maintained

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.460
in a database.

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.900
We, it's hap--

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.360
We have a major issue with landslides

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.370
where again, the same thing
happens and we've ended up

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:12.180
with major damage in landslide regions

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.990
and it turns out there had been a report

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:17.820
saying this is landslides prone
that had been thrown away.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:21.103
So that would be the one
modification I'd like to make.

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:22.899
Yeah.

00:51:22.899 --> 00:51:23.732
(clapping)

00:51:23.732 --> 00:51:24.580
(laughs)

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.293
- [Audience Member] Thank you, Dr. Jones.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.200
We moved here from 50 miles
north of New York City

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.503
and had the pleasure of living
through Superstorm Sandy.

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:39.270
And we were on well and
septic and so for a week,

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:42.830
we had not only no electricity,
but no heat, no water,

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:45.310
no, and no cell towers.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.310
- Right.
- Nothing.

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.940
There were two or three
problems which I'd like

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:55.520
to ask you to address in further detail.

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.050
One is that, this was wind forces.

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:00.210
They're different forces,
- Right.

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:01.360
- [Audience Member]
but I think it might be

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:02.780
the same problem.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.960
About 25% of the power poles just cracked.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.810
So the streets were full of live wires

00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:12.510
until NYSEG and the utilities got around

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:14.633
to turning off the electricity,

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:17.100
which is a hazard to everybody.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.470
That also meant people weren't driving.

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.970
There was so much damage
everywhere it took time

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:24.570
for the crews to get to the
different neighborhoods.

00:52:25.903 --> 00:52:28.163
So transportation, maybe.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:34.890
Second, what bothered us coming
here is the issue of fire.

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:38.940
And we had a power outage and
people were lighting candles

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.390
and I've swapped out all my candles

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:44.830
for those windup flashlights
because if they don't--

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:47.800
We're really dependent on the utilities

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.710
to have things so that they turn off.

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:54.650
I'm more scared of gas
even then electricity.

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:57.800
If we have gas streaming out,
somebody lights a candle,

00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.593
poof, the whole neighborhood goes.

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:04.990
So could you please speak
to plans utilities have

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:08.570
to turn things off, you know, immediately.

00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:12.170
And secondly, you kind
of had to go quickly

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:14.990
for time reasons over fire control.

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:16.610
- Right.
- But we live in

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:21.200
such a congested area here
in Berkeley, in many places.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.600
Can you speak to Berkeley's
Fire Department, thank you.

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.750
- So fires and utilities, yes you got it.

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:28.350
That's where we've got problems.

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:33.230
One thing I'll just say and
I didn't say this earlier,

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:34.500
you know, you look at
where we have problems

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.800
in Southern California, it's
water, fire, and healthcare.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.980
It's like where do we have
trouble on a normal basis?

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:41.930
Fire, water, and healthcare.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:44.330
And so, you know, the
failures in a disaster

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:47.130
happen in the parts of the
system that are already weak.

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:52.330
In terms of utilities, one of the reasons

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:56.600
for doing these scenarios
is to engage the utilities

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.810
in a discussion.

00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:00.310
By asking them to come
in, and we didn't say,

00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:01.820
here's what the problem
is you're gonna have.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.153
We said, here's the shaking.

00:54:03.153 --> 00:54:05.270
Tell us what the problem is.

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:08.630
So we got them to think
it through and understand

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:10.630
what the vulnerabilities were.

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:13.400
And we scared them and they
went back to their companies

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.960
and we're starting a process.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.800
I'm not gonna say it isn't a big problem.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.710
It is very much a big problem.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:23.340
But I believe that this
scenario process has

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:26.610
advanced the discussion
and one of the things

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:29.127
that's come out of it,
took a while to happen,

00:54:29.127 --> 00:54:31.850
and the Mayor's process
has implemented it,

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:34.470
or gives us a bit of a prod
in Southern California.

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:37.590
We actually now have a
consortium of utilities

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:39.170
that are looking together

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:41.170
at where the shared vulnerabilities are.

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:45.600
I wish, I mean it's,
it tends to be focused

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:49.090
on how to respond and I
tend to go wait a minute,

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:51.230
why don't you prevent the
loss in the first place.

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:53.890
Like put valves when you have a gas pipe

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:56.070
crossing an active
fault so you turn it off

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.120
when you set up the early warning system.

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.720
I think that whole process takes time.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.720
Right now, I'm not, we're
not in a great place,

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.920
but I do see the discussion happening

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.170
and that part is extremely encouraging.

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:12.310
Fire following earthquake, you're right.

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:14.390
It becomes the scariest part.

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:16.840
When we modeled it for
the Southern San Andreas,

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.760
we doubled the losses with the fires

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:23.230
and we defined it as not
having Santa Ana winds.

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:26.060
I don't get to do that for
the real earthquake, right?

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.510
If we actually have Santa Ana winds,

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.370
I don't think we keep the fires in control

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:32.400
and that becomes the
real doomsday scenario.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.440
So you're right about that.

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.490
What we are hoping,
especially with Haywired,

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:41.550
is to get, well, I'm getting
it going in Los Angeles

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:42.900
through this process.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.590
We've been working with
the Fire Department.

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:47.270
One of the Mayor's recommendations

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:50.360
and it's now moving forward
is that the Fire Department

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:53.120
and the Water Department have to agree

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.080
on what they need to do.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.690
And, one, what, you know, city
departments tend not to talk

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:03.690
to each other so making this
requirement has been a bit

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:05.890
of an adjustment, but
they're moving forward

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:08.620
and I think that requiring that

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:11.510
was probably the most
important thing we did.

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:14.660
Here in the Bay area, you've
again, got this issue.

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:16.270
You've got all these
different communities.

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:19.690
You've got different systems in place.

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:22.200
In Haywired, we are very much focusing

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.660
on the fire following earthquake
for all of these reasons.

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:29.150
And, I mean, and Professor
Scowthorn's been working on this

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:30.470
for quite a while.

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:33.900
I think that we're getting
traction on the problem.

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.410
Again, not to say it's solved in any way,

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:39.400
but I hope it's moving forward.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.420
Yeah.

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.150
- [Audience Member] I'm
very excited about the fact

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:45.870
that L.A. is actually starting
to do something about this.

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:48.115
It hasn't been my
favorite city, of course.

00:56:48.115 --> 00:56:49.560
I'm in Northern California.

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.960
But I'm a Bay area person.

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.220
I'd like to know if there's
a way that, you know,

00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:57.680
an individual can impact it.

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.740
I work with scientists and I'm very aware

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:04.270
that their primary
effort is not political.

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:08.190
And, in fact, they would rather
not deal with these things,

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:09.770
as most of us would not.

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:11.920
I know the Facilities
Manager's Association

00:57:13.698 --> 00:57:15.520
is very concerned about prevention

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:20.810
both for fire and for water and gas.

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:25.810
So the public/private partnership
seems really important.

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:29.350
I'm kinda overwhelmed with
the thought of how do I

00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:34.350
as an individual begin
to make some inroads here

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:36.640
because I don't even know at what level.

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.730
Is it regional, do I
go to my city council?

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:41.380
You know, I'm just overwhelmed.

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.700
I, any suggestions are fine.

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.730
- Okay, yeah, and I'm
actually thinking, you know,

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:47.170
so tomorrow, I'm talking about

00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:50.560
science communication
challenges and why it's so hard

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.110
for scientists to do
this 'cause we just talk

00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:54.023
in different ways.

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:57.739
And I, one of the points
that would be there

00:57:57.739 --> 00:57:59.630
is we're never supposed
to give the problem

00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:02.000
without the solution and
I sort of did that today.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.210
So, I'm sorry about that.

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:04.043
You're right.

00:58:04.043 --> 00:58:05.890
So what can you do as an individual?

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:07.970
There's a range of things that can go on.

00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:12.680
Part of it is getting your
local government to take action.

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.670
I will say, I mean, I'm not
as familiar with what goes on

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:16.633
in the Bay area.

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.747
I went to the Mayor of Los Angeles saying,

00:58:19.747 --> 00:58:21.450
"Look at everything San Francisco's doing.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:22.890
Why can't we be there?"

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:25.750
So in many senses, there's
a lot of what's going on

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:27.670
in the Bay area that's very encouraging.

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:29.780
And we tried to be learning from it.

00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:32.550
All of the regulations we
put in about the SAFRR story,

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:35.073
we just adopted from what
San Francisco had done.

00:58:35.923 --> 00:58:38.390
So we've now done the
concrete one and worked out

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:40.900
that ordinance and I
think they're looking at

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.973
how to learn from what we did.

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:47.000
So, there is, you know, political support

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.823
for doing this is important.

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:52.430
The other aspect though is there are,

00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:55.550
there's a lot that you
can do as an individual.

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:59.460
And there's a group called the
Earthquake Country Alliance

00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:01.490
that actually started the ShakeOut.

00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:04.093
So when we first did the scenario,

00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:06.710
we recognized that there
was all these things

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:08.900
that really could make a
difference among individuals.

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:11.830
We said, let's do, let's get
that information to people.

00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:13.120
We did the first ShakeOut Drill.

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:15.740
It was supposed to be a one-time-only.

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.350
But you get five million
people to do something

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:19.080
and people take notice
and the state wanted

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.553
to take it statewide.

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:23.890
The group of people that worked with me

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:24.980
to create the first ShakeOut

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:26.380
was the Earthquake Country Alliance.

00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.950
That ended up becoming
a bigger organization.

00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:32.730
There is a Northern
California Chapter of it.

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:33.570
I think it's just called

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.440
the Earthquake Country Alliance here.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:36.273
- [Audience Member] The Bay area.

00:59:36.273 --> 00:59:37.830
- The Bay Area Earthquake
Country Alliance.

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:39.140
Okay.

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.910
And Peggy, right behind us, might be able

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.250
to give you more information.

00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:46.190
So you can become involved
as an individual on that.

00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:49.560
And then the other piece
that I feel like I'm sort of

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.890
it's the next challenge for me.

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:53.050
Community resilience.

00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:56.260
How do you get community
organizations to care about this

00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:57.540
and move forward?

00:59:57.540 --> 00:59:59.700
And that's a, it's a difficult problem,

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.913
but I think it's where a
lot of the strength will be.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:08.040
Communities recover because
people wanna stay here.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.960
So we need to make this, you know,

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.980
you need to make your home a place

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:15.800
that is worth staying through
the problems (laughs).

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.640
And I think that that's where
one of the really big pieces

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.830
are gonna happen.

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:22.970
There was research in New Orleans.

01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:24.530
The communities, the neighborhoods

01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:27.110
that have recovered the
best, the single most

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:29.020
best defining issue was

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.480
that they did a Mardi
Gras float each year.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.870
- [Audience Member] Yes,
I'd been reading about that,

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:36.280
that community spirit and, in fact,

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.540
almost in spite of the
government assistance

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.060
in some cases.
- In New Orleans, definitely.

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:44.760
You know, that was a pretty
dysfunctional political system.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.890
But they, you know, so
having a reason to come back.

01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:51.070
There's also an organization
around doing the floats.

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:54.780
Those crews would know how
to, you know, get resources,

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.920
and arrange for volunteers,
and arrange for food,

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.700
and whatever, so they were more effective

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.333
at managing their neighborhood.

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:03.350
But they also had a community spirit

01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:04.300
that made them wanna be here.

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.330
- [Audience Member]
You've given me a couple

01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:08.590
of really good suggestions already.

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:13.260
And I really, I'm so delighted to see that

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.740
you set up a scenario which is,

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.870
even though you said it's negative,

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:20.680
it's very positive, in
fact, because it sets it out

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.130
and it looks to okay, these are the area

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:25.410
rather than oh, it's
gonna be overwhelming,

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:26.670
let's hit the road.

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:29.003
- Right, it's steps you can
do just to make a change.

01:01:29.003 --> 01:01:31.970
And we're just trying to be good enough.

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:32.803
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

01:01:32.803 --> 01:01:33.703
- Thanks, yeah.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.630
- [Audience Member] I really
thank you for your talk

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:42.120
and I found it really
stimulating and interesting.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.430
But I was involved with the
development of the scenario

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:47.970
in the '70's.

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:52.900
Scenario of a 7.0 earthquake
on the Hayward Fault.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.170
You're probably familiar
with that state scenario.

01:01:56.170 --> 01:02:01.170
And some of the issues that
came up, like for instance,

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.800
and I live in Berkeley, the Chevron,

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.820
we're in the Chevron Auditorium
so I'll mention that first.

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:10.520
The Chevron gas line and oil lines

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:15.100
that go right on San
Pablo, down to San Jose,

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:19.820
from the Chevron oil
refineries are huge pipes

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:23.603
that were built in the
'40's and '50's or earlier.

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:28.470
They're, it was viewed in the scenario

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:30.750
that they would probably
break and there would be

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:35.230
huge, huge fires and we tried to vote

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:37.230
in the city of Berkeley for getting

01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:42.230
some kind of suction system
to get water from the Bay

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.280
to be able to use in the
fire stations, but that,

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.223
we did not pass that, even
after the fire in Oakland Hills.

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:55.460
I think we're in really
bad shape, if not worse,

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:58.730
than 45 years ago in
the Bay area right now.

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:03.730
And the firemen and the
police do not live in Berkeley

01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:06.320
or San Francisco.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.280
They live in Brentwood and Antioch

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.630
and places where they can
afford to live and okay.

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:17.050
Anyway, I just wanted to ask you again,

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:19.340
I appreciated the person before me,

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.440
but I really do feel that
it's very difficult to,

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.740
as a person who's in
a different profession

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.770
and not a seismologist,
to be able to work,

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.190
even if you want to,
and some organizations

01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:32.120
try to get these things changed.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.210
- Well, I think that we do
need to look at what we can do

01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:36.180
as a community.

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.410
And, you know, I'm trying to understand

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:40.900
why we got it through this time.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.360
You know, what's been different?

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.820
And I do think that part of that has been

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:49.040
that we have the science
to make a clear statement.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.100
You know, and I'm hoping
that the Haywired Scenario

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.340
will give you guys a tool.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.620
You know, it's not like
it's really new science.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.380
It's just giving it
into a coherent picture

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:02.160
so you can make that
connection to what it is

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.500
and why these actions are worthwhile.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:04.540
- [Audience Member] I just wanna mention,

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:07.350
I hope you're gonna include Silicon Valley

01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:11.160
and the things like Bubonic
Plague in the little jars

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.564
and stuff like that.

01:04:12.564 --> 01:04:13.887
- Oh yeah, we've been doing
quite a bit of work with them.

01:04:13.887 --> 01:04:17.420
- [Audience Member] And the
plants, the power plants.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.253
- Yeah.

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.390
- [Audience Member] Hi,
you mentioned insurance.

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:25.970
When you, as a homeowner in Berkeley, you,

01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:29.260
I have very smart friends
that say it's smart

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.310
to get earthquake insurance.

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:32.210
And I have other equally smart friends

01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:34.980
that say it's the
stupidest thing you can do.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.210
I wonder what your position is?

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:40.250
- Okay, earthquake insurance
is a very difficult thing.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.760
It is very clear at a societal level

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.690
that we desperately
need a much higher rate

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:46.160
of earthquake insurance.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.210
When you look at what's
happened in Christchurch,

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:50.440
they are recovering only because they had

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.670
95% insurance coverage.

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:55.570
It brought in the money
that allowed them to do it.

01:04:55.570 --> 01:04:58.900
They almost lost their
reinsurance because of this.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.370
They were finally able to bring it along.

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:01.940
If they have another big
earthquake like this,

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.100
they're losing it.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.730
They're trying to figure out how to move

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:06.200
to a higher standard.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.270
This is the problem with
the life safety code.

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:10.620
As a society, we need more insurance now

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:12.290
and we need to move to building buildings

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:13.760
that don't come down.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.920
As an individual, it is a
much more difficult choice,

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.920
partly because what we, the
products that are offered,

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.930
you're required, you can only insure

01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:27.380
for the total replacement
value of your home.

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:30.070
You aren't, you know, and if
you really retrofit your home,

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:32.690
the chances of losing the complete value

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:35.840
is extremely small on a
really well-built house.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.880
So do you do this?

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.120
One way to support you
in making the decision,

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.380
there's a new tool that's just out,

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.610
a place called temblor dot net.

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:48.400
It's an actually an ex-USGS scientist

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:52.120
who has taken the USGS data and turned it

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.120
into a really accessible tool.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.130
You put in your address.

01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:58.577
It tells you what--

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.390
And you put in the value of your house

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.230
and it gives you the probability

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:04.830
in whatever timeframe you wanna look at,

01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:07.100
usually the length of
your mortgage, 30 years,

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:10.660
your probability of shaking, of damage.

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:14.090
What's your chance that
you're gonna have major damage

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:15.910
exceeding a half a million dollars

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:17.620
and comparing it to other things

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.600
that you're used to insuring for,

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.040
like, you know, fire of your house,

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.180
totaling your car, being
sued, major injury.

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:29.150
And in Berkeley, in general,

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:32.830
unless you have really
retrofitted your house,

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:35.190
your probability of
major damage is up there

01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:37.000
with your chance of major injury

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.660
and greater than your
chance of being sued,

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.820
totaling your car, or
burning down your house.

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:44.790
So, it's a useful piece of information

01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:47.720
to just do that financial comparison.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.937
Temblor dot net.

01:06:49.937 --> 01:06:50.770
- [Audience Member] So the bottom line was

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:52.950
would you get it yourself?

01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:54.050
If you had a (laughs).

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.187
- I haven't talked my
husband into it (laughs).

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:04.870
- Please join me in giving
another round of applause

01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:06.088
to Dr. Lucy Jones.

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:08.220
(applause)

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.803
(upbeat music)
