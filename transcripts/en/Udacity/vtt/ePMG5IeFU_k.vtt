00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.090
Believe it or not, this single-celled organism,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.971
Amoeba dubia, has the biggest genome. An

00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:11.196
amoeba, a single-celled organism, has more than

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:14.172
66 times more DNA in its genome than

00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:20.084
one copy of the human genome. While an amoeba has close to

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:25.495
200 billion base pairs of DNA in one copy of its genome, a human genome only has

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:30.360
3 billion base pairs. So hopefully you can see from this, that

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.630
it's not the amount of DNA that makes a species complex, otherwise

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.910
the amoeba would be the most complex organism of all. Instead, it

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.600
matters what the specific sequence of those letters in your DNA are.
