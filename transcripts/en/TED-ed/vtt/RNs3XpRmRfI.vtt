00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.080
Take a look outside a window.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.771
What is the season where you are?

00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:19.294
How do you know?

00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:22.023
Most likely, you looked at a tree or plant

00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:23.979
and noticed details about its leaves

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:27.583
and assessed the qualities of sunlight streaming outside.

00:00:27.583 --> 00:00:29.986
Observing the timing of biological events

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:32.524
in relation to changes in season and climate

00:00:32.524 --> 00:00:34.788
is called "phenology".

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:37.611
When you notice the daffodil buds are poking through the snow

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:39.338
and think spring is on its way,

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:41.893
you're using phenology.

00:00:41.893 --> 00:00:43.936
When you see leaves turn from green to red,

00:00:43.936 --> 00:00:46.475
and watch migrating birds fly past,

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:49.369
and realize that summer is over, autumn is here,

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:51.811
you're using phenology.

00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:54.057
Literally meaning, "the science of appearance",

00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:56.030
phenology comes from the Greek words

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.409
"pheno," to show or appear,

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.841
and "logos," to study.

00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:02.584
Humans have relied on phenology

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:04.822
since the time of hunters and gatherers.

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:06.700
We've watched changes in seasons

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.772
to know when to plant and harvest food

00:01:08.772 --> 00:01:11.511
and when to track migrating animals.

00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:14.786
Scientists observe and document seasonal changes in nature

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:18.537
and look for patterns in the timing of seasonal events.

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:23.342
Timing of these natural signs has remained consistent until recently.

00:01:23.342 --> 00:01:27.354
Increasing global temperature is causing rhythms of nature to shift.

00:01:28.168 --> 00:01:32.143
Bud burst, the day when a tree or plant's leaf or flower buds open,

00:01:32.143 --> 00:01:35.761
is occurring earlier in the year for some species.

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.927
For every one degree Celsius rise in temperature,

00:01:38.927 --> 00:01:42.907
bud burst happens five days earlier than usual.

00:01:42.907 --> 00:01:45.474
Differences in timing affect not only plants,

00:01:45.474 --> 00:01:49.312
but the insects and birds that depend on the plants for food.

00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:52.543
For example, oak trees in the Arnhem Forest of the Netherlands

00:01:52.543 --> 00:01:55.380
now experience bud burst ten days earlier,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.903
as compared to twenty years ago.

00:01:57.903 --> 00:02:01.559
New oak leaves are a favorite food of winter moth caterpillars.

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:03.829
To survive, the caterpillars adapted

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.879
to the change in the tree's timing,

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.607
and now hatch 15 days earlier than before.

00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:11.701
Migrating pied flycatcher birds, however,

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:13.493
aren't doing as well.

00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:17.384
The birds prefer to feed their chicks winter moth caterpillars.

00:02:17.384 --> 00:02:19.610
The caterpillars are now hatching earlier,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.709
but the birds' chicks are not.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.812
This delay is costing the birds a food source.

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:27.041
The pied flycatcher population has decreased

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:30.214
by up to 90% in some areas as a result.

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:32.037
Changes to a seemingly simple event,

00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:33.056
leaves opening,

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:36.491
has ripple effects throughout a food web.

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:40.028
Earlier bloom times can also have an economic impact.

00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:42.694
The famed cherry blossoms in Washington D.C.

00:02:42.694 --> 00:02:45.639
are blooming five days earlier than before.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.116
Since the cherry trees are blooming earlier,

00:02:48.116 --> 00:02:49.827
the blossoms also fade earlier,

00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:52.158
frustrating thousands of tourists who visit

00:02:52.158 --> 00:02:54.200
for the Cherry Blossom Festival.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.991
High school marching bands plan

00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:57.366
all year to attend the parade

00:02:57.366 --> 00:03:00.374
and perform, surrounded by a majestic white canopy.

00:03:00.374 --> 00:03:02.905
How disappointing for them to find, well, trees

00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:05.485
rather than the famous cherry blossoms!

00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:09.548
Plants and animals react to changes in natural light and temperature.

00:03:09.548 --> 00:03:13.986
Increasing temperatures cause plants to bloom earlier than before,

00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:17.435
and become out of sync with the insects and birds in a food web.

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:19.502
So, the next time you look out your window

00:03:19.502 --> 00:03:21.445
and notice what season it is,

00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:23.714
you may be fooled by those blooming trees.

00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:25.239
Think of phenology,

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.819
then think of how you can play a part to slow climate change.
