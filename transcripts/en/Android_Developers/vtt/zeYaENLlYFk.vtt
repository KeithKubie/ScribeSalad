RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, we're live.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.160
Hey, welcome to this
week's Android

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.990
Developer Office Hours.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.095
I'm joined here in London by--

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:14.150
MATT GAUNT: Matt Gaunt.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.864
CHRIS BANES: Chris Banes.

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:16.930
NICK BUTCHER: Nick Butcher.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.230
RICH HYNDMAN: And I'm Rich
Hyndman, which I should have

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.010
said up front.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.950
We've already got--

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.720
I think it's--

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.603
David and Wiebe have joined
us in the Hangout.

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:23.972
Hi, guys.

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:24.810
WIEBE ELSINGA: Hello.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.682
DAVID: Hi.

00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:26.190
RICH HYNDMAN: Hey.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.480
As usual, we'll be discussing
Android development topics.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.532
And also as usual, we won't be
discussing roadmaps, future

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.696
things, unreleased--
or unannounced--

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:36.700
I guess roadmaps.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.160
I don't know.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.100
I said the word roadmaps
twice.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.150
Thank you for all the
questions in the

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.010
moderator this week.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.180
RICH HYNDMAN: We do have one.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.930
So maybe we'll just get the--

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.700
ah, two actually.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.202
We'll get those out of
the way up front.

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:53.330
And then just go into some
kind of discussion.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.380
And hopefully some more people
will join us and keep the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.960
content going throughout.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.250
Oh.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.840
OK, what was our one
moderator question?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.050
Two, sorry.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.077
CHRIS BANES: We had why was the
US office hours stopped?

00:01:05.077 --> 00:01:05.931
And is it coming back?

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.110
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, has
it been stopped?

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.755
Yes.

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:10.900
Is it gone for good?

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.617
I think so.

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:14.610
The US team played with
the office hours

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.765
format for a while.

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:19.620
And they decided to move on to
other formats, like This Week

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.646
and Android.

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:23.280
CHRIS BANES: Maybe it was a
time zone thing, but they

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.350
weren't getting too
many viewers.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.322
There seemed lots of people
come into this time slot.

00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:28.180
And not so much for
that time slot.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.010
RICH HYNDMAN: It's funny we
used to call this Android

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.550
Developer Office Hours EMEA.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.020
Maybe we still do.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.080
But we've been looking at the
statistics on YouTube, more

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.640
than 50% of the viewers are
actually from the US.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.980
So maybe it's just because they
can get up in the morning

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.405
and watch it before they
go to work, or I don't

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:43.510
know what it is.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.290
CHRIS BANES: So where
are you, David?

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.820
DAVID: I'm in North Carolina.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.600
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, hey.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.670
There we go.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.290
Except the sample size.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.614
RICH HYNDMAN: Is that where
The Fresh Prince was from?

00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:53.030
NICK BUTCHER: Philadelphia?

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.500
RICH HYNDMAN: Philadelphia?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.090
Oh, yeah.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.820
I'm sure that's the song.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.522
CHRIS BANES: They
can't hear this.

00:01:58.522 --> 00:01:59.410
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.420
Well, thanks for joining us.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.680
Well, let's take one
from the floor.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.670
Does anyone in the Hangout
have a question for us?

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.670
And hello, Amit.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.601
Thanks for joining as well.

00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:11.425
WIEBE ELSINGA: Yeah,
I have a question.

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:17.470
Chris, we discussed last time
you can use Wi-Fi Direct as a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.470
way of [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.630
Do you know, what's the impact
for the mobile battery?

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.960
Or the device you're
trying to pair?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.620
RICH HYNDMAN: I don't off
the top of my head.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.340
I haven't used the
API much myself.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.580
So I can't comment on battery
life and that kind of stuff.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.990
I don't know.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.336
I imagine it's better
than Bluetooth.

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:38.130
WIEBE ELSINGA: It is.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.693
CHRIS BANES: But that's
only guessing.

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:41.625
RICH HYNDMAN: Hmm.

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:42.940
CHRIS BANES: Anyone
else got any

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.905
experience with Wi-Fi Direct?

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:45.530
RICH HYNDMAN: I don't.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.400
But I mean, I have Wi-Fi
on the whole time

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.950
with my device, right?

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.213
I assume that turning Wi-Fi
Direct on-- at least in

00:02:54.213 --> 00:02:55.866
discovery mode-- doesn't
really impact it.

00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:58.368
MATT GAUNT: But is it in
more active stuff?

00:02:58.368 --> 00:02:59.082
Because it's using all
the multicast stuff?

00:02:59.082 --> 00:03:01.744
Because isn't it two different
chipsets at that point?

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:02.706
RICH HYNDMAN: Really?

00:03:02.706 --> 00:03:04.100
MATT GAUNT: I don't know.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.130
I know it has to be different
hardware.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.918
So I'm wondering whether
it's one to receive?

00:03:06.918 --> 00:03:08.880
There's one to actually--

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.040
RICH HYNDMAN: Maybe we need to
install Dr. Power, and turn on

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.910
Wi-Fi Direct, and see if it
uses much battery life.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.940
I tell you what, I'll make
a note of this question.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.530
CHRIS BANES: I imagine
it's better.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.470
Just because the sheer amount
of bandwidth you have.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.635
So the radio can go
to sleep quicker.

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:26.960
With Bluetooth you're limited
to 100K a second.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.620
Whereas Wi-Fi Direct you're
in the megabits.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.980
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, you mean the
transmissions, they're quick

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.192
and you power down.

00:03:32.192 --> 00:03:33.076
CHRIS BANES: Exactly.

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:33.223
NICK BUTCHER: That's
a good point.

00:03:33.223 --> 00:03:34.400
CHRIS BANES: But
that's a guess.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.090
NICK BUTCHER: I can honestly
say, the best thing to do is

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.870
probably benchmark it.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.650
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.000
WIEBE ELSINGA: OK.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.745
RICH HYNDMAN: What are you
using it for Wiebe?

00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:45.190
WIEBE ELSINGA: I was looking for
a way to connect my Google

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.090
TV with my tablet and
my telephone.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.440
But I can't use it for
my Google TV, because

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.680
it's 4.1 and up.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.460
But I tried to connect my
telephone with my tablet to

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.675
see what it's doing.

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:07.151
CHRIS BANES: Maybe GCM.

00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:08.892
WIEBE ELSINGA: Oh,
that's good.

00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:10.820
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, that'd
be quite good.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.310
WIEBE ELSINGA: And there
goes the weekend again.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:20.829
WIEBE ELSINGA: Nah, I'm using
Movile, and I'm looking into--

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.590
the other framework called?

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.890
All Join.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.508
But they're really terrible.

00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:28.440
NICK BUTCHER: Oh dear.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.810
CHRIS BANES: All Join's
supposed to be

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.456
quite stable, but I've--

00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:32.660
well, it looks quite good
from the website.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.180
I don't know what the
actual code's like.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.055
WIEBE ELSINGA: The Java Dock
and the implementation

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:38.500
examples are really terrible.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.110
So a basic application.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.716
It's a lot of work to do.

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.696
CHRIS BANES: Interesting.

00:04:45.696 --> 00:04:47.766
WIEBE ELSINGA: OK, thank you.

00:04:47.766 --> 00:04:48.280
RICH HYNDMAN: See you, Wiebe.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.186
CHRIS BANES: Cheers.

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:50.818
RICH HYNDMAN: Does anyone
else in the

00:04:50.818 --> 00:04:51.610
Hangout have a question?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.965
David?

00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:52.640
DAVID: Well, no.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.140
I was trying to look at--

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.000
I was just watching another
show last night.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.660
And they were talking.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.860
This application would allow you
to share bandwidth across

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.050
all your devices.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.430
I'm trying to remember
the name of it now.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.410
And I can't remember now.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.560
It'll connect them
all together.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.810
Well, they used to
use Wi-Fi Direct.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.360
And they stopped that option.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.700
It's only Bluetooth now.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.215
So I think there might
be something to that.

00:05:19.215 --> 00:05:21.180
WIEBE ELSINGA: Do you have
the link for the video?

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.920
DAVID: I'm trying to find it.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.720
I was on another show and I
don't want to want to give

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.270
advertising and all that.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.520
But I watched it.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.100
RICH HYNDMAN: We don't mind.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.540
DAVID: All About Android.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.840
They were talking about it.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.750
RICH HYNDMAN: That's
all right.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.990
I hope you don't mind
this, I thought it

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.230
was one of your shows.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.826
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:37.940
DAVID: So yeah, yeah.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.680
It was on a show about
Android only, but it

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.590
was All About Android.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.750
And they were showing it now.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.800
But it's only Bluetooth.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.570
And if I find it I'll
send it up.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.320
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, great.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.998
MATT GAUNT: Great.

00:05:50.998 --> 00:05:52.710
RICH HYNDMAN: Hey there,
Tyrone as well.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.992
Welcome to the Hangout.

00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:58.440
Do you have any questions
for us today?

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.860
Oh, I think you might
be muted there.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.440
We can't hear you.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.900
Hello?

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.280
TYRONE: Oh, hello.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.046
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh there we go.

00:06:09.046 --> 00:06:09.200
Hey, hey.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.630
TYRONE: Hey guys.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.280
No questions.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.510
I'm just kind of listening and
see if I can pick up some

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.530
pointers and stuff.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.830
RICH HYNDMAN: Nice.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.834
OK, well, nice to
have you here.

00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:19.580
And Marty's also
just joined us.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.040
Hey there Marty.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.932
Looks like you must
be on a phone.

00:06:21.932 --> 00:06:22.925
MARTY: Hey, yep.

00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:26.025
I'm on a Nexus--

00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:28.250
RICH HYNDMAN: I don't know,
something-- is that a Nexus 4,

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.550
would you say?

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.270
CHRIS BANES: Nexus
7, I thought.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.640
MARTY: Nexus 7, yeah.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.660
I'll just be listening in.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.715
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, hey.

00:06:33.715 --> 00:06:35.310
CHRIS BANES: Are you the same
Marty who's just asked

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.040
question in the moderator?

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.740
MARTY: Yep, that's me.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.812
CHRIS BANES: Do you want to go
ahead and ask it on video?

00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:44.520
MARTY: Sure.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.970
I was just asking if Photosphere
is open sourced?

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.510
And if it is, is there
an example

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.476
somewhere that I can review?

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:52.465
RICH HYNDMAN: Hmm.

00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:54.903
CHRIS BANES: I didn't think
a camera app was--

00:06:54.903 --> 00:06:57.920
RICH HYNDMAN: Good question.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.480
I very much doubt that
Photosphere is open sourced.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.020
We have some APIs now which
allow you to check if images

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.250
are Photospheres and that sort
of thing, and playback

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.740
Photospheres.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.000
But I don't believe that
Photosphere itself is open

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.840
sourced, no.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.520
MARTY: Is there some examples
for how to use those APIs?

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.160
NICK BUTCHER: They're part of
the Google Play services

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.130
library there, yeah.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.635
For how to check if it's
Photosphere and then launch

00:07:22.635 --> 00:07:24.226
the Photosphere viewer.

00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:25.000
MARTY: OK.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.200
NICK BUTCHER: What is it?
developer.google.com/android

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.130
and the Google Play services.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.070
It's in there.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.970
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, check
Google Play services.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.120
If you've got the support
library downloaded into you

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.420
SDK it will be on your filing
system already on you PC.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.906
MARTY: Wonderful.

00:07:41.906 --> 00:07:42.180
Thank you.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.400
RICH HYNDMAN: Under Extras.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.955
So take a look in
there as well.

00:07:45.955 --> 00:07:47.516
MARTY: OK.

00:07:47.516 --> 00:07:48.432
CHRIS BANES: They're
coming in fast now.

00:07:48.432 --> 00:07:50.410
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, Have we
got some questions?

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:50.840
We have.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.570
All right, again.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.525
OK, I should open up the
moderator again.

00:07:52.525 --> 00:07:54.280
CHRIS BANES: Any other live
questions in the room before

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.820
we plow on with the moderator?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.315
I'm looking at you Paul.

00:07:57.315 --> 00:07:58.110
RICH HYNDMAN: Paul?

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.930
When did Paul join?

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.176
Oh, yes.

00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:01.570
PAUL: Hi guys.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.050
No, nothing.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.843
Or later on I'll come
up with something.

00:08:04.843 --> 00:08:09.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.335
NICK BUTCHER: And Marty's put
his tablet down on the table.

00:08:11.335 --> 00:08:12.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.595
RICH HYNDMAN: That's a really
nice ceiling he's

00:08:13.595 --> 00:08:14.700
got going on there.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.020
Let's see if we can figure
out where he is, do

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.745
like, CSI on him.

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:20.530
MATT GAUNT: Now he's got it.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.975
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE],
in half.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.772
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:26.716
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:08:26.716 --> 00:08:28.890
MATT GAUNT: Right, let's
click on then.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.090
All right, I'll ask one.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.080
So Everland in Barcelona says,
all developers will be able to

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.690
replace comments placed
on Google Play?

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.000
If so, is there any
estimated date?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.850
So I guess this would fall under
what we said at the top

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.360
of the show, that we're
not going to comment

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.470
about roadmap and stuff.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.860
Like even if we did know a date,
when it was going to

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.800
roll out to everyone.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.800
Then it would probably change,
and then we'd be wrong.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.410
So I think the intentions
to this were

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:54.645
announced to everyone.

00:08:54.645 --> 00:08:55.640
And it hasn't happened yet.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.100
We've been expanding
the trial group.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:57.810
But sit tight.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.630
It will happen.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.210
Yeah?

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:06.220
DAVID: Yeah I sure would love
to be able to just at least

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.000
talk to people that call me
names to see why they really

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.530
are having problems
with my apps.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:17.980
Instead of just saying this
is not appropriate.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.820
You know?

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.084
CHRIS BANES: Has the Google+
identity stuff helped at all?

00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:24.180
You've been able to reach out
to them directly by that?

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.932
DAVID: No, I see they say
they're a Google user.

00:09:27.932 --> 00:09:28.940
RICH HYNDMAN: To all
the ones that are

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.330
Google user are historic.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.170
All new reviews that go in-- as
of about a month ago-- have

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.880
to have a Google+ identity
associated with them.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.510
So you will be able to reach
them and at least find them on

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.310
Google+ and speak back to them
that way if you want.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.600
The previous Google user ones,
if you search by date entered

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.390
instead of by relevance, then
you'll see that the top ones

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.390
should all have an
ID next to them.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.010
Obviously the ones that people
have ticked This Was Useful to

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.475
Me filter to the top
in relevance.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.982
But yeah, interesting to see.

00:10:01.982 --> 00:10:04.100
NICK BUTCHER: So thanks for the
question, Everland, and

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.600
sorry we can't really commit to
dates and stuff like that.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.970
But sit tight.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.658
And we'll do the next caller.

00:10:12.658 --> 00:10:15.270
RICH HYNDMAN: Is it possible to
publish an APK internally

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.976
within a company and not through
the Play Store that

00:10:18.976 --> 00:10:20.473
uses the Google Maps API?

00:10:20.473 --> 00:10:21.970
It would, yes.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.748
[INAUDIBLE] that uses
the Google Maps API.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:24.998
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.578
Everyone dives on Marty.

00:10:33.578 --> 00:10:34.020
OK.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.320
So the first part--

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.610
I think as Wiebe
said as well--

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.680
the answer was yes.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.340
Is it possible to
publish an APK

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.606
internally within a company?

00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:41.460
Yes.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.470
And you can do that inside
the Play Store.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.040
If you're using a Google Apps
domain you get your own little

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.080
domain square inside the
application section of the

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.700
Play Store, and you can have
all your employees access

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.410
those applications.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.740
So that's great.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.690
But then it goes on to say not
in the Play Store, which is

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.360
slightly strange.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.288
And then it goes on to
say that it uses

00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:03.740
the Google Maps API?

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.267
So is the Google Maps API linked
to publishing through

00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:06.877
the Play Store?

00:11:06.877 --> 00:11:07.449
CHRIS BANES: No.

00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:07.640
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:07.831
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:09.496
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]
that's fine.

00:11:09.496 --> 00:11:12.985
CHRIS BANES: Once the device has
got the Google experience,

00:11:12.985 --> 00:11:15.680
they start Google Maps,
it should work.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.120
RICH HYNDMAN: The only things
that are linked to publishing

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.610
through the Play Store are the
things that us the Play Store

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:27.960
client, which would be LVL,
in-app billing, yeah, and

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.220
having subscriptions.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.220
WIEBE ELSINGA: Expansion
files?

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.620
RICH HYNDMAN: Expansion files,
thank you there, Wiebe, yep.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.870
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.123
That's probably it.

00:11:37.123 --> 00:11:39.430
And the rest of the APIs that
you get available to you via

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.920
the API console are Google APIs
as opposed to Android

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.430
APIs or Play APIs.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.500
And you can access all of
those via application.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.930
Most of them will have certain
amounts of free quota.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.842
And then you can either ask for
more or go into paid quota

00:11:54.842 --> 00:11:56.350
for the separate Google
services.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.170
So yes, you can use maps.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.730
As long as the device you're
distributing it

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.564
on has Google maps.

00:12:02.564 --> 00:12:03.056
OK?

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.240
CHRIS BANES: So next question.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:10.530
Software bloke, from Milan has
asked if I add a birthday date

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.300
to my contacts, it would be
great if the date would sync

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.760
with G Calendar and set
notifications for that event.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.920
It actually already does that.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.920
So when you set your birthdate,
if you go onto

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.130
Google Calendar on the web, you
can add a calendar called

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.200
Contact Birthdays.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.575
And it automatically shows
your calendar.

00:12:27.575 --> 00:12:32.090
It doesn't do notifications
at the moment.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.605
But it will show in
your calendar.

00:12:33.605 --> 00:12:35.692
Because I've got that
one, and it's great.

00:12:35.692 --> 00:12:37.230
RICH HYNDMAN: And it's just
there as an option?

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.726
CHRIS BANES: It's just
there as an option.

00:12:38.726 --> 00:12:39.750
#protip.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.232
Yeah.

00:12:40.232 --> 00:12:41.196
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:42.160
CHRIS BANES: It's good.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.700
RICH HYNDMAN: Might
do it right now.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.270
calendar.google.com.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.640
Good stuff Chris.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.610
CHRIS BANES: I know.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:50.692
It's awesome.

00:12:50.692 --> 00:12:53.495
NICK BUTCHER: Sounds like it.

00:12:53.495 --> 00:12:54.736
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, next one?

00:12:54.736 --> 00:12:57.370
CHRIS BANES: OK, so
Andre in Prague--

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.500
I've probably mispronounced
that-- asks if subscriptions

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.700
are going to be part of
the B3 billing API?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.900
And at least, a time frame.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:11.468
So again, see it at the top of
the show, we're not going to

00:13:11.468 --> 00:13:12.610
be able to commit
to a time frame.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.890
Have we definitely said
it's going to be part

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.090
of B3 billing API?

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:15.720
NICK BUTCHER: Yep.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.230
CHRIS BANES: I think
everything is

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.450
going to the new structure.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:19.915
So yes.

00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:20.430
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.132
Yeah, it says inside the
documentation that it will.

00:13:24.132 --> 00:13:25.816
But it doesn't say when.

00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:27.066
CHRIS BANES: OK, eventually.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.761
Cool.

00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:33.350
RICH HYNDMAN: Yep.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.120
NICK BUTCHER: Next person?

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.326
Someone called the
Condor in Italy.

00:13:39.326 --> 00:13:41.290
I made my first app for
a university course.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.700
And my professor
said it's good.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.120
But on Samsung device
it runs well.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.050
And on HTCs it doesn't.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.120
Is there a good way to test my
app on different devices?

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.370
DAVID: Emulators.

00:13:54.722 --> 00:13:56.740
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, I mean, I
think what he's trying to say

00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.280
is for some reason his
app doesn't work on--

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.180
Samsung was it?

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.540
It works on Samsung
but not HTC.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.480
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, there's
a few things.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.540
Samsung have their own online
test studio that you can use

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.920
if you become a Samsung
developer.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.020
It's free for the first
x number of tests.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.410
So go to Samsung Developer and
look for remote device access.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:17.610
And then you can check
out devices.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.500
You can say I want a note
two on firmware x.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.440
And when it's available you get
to just go into your web

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.350
browser, upload your APK
and test it for free.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.440
So for Samsungs it's
not too bad.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.200
I don't if any of the other
Android OEMs that

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.130
provide that service.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.170
NICK BUTCHER: I think Sony has
a system where you can get

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.150
real devices.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.090
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
Sony might have.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.242
Outside of that, you'd
be looking at

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:38.180
a cloud-based service.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.010
There are a number of
them out there.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.020
They all charge for
their services.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.475
NICK BUTCHER: Calabash,
Testdroid, DeviceAnywhere,

00:14:45.475 --> 00:14:46.080
there's a bunch of them.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.340
RICH HYNDMAN: Testdroid,
DeviceAnywhere, yeah.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:47.850
These things.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.050
So go to those websites.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.025
Have a look.

00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:52.490
Use our popular search
engine to find them.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:58.310
And you should be able to find
good ways of uploading a test

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.600
script and having
it run across a

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.130
number of hardware devices.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.400
And then you receive back the
log dumps, the screenshots,

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.560
all that kind of thing.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.955
NICK BUTCHER: I'm interested why
he thinks it's a Samsung

00:15:08.955 --> 00:15:11.290
versus HTC issue.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.160
In my experience, comparing
similar devices across

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.910
manufacturers isn't really the
issue, performance wise.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:22.370
It might be comparing Galaxy
S3 to HTC Wildfire or

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.090
something like that.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.640
Then those are two very,
very differently

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.080
specced priced devices.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.080
So I'd be interested in some
more details of what the

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.875
different devices were.

00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:31.190
CHRIS BANES: And also, he didn't
mention whether they're

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.570
the same API levels.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:37.590
So whether he's running on ice
cream sandwich versus jelly

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.960
bean or whatever.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.382
NICK BUTCHER: Or like a
pre-hydroacceleration and post

00:15:41.382 --> 00:15:42.490
hydroacceleration,
for example.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.295
Yes a gingerbread versus jelly
bean, for example.

00:15:45.295 --> 00:15:46.945
RICH HYNDMAN: Take a look at
your stats in the developer

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:47.900
console as well.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.402
You'll be able to see what's
percentage of your installs

00:15:50.402 --> 00:15:53.800
are on each of the API levels
since you're on each device,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.285
that kind of thing.

00:15:54.285 --> 00:15:55.840
That might help you break it
down and find out where the

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.914
issues are.

00:15:57.914 --> 00:15:59.336
What anyone else thinks?

00:15:59.336 --> 00:16:01.760
NICK BUTCHER: Another
good way--

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.380
going low tech on this-- is if
you join your local Android

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.090
user group.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.960
This is certainly the way
we've seen before.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.270
It's a good way to meet with
other Android developers, talk

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:09.870
Android chat.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.700
But also to do a [? beach ?]
with them.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.400
Say, hey, can you
guys run this?

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.560
And get a cross section
of devices and tell me

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.480
what's going on.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.350
And you'll get some informed
people giving you feedback on

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.590
the performances and that.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.075
And they'll probably give you
tips where they think you're

00:16:23.075 --> 00:16:23.790
going wrong in your
code, as well.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.490
DAVID: Yeah.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.965
Free coffee, that's
all it costs.

00:16:25.965 --> 00:16:26.722
Have them at the coffee shops.

00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:30.975
RICH HYNDMAN: And be a good
citizen, offer to test their

00:16:30.975 --> 00:16:32.230
apps out as well when they
need testing help.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.490
Because testing apps on a wide
variety of handsets is really

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.532
helpfully done when it's
when it's distributed.

00:16:37.532 --> 00:16:39.190
Is that [? Julien? ?]

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.526
He's just trying to sign on?

00:16:40.526 --> 00:16:41.240
Oh no.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.135
NICK BUTCHER: Or run like a
[INAUDIBLE] or something like

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:44.412
that, right?

00:16:44.412 --> 00:16:45.440
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.155
Yep.

00:16:48.155 --> 00:16:52.270
Does anybody else who's just
joined us, or anybody else in

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.945
the Hangout have a
question for us?

00:16:53.945 --> 00:16:55.610
NICK BUTCHER: Is Amit
in Hangout?

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.250
He was in and he left,
then he was in.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:16:59.870
He's left.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.280
OK.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.776
He's asked a question which
I don't understand.

00:17:02.776 --> 00:17:03.970
RICH HYNDMAN: Amit's there.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.710
NICK BUTCHER: Oh,
you were here.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.130
Did you ask your question?

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.790
Oh, you don't have
a microphone.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.539
RICH HYNDMAN: He can
copy and paste

00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:11.000
it in from the moderator.

00:17:14.948 --> 00:17:15.936
NICK BUTCHER: Let's
watch him type.

00:17:15.936 --> 00:17:18.390
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
we could just.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.416
RICH HYNDMAN: Fair enough.

00:17:19.416 --> 00:17:22.470
So is this the question?

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.240
Other than the Android
development question.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:24.411
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:24.669
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.510
RICH HYNDMAN: Other than Android
development-- yeah,

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.180
he's placed it again.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.590
Vote yes for this,
vote no for this.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.736
Interesting.

00:17:31.736 --> 00:17:32.623
CHRIS BANES: He's copied that.

00:17:32.623 --> 00:17:34.110
RICH HYNDMAN: He's copied
quite a lot of it.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.430
Let's go.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.470
I'll just read it out.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.640
Other than application
development, what are the

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.470
career opportunities in
Android or the Android

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.950
marketplace?

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.570
This is a question of a lot of
developers like me who want to

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.110
shift from other platforms
like Microsoft.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.470
Application development,
obviously, is split down both

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.660
sides of writing your own
applications and writing

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.940
applications for other
companies are

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.160
clearly the two key ways.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.400
And the most reliable income
always comes from writing

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.040
applications as a contractor or

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.110
consultant for other companies.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.830
So that's the easiest way to
get into it until you're

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.140
confident enough and have the
ideas to start making your own

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.720
applications on the
side as well.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.680
But there's a lot of companies
set up these days surrounding

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.300
the Play Store and Android.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.390
There's companies with their
own application stores.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.420
There's companies that do
publishing on behalf of other

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.940
applications, because a lot of
developers know how to write

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.060
applications, but don't how to
publish and market them.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.540
So there's a lot of application
publishing

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.720
companies and marketing
companies

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.160
and advertising companies.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.000
There's every single individual
part of the

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.576
ecosystem is taken care of.

00:18:40.576 --> 00:18:42.970
NICK BUTCHER: Design,
tests, all sorts.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:43.700
RICH HYNDMAN: Absolutely.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.930
Yeah, even just the development
process.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.520
CHRIS BANES: Test is a good
beginner side of it.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.490
Because you get to see the
process of what software

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.890
development is from a less
technical side so you ease

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:54.173
yourself into it.

00:18:54.173 --> 00:18:54.230
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:55.360
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.520
That's a good point.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.360
I mean, we work with a
lot of partners here.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.080
And we ask them how they
do their testing.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.250
And some say, we just
outsource it.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.210
It seems to be a pretty good
solution for getting

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.170
comprehensive tests done.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.810
Just let the experts who do
testing across multiple

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.036
devices every day
do it for you.

00:19:10.036 --> 00:19:12.720
And if you get into
that side of it.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.510
Amit's just about to comment.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.500
And say whether we've answered
his question or not, or

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.710
whether we totally
missed the pitch.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:21.636
MATT GAUNT: Did we miss?

00:19:21.636 --> 00:19:23.025
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:26.670
Oh, Amit says, good.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.090
Thanks.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.770
WIEBE ELSINGA: I think a good
graphics now makes it big.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.350
Good graphics for
the marketplace.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.630
To be able to come up and
say, this is going

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:35.700
to sell your app.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.090
Or the eye catchers, or
something unique like that is

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.700
a big thing.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.880
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, I
think you're right.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.630
CHRIS BANES: I agree.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.511
I think design is really
important.

00:19:44.511 --> 00:19:46.475
RICH HYNDMAN: Design is
really important.

00:19:46.475 --> 00:19:47.950
[INAUDIBLE] some apps.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:48.990
But yeah, there's more
developers than there are

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.030
designers at the moment.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.245
People are now being able to
find Android developers to

00:19:52.245 --> 00:19:53.710
make their apps, but being
able to get really good

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.410
designer can be tricky.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:57.475
CHRIS BANES: Plus the market
has enough apps,

00:19:57.475 --> 00:19:59.040
like enough OK apps.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.000
It needs gorgeous apps.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.923
RICH HYNDMAN: Nick's been saying
this saying this for

00:20:01.923 --> 00:20:02.950
over a year now.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.830
Make awesome apps.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.815
He had it tattooed once, but
lasered off again of his face.

00:20:05.815 --> 00:20:08.270
DAVID: I would love to
have a designer.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.270
I do my stuff for free.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.400
I would love to have someone
that's more into the design.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.430
I've tried to do it.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.480
But there's only a certain
amount of design.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.700
You either have it
or you don't.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.530
RICH HYNDMAN: I was
really lucky.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.010
I mean, I got absolutely zero
design skills, and I had an

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:21.885
app that looked pretty bad.

00:20:21.885 --> 00:20:23.010
I put it out there, and someone

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.190
offered to redesign it.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.988
And I'm still building it,
but it looks absolutely

00:20:25.988 --> 00:20:26.320
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.810
I've ever come up with
a design as good as

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:29.440
Marie's did for mine.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.365
CHRIS BANES: So there's two
good communities you

00:20:31.365 --> 00:20:32.710
can go to on G+.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.870
There's the Android design
official community.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.250
And there's another one called
Android Designers, which is

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:39.820
invite only.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.550
But just ask, and they'll let
you in unless you start

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.926
posting spam, in which
case you get banned.

00:20:44.926 --> 00:20:46.910
But both are very, very
active communities.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.870
And they have sections where
you can say, here's my app.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:50.370
Any pointers?

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.770
And it's all very friendly.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.710
And there's a section for asking
for people to help you

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:55.770
out with stuff.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.260
So I'm not going to say they're
going to necessarily

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.900
design your app for free.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.790
But they'll give you
some pointers.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.450
RICH HYNDMAN: And Android user
groups are being far more

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.830
welcoming to designers
these days as well.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.280
NICK BUTCHER: Or like Rich, you
might find-- you might be

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.415
lucky and find a designer who's
looking for a developer

00:21:09.415 --> 00:21:12.990
so that they can increase their
portfolio or whatever,

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.240
to get more work.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:14.705
Then they might just
take pity on you.

00:21:14.705 --> 00:21:15.970
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, then you
send them a developer who

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.200
takes six months to get the
designs realized and still

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.722
hasn't got them live.

00:21:19.722 --> 00:21:22.083
But that was my fault because I
did a beta test, and so much

00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:23.790
feedback came back that I
had to do improvements.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.110
And then I took it to the
Android framework, and they

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.320
said you should have
done it that way.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.460
All right, yeah.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.090
There you go.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.946
But it is open source,
so I'll fix it up.

00:21:30.946 --> 00:21:31.576
CHRIS BANES: Yet again.

00:21:31.576 --> 00:21:32.410
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:33.660
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:39.780
RICH HYNDMAN: David wants
a link to something.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.030
I'm not quite sure what.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.840
DAVID: Well, the link
to that group.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.360
What was it?

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.670
RICH HYNDMAN: That's
Android Developers.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.650
CHRIS BANES: Android
Designers.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.055
RICH HYNDMAN: Sorry, Plus
Android Designers.

00:21:50.055 --> 00:21:53.320
CHRIS BANES: I don't
think it is that.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.120
RICH HYNDMAN: But is that-- if
you go to the Plus Android

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.515
Developers there should be the
communities down the side

00:21:58.515 --> 00:21:58.790
there, right?

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.330
CHRIS BANES: So it comes with
the Android Designers, not

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.182
Android Design.

00:22:02.182 --> 00:22:03.555
RICH HYNDMAN: And
where's that?

00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:04.560
DAVID: I got it.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.210
Never mind.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.070
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.360
Did you use the popular
search engine?

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.820
DAVID: Yeah, I used one
of the small ones.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.218
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:13.218 --> 00:22:17.423
RICH HYNDMAN: It's a lot
easier than asking us.

00:22:17.423 --> 00:22:18.880
How's the moderator looking?

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.550
CHRIS BANES: I think we've
exhausted the moderator.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.660
AUDIENCE: Hi guys.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.142
I've got a question
if you want.

00:22:25.142 --> 00:22:27.482
RICH HYNDMAN: Go for it.

00:22:27.482 --> 00:22:30.010
AUDIENCE: It's a bit tricky.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.755
But one of the requirements I've
got to look into is to do

00:22:32.755 --> 00:22:36.620
with NFC card emulation mode.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.970
I know that's heavily restricted
in Android.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:43.070
I don't know if anyone's done
anything with [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.145
I've got some open card
emulation code.

00:22:47.145 --> 00:22:49.023
Has anyone done anything
with that at all?

00:22:49.023 --> 00:22:51.730
Or any experience?

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.142
Maybe from around the people
logged onto here as well?

00:22:56.142 --> 00:22:57.138
CHRIS BANES: I haven't.

00:22:57.138 --> 00:22:58.610
RICH HYNDMAN: No.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.490
MATT GAUNT: I know what
you mean, but no.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:00.780
I haven't.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.280
RICH HYNDMAN: No, unfortunately
not.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.510
Gone trivial.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.760
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:23:07.376 --> 00:23:12.862
WIEBE ELSINGA: But you want
to emulate the NFC cards?

00:23:12.862 --> 00:23:17.635
AUDIENCE: Yes I've got to do a
low-level NFC card emulation.

00:23:17.635 --> 00:23:23.780
WIEBE ELSINGA: Because they
aren't that expensive.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.055
I think for a buck you
can get an NFC tag.

00:23:27.055 --> 00:23:28.665
AUDIENCE: Oh no, it's
a different

00:23:28.665 --> 00:23:31.790
mode from tag reading.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:38.380
It's a low-level way we send
back and forth messages to a

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:43.506
device or to a door reader.

00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:45.390
WIEBE ELSINGA: Yeah.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.230
RICH HYNDMAN: If you want to
replace one of these things on

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.522
your phone, they're
a cheap part.

00:23:50.522 --> 00:23:52.042
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:23:52.042 --> 00:23:53.985
AUDIENCE: OK, well thanks
anyway guys.

00:23:53.985 --> 00:23:55.610
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, at
least we can confirm

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.810
that it's not easy.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.345
It's non trivial.

00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:01.160
MATT GAUNT: Enjoy.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.880
RICH HYNDMAN: Hope you haven't
committed to too much.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.700
NICK BUTCHER: There's a good
blog with information on this

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.595
kind of stuff.

00:24:08.595 --> 00:24:10.675
Do you know Nikolay Elenkov?

00:24:10.675 --> 00:24:11.465
AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:24:11.465 --> 00:24:13.745
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, you're
aware of his blog?

00:24:13.745 --> 00:24:15.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I've been
following that.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.610
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, he did some
really, really good low

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.720
down, low level what produces--
how all this works.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.880
I think he talks about
how to do this on CN.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.550
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.690
I need to get hold of
that guy, as well.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.102
Thank you.

00:24:28.102 --> 00:24:29.465
NICK BUTCHER: No worries.

00:24:29.465 --> 00:24:33.290
RICH HYNDMAN: And we've got
another question, moderator.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.130
From Alton.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:39.000
What is a technical problem to
deploy a sandbox environment

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.360
and not been?

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.880
NICK BUTCHER: He's saying why
haven't we done it yet?

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.970
RICH HYNDMAN: Why haven't
we done it yet?

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:45.665
Yeah, don't know.

00:24:45.665 --> 00:24:47.435
Yeah, why haven't
we done it yet?

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.495
That's a shame.

00:24:53.495 --> 00:24:54.445
SAM: Thank you.

00:24:54.445 --> 00:24:54.920
I've got a question.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.710
RICH HYNDMAN: It's too bad you
have a question, but next one.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:01.070
We've got one that says, what's
available on Android

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.440
devices if you don't publish
with Google Play Store?

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.590
Can you use GCM if you
haven't published

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.174
through the Play Store?

00:25:06.174 --> 00:25:06.622
Yeah.

00:25:06.622 --> 00:25:11.620
It just needs to be on a device
that has our suite of

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.860
services on it.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.590
So you still need to be running
on a device that has

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.150
the Play Store even if you
didn't distribute your app

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.140
through the Play Store.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.490
NICK BUTCHER: So when you're
developing your app from

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.350
before you publish it you
can still test it, GCM.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.860
DAVID: And you can put
references to it, can't you?

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.853
Like you have to have
a dependency?

00:25:24.853 --> 00:25:27.034
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah it users
library, isn't it?

00:25:27.034 --> 00:25:32.572
DAVID: Yeah so that it won't
install or whatever?

00:25:32.572 --> 00:25:33.550
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.827
I think we may have exhausted
everything.

00:25:34.827 --> 00:25:35.661
CHRIS BANES: We are.

00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:37.200
RICH HYNDMAN: We're out of
questions and we [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.470
streams on the moderator.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.796
WIEBE ELSINGA: Where is
Sparky, by the way?

00:25:40.796 --> 00:25:44.190
RICH HYNDMAN: Sparky, last week,
he's transferred teams.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.600
He's transitioned to an internal
team at Google now.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.930
WIEBE ELSINGA: Hmm.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.160
So he will not be joining
us again?

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.550
RICH HYNDMAN: No, he's
no longer in.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.770
NICK BUTCHER: He may
pop his head in.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:53.545
Head said he might pop his head
in every now and again.

00:25:53.545 --> 00:25:54.465
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, he
might pop his head in

00:25:54.465 --> 00:25:54.740
from time to time.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.980
He's still a good source of
Android knowledge for us.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.230
But he's not in the Android
Develop Relations team

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.950
anymore, nope.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.130
But he's still in the Munich
office, and he

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.405
still works for Google.

00:26:06.405 --> 00:26:09.330
And he's on something
super cool.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.380
WIEBE ELSINGA: Which you can't
say because of disclosure.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.990
CHRIS BANES: Are you talking
about the laser beams?

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.260
RICH HYNDMAN: Whoa, dude.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.390
Frigging laser beams.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.495
MATT GAUNT: Laser beams coming
out of their heads.

00:26:21.495 --> 00:26:22.900
SAM: Can I ask a question?

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.640
ALL: Yeah.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.792
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, please do.

00:26:24.792 --> 00:26:28.150
SAM: So I actually posted in
the moderator earlier under

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.780
Sam about the Google Maps API.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.560
I don't think I was clear
enough, or I'm confused a

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.660
little bit.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.060
So there is a way that I can
publish an app that can only

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.210
be accessed by a certain
organization in the Google

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:42.970
Play Store?

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.791
RICH HYNDMAN: I thought
you said not in

00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:46.080
the Google Play Store?

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.520
SAM: Right, I did.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.960
But I was confused.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.840
Basically I want to create a
version of our app that only

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.370
our salespeople could use
for demo purposes.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.900
RICH HYNDMAN: Absolutely, yes
you can do that if you're

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.210
using a Google Apps domain.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.550
So if your company uses a Google
Apps domain to host its

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.510
infrastructure in any
way, your domain.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.800
Then say you're at domino.com.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.830
Then if you log into
the Android

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.000
device/Play Store, yeah.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.753
Well, yeah, you're right.

00:27:16.753 --> 00:27:17.560
You've got to go to the--

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.310
CHRIS BANES: You've got to
go to the Apps dashboard.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.080
RICH HYNDMAN: The
Apps dashboard

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:19.910
first and turn it on.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:20.700
SAM: OK.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.240
RICH HYNDMAN: And then you'll
get an extra square inside in

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.130
the Apps section of devices that
are logged in with on of

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.490
your domain accounts, which
is just your own internal

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.740
applications.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.970
There was a blog post
about it just before

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:33.940
Christmas, I believe.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.360
I can dig it out for you.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.485
It was on the Android
developer's blog anyway.

00:27:38.485 --> 00:27:39.950
SAM: All right, all right.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:40.950
I can check that.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.640
Yeah, the only issue I was
having is just if you use a

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.190
debug key, the maps don't show
up except for on the device

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:48.870
that you have plugged in.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.610
And then if you use a production
key and try and

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:54.668
distribute the APK, the
app will crash when

00:27:54.668 --> 00:27:56.660
you open it up, right?

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.560
Or am I mistaken?

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.250
Because I've tried to use a
production key and take that

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.512
APK and distribute it to some
of our salespeople.

00:28:06.512 --> 00:28:10.505
And then when they open up the
app it crashes instantly.

00:28:10.505 --> 00:28:14.840
CHRIS BANES: Have you
regenerated the maps from

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.005
using your distribution
key stopped working?

00:28:18.005 --> 00:28:19.643
SAM: Yeah.

00:28:19.643 --> 00:28:21.280
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, that
should be fine.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.175
SAM: It should be fine?

00:28:23.175 --> 00:28:25.870
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, I've done
that a number of times without

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.020
uploading it to the
Play Store.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.582
And with uploading it
to the Play Store.

00:28:29.582 --> 00:28:33.600
SAM: So you're saying if I use
a production API key--

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.080
RICH HYNDMAN: Find the app with
the production API key,

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.880
and then go into the
Developer console.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.580
And then use the production
API key when you get

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.480
your maps API key.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.570
Yeah.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.040
CHRIS BANES: So the Google
Maps key is tied to your

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.605
public key store that you
designed your app with?

00:28:47.605 --> 00:28:48.375
SAM: Right.

00:28:48.375 --> 00:28:51.370
CHRIS BANES: So if you're using
a debug key for Google

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.550
Maps but your release key for
your app, it won't work?

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.470
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, you can list
multiple key certificates

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.340
next to each API key
as well, right?

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.500
I think so.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.385
If not, he can get both.

00:29:03.385 --> 00:29:04.275
SAM: OK.

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:05.400
All right.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.665
Well, thank you then.

00:29:06.665 --> 00:29:07.520
RICH HYNDMAN: But you
can do both anyway.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.970
You can have your own internal
apps inside the Play Store for

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:10.910
people on your own domain.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:14.770
And you can create maps.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.575
I did it using the new Maps.

00:29:16.575 --> 00:29:20.065
But anyway, I haven't tried it
with the old Maps, Maps V2.

00:29:20.065 --> 00:29:21.400
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, I've only
tried with the old maps.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.310
I've haven't used the new one.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.880
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, that's good.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.760
I've only tried it with
the new maps.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.255
So we're covered

00:29:24.255 --> 00:29:24.920
SAM: All right.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.010
Thanks a lot guys.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:26.580
RICH HYNDMAN: All right.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.470
Come back though, and re-post
in the thread if it doesn't

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.085
work for you, if you
find anything.

00:29:31.085 --> 00:29:32.975
SAM: I will do that.

00:29:32.975 --> 00:29:35.490
RICH HYNDMAN: Getting all the
ducks in a row to make it work

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.685
can be a little bit stressful
at times.

00:29:37.685 --> 00:29:40.970
To get all the dev console stuff
and then the application

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:41.470
built properly.

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:44.910
SAM: OK, I'll figure it out.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.620
Thank you.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.510
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.730
CHRIS BANES: Check moderator.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.010
RICH HYNDMAN: What
have we got?

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.871
Wiebe's posted something
into the chat.

00:29:54.871 --> 00:29:59.003
WIEBE ELSINGA: Yeah, it's the
link for the private channel.

00:29:59.003 --> 00:30:01.000
RICH HYNDMAN: Ah, that's what
it's called, Private Channel.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.350
Thank you.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.675
WIEBE ELSINGA: Yep.

00:30:03.675 --> 00:30:05.070
CHRIS BANES: Questions.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.000
MATT GAUNT: Hey, Timothy.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.450
Got a question for us?

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.770
RICH HYNDMAN: So there's no
questions in the moderator.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:14.563
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
no questions.

00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:15.865
RICH HYNDMAN: This might
be the shortest ever.

00:30:15.865 --> 00:30:16.646
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:16.646 --> 00:30:18.250
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, me too.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.780
If nothing else coming
in we'll let you

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.220
go and wrap up early.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.080
We're going to start playing
with the format of this show,

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.790
as well, over the
next few weeks.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.410
Try and make the output of it
more useful for people who are

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:32.120
watching it afterwards and
maybe formalize which

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.970
questions we'll be answering
during the show.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.110
We just have to work out what's
best for you guys,

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.549
because I know the majority of
questions come in on the day

00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.896
of the show.

00:30:39.896 --> 00:30:40.589
CHRIS BANES: Like today.

00:30:40.589 --> 00:30:42.520
RICH HYNDMAN: Because
that's obviously--

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.550
like today, yeah.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.150
We had one question
before the show.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:45.563
Now we've got 10.

00:30:45.563 --> 00:30:46.870
Timothy has got a question.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.846
Go on.

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:51.855
NICK BUTCHER: And we can also
go on the G+ thread as well.

00:30:51.855 --> 00:30:54.030
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, I
just found that.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.950
CHRIS BANES: So while Timothy
types out his question, why

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.785
don't we go to the G+ thread?

00:30:58.785 --> 00:31:01.080
RICH HYNDMAN: So since you have
a question for an app

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.640
product, so in-app billing
for offline functionality

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.550
TIMOTHY: Oh, that's how you--

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:07.942
RICH HYNDMAN: Hello?

00:31:07.942 --> 00:31:11.464
TIMOTHY: Sorry I just realized
how to unmute.

00:31:11.464 --> 00:31:15.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:18.900
TIMOTHY: So it's my first
time on the Hangout.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.710
RICH HYNDMAN: Welcome.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.580
TIMOTHY: Yeah.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:28.660
I asked a questions ages ago
on the moderator about

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:33.710
preventing swiping to views
on a ViewPager.

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:41.580
And I took your advice, Chris,
on preventing that by

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.520
controlling the adapter
and changing the size.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.726
CHRIS BANES: OK, I can't
remember saying that, but I'll

00:31:48.726 --> 00:31:49.172
agree with you.

00:31:49.172 --> 00:31:49.987
TIMOTHY: OK.

00:31:49.987 --> 00:31:52.158
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:52.158 --> 00:32:01.700
But yeah so it works for
all of each page

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.820
except the first one.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.310
If there's just one view
displayed in a ViewPager, it

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.580
doesn't show that.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.680
I'm after the feedback
that you get on

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.720
the right-hand side.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.860
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, the
force-field thing?

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.390
TIMOTHY: Yeah, that's it.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.290
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.300
So you can remind me what the
original requirement was?

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:33.990
TIMOTHY: OK, so the screen I'm
trying to do is I've got a

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:35.110
load of swipeable views.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:43.190
And you can only progress to
the next view once you've

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.540
completed the first view.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.700
Does that makes sense?

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.560
DAVID: It's a train.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.310
RICH HYNDMAN: Sounds
like a wizard.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:53.200
TIMOTHY: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.870
But I couldn't get it to prevent
the movement properly.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.100
Or I could, but it was buggy.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.655
So I tried your message,
Chris, and that worked.

00:33:05.655 --> 00:33:10.420
But how do I trigger it so
that it would happen when

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.230
there's just one view
in the ViewPager?

00:33:15.195 --> 00:33:17.780
CHRIS BANES: Don't intercept
any touch events.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.480
Don't do anything.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.160
Just let the ViewPager do it.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.460
TIMOTHY: Really?

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.590
CHRIS BANES: Yeah because if
there's any [INAUDIBLE] in the

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.870
ViewPager it will handle
the edge effect anyway.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:26.810
TIMOTHY: Right.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.120
But I mean, I want to show the
user that they need to

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.200
complete something on the page
first so they can swipe.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:40.370
Instead of having a CD like
Toast that says you need to

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:42.140
complete the thing first.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.830
You need to complete
the form first.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.550
How can I sort of--

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.940
CHRIS BANES: Control when
edge effect is shown?

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.060
TIMOTHY: Yeah.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.026
CHRIS BANES: So there's no real
easy way of doing that.

00:33:55.026 --> 00:33:58.220
Other than taking the ViewPager
source into your

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:02.300
tree and hacking it.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.120
Because edge effect isn't
exposed to you.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.585
It's supposed to be something
that's transparent to the

00:34:06.585 --> 00:34:08.420
user, and to the developer.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.679
TIMOTHY: OK.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:14.100
So even if we want to change
the color as well.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.850
Is that also going to need?

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.770
CHRIS BANES: It's all
done on Drawable.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.645
So you'd have to
do it yourself.

00:34:21.645 --> 00:34:22.415
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:22.415 --> 00:34:23.935
CHRIS BANES: Not that
I can remember.

00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:26.476
It's all down on Drawable.

00:34:26.476 --> 00:34:27.362
NICK BUTCHER: No,
I don't think.

00:34:27.362 --> 00:34:28.250
CHRIS BANES: Well,
I don't know.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:28.850
I can't remember.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:30.350
But I don't think you can.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.120
TIMOTHY: OK.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.659
CHRIS BANES: As a quick
thing, Roman Nurik has

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:38.969
released his Wizard.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:40.040
TIMOTHY: Oh, the WizardPager.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.460
Yeah, I'll have a
look at that.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.179
CHRIS BANES: And that' a really
good example of how to

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:45.556
do this nicely.

00:34:45.556 --> 00:34:47.469
So have a look at that and
see how he's done it.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:49.635
TIMOTHY: OK thanks a lot guys.

00:34:49.635 --> 00:34:52.375
CHRIS BANES: Cheers.

00:34:52.375 --> 00:34:53.760
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, let's
grab that one out of

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.806
the G+ stream, then.

00:34:55.806 --> 00:34:58.240
MATT GAUNT: Yep so, in-app
billing for offline

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.660
functionality, how can I make
sure the user has access for

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.465
some function on my app if its
functionality is dependent on

00:35:05.465 --> 00:35:06.715
in-app billing?

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:14.180
So essentially, if they want to
charge for a certain aspect

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.510
of an app, but the user isn't
online, how can you still

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.370
essentially charge them and
give them access to it?

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:20.880
CHRIS BANES: If they're
not online?

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.465
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:35:21.465 --> 00:35:22.286
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, you
can't charge them

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:24.886
if they're not online.

00:35:24.886 --> 00:35:28.120
And your app should clearly
cache whether or not it's

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.424
being purchased or not.

00:35:30.424 --> 00:35:32.070
CHRIS BANES: Well, you should
be able to restore

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.030
transactions and it'll cache.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.600
RICH HYNDMAN: But if
you're not online--

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.120
I know we have the cached
Play store.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.430
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, so if you're
using the V3, via

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.114
[INAUDIBLE] it's all cached
anyway for you.

00:35:42.114 --> 00:35:45.205
So there's no real
need to cache.

00:35:45.205 --> 00:35:47.171
It does that itself.

00:35:47.171 --> 00:35:49.230
RICH HYNDMAN: Depends on if he
wanted to recall Restore

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.700
Transactions, or something
like that.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.810
MATT GAUNT: So imagination
John's just trying to

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.725
essentially store the
transaction if it didn't, and

00:35:55.725 --> 00:35:59.324
then kick it off in advance in
the future but [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:01.730
CHRIS BANES: The thing is,
you can't force the user.

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:03.530
If you want to kick it off again
in the future you can't

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.460
force them to actually
go through with it.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.870
So you give it to
them for free.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.210
So yeah, it all depends on
your business model.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:14.440
But you probably wanted to wait
until they go back online

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.560
before you actually
give them access.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.630
DAVID: Yeah, how does that work
with in-app purchases?

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.180
Say you're buying some
gold coins to

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.180
get to the next level.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.810
And then you're not connected,
and then you're like oh, I got

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:25.480
to the next level.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.686
[CHUCKLES]

00:36:26.686 --> 00:36:31.561
DAVID: There's a lot of code
you have to do too.

00:36:31.561 --> 00:36:32.811
ALL: Yeah.

00:36:34.985 --> 00:36:37.175
NICK BUTCHER: Well, you've got
simplified in V3 right?

00:36:37.175 --> 00:36:37.920
So it's all synchronized.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.500
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.410
V3 helped a lot with that.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.170
It is synchronous and the
Play Store does cash the

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.246
transactions.

00:36:45.246 --> 00:36:47.030
NICK BUTCHER: So basically
if it doesn't

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:48.059
succeed, then don't progress.

00:36:48.059 --> 00:36:49.090
Don't unlock the content.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:52.998
RICH HYNDMAN: Just tell the
user to return online.

00:36:52.998 --> 00:36:54.964
Hopefully it's an [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:54.964 --> 00:36:55.770
the user online.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.860
Or the users that aren't online
understand why they

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.990
can't purchase something.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:05.540
OK anything else come in?

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.460
CHRIS BANES: We had somebody
new join us.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.970
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh yeah,
anybody else in the

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.490
Hangout have a question?

00:37:14.106 --> 00:37:16.190
CHRIS BANES: It doesn't
look like it.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:17.303
MATT GAUNT: We've got some more

00:37:17.303 --> 00:37:18.190
questions on the G+ thread.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.620
CHRIS BANES: A bunch
more, go for it.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.370
MATT GAUNT: All my
techs use SP.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:25.300
But one user asked for
text size options.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.610
What exactly does she want?

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:29.030
Isn't there an option
in the settings to

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.060
change the font size?

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:36.120
And this is from Caitlin,
I think

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.190
So yeah, generally the whole
point of SP is so that it

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:43.580
acknowledges the system-wide
text size preference.

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.600
Chances are the user's used an
app where the app itself

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.600
actually has additional text
sizes, as in, say, I want to

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.180
increase the size large,
medium, or small.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:58.230
And that could be related to the
system font size as well.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:01.355
So I imagine that's what
it's asking for.

00:38:01.355 --> 00:38:02.353
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
it's quite common.

00:38:02.353 --> 00:38:04.350
You see it in news reading apps
and something like that.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.375
They'll quite commonly have a
text size option that you bump

00:38:07.375 --> 00:38:09.680
it up a little bit if
you feel like it.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.380
So I guess that's what the
user is requesting.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.460
So yeah, the answer you could
say, is hey, go to Settings

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.120
and change the setting.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.312
RICH HYNDMAN: If they don't want
to change the font size

00:38:17.312 --> 00:38:19.833
for their entire device, and
they just want to change it in

00:38:19.833 --> 00:38:21.290
your application-- and that's
fair enough, I can understand

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.740
why, especially if you've chosen
particularly small

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.410
fonts-- but yeah, there
are obviously options.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:28.850
MATT GAUNT: So think about
it, whether it makes

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:29.350
sense for your app?

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:33.230
Whether you think it's
a common use case.

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.480
It might not be.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:38.010
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:39.970
RICH HYNDMAN: You can always
use magnification as well.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:44.010
Whatever that three-finger
tap is.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.670
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:47.730
CHRIS BANES: Adds
accessibility.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.991
MATT GAUNT: That's
a good location.

00:38:50.991 --> 00:38:51.720
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.380
So unless there's anything
coming in from Moderator I

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.810
think we've exhausted all the
questions in this chatter.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:58.530
RICH HYNDMAN: OK guys.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.500
I think we might be done
for this week.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.500
NICK BUTCHER: No, there's
one more.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.620
RICH HYNDMAN: Aw, every time.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.060
That's the third time
I've said that.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.760
Now it's not the
shortest ever.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.716
It's soon to be the
longest ever.

00:39:08.716 --> 00:39:13.765
WIEBE ELSINGA: David, the movie,
was it Open Garden?

00:39:13.765 --> 00:39:14.580
DAVID: Yeah.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.450
And I've been looking for it
during this show, and they cut

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.680
it out of their recorded
video.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.850
I was watching it live.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:25.585
WIEBE ELSINGA: OK, I got
the internet site.

00:39:25.585 --> 00:39:31.010
DAVID: Yeah, so Open Garden
stopped doing the NFC and

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:34.440
they're just doing the
Bluetooth only for

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.000
communicating.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.210
And that's where they open up
a VPN tunnel between all the

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.460
different devices.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.770
And they measure the output, and
they share the bandwidth

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:42.230
between them.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.210
So if another device comes on,
and that says it's connected

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:51.000
to Wi-Fi, or if it's using
HSPA or whatever, they'll

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.240
share bandwidth and
go back and forth.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.000
If only one has it,
they'll all do it.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.650
And since it's a VPN tunnel it
only looks like it's coming

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.510
from that device.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:01.540
OK.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.150
NICK BUTCHER: The extra
question is

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.905
just London, the moderator.

00:40:03.905 --> 00:40:06.930
It's from The Condor again, who
asks might be the right

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:09.220
place, but is it an
opportunity to do

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.490
internships in Europe?

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:12.890
I'm guessing with Google
as a user experience.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.490
So I don't think anyone
here knows that.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:15.516
I think if you go to--

00:40:15.516 --> 00:40:16.625
RICH HYNDMAN: They're all
on google.com/jobs.

00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:17.814
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, go
to google.com/jobs.

00:40:17.814 --> 00:40:19.780
And go to the internship
section.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.210
They'll have all the details.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.225
I don't know where the
internships land, but there

00:40:23.225 --> 00:40:25.940
certainly is user experience
in Android done in Europe.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.840
So it's entirely possible.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.180
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE] is
out of the question in the

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.380
chat stream.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.910
So I have one question.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:39.890
If we extend application class
sometimes when we clear the

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:43.780
activities from the stack by
pressing the back button, and

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.872
we then launch the app,
sometimes the last instance of

00:40:46.872 --> 00:40:49.400
the application class
is still there.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.240
But the application object stays
alive for as long as the

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.130
process is alive.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.740
So it's a singleton.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.800
So yeah, there's not much else
to say other than that really.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.140
I'd wonder why you're
trying to--

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.970
why this is affecting
your app.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:07.993
Because if the state you're
trying to keep is specific to

00:41:07.993 --> 00:41:09.783
an activity then there shouldn't
be any activity on

00:41:09.783 --> 00:41:10.935
the application.

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.585
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, as long
as their case [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:12.585 --> 00:41:17.040
CHRIS BANES: So only keep global
stuff that you don't

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.130
care the lifetime of, really,
in an application.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:20.970
So stuff like caches, and
that kind of stuff.

00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:27.722
WIEBE ELSINGA: You can always
empty the back stack.

00:41:27.722 --> 00:41:30.460
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, I think the
question's more about why,

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.490
sometimes, the application
keeps

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:36.470
alive and why it doesn't.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:37.450
So when you press Back.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.010
NICK BUTCHER: So let's say
what you're reporting is

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.080
expected behavior.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.740
But yeah, it's probably that
it doesn't work as you

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.216
imagined it works.

00:41:44.216 --> 00:41:45.760
WIEBE ELSINGA: Back
isn't Close.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:52.160
Back is always the same problem
when you talk to

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.640
Android developers starting with
the difference between

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.840
the Home and the Back button,
and they think the activity's

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.025
closed when you put
Back or Home.

00:42:00.025 --> 00:42:00.797
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, sure.

00:42:00.797 --> 00:42:02.555
RICH HYNDMAN: Mm-hmm.

00:42:02.555 --> 00:42:04.500
DAVID: You should have to
watch a video when you

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:10.015
download the APK of
the life cycle.

00:42:10.015 --> 00:42:12.590
RICH HYNDMAN: I love
that idea.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.905
VIGNESH: What I think is--

00:42:14.905 --> 00:42:16.610
RICH HYNDMAN: Ooh.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:17.240
Is that Vignesh?

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.114
VIGNESH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:20.114 --> 00:42:21.730
NICK BUTCHER: I can't
hear you.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:22.560
RICH HYNDMAN: Sorry.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.030
MATT GAUNT: Can you speak up?

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.280
Maybe bring the microphone
closer?

00:42:28.575 --> 00:42:32.170
VIGNESH: I was just asking if
I have stack of activities,

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.610
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:36.370
cookies from the stack.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:38.150
And when all the duties
are cleared, my

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.370
application gets closed.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.620
And then I relaunch
the application.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.710
It stems off my last pack.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:46.570
It stems off application
clause-- it's still there.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:50.120
I mean, when I come back, the
[INAUDIBLE] which I assigned

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.130
previously to the application
object are still there.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:55.840
RICH HYNDMAN: That's right,
that's correct.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.420
NICK BUTCHER: Correct.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.796
Yeah, that's production
as expected.

00:42:58.796 --> 00:43:01.370
VIGNESH: OK, that's
expected behavior?

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.690
ALL: Yeah.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:04.830
VIGNESH: Oh, thanks.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:06.850
DAVID: That's so that when
you launch the app

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.600
again it's in the cache.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.760
It's faster next time.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.440
Isn't that correct?

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.720
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, Android will
do things to try and keep

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.090
activities and applications
around.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:19.590
And it'll only kill them when
it's got memory pressures.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.950
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, so if you
actually need to force those

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:25.170
values to reset, just grab
them when [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:29.080
or somewhere further
down the life cycle

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.930
and reset them yourself.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:32.470
[? Ulya ?] has joined
us, apparently.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.860
[? ULYA: ?]

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.410
Oh yeah.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:34.855
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah?

00:43:34.855 --> 00:43:36.534
Well, this Hangout was going
to finish 20 minutes ago

00:43:36.534 --> 00:43:37.580
because we ran out
of questions.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.990
But then it just kept
on just surviving.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.430
[? ULYA: ?]

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:42.570
You guys got so much good
stuff to share.

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:43.952
How can it stop?

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.610
Just a quick question
for Matt.

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:49.296
MATT GAUNT: Hi.

00:43:49.296 --> 00:43:49.640
[? ULYA: ?]

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.620
Anymote Protocol, is
that open sourced?

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.480
MATT GAUNT: So we've open
sourced the libraries that

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.305
we're using for Android.

00:43:59.305 --> 00:44:02.910
You can also find it--

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:03.760
there's a library for it.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.540
There's also just a plain
Java library.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.470
I can't remember who did it.

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:09.280
I'll dig it out for you, but
there's an Anymote library

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.155
which is just purely Java.

00:44:10.155 --> 00:44:13.850
It doesn't rely on any Android
side of things.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.710
The actual Google TV
implementation, I don't think

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:17.590
is open sourced.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:18.860
I think that's kept in house.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.960
So yeah, I think it's only the
actual use of protocol that's

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.056
open sourced.

00:44:24.056 --> 00:44:24.440
[? ULYA: ?]

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.100
OK, cool.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.465
I'll let you guys get to your
Google cups of coffee now.

00:44:27.465 --> 00:44:29.325
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:29.325 --> 00:44:31.675
MATT GAUNT: Got to
love that coffee.

00:44:31.675 --> 00:44:32.925
RICH HYNDMAN: All right.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.780
What's that?

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.530
Oh, Lindon's saying he
had an [? Ulya ?]

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.280
demo room at the Melbourne
Android

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.670
developer Meetup tonight.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:41.610
Excellent.

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:42.010
That's funny.

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:42.840
Because he's in Melbourne.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.040
Tonight's already happened.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.360
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, had.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.173
RICH HYNDMAN: Had, already
had one tonight.

00:44:47.173 --> 00:44:48.120
NICK BUTCHER: Gotcha.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.418
CHRIS BANES: There's one
more that's come

00:44:49.418 --> 00:44:50.550
through on the Google+.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:51.050
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.770
RICH HYNDMAN: What
does it say?

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.850
MATT GAUNT: What are the
drawbacks of using config

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:57.030
changes orientation on activity
to prevent it from

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:00.400
recreating after screen
orientation change?

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.330
The only one I've found is that
I cannot use different

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:03.790
layout for landscapes.

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:04.660
There's nothing else.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:05.210
RICH HYNDMAN: That's
the main one.

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.520
But you can.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.180
You can call Request
Layout anyway.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.650
So it's not going
to automatically

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.020
process it for you.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.040
CHRIS BANES: You can do.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.580
But it also has to do
with the Action bar.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.660
So the Action bar has got
optimizations in Landscape

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.720
where it gets slightly smaller,
which won't happen if

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.630
you override the
configuration.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:24.150
But if you call Request
Layout, will it?

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:25.990
NICK BUTCHER: I think it will.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.440
RICH HYNDMAN: Really?

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.820
CHRIS BANES: I don't know,
but I think it will.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.291
But I could be wrong though.

00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:34.060
RICH HYNDMAN: So we're starting
to see video apps and

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.620
things working this way, that
they have the video playing

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.400
and you certainly don't want
to restart the video or

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.130
interrupt the video when
you rotate it.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:43.020
So they'll do the orientation
change themselves and then

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.410
request layout but keep the
video playing inside the

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:45.660
little video play window.

00:45:49.864 --> 00:45:51.760
And yeah I don't
think there's--

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.430
as Chris says.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:54.525
OK is that it?

00:45:54.525 --> 00:45:55.550
NICK BUTCHER: And well,
also, it depends on

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:56.360
what your logic is.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.220
Because if you're depending on
getting your unpause and then

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.290
unresume, cool, it's
just kind of like,

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:01.675
manage your states somehow.

00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:03.210
Then that's obviously not
going to get called--

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.030
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
you're right.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.206
You're in custom views.

00:46:05.206 --> 00:46:06.430
NICK BUTCHER: So be
careful of that.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.391
And any frame which
might be using--

00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:10.640
CHRIS BANES: And the retain
configuration state, whatever

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.260
it's called.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:13.365
Is a bit decrepit now.

00:46:13.365 --> 00:46:15.536
So you shouldn't really
rely on it.

00:46:15.536 --> 00:46:16.430
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.142
MATT GAUNT: We're
actually done.

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.905
RICH HYNDMAN: We're going to go
for the button, We're going

00:46:19.905 --> 00:46:20.530
to end the broadcast.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:21.750
There's nothing else
coming in.
