00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:02.858
So let’s follow our Jersey Square team down

00:00:02.858 --> 00:00:05.163
and see what they’ve done for customer

00:00:05.163 --> 00:00:07.290
relationships. We’ll it’s really interesting to

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.124
remember when they first started. Customer

00:00:10.124 --> 00:00:13.506
relationships for then said search ads, social

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:15.671
medium and stadium promotions. And there

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:18.703
was nothing wrong with that. But really

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:21.288
what they discovered is that they were actually

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.390
just talking about the customer acquisition

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.656
portion, or the get portion of customer

00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:30.776
relationships. But we really want teams to

00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:33.472
understand, what you can do to keep customers

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:35.245
long-term, and what are you going to do

00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:37.999
to grow them in the next couple of years as we.

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:40.168
So we ask you to think about get, keep

00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:42.268
and grow. And they did a good job of

00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:44.645
getting out of the building and doing that.
