00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
What's your favorite movie memory?

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.540
What I mean is,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.560
what's your fondest memory while watching a movie?

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.040
The question came to me this morning when I

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.300
was watching the first episode of Louis C.K.'s

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.200
Horace and Pete.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.100
It's a TV show that he produced on his website

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.880
and it's great.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.460
There's this interesting segment where an old

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.840
man enters their bar.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.240
I'm gonna let the whole scene play out.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.960
I really encourage you to get the first episode if you enjoy this.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.980
My mother would send me here for a pale of beer for my dad.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.760
Other man- Yeah, we used to sell beer pales out the back.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.080
First man- Yeah, and I, I,... I came here to get my first beer.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.640
And I met my wife here.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.320
she was sitting *points* in, in that stool.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:50.160
Yeah, and we were, we were married for- years and *sighs*

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.080
I- I was happy and, um, then I heard that she was sleeping with my best friend

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.320
and so I showed up here one night and- uh- she was sitting in that stool, again,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.000
with my, best friend kissing her.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.040
And, I just shot them both dead.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.920
That was back in 1961.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.760
I just got outta, got outta jail today.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.140
*stifled laughter*

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.820
*stifled laughter*

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.780
*Man cry-laughs*

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.580
NowYouSeeMe- Is that guy really there?

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.140
Other man- Hey, you want a beer?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.020
Man- *croaks* yeah.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.880
So here's my question-

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.040
Was that segment tragic or funny?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.420
I think the first instinct is to find it morbid.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.080
Certainly a man murdering his wife and spending his life in prison is tragic.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.860
But the way it's presented is also comedic.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.860
It's a rollercoaster of events.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.720
I was choking on my morning bagel from laughter at how this story got absurdly worse and worse.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.260
I'm a big believer that the funniest moments are the ones that are also the saddest.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.680
I watched "Daddy's home" the other day and it's fine.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.260
It had some good laughs, but with comedies like "Daddy's home" there's always something missing.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.120
And that brings me to my point, the funniest movies are also the saddest movies.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.560
It's the Tragicomedy.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.200
Hear me out on this one-

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.200
I venture to say that the vast majority of comedy these days

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.580
contains characters who serve no other purpose but to make us laugh.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.760
Stuff like "Bridesmaids" and "Spaceballs"
