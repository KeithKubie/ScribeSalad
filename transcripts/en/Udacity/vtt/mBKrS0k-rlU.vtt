You just saw how Reddit uses external APIs to present some really cool and

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.520
dynamic content from other websites inside their page.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.015
For this quiz, I want you to head over to Yelp.com.

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:13.150
See if you can find out which big name API Yelp is

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.500
using to give users some really useful information about businesses.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.010
Are they using Google Maps, YouTube, Twitter, or Flickr?
