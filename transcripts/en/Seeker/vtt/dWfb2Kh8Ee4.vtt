00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:10.580
Is it possible that all life on earth including
human life originated from alien DNA?

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.960
Hello fellow Alpha Centurians!

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.450
Ian here for DNews to talk about the meaning
of life, kinda.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.810
Let’s cut to the chase: we have a pretty
good idea that life on Earth popped into being

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.699
around three and a half billion years ago.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.150
Sure, back then, life wasn’t particularly
glamorous -- unless being a single-celled

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.980
prokaryote living in a pool of organic goo
is your idea of “glamor” -- but that’s

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.470
how we think our planet's biosphere began.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.440
There is, however, a lot of debate surrounding
how life came to be and where life’s building

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.880
blocks REALLY came from.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.930
Were all the prebiotic chemicals already here
on Earth, laid out like the ingredients to

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.430
a biological cake?

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.420
Or did these chemicals come from elsewhere?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.740
A tantalizing clue recently came from Europe’s
Rosetta mission that has been orbiting Comet

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.710
67P for the past 2 years.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.630
In addition to the incredible number of discoveries
Rosetta has made, the detection of the amino

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.220
acid, glycene in the comet’s coma -- basically
the dusty, gassy atmosphere surrounding the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.810
comet -- has excited astrobiologists.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.540
This is the second comet known to be carrying
the amino acid.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.630
In 2004 it was found on comet Wild-2 (“Vilt-2”),
which is exciting because we know that glycene

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.950
is one of the essential building blocks for
life and we know that finding it in more than

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.380
one place isn’t a fluke.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.429
Not only that, but Rosetta’s comet also
contains other compounds that form the building

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:24.209
blocks of life, including the element phosphorous
that is the backbone of DNA and RNA, reaffirming

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.670
comets as potential “seeds” for life on
planetary bodies.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.200
So we have a pretty good idea that the ingredients
for life can be found anywhere and could be

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.619
transported to habitable worlds via comets.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.689
But what if life ITSELF could be transplanted
from one planet to another?

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.450
This concept is known as “panspermia”
and it’s a hypothesis that really puts your

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.189
imagination into a spin.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.000
For argument’s sake, let’s say life formed
on Earth first.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.989
In the billions of years of evolution, Earth
has been hit by countless massive meteorite

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:51.989
strikes.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.959
Should these impacts have been powerful enough,
chunks of Earth’s crust would have been

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.309
catapulted into space.

00:01:56.309 --> 00:02:00.130
As the planet is covered in life, some of
these chunks of Earth rock would have likely

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.799
had bacteria hitching a ride.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.460
Should these hardy microbes survive for long
enough -- protected deep inside their rocky

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.619
interplanetary vehicle -- could they end up
crashing onto another world, survive the impact

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.040
and take up home?

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.219
This is hypothesis is known as “lithopanspermia”
and though it’s a highly speculative means

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.150
of life hopping from planet to planet, we
do know that rocks have travelled across the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.290
solar system.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.610
For example, Mars meteorites have been found
on Earth -- massive Martian impacts have kicked

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.410
pieces of the red planet into space only for
those samples to fall onto Earth, sometimes

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.519
thousands of years later.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.450
There’s even been some excitement surrounding
the possibility that fossilized bacteria might

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.630
exist within these meteorites, though further
analysis has shown these “fossils” are

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.560
actually just mineral deposits.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.900
Another hypothesis called “necropanspermia”
even suggests that for life to spread from

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.650
planet to planet the organisms in a meteorite
needn’t be alive when they arrive at their

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.370
destination -- their fossilized DNA may create
a template by which organic chemicals can

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.319
latch onto, spawning life.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.849
In this case, rocks that have traveled interstellar
distances may seed life in other star systems.

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.780
And then there’s an even more “out there”
hypothesis that some advanced alien civilization

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.480
seeded protoplanetary disks around young stars
with their own special blend of amino acids

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.760
to create cosmic life in their image.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.959
This sci-fi possibility is called “directed
panspermia.”

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.890
Although there is currently zero evidence
that panspermia is a “thing” we DO know

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.040
that the ingredients for life is everywhere
and it’s possible that the biology that

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.439
kick-started life on Earth didn’t, in fact,
originate here.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.209
If you want to find out how we might be CURRENTLY
polluting the solar system with our germs,

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:43.890
check out my video on dirty Mars rovers:

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:55.580
Do you think life as we know it was actually
seeded from space?

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.769
