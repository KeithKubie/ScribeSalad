carved the world into in-group and

carved the world into in-group and

out-group I do some research on babies

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719
out-group I do some research on babies
 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.660
out-group I do some research on babies
and I would argue that this in-group

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670
and I would argue that this in-group
 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.209

out-group distinction comes naturally

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219
out-group distinction comes naturally

empathy were to be stripped from our

empathy were to be stripped from our
 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.209
empathy were to be stripped from our
heads if you were to take a pill that

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.029
heads if you were to take a pill that
would blot out your empathy you still be

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039
would blot out your empathy you still be
 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.369
would blot out your empathy you still be
biased you still favor yours over the

other group there are many sources of

other group there are many sources of
 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.149
other group there are many sources of
bias they seem to be wired into all of

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159
bias they seem to be wired into all of
 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.720
bias they seem to be wired into all of
our emotions all of our decision-making

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730
our emotions all of our decision-making
 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.670
our emotions all of our decision-making
but empathy is particularly vulnerable

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680
but empathy is particularly vulnerable
 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.060
but empathy is particularly vulnerable
to bias I use the analogy of it as a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070
to bias I use the analogy of it as a
 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.130
to bias I use the analogy of it as a
spotlight and in fact many of the fans

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140
spotlight and in fact many of the fans
 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.230
spotlight and in fact many of the fans
of empathy use it that analogy as well

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240
of empathy use it that analogy as well
 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.090
of empathy use it that analogy as well
because it captures the apparent good at

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100
because it captures the apparent good at
 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.800
because it captures the apparent good at
empathy could do it zooms you in and

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810
empathy could do it zooms you in and
 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.560
empathy could do it zooms you in and
makes you care but a spotlight only

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570
makes you care but a spotlight only
 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.740
makes you care but a spotlight only
illuminates a small area and a spotlight

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750
illuminates a small area and a spotlight
 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.650
illuminates a small area and a spotlight
only illuminates where you point it and

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660
only illuminates where you point it and
 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.840
only illuminates where you point it and
so empathy is exquisitely subject to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850
so empathy is exquisitely subject to
 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.990
so empathy is exquisitely subject to
bias because our bias tells us where the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000
bias because our bias tells us where the
 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.450
bias because our bias tells us where the
spotlight is pointed to I could try to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460
spotlight is pointed to I could try to
 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.610
spotlight is pointed to I could try to
do a rational cost-benefit analysis and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620
do a rational cost-benefit analysis and
 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.530
do a rational cost-benefit analysis and
I could do a pretty good shot at being

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540
I could do a pretty good shot at being
 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.380
I could do a pretty good shot at being
unbiased and fair adding up the people

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390
unbiased and fair adding up the people
 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.120
unbiased and fair adding up the people
who suffer from the people who benefit

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130
who suffer from the people who benefit
 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.000
who suffer from the people who benefit
figuring out a solution but once empathy

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010
figuring out a solution but once empathy
 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.790
figuring out a solution but once empathy
comes into the mix bias is inevitable

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800
comes into the mix bias is inevitable
 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.360
comes into the mix bias is inevitable
and so empathy making decisions based on

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370
and so empathy making decisions based on
 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.640
and so empathy making decisions based on
empathy exaggerated SAR in-group

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650
empathy exaggerated SAR in-group
 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.410
empathy exaggerated SAR in-group
out-group bias it brings it to the fore

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420
out-group bias it brings it to the fore
 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.620
out-group bias it brings it to the fore
and makes it very hard to override so

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630
and makes it very hard to override so
 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.890
and makes it very hard to override so
it's it's a great question what goes on

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900
it's it's a great question what goes on
 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.930
it's it's a great question what goes on
when we're so rotten to other people and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940
when we're so rotten to other people and
 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.960
when we're so rotten to other people and
one ingredient of it I think really is

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970
one ingredient of it I think really is
 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.330
one ingredient of it I think really is
dehumanization it's when we think of the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340
dehumanization it's when we think of the
 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.750
dehumanization it's when we think of the
out-group

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760
out-group
 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.590
out-group
not as a peep

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600
not as a peep
 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.270
not as a peep
but just as things and this doesn't

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280
but just as things and this doesn't
 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.950
but just as things and this doesn't
necessarily motivate cruelty you're not

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960
necessarily motivate cruelty you're not
 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.840
necessarily motivate cruelty you're not
cruel to things you're not cruel to

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850
cruel to things you're not cruel to
 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.720
cruel to things you're not cruel to
nonhumans but it but it motivates a sort

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730
nonhumans but it but it motivates a sort
 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.740
nonhumans but it but it motivates a sort
of moral indifference and so if you want

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750
of moral indifference and so if you want
 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.610
of moral indifference and so if you want
to ignore the fates of people

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620
to ignore the fates of people
 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.810
to ignore the fates of people
dehumanizing them is a great way to do

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820
dehumanizing them is a great way to do
 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.440
dehumanizing them is a great way to do
so I'm somewhat skeptical though about

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450
so I'm somewhat skeptical though about
 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.830
so I'm somewhat skeptical though about
the importance of dehumanization in in

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840
the importance of dehumanization in in
 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.920
the importance of dehumanization in in
in atrocities I used to be I used to

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930
in atrocities I used to be I used to
 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.600
in atrocities I used to be I used to
think this played a huge role I was

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610
think this played a huge role I was
 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.400

argue dehumanization that the core of

argue dehumanization that the core of
all evils but now I'm less certain

all evils but now I'm less certain
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.280
