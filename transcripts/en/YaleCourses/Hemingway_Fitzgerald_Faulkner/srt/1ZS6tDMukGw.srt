1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,900
Just, um, we're gonna install it
and just want to remind you, uh,

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,940
refresh your memory about what we
were talking about before the break.

3
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,300
So we were talking about, uh, first, um,

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,570
the concept of strangers and kindness
of strangers, right? Um, that, um,

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,030
um, that Lena would be a recipient of. Um,

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,410
and then we would harking
about, um, the, um,

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,820
about neighbors and what could come to us,
um,

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,720
from neighbors and not always good things.
Um,

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,900
and high tower is the
recipient of the novel.

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,770
Always good things coming from
our neighbors, but high towers,

11
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:50,810
we also know,
um,

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,910
it's very emphatic that in spite of
what happens to him in spite of the

13
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:59,730
beatings, um, and so on, um,

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,850
that he is actually
surrounded by two people.

15
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:06,990
So it really takes a
tremendous act of willpower,

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,333
um,

17
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,910
to be able to say that. Um, and so
this is the quote from hightower.

18
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,030
They are good people.

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,420
All that any man can hope for is to
be permitted to live quietly among his

20
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:28,100
fellows.
Um,

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,280
so it is a proposition statement that
really is sort of thrown in our face and

22
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:40,370
in the phase of all the things that have
happened to him. Um, so today we'll,

23
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:45,371
I like to do is to use race as the
test case for house proposition.

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,260
We all know that Joe Christmas,
um,

25
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,940
is someone who's racial
identity is ambiguous.

26
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:57,130
I would say from beginning to end.
We don't really know for sure. Um,

27
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,940
what his parentage, um, I mean,
you know, we have some very,

28
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,800
we have good guesses but we don't know
for sure and we certainly don't know the

29
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,840
genetic make up of someone
like Joe Christmas. So in the,

30
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,670
in that context,
um,

31
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,600
I think it's especially relevant to
talk about some of the contemporary

32
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:21,200
discussion of race. Um, and um,

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,790
and this is not even so new. I
mean it was, came out in 2003,

34
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,660
um,

35
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,660
it was the special issues and to make
American whether it raised exist and it

36
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:33,180
makes a strong argument,
um,

37
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,000
that racism is leading in the
sense that we look at the physical

38
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:40,550
characteristics,
the facial features of people,

39
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:45,551
and we assume that res has a very
solid existence that is real.

40
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,890
Um, but actually the facial
characteristics with the
physical attributes do not

41
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:56,660
always correspond to our genetic makeup.
So you know,

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,810
how people look.
Hatchway um,

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,560
it's not a very good way to tell us
who they are are biologically. Um,

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,980
and so the scientific argument,

45
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,010
special issue or that essay is about the
importance of thinking outside of the

46
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,090
box of noticeable,

47
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,800
of servable visible characteristics,
um,

48
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,570
to thinking about medical,
you know,

49
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:23,620
what would come into play in a medical
situation if this is scientific American

50
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,930
after all. Um, so this is,

51
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:30,790
this was back in 2003 and
even earlier than that,

52
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,650
I'm on the front cover of Time magazine
is to face new phase of America.

53
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,840
Um, and it's really about America
becoming mixed race nation. Um,

54
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,790
this is, um, and in find out his case, you
know, I look at, you know, everyone, yeah,

55
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,880
we're not quite often they can't really
tell, you know, what background, uh,

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,020
ethnic background people from,
um, and that is the case.

57
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:57,670
This is computer generated image.
Um, and we don't really know.

58
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,750
She's made up of the trays are many
razors and so it's hard to tell,

59
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:06,910
but just a very typical American face.
Um,

60
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,500
and around the same time
a book came out by um,

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,570
f James Davis called who
is black ash like this. Um,

62
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,590
it was quite an important but when it
came out in 1992 to such an extent that

63
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,900
and its 10th anniversary, PBS
actually did the special program, um,

64
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,790
title who is black and feature that
book. Um, and his argument is very,

65
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,190
very hurt and um, to Faulkner's novel, um,

66
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,110
we don't actually know, um,
who is black and this novel.

67
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,600
So it is a question that is not answer.
Um,

68
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,640
and it'll has not men today and
struggle even at the end of the novel.

69
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,150
And this is, um, um, image that, um,

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,000
as the Tao use for her
section and great section.

71
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,710
I'm very happy to be there. Um, but this
is, um, so I just borrow it from her.

72
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,660
Um, and this is, uh, Ebony
magazine, a quiz, um,

73
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,330
1952 again,

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,830
but even back in 1952,
um,

75
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,350
people were realizing that
if you look at people,

76
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:15,030
you don't really know what race
they are. Um, and so, you know,

77
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,420
I think the most who are as they get
a few wrong answers for that quiz. Um,

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,600
so I think that all of this is just
to set the stage for the ferry,

79
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,790
um, complicated, um,

80
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,850
and maybe not men to be resolve
landscape that Faulkner is set up for us.

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,890
Um, and in light in August. Um,

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,150
and so what I like to talk about today
is the one Nager and of course, you know,

83
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:45,151
that's the word that would have to be
used because just as in the 50 is the word

84
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,460
Negro, uh, was the standard term. Um,

85
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,470
in the twenties and thirties,
a nigger,

86
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,760
whether have been the standard term.
So it was not a racial slur.

87
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,300
They use the word nigger. And, um,

88
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,660
even though it wasn't
necessarily a racial slur,

89
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,920
it nonetheless was a charge appetite.
Um,

90
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,480
it always is,

91
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,580
has carry excessive semantic burden,
um,

92
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,320
and because it carries
excessive semantic good and, um,

93
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,310
it also opens itself up to multiple users.
So today we'll lock,

94
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,830
look at the way that word is being
used by different people in different

95
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:29,960
contexts and for different purposes.

96
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,350
So that will go down and let's change out.
We'll be talking about all of this, um,

97
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,040
and also spoken by other people.
Um,

98
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,090
and also when the words
spoken by the person himself.

99
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,780
So,
um,

100
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,740
just noticed this microphone has
a way of diminishing yourself.

101
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,080
Um, so, um, the,

102
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,980
these are the people that we'll be
looking at who use the word nigger. Uh,

103
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,910
first is,
uh,

104
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,940
Joe Brown and the the dietician a couple
of times and then hide and then Bobby

105
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,970
the waitress, and then join the
burden. And then Joe Christmas himself,

106
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:12,630
he uses the, what negative for
himself. Um, but first let's talk,

107
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,790
look at the way Joel Brown uses that word.
Um,

108
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,380
at this point to arise being questioned
by the shower of rain. So, you know,

109
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,820
we know that,
um,

110
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,880
the join his body has been discovered
and know that the house has burned down.

111
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,950
Um, and the sheriff is
questioning, um, uh,

112
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,980
Joe Brown and um, and there's $1,000, um,

113
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,630
that is up for, you know, anyone
who can help solve the case.

114
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,070
So Joe Brown is who have high hopes
that he will be the one to get $2,000.

115
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:47,330
But as the sheriff questions
in more and more comes out,

116
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,270
it seems as little less analyzed
likely that the thousand dollars,

117
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,410
we'll begin his own pocket.

118
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:56,411
So He's getting desperate and that is
when that word comes up because they said

119
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,710
it was like he had been saving.

120
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,800
He told them next
[inaudible] time is like,

121
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,000
he didn't know that ever come
to a pinch is with this is um,

122
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,630
Brian talent,
my towel,

123
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,810
like in head note that if it come
to a pinch, this would save him,

124
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,110
even if it was almost worse for a white
man to knit what he would have to admit

125
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,750
than to be accused of the murder
itself as right. He said, he says,

126
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,030
go on,
accuse me accused.

127
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:33,610
The white man is trying to help you with
what he knows accused of white men and

128
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,490
let the nigger go free accused to white,
let them nigger run.

129
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,350
So this is the classic race card,
you know,

130
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:47,140
that we recognize so well and
unfortunately it still has some currency.

131
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,160
Um,
and um,

132
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,570
so he's playing the race card
because he's really desperate.

133
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,780
What is really interesting is
how subtle there's portrayed.

134
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,870
Even have someone like Joe Brown who
is sold little saving grace to him.

135
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,990
You know, this is a really someone
who's supremely unlikable. Um,

136
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,990
but even for someone who
is supremely unlikable,

137
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,810
Foglia nonetheless portrays him as
someone who's not incapable of feeling the

138
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,013
shame.
Right?

139
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,350
So it is shameful even for someone like
Joe Brown to use the race car that you

140
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:30,210
know, that this is when he is not,
when there's nothing else he can do,

141
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,560
he would do that.

142
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,040
So he's not such a racist
or such or whatever the,

143
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,660
he is blind to what he's doing.

144
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,830
And so I would say that even though
this is Joe Brown doing one of the

145
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:46,770
despicable things that
he's capable of doing, um,

146
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,340
in the very act of doing that,
um,

147
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,420
he recognizes completely that
he is being despicable. Um,

148
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,320
so this is one kind of self
contained usage, shameful,

149
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,160
shameful, even to the
person who was doing it. Um,

150
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,720
and the next,
uh,

151
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,480
couple of usages or revolving
around the Dietitian.

152
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,630
Um, and we know that, that,
um, Joe Christmas is, um,

153
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,900
in the,

154
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,900
in behind the curtains and watching
this whole scene unfolding between,

155
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,050
um,

156
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,050
the dietician and her bowl and eating
toothpaste and having no idea what's going

157
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:32,310
on outside, but the Dietitian thinking
that he knows everything. So he,

158
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:35,520
she drags him out. Um, and, um,

159
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,080
this is what Joe sees when she drags
him out with phase you no longer smooth

160
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,760
pink and white surrounded now
by wild and disheveled hair,

161
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,990
who's moved bands? Once Megan
things candy, you low rat,

162
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,900
then fear is,
was his new logo rat despite,

163
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,210
I mean you little nigger
past it. Um, so at,

164
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,170
she's never called it that before.
So is it at this moment of x,

165
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,620
Rheem from ability on the part
of the dietician that that would,

166
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:09,260
would come rushing up.
So this,

167
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,300
it has some relation to the Joe Brown
usage in the sense that this is the word

168
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:21,170
that comes out, um, when, when,

169
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,200
when your back is against the
wall basically, you know, um, you,

170
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,250
this is the thing that, that,
that you fling at people. Um,

171
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,780
but the Dietitian actually is more
resourceful than um, Joe Brown.

172
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,510
She last today is, I'm able to use
that word in some other contexts.

173
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,780
So this is the next and storm and after
the word nigger coming out of the mouth

174
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,080
of the Dietitian and she has
something else to offer Joe Christmas

175
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,680
and it's out fresh and upon it,

176
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:01,681
they assume the dollar of voice
when on Bush and tens fast,

177
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,270
a whole dollar city. How was you could
buy something to eat every day for a week.

178
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,850
And that's what of maybe
I'll give you another one.

179
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,600
You seem to see rent tubes of toothpaste,

180
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,930
like word work and listen.
Terrifying.

181
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,520
His whole being coiled and were
rich and passion. That revision.

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,250
I don't want no more. He said,
I don't never want to know more.

183
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:29,860
He said he didn't need to look up
to know what her face looked like.

184
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,360
Now Tau,
she's like,

185
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,960
tell him your little negative
asked of you nigger bastard.

186
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,420
So this is the evolution of the Dietitian,
um,

187
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,460
that she's not so vulnerable now that
she's actually on the verge of going on

188
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,560
the offensive, but not quite because
she'll just wants to make peace.

189
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:55,150
Really. She has ones to have it cut a
deal with Joe Tresona's is basically,

190
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,720
um,

191
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,720
and so what she doesn't understand is
that he doesn't understand the concept of

192
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:05,620
bribery. Um, Joe Prisma is really
interesting. Um, in that way.

193
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,820
He doesn't always understand kindness,
um,

194
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,810
and even doesn't understand the next
thing down. I think it was just bribery.

195
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,090
Um,
and so for him,

196
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:21,091
if the silver dollar just means endless
tubes of toothpaste and can be more,

197
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,740
uh, that can be more repugnant to him. Um,

198
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,800
but he knows enough to know that rejecting
that silver dollar will actually be

199
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:39,901
an automatic guarantee of the appearance
of that worth from the Dietitian.

200
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:46,090
So the pattern is beginning to develop
first complete vulnerability on a pole or

201
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:51,430
the Dietitian, um, then now
of complete vulnerability,

202
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,910
but of something her skin is being
stolen and willingly by Joe Christmas,

203
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,370
and that word comes up again. So
it's just a killer of handy, uh,

204
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,790
while involuntary, but, um,

205
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,860
quite reflective and taught handy almost
in his true Manto usage of that term.

206
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,020
Um,

207
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,020
and we'll move on now to come
see the instrumental light usage.

208
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,840
Right? So with the dietician, they
begins with a nonindustrial mental eyes,

209
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,290
uh, involuntary usage. By the
third time she, she uses that word.

210
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:31,030
It is completely instrumental
eyes and completely calculated.

211
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:36,031
And as when the dietician goes to the
matron of the orphanage and uses that word

212
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,030
and they go one more time,
how does she know about this?

213
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,850
The dietician did not look away.
I didn't, I have no idea at all.

214
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,230
Of course I knew it didn't mean anything.

215
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,010
When the other children called him a
nigger nigger you consider the other

216
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:55,150
children they have been calling
him and they go over for years.

217
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,640
Sometimes I think the children have a
way of knowing things like wrong people,

218
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,750
your and my age don't see it
down to that little detail.

219
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:09,110
People of your age, of your and my age,
they actually are not the same age.

220
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,860
So, um, when you have some of the
using that kind of construction,

221
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,130
you just know that they are
who completely, you know,

222
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,290
the highly manipulative and know
exactly what they're doing. Um,

223
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,250
so that little giveaway
to tell at the end,

224
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:30,251
it's basically just the kind of a smore
is just the icing on the cake of this

225
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,490
racialization, this very deliberate, um,

226
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,040
racialization of Geo prisoners in order
to get them sent away from the off an

227
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:42,470
edge. Um, so the dietician
I would say is probably,

228
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,920
um, you know, it's right up there
in my mind along with Joel Graph,

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,330
uh, in terms of unlikeability, uh,

230
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,880
but she is better I think,
um,

231
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,410
at what she is doing and it's just
so she was like six succeeds in, um,

232
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,140
in pinning that adverts hat,
uh, on Joel Christmas. Um,

233
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,170
and so this is really the first thing
that we should say about their habitat is

234
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:12,650
that it is something
that someone else can,

235
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,510
it doesn't really rule from inside your,
um,

236
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,600
it is knowledge nanotech attribute
about you as an attribution is not an

237
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,610
internal genetic congenital attribute.

238
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,520
It is an attribution Dennis
foisted upon you. Um,

239
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,580
and that is what the dietician
is doing right there.

240
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,920
So, um, that's,

241
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,650
that is the usage of the word
nigger on one side of the spectrum,

242
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,050
joke Brown.
And that vision,

243
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,110
and now we'll move on to the other and
the spectrum when his sheer agony to use

244
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,350
that look for. By the time the
dietician uses the word last time,

245
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,620
she was actually very
good at what she's doing.

246
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,170
It doesn't really touch her anymore.

247
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,290
It's just completely distance yourself
and therefore able to manipulate at work.

248
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,630
But um,

249
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,350
here is on the other side of the spectrum
and someone who simply cannot have

250
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:13,130
that distance from that word.
And so it was an agonizing usage.

251
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,160
And this comes out in the context
of the conversation between,

252
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,270
um, uh, between hightower
and Byron and Byron,

253
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:25,520
this telling him about
this new development,

254
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,290
about it burning down the house,
join his body and so on. Uh,

255
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,760
but also about Christmas,
Christmas about yesterday and Christmas,

256
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,940
Christmas is on nigger about
him and Brian yesterday

257
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,250
[inaudible] I'd houses,

258
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,910
it's always announce the Leighton Trilio
[inaudible] bloom falling into silence

259
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,320
without a sound,
without any weight.

260
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,860
He does not move for a moment longer.

261
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,950
He does not move then the sales to come
over his whole body as if it's paws.

262
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:07,191
When mobile life phase features that
shrinking and denial and baron sees that

263
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:13,251
the still flattered big phase
is done lists like with sweat,

264
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,090
but his voice is light and calm.
What about prisoners? And Brian,

265
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,070
yesterday he said,

266
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:26,140
so it is that other disparity
between the bodily gesture,

267
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,540
the facial expression,
that bodily expression, um,

268
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,770
high tower and the still control,

269
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,820
lightness of tone is bad,

270
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:46,010
is what gives the hideout away.
Um,

271
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,660
bad not only is

272
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,570
the possibility of Joel
Christmas being black now,

273
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,480
not only is there the most
terrifying of possibilities,

274
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,960
but their sole terrify take really
afford to her knowledge is gravity,

275
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,630
right? So it's not as that, it's just
terrible, but he can't even men too.

276
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,710
It is that double double combination
that suggests just have rave.

277
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:16,790
The situation is,
um,

278
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,040
because the high Mao and knows
exactly what's going to happen.

279
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,880
And once the question
of race comes into play,

280
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,870
there's probably just one
outcome. Um, you know,

281
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,550
he knows it from his own personal history,
from what has happened to him,

282
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,330
to his coat, um, and there was
really nothing compared with this.

283
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,320
So it's just a terrible scenario.
Um,

284
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,560
the endpoint of what she can already
see and that's why he's behaving in this

285
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,170
particular way. Um, but this is also
a point, the kind of the division,

286
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,570
the lightness or tone it and accomplish
involuntary shrinking as well. And,

287
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,290
and just just, um,
just, just um, you know,

288
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,620
just just kind of devastation
that's kind of coming over, um,

289
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,060
hide how it points to the doubleness
of try talent. Another thing is world.

290
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,360
I'm talking about this
as a slight digression,

291
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,660
but thought that was really fairly
emphatic about the two phases of Itel.

292
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,850
Um, I think that sometimes we tend
to see him too much as a victim, um,

293
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,140
and certainly was hammered to him,
um,

294
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,600
and vices to think of him as just
a victim of his neighbors violence,

295
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,600
but fathers and felt it
from beginning to end.

296
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,980
The his two faced his face
is this one go on and flabby.

297
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,560
It is as though there were two phases,

298
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,110
one imposed upon the other.

299
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Looking out from believe the Peo boss
scouts rather by fringe agree here from

300
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:48,561
behind the twin motionless glares or this
battery goes down to the twin glares.

301
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,070
Misbeck nickel until the earliest moment.

302
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,100
We know that means coming off the children
and reporters were taking a picture

303
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:57,700
of him and they took a picture of him
from the sign. It looks like Satan, um,

304
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,890
down to this moment.
Um,

305
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,690
when this lightness of tone is belied by
the involuntary shrinking of his body,

306
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,030
um, hide how it seems to be the meeting
place for two contradictory impulses.

307
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,610
Um, and so we can also say that, you know,

308
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,150
metaphorically he is also the meeting
place for the goodness of strangers and

309
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:20,950
the brutality of your neighbors.

310
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,960
He really is a kind of unresolved meeting
place for those two cross Cameron's

311
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,530
um, and so, but right
now, right there, um,

312
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,350
he's trying his best to trivialize that
event right in and say that it really is

313
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,430
nothing at RBS is of no
consequence. Um, we'll,

314
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,000
we'll get one coming now to Bali,
the waitress,

315
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,040
we look at one instance,

316
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:50,070
another instance of someone trying to
trivialize that that fact the possibility

317
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,710
that joke would be black.
So this is the two of them lying,

318
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,030
lying in bed. Um, and he
makes this confession.

319
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,900
I got some negative [inaudible] then
she'd be publicly still with the different

320
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:10,900
stillness.
The heat in our seem to notice it.

321
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,740
He laid peacefully to his hands,
low up and down and flat.

322
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,710
You're what you said? I think I got
some negative blood on his hands.

323
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,850
His eyes would close his hands
go and see thing. I don't know.

324
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:29,280
I believe I have, she did not move.
She said the ones you're lying.

325
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,200
Alright. He said not moving
his hand, not seizing.

326
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,140
I don't believe that who voice
said in the darkness. Um,

327
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,970
so you know,

328
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:44,971
I think that the Foglight is going out
of his way to make this a very peaceful

329
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,800
scenario.

330
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:53,010
So this is the equivalent of their
likeness of tone that hide how has using,

331
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,050
when he's facing the possibility,

332
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,000
the joke prisoners is black and here Joe,

333
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,900
Mrs Making that concession itself
but really doesn't know. Um,

334
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,050
but all in emphasis here is
on how peaceful the stain is.

335
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,870
Just stroking her. He doesn't stop
when he makes that confession.

336
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,850
So it's as if nothing is happening.

337
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,750
It wants to create the illusion
that nothing is happening,

338
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,830
but actually everything is happening,
right?

339
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,020
So the waitress bobbies reaction goes
along with the pretense that this was

340
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:33,270
really nothing she can completely,
she's not going to believe in it.

341
00:23:33,271 --> 00:23:37,330
There's nothing to it.
Um, but we also know that,

342
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,530
that that takes a lot of
willpower, that, that assertion.

343
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,110
I don't believe it. Others not
into it. You're just imagining it,

344
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,560
all those statements as they take a lot
of willpower to say and how official

345
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,660
that the surgeon is becomes clear
when something else happens.

346
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,470
Um, and then body uses the
word nigger at one more time.

347
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:07,740
This time in a completely different
tone of voice is, um, there's,

348
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,750
there's much later when
Joe has killed within his,

349
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:17,820
killed his first foster father
in the kitchen accidentally. Um,

350
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,400
and now he's going to see body one more
time and now they know that they have to

351
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:24,920
leave, that they're in big trouble. Um,

352
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,530
so this is a moment of duress.

353
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,330
The equivalent of the dietitians duress,

354
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,890
the equivalent of Joe Brown's duress.

355
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,190
And this is what body says under duress.

356
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,940
It was very much like it
had been in the schoolhouse.

357
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,830
Someone holding her as she
struggled and Sri for hair,

358
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,470
wild who the joking and passing the phase,

359
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,500
even her mouth and contrast their hair
as still as a bad mouth in a death face

360
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,660
pastor's son of a bitch getting made
into a jam that always truly you like a

361
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:01,280
white man,
a white man.

362
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,050
Perhaps John did not hear
or not a screaming waitress.

363
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,290
He told me himself he was
nigger the son of a bitch.

364
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,690
Me F worth for nothing.

365
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,590
The negatives and the verbage that
would get me in a jam with club Harper

366
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,140
police. Um, so this is um,

367
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,730
this is not by design,
it is involuntary usage,

368
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,120
but it is to Helen that that's the word
that all of us or at least every single

369
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:35,660
one,
every single character in light in August,

370
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,730
which for that is the word that would
come in voluntarily into our mouths when

371
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:44,420
we are under duress.
Um,

372
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:49,540
it also says that no matter what good
intentions we have or how much willpower

373
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,460
we hope to bring to bear
on a racialized situation,

374
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:01,060
that that will power is always going
to be an equal to the terrible wait

375
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,620
semantic weight that comes with that
words that every individual effort to

376
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,910
lighten or trivialize that appetite
area town to make light of it.

377
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,510
It's going to fail.

378
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,800
There's as Polly and now than possible
meaning for worldwide in artists that

379
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:26,801
this is an town of various people to
make light of the phenomenon of race and

380
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:32,120
are succeeding. Um, so, um, this, um,

381
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,830
the Bobby is, is in
that sense not even, uh,

382
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,960
especially interesting character
on their own other than, um,

383
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,310
as a kind of a dramatize and
concentrated version of the suit,

384
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:50,311
the involuntary reactions and involuntary
usage of that word when we are

385
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,110
ourselves under the rest, um, below
these are really quite marginal,

386
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,080
thicker hide. How isn't um, isn't
all that marginal. But, um, he,

387
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,160
uh,

388
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,160
his reaction is in many ways is an
entry point into his psychology,

389
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,650
but there's one person for whom the
word nigger is front and center.

390
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:15,720
And, and in many ways, um,

391
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:20,630
she is more extreme to be
a generalized case. So, um,

392
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,580
faculty uses join of burden,
um,

393
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,760
as a fairly atypical case of thinking for
emotional response to the word nigger.

394
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,110
Um, that is in many ways on
the far end of the spectrum.

395
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:41,730
The nonetheless refers on the medium
on me and have that spectrum. Um,

396
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,760
but she has this very extreme notion
of what the word nigger mean is,

397
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:50,120
which is that it is an eternal curse.
Um,

398
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,250
and the context of which is the death
of her grandfather and her half brother

399
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,640
Calvin.
Okay.

400
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So her grandfather and her half brother
Calvin were killed by a white person.

401
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,430
They were killed by,
to torrid.

402
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,150
So there's no forget that they will not
kill by black girls and they were killed

403
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:13,320
by way person.

404
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,710
But this is the account that Joanne or
with Gif of the reason why the two of

405
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:22,410
them are killed.
Oh,

406
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:25,860
this is what her father says to her.

407
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,370
Your grandfather and brother aligned.

408
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:34,080
They're murdered now by one white man,
but by the curse,

409
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,140
which got put on the whole race before
your grandfather or your brother or me or

410
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,120
you ever thought of race,

411
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:48,150
Dune and cause to be forever and ever a
part of the weight reasons do and curse

412
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,330
for us since remember that his doom and
his clothes forever and never mind your

413
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:57,300
mother's yours.
Even though you are a child,

414
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,510
the curves of every white child that was
born and that ever will be born now can

415
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:03,984
escape it.

416
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:09,110
This is about as thorough
going occurs as could be.

417
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:14,210
It's basically comprehensive cover all
the bases covers every single member of

418
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:20,050
the white race and it goes on for an
eternity that occurs when there were go

419
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:20,520
away.

420
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,520
So why is it that when two white people
are killed by another white person,

421
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:30,000
that that is the case of
the coast of the black race.

422
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,960
That is a really interesting bit of logic,
but um,

423
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,740
doing his father and is firmly
convinced that that is the case,

424
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:42,340
that if they had not been
blacks in this world,

425
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,140
um, [inaudible] is true if
they had not been blessing.

426
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,870
And as well, the rand father and Calvin
would not have been killed pastor Torres.

427
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,350
So even though it seems like a strange
kind of logic once you spell it out in

428
00:29:56,351 --> 00:30:01,090
that way, actually it is a strange
when as truthful statement I think.

429
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,493
Um,

430
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,530
and this was how Joanna
Russ interpretation of
that statement elaboration,

431
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,160
um,
on that image of eternal,

432
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,090
of raised as an internal occurs
on the bladder obviously,

433
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,180
but also on the waste as well.

434
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,660
And given her fathers with her
father says [inaudible] uh,

435
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,730
this is what she herself things.

436
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,880
But after that I seen to see
them relax for the first time,

437
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,440
not as people but as a thing,
a shallow in which I live,

438
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,890
we lived or when people are other people.

439
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,240
I've thought of all the children coming
forever and never and into the world

440
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,830
wait with the blast,

441
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:48,640
shallow already falling upon
them before they air to breath.

442
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:54,270
And I seem to see the black shadow in
the shape of a cross and they seemed like

443
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:59,461
the white babies were struggling even
before the two Braf to escape from the

444
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:04,561
shower who was not only upon them but
being leave them to flung up like the arms

445
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:09,550
were flung up as if they
were nailed to the cross.

446
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,840
I saw all of the little babies
than would ever be in the world.

447
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:19,170
The ones not yet even born a long line
of them with upon spread on the black

448
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:25,480
cross. So this is a modern
interpretation of Christopher sick of,

449
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,840
of, of the reason and
high res being crucified.

450
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:34,470
And it turns out that according
to join her and her father,

451
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,740
that the dynamics of race and the legacy
of slavery is such that wise will be

452
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,140
crucified apart the black cross for,

453
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,080
for as long as they live for as long
as they are human beings on earth.

454
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,280
Susan extravagant claim. Um, but,

455
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,320
um,
and it's predicated on the notion,

456
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,120
um, then in some sense,
this is summary of our,

457
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:11,440
that we're seeing so far,

458
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:17,130
which is that the ratio appetite is in
fact and habitat that offers which for

459
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,470
him voluntarily when we are under arrest,
right?

460
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,870
So it's almost a kind of psychological
necessity for us to call someone the

461
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:32,650
whack, um, that of us as human beings.

462
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:37,830
And because our hours are under
duress so much of the time,

463
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,600
there's just no way to have weighing
in uninjured as some of the time, uh,

464
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,470
because they're such good chances for
all of us to be under different. Yes.

465
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,190
They also good chances for all of
us to call someone back. Right?

466
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,280
We're just need to,

467
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:58,190
to make that kind of
attribution, um, to someone.

468
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,120
Um,

469
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,120
and it's because of that basic human
psychological need that the relations

470
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:10,430
between the races so called races,
even though the membership of each one,

471
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:11,870
there's always going to be in flood,

472
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,340
but the relation between
the simple certain races,

473
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,610
that relation is always
going to be fraught,

474
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,970
always going to be terrible relation.
Um,

475
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,420
and that's why according to Joe Hannah,

476
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,510
the is not just as black
shadow falling on white babies,

477
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:33,570
but she actually go so far as to say that
that shadow is underneath them as well.

478
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,390
It is an incredibly detailed all
encompassing black challenge basically

479
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:42,420
envelops. Everyone is on top
of you, is underneath view,

480
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,560
your arms has flung out and
the follows the con, you know,

481
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:50,240
the shape of your arms
basically completely envelops
every image of you. Um,

482
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,970
there's no escape from that black coast.

483
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,820
So this is a really incredible claim.
Um,

484
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,900
and I think that it's helpful in order
to contextualize their claim to think

485
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:06,700
about the burden
genealogy. So this is, um,

486
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:12,710
another, you know, this unsure father
with the objective is kind of schematic,

487
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:16,400
um, uh, summary. But
this is what we have, um,

488
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,460
that it starts off the Berlin genealogies
does have for someone called the

489
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,250
[inaudible] Burlington.
It's changed to burden, uh,

490
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,290
by Calvin burden,

491
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,250
who has a Huguenot quit
Protestant white from friends.

492
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,620
Um, and then, um,

493
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:37,900
Nathaniel burden to and his
father with two ways, uh,

494
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,260
the Mexican wife,
um,

495
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,020
or Joanna and why from New Hampshire
who is joining this actual mother.

496
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,920
And then in Kelvin burden, his son, um,

497
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:53,000
first son kill, buys a Torres around
the grandfather and then a book.

498
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,080
And so this is their,
um,

499
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,500
put in genealogy and we'll see that,
um,

500
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,660
two names are being repeated
twice, right? So the name,

501
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,280
the Fangio appears twice and they,

502
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,810
Calvin appears twice.

503
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,810
Definitely foreign of
loves to play with names.

504
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:16,811
So this is another instance of the non
trivial play with names because we all

505
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:23,891
know who Calvin is and he is everything
to say about originally was thin and

506
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:27,980
predestination. Um, John Calvin wreck,

507
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:32,100
they're looking like someone who would
make that kind of felt stigma about

508
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:36,110
originals. Then, um, and
this is his treaters, um,

509
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:40,290
hell than institutes of
the Christian division. Um,

510
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,530
and this is what he
says about original sin.

511
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Original sin therefore seems to be a
hereditary depravity and corruption of our

512
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:55,190
nature diffused into all the possible.

513
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,540
There's so push first
makes us liable to cause.

514
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,600
So it doesn't really actually take the
reprehensible action of anyone for us to

515
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,940
be liable to cause rough, um, that Ashley,

516
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,950
we inherit them then pull.
The thing is that it is hereditary.

517
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:25,010
It is passed on from one generation to
another without the full vision of a

518
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:30,240
person upon which is visited and,
uh,

519
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:35,160
without even necessarily
and the reprehensible action
on the poet on whom a dad

520
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,490
original sin it's visited.
It simply,

521
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,460
it's something that is
passed on automatically from
one generation to another.

522
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,570
So this,
um,

523
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,600
this long standing tradition of thinking
about an evil that we can escape,

524
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,440
um, that we're just in, in
voluntarily signed up, you know,

525
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:58,440
onto the school legacy of evil
and punishment of course. Um,

526
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,320
and so this was one I would say,
you know,

527
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:06,350
this is Joanna's genealogy and this
was also partly Faulkner's genealogy as

528
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:12,470
well. He's, when the sailing
is a calendars based on
very, very interesting, um,

529
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,680
in this kind of thinking,
of course that is transmitted across time,

530
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,240
across generations.
Um,

531
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:24,270
but there's another
party to this genealogy,

532
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,310
um,
that Daniel Hawthorne,

533
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:29,390
we're rarely have seen how
important Hawthorne is.

534
00:37:29,391 --> 00:37:34,391
And it turns out it really is the figure
and was of longstanding relevance to

535
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:38,610
fatten her up. So the hearth
on Faulkner connection. Uh,

536
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,680
we know that in the scholar leather,

537
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,530
there's the revenant dems there of who
convinced the devil tree with Hesta print.

538
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,970
Um,
and as a laid iron,

539
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:52,971
just a reverence Whitfield who commits
adultery with adding so that with feel,

540
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,810
oh, and with your Ashlyn making a speech
that sounds almost like themselves,

541
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,770
a speech at the end of
the sky, never. And, um,

542
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,750
then we in light and artist named
Nathaniel this resurrected one more time,

543
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,700
it's almost as if fabulous
just paying this kind of the,

544
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,960
this lovely tribute to an author who's
been very, very important to him.

545
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,770
Um, and so, um,

546
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:24,120
given the fact that, um, that, that,

547
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,910
that, that the whole, that
connection is actually a connection,

548
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:34,040
um, by way of the skull. The other, um,

549
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,060
which is in some sense a novel,

550
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,160
not just about sin,
some kind of sin in passing,

551
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,540
um, that nobody that, you know,

552
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,730
demonstrate was only can shake off and
maybe has drew can shake off either the

553
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,790
sin that will stick to you and
follow you wherever you go. Um,

554
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,140
is not really just about that,

555
00:38:56,141 --> 00:39:01,141
but there's also about sexual depravity
or sexual license to some extent,

556
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,420
even though that is not
representative at all, um,

557
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,310
in the scout weather and not really
represented in any ddos in both those

558
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,650
novels, in both the scarlet
letter and as I lay dying, um,

559
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,460
the sexual licenses on the gesture
that we know, the outcome of that,

560
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,000
uh,

561
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
of that elicit sexuality in the sense
that we see has to a village of a dog pull

562
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,420
in the sky letter and we see
addys it legitimate son Joel,

563
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,410
uh, in this also connection between
Pearl and jewel as well. Um,

564
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,740
we see has to,

565
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,460
as we see at is a legitimate son,

566
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,440
Jude in SLA done. But in
both those novels, um,

567
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,140
the social license is not
really represented, is not
part of the novel in um,

568
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,760
the light in August after we,
um,

569
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,390
we do see that sexual
license front and center. Um,

570
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:00,450
and what makes this even more complicated
is that is mapped onto the platform of

571
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,440
ways.

572
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,070
So it is weird combination of uh,

573
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,780
uh,
believe in Calvin is original sin,

574
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,200
comfortable with sexual wireless
on their part of Joanne,

575
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,940
that burden.
Um,

576
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,540
and that is when the
word new row comes out.

577
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:24,340
This is yet another device,

578
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,400
sashes context for the
use of the word Negro now.

579
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:34,711
And then she put the Tris beneath so much
rumps our grounds where he would find

580
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:39,490
her a negative or with her clothing,

581
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,520
have time to ribbons upon
her in the whilst froze with
an inflammation mania and

582
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:49,950
Barney gleaming in the slow shifting
from one to another of such informally

583
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,440
you're writing attitudes and gestures
as a Beardsley of the time of petroleum.

584
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,260
My hair dryer,

585
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,880
she would be wild in the close feeling
half dark without was with her wild here.

586
00:41:03,371 --> 00:41:07,660
And each strand of which we seem to
come alive. Like October's tentacles,

587
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,980
wow. Pant who really Negro, the Negro.

588
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,350
So it might seem in comprehensible than
someone like John and let her spends all

589
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:22,351
the time trying to help blacks in the
south who would is on a board of a dozen,

590
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,230
uh,
charities and schools.

591
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:31,350
Black schools are basically if dedicated
and her entire life to racial uplift

592
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:37,010
should be doing this. Um, but
I think that it actually is,

593
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,460
I think as far as far as concern,

594
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:44,770
this incredible sexual license actually
goes hand in hand with a belief in

595
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:48,530
Calvinist predestination,
right?

596
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,840
If you really believe that you are
going to be stuck with the originals,

597
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:55,610
then that that is going to be upon you,

598
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:59,120
that black shadow is going to be
upon you no matter what you do,

599
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:04,450
then it really doesn't matter what
you do is aware kind of of, of,

600
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:08,240
of granting of lies. And is
that, you know, if all this,

601
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,060
if you're going to be evil anyway,
no matter what you do,

602
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,950
that you might as well actually be
evil and your conduct as well. Uh,

603
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,400
it's something of that logic.
Uh,

604
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,120
but I don't even think that this
is as large and complex that they,

605
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:22,800
there's just for, is
just the two sides, um,

606
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,830
of Joanna.
Um,

607
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:28,940
and maybe that just as
high tower has two phases.

608
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Joanna clearly has two phases
and the whole tradition,

609
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:39,750
the Calvinist tradition also
has two phases. Um, and,

610
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:44,570
and that is really foreclose
a contribution to thinking
about this particular

611
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,390
card, uh, theology. Um,

612
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,910
but what we also know that this is,

613
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:54,020
that thought my tenants to stick in all
kinds of weird details, um, into this.

614
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:57,810
Otherwise, you know, kind of,
um, just kind of food rest, um,

615
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,270
description of centralizing some,
the hydro, he also has kind of,

616
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:07,790
we're kind of references
to two other traditions.

617
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:12,460
One is, um, be late and the other
is patrolling areas. So, um,

618
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,420
this is be as laid,
the famous illustrator [inaudible].

619
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,120
Um, there's a Salamay, um,

620
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:25,370
showing human beings in this kind
of very erotic and wow gestures.

621
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:30,020
Um, there's, uh, another
illustration for Oscar was, so,

622
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:34,910
I mean, and, um, a full
portfolios. Um, it,

623
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,270
um, this is, uh, actually,
uh, not quite a novel,

624
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:41,560
sort of a beginning of a novel.
Um,

625
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,480
is about to,
um,

626
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:49,130
Petrolia is the writer
as Taryn can. Um, it,

627
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,050
the reason that is related to, um,
to the Falkland novels of them,

628
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,930
um, is that, especially
in light in August,

629
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,960
is that this novel early novel is about
to foreigners with Greek sounding names

630
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:09,190
and Coby is and gets in,
in southern Italy, right?

631
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,200
So this is the first instance
of northerners going south
and quite Yankees going

632
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:19,980
themselves. And as I said, a
bit but similar dynamics. Um,

633
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,000
and Joanna knows that and her father
and the whole family knows that they're

634
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,490
headed as Yankees and Cabo back
business we've seen last time.

635
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,940
So the whole dynamics of people from one
region going south and being hated by

636
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:37,230
the logos. Um, but in this case,

637
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:41,850
there's this additional complication
that this is a very coal,

638
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,030
no going to the heart itself.

639
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:50,060
And in some instances
being heated up by that,

640
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,740
uh, tropical environment, uh,

641
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,380
but basically staying cold
at heart. So this is, uh,

642
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,840
the pendulum swing of Joanna from that
incredible sexualizes to the other side.

643
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,040
And she also,
interestingly enough,

644
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,870
she also uses the word Negro
in that context. When she
swings to the other side,

645
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,890
she was sitting place still on the bed.

646
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,550
Her hands on her land is
still New England phase.

647
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,060
It was still the face of a
spinster prominently bond long,

648
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,780
a little thin,

649
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:33,050
almost men like in contrast to it who
Lombardi was more originally in softly and

650
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:39,731
more than ever though she
said at home using detach,

651
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:45,380
impose a full measure
even to a bastard child.

652
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,730
I would like to see fathers in faces.
Um,

653
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,730
the sentence I think is really interesting
that what is in the parenthesis,

654
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:58,720
the still face, it has been in
store and then the animal body. Um,

655
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,540
and kind of perfect summary
of the two size of Joanna.

656
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,823
Um,

657
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:10,250
and there's even for five new very
ungainly syntax of deliberate syntax.

658
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,540
Um, and then the last part of that, um,

659
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:19,610
the Bastard Negro child and it
is not accidental that there's,

660
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:22,680
is the moment the Salish
is invoking Calvin,

661
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,890
I would like to see
farther than it was fairs.

662
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,120
And Calvin's Faitas is almost as if
this is the Neil, the 20th century,

663
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,180
in addition to the scar,

664
00:46:31,181 --> 00:46:36,181
that level in a new 20th century addition
to long standing theology of cal.

665
00:46:36,651 --> 00:46:39,930
And the, this is what
happened when you, when you,

666
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,230
when you inherit from
those two traditions, um,

667
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:46,940
is that you both do good by, um, you know,

668
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,930
by supposedly helping, uh,
blogs. But then you also, um,

669
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,760
engage in this,
uh,

670
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:59,250
uncontrollable sexual orgy with that.
Um,

671
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,050
and the, the, the, the, um,

672
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,220
the best and Negro child is,
is,

673
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:10,970
is this kind of also involuntary
outcome of the Union of those two sides.

674
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:16,200
Um, so, you know, as sort
of easy to, it's the wild.

675
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:20,700
Joanna is not going to be an easy
person for German prisoners to deal with

676
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:22,950
regularly. I, anyone, uh,

677
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,430
with have hard time trying to negotiate,

678
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,740
trying to deal with someone like that.
Um,

679
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,860
and Joe Christmases responds is lack this.

680
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,263
Um,

681
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,320
at this point in either wanted to go to
school once in to study law with a black

682
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:48,601
lawyer and wants to turn over all the
lens of all the money that she has in.

683
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:52,580
It's quite, it's not insignificant. Um,

684
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,480
[inaudible] that all the money to him,

685
00:47:55,481 --> 00:48:00,010
and this is his response to school.
His mouth said a negative school.

686
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:04,170
Me, yes, that you can go to
Memphis, you can read them,

687
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:05,800
bought in people's office.

688
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:10,030
He would teach you long and about a
lot in the office with a neighbor,

689
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,040
lawyer. His mouth said yes. Then I
would turn over all the business to you,

690
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:18,880
all the money of it so that when you
need money for yourself, you could,

691
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,670
you will know how lawyers
know how to do it.

692
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:26,620
So he would be helping them out of
darkness and number accused of loving you

693
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:31,300
even if they found out. But a nigger
in college and niggers lawyer,

694
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,410
his voice had quiet,
not even argumentative,

695
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,960
just prompted there.

696
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:41,020
We're not looking at one another and
she had not looked up since he entered.

697
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,630
Tell them, tell them niggers
to them and they go it to, um,

698
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,470
incident. Essentially, this is
a moment when Joanna is boat,

699
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:54,730
completely tone deaf. Um, but also, uh,

700
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,100
just really sad,
you know,

701
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,390
just incredibly sad person that,
um,

702
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:04,420
this is the best that she can do for him
to choose to, a little embarrassed to.

703
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,270
She's offered a bribe him as well,
just trying to say, you know,

704
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,830
I'm going to turn over
all the money to you. Um,

705
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,000
and it really doesn't matter
if you study along, you know,

706
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,020
the way how to use the money for, you
know, for your own pleasure really.

707
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,050
She's can really spread,
goes up to say that word,

708
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,250
but that's about as she
wants to do the most for him.

709
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:26,170
And she would not admit to it,

710
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,310
she would not name what
she's turning over to them.

711
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,260
So all that your lips or the
of those unfinished sentences,

712
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:37,700
she was both tone deaf and bill also
actually at the maximum point of,

713
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:40,900
of goodwill and love,

714
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:45,901
maybe even towards him wanting to do the
most fan and his way of responding is,

715
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:53,470
but being too holy.
Ironic about the work in there.

716
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,330
So I think that the least and
have the, about her as well. Um,

717
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:03,070
so I think that we can say
that when the word Nigger, um,

718
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,900
is used in that context,
it's also a moment of psychological,

719
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,381
the rest.

720
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:13,060
And maybe he just even can
bear to knowledge the fact
that she actually wants to

721
00:50:13,061 --> 00:50:14,500
do so much for him.
You know,

722
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:18,860
I think that that would be one way to
read that that is actually not, um,

723
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:23,250
a moment when there's no love fellow
that, you know, that, that, that,

724
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:26,280
that is, that romance
is over, is not that,

725
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:28,430
but then maybe it's too much.

726
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:33,431
And that the way the key is responding
to that is by being told is cynical,

727
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:38,450
is a terrible in their
eye about the whole thing.

728
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:42,640
So the state is really open
to any number of readings. Um,

729
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:47,710
all we know that it is definitely not an
innocent word when it's used by oneself

730
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,350
that is asked which hodge,
um,

731
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:55,100
and is painful to use as when
there's a tribute to oneself.
