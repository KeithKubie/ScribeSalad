00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.430
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.940 position:69%
&gt;&gt; And I'll be the host for today's session.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.070 position:59%
And as you may know, this program is
part of a series of webinars connected

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.250 position:73%
to the library's exhibition, Echoes of the
Great War: American Experiences of World War I,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.970
which is on view here at the
library through January of 2019.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.920
Today's presentation will
last approximately 30 minutes.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880 position:66%
There's time after that for our presenter,
Sahr Conway-Lanz to answer questions.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.390
Please note that you can
communicate with us by the chat.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.020 position:72%
If you've already introduced yourself, that's
great, and if you haven't please take a minute

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.310
to tell us who you are and
where you're joining from.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.270
It's also a chance for you to
test out how the chat works.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.330 position:70%
Make sure you're sending to all participants.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.880
There's a little chat icon at
the top of the WebEx event center

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.830 position:59%
that you can click to access the chat.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.050 position:70%
Again, submit questions throughout the
session and Sahr will answer them at the end.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.530
If you have technical questions,
please send a message

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.360
to Cathy McWiggin who's our
technical host for the day.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.840
We'll be recording today's
session which will then be posted

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.690
on the library's website once
the program has been captioned.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.050
So today's presenter, as I
mentioned, is Sahr Conway-Lanz.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.050 position:69%
He's a historian in the manuscript division.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.220 position:73%
He holds a PhD in history from Harvard
University and is co-curator of the exhibition,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.450 position:75%
Echoes of the Great War, and is also the curator

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.290
for the Woodrow Wilson papers
here at the library.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.260
Sahr's talk is titled, Woodrow
Wilson Chooses War.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.180
Thanks so much, Sahr, for
being here and presenting.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.000
I'll pass it to you to take over.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Naomi.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.720
And thanks to the rest of
you for joining us today.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.800 position:67%
As Naomi mentioned, I work as a historian
in the manuscript division helping to build

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.970
and facilitate use of the
library's archival collections --

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.090 position:56%
personal, family, and organizational
papers of lasting historical value.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.730
I specialize --

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.310 position:67%
In the library's Foreign Policy, Military,
and International Collections concerning --

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.710 position:67%
The 20th and 21st century American history.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.470 position:58%
Since one of the collections I curate
is the papers of Woodrow Wilson,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.710 position:72%
I'm glad to have this opportunity to talk
with you about Woodrow Wilson and his decision

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.930 position:70%
to lead the United States into World War One.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.820
Give me just one second.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.520 position:59%
I'm catching up with the presentation.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.350
Alright. There we go.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.120
So we know that President
Woodrow Wilson chose war in 1917,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.360 position:58%
as the Atlanta Journal shows us here.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.210 position:66%
But you may be surprised that even experts
are not terribly confident about why, how,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.200
or when Wilson changed his mind and
decided to lead the United States

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.770
from the three-year-long policy of
neutrality in the first World War

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.530 position:67%
to a a policy of full-fledged belligerency.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.210 position:72%
The entire question of why the United States
entered World War I many today have forgotten,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.730
and for good reason.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.240
The explanations are not
easy to understand today,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.950
at least not the way historians
have often explained them.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.870
I want to try and do three things
with this talk: explore the mystery

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.730 position:63%
of Woodrow Wilson's decision, examine
what Wilson and others said was at stake

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.090 position:64%
in choosing war, and explain its
significance for them, hopefully in terms

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.640 position:70%
that will be more easily grasped by us today.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.780 position:66%
I also want to discuss the relation of the
collections here at the library and a few

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.630
of the items in the exhibit --
all items that I'm showing are

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.540 position:72%
from the exhibit -- to those larger questions.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.800 position:73%
Let us start with the question of why we don't
have more confidence in the answers to the why,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800 position:67%
how, and when of Wilson's decision for war.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.670 position:67%
After all, the Library of Congress has a
very large collection of Wilson's papers --

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.780
about 600 feet of them if you
line up the files on a shelf.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.660
Almost 300,000 documents.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.760 position:67%
Drawing largely but not exclusively from
the papers here at the Library of Congress,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.470 position:75%
Princeton professor Arthur Link spent 35 years
editing Wilson's papers and published 69 volumes

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.260
of primary source material on
Wilson's life and presidency.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.780
With all this source material,
how can anyone possibly be unsure

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.360
about such a momentous decision?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.340 position:69%
Well it has a lot to do with Wilson himself.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.190 position:75%
Wilson rarely reflected on himself and his work
in writing, unlike many other well-known figures

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.530 position:72%
such as Theodore Roosevelt or George Patton,
whose papers we also have here at the library.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.700
Most of Wilson's writings --
especially as president --

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.370 position:63%
are public-facing, such as his speeches.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.310 position:69%
Even his official and private letters were
often short and contained little explanation

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.060
of his thinking on major decisions.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.290 position:59%
Moreover, Wilson never gave a detailed
account of his decision for war.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.680 position:75%
His health after the war is surely part of this,
but he also explicitly refused to write memoirs.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.200 position:59%
In 1920 he said, there are -- quote --

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.750
biographies, autobiographies,
and ought not to biographies.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.620
Whether mine ought to be
or not, they will not be.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.600
The fact that we don't have obvious
answers about Wilson's choice

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.960 position:66%
for war makes the question more
intriguing for me, and I hope for you too,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.750 position:69%
and I think underlines the importance of the
collection to the library and other archives

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.460
that help us explore this question.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.860 position:59%
After all, what is more important than
a country's decision to go to war?

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.830 position:63%
So what can we learn from these archival
materials about Wilson choosing war?

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:41.350 position:70%
I want to start with this exhibit item, just
a page here but it's from Wilson's April 2nd,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.530 position:70%
1917 war address where the president is
urging congress to recognize the state of war

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.340 position:59%
between the United States and Germany.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.820 position:63%
So specifically this item is one page
of Wilson's reading copy of that address

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.260 position:75%
from his papers here at the Library of Congress.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.640
The address lays out Wilson's
public rationale for war.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.480 position:70%
In the speech, Wilson leads off by condemning
the German decision two months earlier

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.610
in February, 1917, to resume
unrestricted submarine warfare.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.790 position:69%
Wilson describes it as Germany's -- quote --

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.650
purpose to put aside all
restaurant of law and humanity.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.620
End quote.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:26.040 position:70%
And he used submarines to sink every ship
approaching Britain or any other allied port.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.860
Submarine attacks had been an issue
for the United States since 1915.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:37.970 position:70%
Britain during World War I dominated the seas
and blockaded Germany and the central powers.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.990
Germany viewed its use of
submarines as justified retaliation

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.350 position:72%
for Britain's -- quote -- starvation blockade.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:50.140 position:72%
In retaliation, the Germans were trying to
blockade Britain with the use of their uboats.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.080 position:67%
However, neutral American shipping or
American property and passengers on neutral

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.880
or allied ships were in danger from
these German submarine attacks.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.390 position:61%
Wilson and others insisted on the right
of Americans to trade and travel freely

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:11.220 position:69%
without risk of harm from Germany's subs
and protested German attacks without warning

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.880 position:64%
on shipping that killed passengers and
merchant crews and destroyed trade goods.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:22.120 position:70%
These attacks without warning constituted
the so-called unrestricted submarine warfare.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.400
In his war address, Wilson then
talks about how other alternatives

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.120 position:72%
like arming merchant shipping are not workable

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.890
and that the German government
has proven itself untrustworthy,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.720
implying that further negotiations
are pointless.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.390
Wilson's most famous line
in this document is, quote,

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.880 position:66%
the world must be made safe for democracy.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.540 position:58%
In the page that you see here
displayed you can see that very line.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.720
But if you read the entire
speech closely you will find

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.650
that Wilson is not clearly calling
for a war to spread democracy.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.860
I would argue Wilson has often
been misunderstood on this point.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:04.630 position:70%
Wilson's point here is that anti-democratic,
autocratic Germany has proven itself a threat

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:09.180 position:63%
to citizens of democracy like the United
States through its submarine warfare

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.370
and other perfidious behavior,
and therefore must be fought.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:19.430 position:70%
While other Americans were advocating at the
time a war to create a more democratic world,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.890 position:58%
Wilson was not clearly offering that
justification for war in this speech.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:29.550 position:69%
That left as Wilson's primary public
justification for war the right of Americans

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.730 position:73%
to travel on foreign ships entering a war zone.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.240 position:64%
Let's explore this justification further.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.550 position:67%
Let's look at the question of why Wilson
had become convinced that war was necessary

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:45.810 position:73%
to protect the principle of free travel and
trade, often referred to at the time as freedom

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.240
of the seas or in wartime
as the rights of neutrals.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.880 position:66%
Ultimately, the question is, if Wilson was
not being entirely frank with the public

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.370 position:61%
about his true motivations for going to
war, why did Wilson use this principle

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.940
as his public justification when
he really was after something else?

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:08.120 position:67%
Historians have come up with a variety of
explanations for Wilson's decision for war.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.370 position:72%
There's an older, economic argument about
Wilson's choice which more recently has fallen

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.530 position:64%
out of favor and I'm happy to discuss it
during questions if anyone is interested.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:22.280
But I'm going to focus on the
two currently dominant arguments.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:28.590 position:75%
Probably the most common explanation offered
today for Wilson's choice for war was his vision

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:35.250 position:75%
and ambitions for a new, peaceful, international
order, nothing less than a drastic reform

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.900 position:69%
of international relations -- essentially
American progressivism brought to the world.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.640 position:73%
There are various versions of this argument
but it generally goes that Wilson was disgusted

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.300 position:69%
with what he saw as a catastrophic world
war and the treacherous and selfish politics

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.010 position:63%
of the empires and monarchies of Europe.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.250 position:59%
He wanted to change how states behaved

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.790
in the international system
and bring a new era of peace.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:04.580 position:63%
This is where we get the phrase, the war
to end war or the war to end all wars,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:10.490 position:75%
which is often associated with Wilson even
though H.G. Wells was the one to coin the phrase

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:15.640 position:72%
and Wilson did not make much use of the phrase
in public speeches or his private writings.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:22.090 position:70%
Wilson usually talked instead of establishing
peace or sometimes permanent peace.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:27.730 position:67%
Wilson thought a key ingredient to this new
world order would be a league of nations

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.070 position:63%
which could help resolve conflicts among
states and help to maintain the peace.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:39.140 position:63%
Here being displayed is Wilson's first
draft of the League of Nations Covenant,

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:44.730 position:63%
what would be the governing constitution
of this new international organization.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.570 position:61%
So the argument goes that Wilson chose
war because he finally became convinced

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:54.850 position:59%
that the US could do more to shape the
post-war peace and pursue his vision

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.080 position:59%
by fighting than by remaining neutral.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.610
There's much to this argument.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.610 position:61%
Certainly Wilson did develop a dramatic
new vision of international relations

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.240
and this is one reason he's
well remembered today.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.990 position:56%
But the argument has some weaknesses
in explaining why Wilson chose war.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.430
The big problem is chronology.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.930 position:59%
There simply is not much evidence that
Wilson is thinking about going to war

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:25.850 position:64%
for his peaceful ends until after he asks
congress to declare war on April 2nd.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:33.710 position:58%
The day Germany declares unrestricted
submarine warfare on February 1st,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:38.190
1917 (two months before), Wilson
is still worrying that going

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:43.750
to war will ruin American chances
to help establish a post-war peace.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:53.160 position:69%
Wilson's close advisor, Edward House, in his
diary for that day wrote, the president --

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.910 position:73%
quote -- reiterated his belief that it would be
a crime for this government to involve itself

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.440 position:61%
in the war to such an extent as to make
it impossible to save Europe aftward.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.650
In fact, the first evidence we
have of Wilson making the argument

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:12.420 position:69%
that fighting will allow the US to better
influence the peace is from a meeting he has

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.670
with the peace advocate Jane Adams
later that month on February 28th.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:21.150
This is when Wilson already knows
about the Zimmerman telegram.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.170
Here's a cartoon about the
scandal surrounding the telegram.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:30.010 position:63%
So Wilson already knows about the German
intrigues to start a war between Mexico

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.770
and the United States, and by this
time the archival evidence suggests

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:39.950 position:64%
that Wilson has lost all faith in ending
the war for negotiating with the Germans.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:44.190 position:63%
In other words, Wilson loses all faith
in the Germans before he starts thinking

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:48.640
that fighting could be his best
option for creating post-war peace.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:55.060 position:72%
In addition, Wilson's war address on April
2nd that I was discussing earlier does not lay

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.380 position:59%
out Wilson's vision for a post-war
order or a scheme for ending all wars,

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.490
even though it sometimes has
been taken to imply this.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.610
I would argue the address as a
whole, as well as other evidence

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.920 position:61%
from the manuscript collections we
have here at the library and elsewhere,

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:16.170 position:75%
does not support this interpretation even though
today it's popular to think that Wilson went

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.100
to war to establish a new
world order or to end all war.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.340 position:58%
I think it more likely that Wilson
made the connection between his ideas

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:30.140 position:64%
about establishing a peaceful order and
how fighting could lead to that peaceful,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.710
post-war world as an afterthought
to choosing war.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:40.190 position:73%
In other words, he came to view this new global
system as the silver lining to the cloud of war

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.730
and that it was not what
motivated him to choose to fight.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.460 position:58%
That brings us to the other major
explanation for why Wilson chose war.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.720 position:69%
This is the argument I find most convincing.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.650
It's the case he is explicitly
making in his war address.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:02.980 position:64%
It's the argument that Wilson went to war
over a principle: the right of Americans

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.480
and other neutrals during war
to travel freely overseas.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.780 position:66%
Now you may be thinking, how could this
possibly be the reason the US went to war,

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.430
a war in which over 100,000
Americans lost their lives?

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.020
What was Wilson possibly thinking?

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.600
How could war be worth the
right to travel overseas,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.370 position:69%
especially to travel overseas in a war zone?

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.890 position:58%
You would think most people would not
be clamoring for the right to sail

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.770 position:75%
into a deadly war zone swarming with submarines.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:37.360 position:70%
Well, the first thing to understand is that
Wilson's concern was not so much about travel

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:43.990 position:72%
or even abstract rights than that Wilson
believed he needed to stand up for a principle

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.900
that he had laid out publicly
and pledged his support for.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:54.770 position:69%
Wilson had told the Germans as early as 1915
that the US would enforce this principle

00:14:54.770 --> 00:15:01.110 position:58%
which most saw as part of established
international law and custom.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:06.000
When the British passenger ship the
Lusitania was sunk in May, 1915 --

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.440 position:56%
killing over 100 Americans and over
1,000 others -- the headline's here.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.620 position:61%
Although you'll note that initial
press reports said that all were saved.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:22.570 position:72%
But when the Lusitania sunk, Wilson threatened
to break diplomatic relations with Germany

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.360
if the Germans continued with their
submarine attacks without warning

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.530
on passenger and merchant vessels.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:35.400 position:69%
In effect, Wilson had laid down a red line
that he hoped the Germans would not cross --

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.900 position:61%
a warning so likely to lead to war that
Wilson's anti-war Secretary of State,

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:46.800 position:58%
William Jennings Bryan, resigned in
protest over Wilson's threat in 1915.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.430
Why the United States did not
go to war for two more years is

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:59.630 position:75%
because Germany did largely back off from its
unrestricted submarine warfare until early 1917.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:04.460 position:56%
Wilson used this time to try to help
negotiate a peaceful end to the war

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:11.610 position:64%
and I think the archival evidence clearly
shows his hope was that he would not have

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:16.230 position:61%
to enforce his threat, and the evidence
amply demonstrates his reluctance

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.700
to lead the United States into war.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.310
But he also acknowledged
that his official warning

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:27.240 position:58%
to Germany basically left the
possibility of war up to the Germans.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.500 position:72%
Wilson's Secretary of the Navy recalled the
president telling him during the 1916 election

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.280 position:75%
-- quote -- I can't keep the country out of war.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.720 position:61%
They talk of me as though I were a god.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:45.460 position:69%
Any little German lieutenant can put us into
war at any time by some calculated outrage.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:51.180 position:72%
Wilson had helped to create the possibility of
war by his resolve to stand up for a principle

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.320
and this left the coming
of war to outside forces.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.510 position:70%
Wilson, in the leadup to war, often expressed
himself in public and private as believing

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.780
that external forces were
driving the US toward war.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:08.140 position:70%
And Wilson seemed to experience the coming
of war as out of his control, and eventually,

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.990 position:75%
probably, in late February, 1917, as inevitable.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:17.230 position:59%
But you may still have the question of
why did Wilson and other Americans --

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:22.710 position:73%
because congress did ultimately support going
to war -- feel that standing by this principle,

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.880 position:61%
even if it was a principle embedded in
international law, was important enough

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.810 position:69%
to justify the terrible consequences of war?

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:36.540 position:73%
Historians usually characterize the
importance of this stand on freedom of the seas

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.260
and neutral rights to Wilson
and others as the importance

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:45.330 position:58%
of maintaining American international
credibility, prestige, or honor.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.430
That is, if Wilson had not
enforced his principled pledge,

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:54.820 position:69%
the United States would have lost influence,
especially moral influence, in the world.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.320 position:58%
And I think this is largely the
explanation for why Wilson chose war.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.150 position:69%
But I also think that one of the reasons why
people today often forget or are confused

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:09.800 position:72%
by explanations for US entry into World War I,
which focus on the right to travel and freedom

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.020
of the seas and neutral rights and
American credibility and prestige,

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:21.030 position:75%
is because those intertwined explanations lose
sight of why Wilson drew his principled red line

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:27.090 position:72%
in the first place, why he became trapped into
feeling compelled to defend US credibility

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:31.080
when German subs resumed
their indiscriminate attacks.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.190 position:63%
And this brings us back to the Lusitania
and the American lives lost there.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:41.730 position:61%
To Wilson and many Americans,
standing up for the freedom of the seas

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:46.150
and neutral rights was standing
against inhumane attacks

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.230
on innocent people uninvolved
in the European war.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:56.160 position:69%
Wilson in his war address characterized the
primary German offense as, quote, the wanton

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.900
and wholesale destruction of
the lives of non-combatants.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.100
Men, women, and children engaged
in pursuits which have always --

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:10.430 position:70%
even in the darkest periods of modern history
-- been deemed innocent and legitimate.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.730
This is an issue that's still
very much with us today.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.440 position:61%
And I think it's easier for us to grasp
even if we don't agree with Wilson.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:23.830 position:61%
To Wilson, Germany had committed an
atrocity against civilians in violation

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:29.430 position:69%
of humanitarian standards and had to be held
accountable for that offense and prevented

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.290
from committing further atrocities
against Americans.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:38.830 position:69%
This explanation also helps us to understand
the power of the enlist poster that you see

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:45.240 position:61%
on the screen with its image of a woman
with a child in her arms drowning.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.210
This is not to say that Wilson
was right to go to war.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.280
The war had a terrible toll
for the United States.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:58.580 position:70%
The Allies killed non-combatants as well and
the first world war was followed by a second.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.340 position:66%
I will leave that judgment of Wilson's
decision up to you but I hope you'll agree

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:08.660 position:64%
that understanding the reasons the United
States went to war in 1917 is important

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.190 position:72%
and that the Library of Congress'
collections, which were the basis for my talk,

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.150 position:56%
are essential to that understanding.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.460
Thank you.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.930 position:64%
And Naomi, I'll turn it back over to you.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.810
&gt;&gt; Great. Thanks so much, Sahr,
for that fascinating talk.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:27.340 position:69%
And for those who are interested, especially
in the collections, in some of the images

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:31.100
that you've shown, you should know
that many of those are available

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.900
on our website at loc.gov/exhibits.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.250 position:66%
Those are from the exhibition so if you're
not able to come here to the library,

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.650
you can certainly see them in
the online exhibition format.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:46.200 position:59%
So now we'll open it up for
questions so please tell us what you'd

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.100
like to know from Sahr in the chat.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.030 position:75%
Make sure you're sending it to all participants.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.110
We're happy to take questions
for five or ten minutes.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:59.980 position:75%
I think I'll begin, though, Sahr, with a general
question for you about the library's collection.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.200
So how is it that the library
came to hold the Wilson papers

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.860
and then how do researchers
generally access them?

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.900 position:66%
As the main curator for the Wilson papers,
tell us a little bit about the life

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.480 position:56%
of those papers here at the library.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:23.820 position:70%
&gt;&gt; So actually shorter after Woodrow Wilson
left office, the Library of Congress embarked

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:29.180 position:64%
on a major effort to collect presidential
papers, including Woodrow Wilson's.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.890 position:66%
And so in the early 20th century, a number

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:39.270 position:59%
of presidential paper collections were
brought to the Library of Congress.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:47.560 position:69%
Wilson's were donated by his family and some
of them came directly from the White House.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:56.560 position:72%
And the Library of Congress has been a major
repository for presidential papers ever since.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.730 position:70%
We have the papers of 23 American presidents.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:07.100 position:73%
The most of the 20th century presidents after
Calvin Coolidge now have presidential libraries

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.890 position:66%
where you can use the presidential papers.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.960
And those presidential libraries
are run by the national archives.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.650
But for presidential collections
before Herbert Hoover,

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.840
most of those papers can be
found at the Library of Congress.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.040 position:56%
Now if you're interested in actually
using the Woodrow Wilson papers,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.850 position:75%
there are a couple of ways that you can do this.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:35.880 position:73%
Most of the Wilson papers have been microfilmed
and so they are available for use on microfilm.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.830 position:56%
But I know microfilm is not
necessarily the easiest thing to use

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.040 position:61%
so there are a couple of other options.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:49.080 position:61%
One is in the not-too-distant future --
in the spring or summer of next year --

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.510
the Woodrow Wilson papers
will be available online.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:58.220 position:69%
They're in the process of being digitized
and put on the Library of Congress' website.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.740
And so they will -- all of the
Wilson papers here at the Library

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:08.610 position:56%
of Congress will be available on the
website in about six months or so.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.630 position:59%
Another option for using the papers --

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:19.420 position:72%
you won't get to see the images of the
original papers this way, but those 69 volumes

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.730
of the papers of Woodrow Wilson
by Arthur Link that I mentioned

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:29.880 position:70%
in my talk are really the most accessible
way today, tomorrow, for the next six months,

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.090 position:73%
of getting access to many of the most important
papers from the Woodrow Wilson collection.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:41.910 position:64%
And even though it's 69 volumes, it's not
anywhere close to the entire collection,

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:46.200
all 300,000 documents that we
have at the Library of Congress.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:51.320 position:61%
But remember that not every document in
the Woodrow Wilson papers was written

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:58.750 position:70%
by Woodrow Wilson or gives you a deep insight
about him, his life, and his presidency.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.060 position:59%
Does that answer your question, Naomi?

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:00.990
&gt;&gt; It does.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.650
Thank you.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.820
And it's very exciting, as Connie
says, to have digital access

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.090 position:67%
in the coming months for the Wilson papers.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:14.000 position:72%
So another question -- and I encourage all of
you guys who are listening to also submit one,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.610 position:61%
but I'll give you one more, Sahr, which
is to ask you about Wilson's influence

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:26.060 position:70%
on American foreign policy and how or whether
it shaped American foreign policy today.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:30.410 position:58%
Sort of this idea of an international
perspective, international bodies,

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.720
and the United States involvement
in those bodies and sort of a frame

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.980
for American foreign policy
the last century or so.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.510 position:73%
Are we moving out of an era of Wilsonism today?

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.740
How would you talk about that?

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:49.030 position:64%
&gt;&gt; So you know, Wilson is not necessarily
the most popular president today

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:57.330 position:61%
but I think he is very important both
for domestic policy and foreign policy.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:02.200 position:72%
In foreign policy, it's really where he made
his mark although I think it would have been a

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.890
surprise to Wilson to think
that international relations is

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.480
where he really would have
had the greatest influence.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:15.940
But in international relations,
kind of how people often think

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.320
about Wilson still today is
Wilson really embodied this idea

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.910 position:58%
of idealism in international affairs.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:31.420 position:56%
And it's a question that people
come back to again and again dealing

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.400
with today's current events
and thinking about the history

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.440
of American foreign relations
and Wilson in particular.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:47.300 position:72%
I mean, this idea of Wilsonianism, a term that
has been used to mean many different things,

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:55.970 position:70%
although generally it's used to mean the idea
of pursuing some kind of universal ideals

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:01.060 position:67%
as opposed to narrow American
self-interest or narrow national interests.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.310
It's also been used to mean
the spread of democracy abroad,

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:12.050 position:63%
which in my talk I said I think that's
slightly a misreading of Woodrow Wilson,

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:20.540 position:75%
even though he did pick up the chance for
self-determination during World War I and follow

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.860
that through to a certain degree.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:30.150 position:70%
Although, Wilson certainly wasn't arguing to
get rid of imperialism and colonies dominated

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.790 position:69%
by the European powers throughout the world.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.740 position:69%
He had somewhat ambivalent views about that.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:44.870
But in terms of whether we're
leaving an era of Wilsonianism,

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.600 position:64%
I think it's going to be -- I mean, yeah.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.840
I'm a historian.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:56.890 position:75%
One of the last things you want me to do is make
predictions about the future but I would say

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:04.170
that considering questions about
the role of ideals versus interest

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:08.610 position:66%
and international relations is going to
be a question that we're going to continue

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:13.110 position:69%
to struggle with for the foreseeable future.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.520
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.660
Thank you for that.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.130
We have had one -- oh, go ahead.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.350
Sorry.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.980
&gt;&gt; Oh, go ahead.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.650
Go ahead.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:19.240
&gt;&gt; Well, just that we had another.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.510
We had a question come through,
a similar question

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.640 position:64%
that also asks you to predict [laughing].

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.640
So maybe this is another one that,
you know, it's hard to answer.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.830 position:72%
But Trevor asks, on hearing of US entry, Lloyd
George said the US had become a superpower.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:39.720 position:63%
Is this the end of the American century?

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.760
Well I'm always happy to put
on my political science hat

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.580
and try to make predictions
about what is coming.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.790 position:66%
But this is actually a parlor game that --

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:59.340 position:66%
you know, that end of the American century
that's very popular among historians

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.890
and academics and political
scientists in general and,

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.840 position:58%
you know, talking heads in the press.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.830 position:58%
And I would just point out -- I mean,

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:13.160
I don't have any particular
insight in that, I would venture.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:20.870 position:72%
But I would just point out that the end of the
American century has predicted to be coming

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:27.880
to an end for about the last
40 years, ever since the 70s.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.760
And yet it continues.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:38.100 position:66%
We may finally with the rise of a powerful
China see things change but I think

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.150 position:69%
that really has more to do with Chinese
history than American history at this point.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.980 position:58%
That would be my personal take on it.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.470
I'm not exactly sure what
Woodrow Wilson would say.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:54.890 position:69%
I think he would probably be very optimistic
about America's prospects for the future,

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.840
as many of the American presidents

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.070
from the early 20th century
were, like Theodore Roosevelt.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.270
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:08.990 position:66%
Well we hope that we've at least piqued
your interest about Wilson, his decisions,

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:13.660
his influence on American history
and foreign policy even today.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.950 position:56%
So with that, we're at the bottom of
the hour so I think we'll wrap up.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.390 position:75%
And Sahr, if you can pull the slideshow back up,

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:24.250
I do want to remind everyone
that this is part of a series.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.470 position:61%
So there will be more webinars to come.

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:30.880 position:61%
But also, [inaudible] the Wilson papers
when they become available online.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:36.480 position:67%
But in the meantime, there are two webinars
on World War I, one November 28th looking

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.260
at Joseph Pennell who was
a printmaker in World War I

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:44.440 position:73%
and specifically his prints left Liberty Parish
an evocative image of New York City destroyed

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.830
by the enemy which was created for
the 4th Liberty Loan Drive of 1918.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:54.550 position:75%
This will be by Catherine Vlaud of the Princeton
Photographs division November 28th at 2:00.

00:29:54.550 --> 00:30:01.400 position:72%
And December 12th at 2:00, Sahr's fellow
curator of the exhibition and fellow historian

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.500 position:75%
in the manuscript division, Ryan Reft, will
present Charles Hamilton Houston on World War I,

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:10.180 position:73%
looking at Houston's work experience as a young
officer serving in the segregated military

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.970 position:59%
and the influence of those experiences
on his later work in civil rights,

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.770 position:63%
including as chief attorney of the
NAACP and a mentor to Thurgood Marshall.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.930
And of course you can register
for those sessions

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:24.160
by the World War I exhibition
website at loc.gov/exhibits.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.680 position:64%
I'll put in the chat a few more resources
by Sahr if you'd like to read more

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.100 position:58%
of his thoughts on the Wilson papers.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:36.680 position:63%
And we'll also share -- it's on the next
slide -- the survey for today's webinar.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.830
We hope you'll tell us what
you think of today's event.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.210
And hopefully you'll join us
again for future sessions.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.600
And with that we'll wrap up.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.740 position:58%
Thank you all so much for joining us.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.650
I hope you enjoy it.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:02.270
[ Background Discussions ]

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:03.970
Thanks, Connie.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.910
And there's the webinar link.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.890 position:75%
So if you can take a minute, we'd appreciate it.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:58.120
