00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:02.477
- [Instructor] It is the year 1200

00:00:02.477 --> 00:00:06.450
and the world is about to
change in dramatic fashion.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.560
Let's just give ourselves
a little bit of context

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.867
of what the world looks like.

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:14.497
The kings of western Europe
are caught up in the Crusades.

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:18.206
In the year 1200, the third
Crusade has just ended

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:20.705
and is mildly successful,

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:24.590
but Jerusalem is still in
control of the Muslims.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.521
The Byzantine Empire, what's
left of the true Roman Empire,

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:30.542
is on the decline,

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:34.836
losing more and more
territory to the Turks.

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:37.020
In the Middle East and Persia,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.420
you have the golden age of Islam.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.885
The Abbasid Caliphate is still around,

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:43.734
although it is now have been fragmented

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:46.678
into many different Muslim empires.

00:00:46.678 --> 00:00:50.311
Modern-day north India,
Pakistan, and Afghanistan

00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:52.970
is under control of the Ghurid Sultanate,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.790
with the rest of India being divided

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.373
amongst various Hindu kingdoms.

00:00:59.712 --> 00:01:03.609
In the east, in other videos,
we study the Song Dynasty,

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.661
which is one of the really high points

00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:07.066
of Chinese civilization,

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.243
although they're suspicious
of their northern neighbors.

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:12.630
But in the midst of all of this,

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.062
it ends up being a nomadic people

00:01:16.062 --> 00:01:18.058
that we really haven't talked a lot about

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:22.798
in our survey of world history
that become the main catalyst

00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:26.688
for change over the next
several hundred years.

00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:28.688
And that is the Mongols.

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:33.417
So let's move forward to the year 1206.

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:38.324
In the late twelfth and
early thirteenth centuries,

00:01:38.324 --> 00:01:42.491
you have a leader by the name
of Temujin arise in Mongolia

00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:47.454
and he's able to unite
the various nomadic tribes

00:01:47.454 --> 00:01:50.454
and declares in 1206 a Mongol Empire

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.949
you see here in this yellow color.

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:58.235
He is eventually called
Genghis, or Genghis Khan,

00:01:58.235 --> 00:02:02.937
the great Khan, the great
ruler, or the universal ruler.

00:02:02.937 --> 00:02:06.154
Now, even though the Mongols
were not a focus point

00:02:06.154 --> 00:02:08.653
of world history up until this point,

00:02:08.653 --> 00:02:11.701
they did have several
very significant things

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:15.218
going for them at this point in history.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:19.429
As nomadic tribes of herders,
they were excellent horsemen

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.164
and they were also excellent
archers, capable of shooting

00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:25.835
an arrow in any direction
while riding a horse.

00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:28.170
So as a military, they
were incredibly nimble,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.186
they were incredibly fast,
they were incredibly brutal,

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:33.547
but they were also incredibly adaptable.

00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:35.862
As they conquered more and more people,

00:02:35.862 --> 00:02:39.605
they learned from them and
by the time of Genghis Khan's

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:43.772
death in 1227, they had
conquered much of northern Asia.

00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:48.631
And the Mongols will continue on.

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:52.588
Within half a century
of Genghis Khan's death,

00:02:52.588 --> 00:02:55.404
they will have conquered
not just northern Asia.

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:57.924
When they capture Baghdad, many historians

00:02:57.924 --> 00:03:02.077
consider this the end of
the Islamic golden age.

00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:03.806
As much pressure as the western Europeans

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:06.180
were putting on the Turks
during the Crusades,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.952
it was actually the Mongol threat

00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:10.839
that was much more significant.

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.675
Before fragmenting,

00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:17.009
it is the largest contiguous
empire in world history.

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.328
I use the word contiguous
because the British Empire

00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:23.354
actually covers more land, as we'll see,

00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:25.067
a few hundred years later.

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:28.420
But the Mongolian Empire, all
of the land was connected,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.635
it was contiguous.

00:03:30.635 --> 00:03:34.996
But as you can see from this
drawing, they begin to fragment

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:38.151
into what's referred to
as multiple Khanates,

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.874
that become more and more independent

00:03:40.874 --> 00:03:44.369
in the second half of
the thirteenth century.

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:46.080
As we get into the fourteenth century,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.852
we can see that it is now fragmented

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:52.058
into multiple, still
very significant empires.

00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:54.962
In the east, you have
Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty,

00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:58.652
controlling modern-day Mongolia and China,

00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:01.186
reemphasizing the importance of Buddhism

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:05.408
until they eventually get
reconquered by the Ming Dynasty.

00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:08.323
In central Asia, you have
the Chagatai Khanate.

00:04:08.323 --> 00:04:10.632
In northwest Asia and eastern Europe,

00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:14.230
getting as far as Poland,
you have the Golden Horde.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.366
And in Persia and the Caucasus,
you have the Ilkhanate,

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:20.695
which you can view as
a subordinate Khanate,

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:22.474
but is now independent.

00:04:22.474 --> 00:04:25.961
The Khanates in the west
eventually convert to Islam.

00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:27.699
Super important to understand

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.586
because many of the empires
that we are about to study

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:35.111
in Asia and the Middle East
have roots in the Mongolian

00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:39.278
Empire and roots in what
Genghis Khan started in 1206.
