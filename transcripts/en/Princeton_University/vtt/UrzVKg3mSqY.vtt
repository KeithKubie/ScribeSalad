Edward Felten:
Hi, I'm Ed Felten. I'm a professor of computer science
and public affairs here at Princeton and the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.970 position:89%
Edward Felten:
director of the Center for Information Technology Policy.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.029 position:70%
Edward Felten:
Welcome to the "Conversation With..." series.
Many of you would like to know whether you

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.210 position:70%
Edward Felten:
can study more than one thing... more than
one topic at Princeton, and in my experience,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.269 position:67%
Edward Felten:
this is something that is easy for students
to do. Many students come with an interest

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.809 position:69%
Edward Felten:
in something else besides the one topic that
they want to major in, and one of the ways

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.940 position:72%
Edward Felten:
that we recognize that on students'
diplomas is through certificate programs which

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.930 position:64%
Edward Felten:
are sort of the equivalent of minoring in
a particular topic.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.930 position:69%
Edward Felten:
Princeton really encourages people to follow
their intellectual interests. I came here

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.799 position:73%
Edward Felten:
17 years ago as a pure technology professor,
but I got interested over time in public policy

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:58.369 position:75%
Edward Felten:
and how technology interacted with the decisions
the government and society makes, and the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:03.110 position:67%
Edward Felten:
people across the University were excited
to see a faculty member taking off in a new

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.740 position:66%
Edward Felten:
direction and combining different areas of
study, just as we encourage students to do

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.670 position:69%
Edward Felten:
the same thing. A big part of what Princeton
is about is drawing these connections across

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.460 position:75%
Edward Felten:
traditional disciplines. Students are often
interested in whether they can focus on computer

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.320 position:69%
Edward Felten:
science or information technology and issues
of public policy or sociology or economics

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.520 position:72%
Edward Felten:
at the same time, and we have a growing number
of students who do that. That's one of the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.670 position:69%
Edward Felten:
reasons we set up the Program in Information
Technology and Society. An example would be

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.549 position:75%
Edward Felten:
a student who wants to understand how technology
can enable economic development and a better

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.820 position:66%
Edward Felten:
life for people in the developing world in
Africa or elsewhere. So that student has

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.950 position:67%
Edward Felten:
the opportunity to take technology classes,
they have the opportunity to take classes

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.830 position:78%
Edward Felten:
in economics and sociology and public policy
all around these issues and then to do independent

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.890 position:64%
Edward Felten:
work in a senior thesis that really draws
it all together.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.860 position:64%
Edward Felten:
I think the intersection between computer
science and society is a fascinating area

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.409 position:80%
Edward Felten:
to work in and touches all kinds of it important
things that go on in our lives. We study electronic

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:13.450 position:66%
Edward Felten:
voting in elections. We study intellectual
property, which accounts for a bigger and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.730 position:67%
Edward Felten:
bigger fraction of the economy and a lot of
the devices and products that we deal with

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.730 position:70%
Edward Felten:
everyday. We deal with things like the safety
of cars and the stability of technologies

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.780 position:75%
Edward Felten:
that underlie the banking system. We deal
with issues of national security and the balance

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.530 position:75%
Edward Felten:
of power around the world. We deal with economic
development in the developing world. All of

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.910 position:86%
Edward Felten:
this is connected to information technology these days.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.150 position:70%
Edward Felten:
One of the early studies we did on electronic
voting was to really take apart an electronic

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.349 position:66%
Edward Felten:
voting machine that was, at the time, used
by about 10 percent of U.S. voters, and we

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.910 position:86%
Edward Felten:
found that it was in fact possible to steal an election

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.790 position:77%
Edward Felten:
in a way that wouldn't be discovered, and
we demonstrated it in many places. I demonstrated

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.650 position:67%
Edward Felten:
it for Congress. We demonstrated on CNN and
Fox News. And this has led to some changes

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.510 position:72%
Edward Felten:
in the way elections are held in a bunch of
states including California, Ohio and Florida.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.569 position:72%
Edward Felten:
One of the problems with electronic voting
machines is the worry that someone is going to

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.800 position:73%
Edward Felten:
program them to do something other than count
the votes correctly. This is a Sequoia AVC-Edge

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.360 position:64%
Edward Felten:
voting machine, which would normally
be used in election in the United States,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.860 position:67%
Edward Felten:
but some of our students built a version of
Pac-Man to run on this voting machine

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.180 position:69%
Edward Felten:
I've been teaching about computer technology
and public policy here at Princeton

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.069 position:75%
Edward Felten:
for quite awhile, but now I have the opportunity
to put this into

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.129 position:69%
Edward Felten:
practice. I've been appointed as the chief
technologist at the Federal Trade Commission

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.349 position:80%
Edward Felten:
in Washington, and so I'm going to go off
and do that for awhile. When I come back afterward,

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.989 position:75%
Edward Felten:
I'll be able to teach this material in, I
think, a different way -- I can see that already

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.150 position:78%
Edward Felten:
-- and with real world examples in the kind
of insight that you only get from doing something.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.250 position:66%
Edward Felten:
Thanks for joining me in this installment
of "Conversation With...." I hope you join

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.250 position:75%
Edward Felten:
me next time when I answered questions submitted
on Facebook.
