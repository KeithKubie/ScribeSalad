00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.540
If you're mating with somebody outside of your family who doesn't

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.790
have this rare variant or rare allele, there's no way your child's

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.010
going to be affected. You may pass the allele on, but they'll

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.660
be a carrier. There's no way they're going to be affected, because your

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.280
partner doesn't have the allele themselves. But if you're mating with

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.640
somebody in your family, there's a possibility, high possibility that they also

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.130
have this rare allele. And the fact that both of you

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.340
could give that allele to the child indicates a much higher probability

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.430
the child's going to be affected by that recessive trait.
