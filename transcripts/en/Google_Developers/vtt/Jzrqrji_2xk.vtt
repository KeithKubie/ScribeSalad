00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:02.736
VR should be accessible to everyone.

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.638
Because it has the potential to let everyone

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:07.708
explore, play, and create in amazing new ways.

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:10.644
But right now, VR is pretty complicated.

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:12.880
To make awesome VR stuff,
developers might have to

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.349
learn a new language,
and then spend a bunch

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.352
more time to make that stuff
work on multiple headsets.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.555
And then, when we want to play
with their awesome VR stuff,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.590
we’ve got to have the right headset.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.758
VR should be easier.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.961
So developers can make something
quickly and share it with everyone,

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.663
no matter what device they’re on.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:33.767
Kind of like how easy it is to
share stuff on the web, but with VR.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.903
Well, that’s the idea behind WebVR.

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:39.239
It’s VR. On the web. For everyone.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.140
Here’s how it works.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.144
Say you’re in a browser like Chrome,
and you come across a WebVR experience.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:48.382
You just tap the link, put on
a headset, and boom, you’re in VR.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.852
Developers can build WebVR things
the same way they build web things -

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.086
with JavaScript.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.955
And since it all works in a browser,

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:57.925
it’s easy to make it work
for all kinds of VR devices.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:03.063
Whether it's someone using their phone,
their computer, or their entire room.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.667
Developers are already building and
sharing awesome stuff with WebVR.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:10.304
We’ve started showcasing their work
on a site called WebVR Experiments.

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.773
It gives you a glimpse into
the kind of stuff that’s possible.

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:14.675
You can play simple games.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.610
See the world in a new way.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.645
Explore interactive stories.

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:19.947
Play with a friend.

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:22.516
Or, lots of friends.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:26.620
Each experiment comes with open-source
code to help others to make new experiments.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.922
And, developers can submit what they make.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.792
All of this is an effort to
make VR more accessible,

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:35.929
so anyone can build and everyone
can play with awesome VR stuff.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.099
