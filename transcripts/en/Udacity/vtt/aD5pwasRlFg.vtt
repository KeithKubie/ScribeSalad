00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:02.256
So, what are the consequences of something

00:00:02.256 --> 00:00:05.113
being placed under pressure? Well, if I look

00:00:05.113 --> 00:00:08.095
at this balloon, I can apply pressure to it by

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:12.694
exerting a force over its area. And when I do,

00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:14.565
well, the balloon actually gets a little bit

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:17.930
smaller. The air inside the balloon gets a

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.348
little more densely packed together. And

00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:24.597
in fact, this is exactly what happens on earth.

00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:26.480
Out here, far away from the surface of the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.761
earth, there are not very many air molecules.

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.606
This is a low pressure environment and

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:33.298
with nothing to weigh down on these air

00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:35.849
molecules from above, they’re basically

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:38.832
free to play. They are free to move around.

00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:40.811
Now below this outer layer of the

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:44.192
atmosphere, where all these air molecules

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:47.042
are sort of weighing on the atoms below it,

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.019
the molecules below it, and so these become

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.717
a little more densely packed. And as we go

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.387
even further down towards the surface of

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:57.223
the earth, where us humans tend to live,

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.503
the air gets even more densely packed.

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:01.248
And so we see that down near the surface

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:03.886
of the earth, where we have high pressure,

00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:06.281
we also have a high density of air molecules.

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.299
And this high density of air molecules makes

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.752
us humans living at the surface very happy.

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:13.504
So I want to know, why do humans like high

00:01:13.504 --> 00:01:15.362
pressure so much? Maybe the weight from

00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:17.655
all that air above us keeps us from growing

00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:20.025
too tall. Maybe air pollution tends to go to

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:22.504
regions of low pressure. Or maybe it means

00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:24.774
that there’s lots of oxygen for us to breathe.

00:01:24.774 --> 00:01:27.000
Go ahead and choose the best answer.
