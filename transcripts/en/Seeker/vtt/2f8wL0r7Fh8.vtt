After I took the SAT I was so exhausted I
wanted to sleep for days, but I just sat there

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.160
for hours, how can sitting there and THINKING,
wear you out?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.740
Hey Brainiacs, Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.480
Have you ever been really tired after spending
all day sitting around at school?

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.100
How can you be so exhausted from literally
just sitting all day?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.230
Why is learning so tiring?

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.310
Well let’s start with the body’s energy
usage, 30% of the calories you eat go to maintaining

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.570
your current muscle mass.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.050
While our brain only makes up 2% of your body
weight, it gobbles up 20% of the energy you

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.050
take in.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.320
One study published in Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences USA found that

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.400
2/3s of the energy the brain uses goes to
the firing of cells.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.360
But the other third, is basically just brain
maintenance.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.890
So where does that energy come from?

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.270
Most of the energy the brain eats up is in
the form of glucose from the things we eat.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.600
When neurons fire, they need extra oxygen
and glucose from nearby capillaries.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.170
So scientists think that when performing a
difficult mental task, the neurons would eat

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.410
up more glucose.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.730
And so there’d be less glucose in the blood
stream if you’d measure it after something

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.820
like a tiring test.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.200
And that’s what some studies show.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.430
Another study published in the journal Physiology
Behavior found that there was less blood glucose

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.229
in the bloodstream, which the researchers
thought was linked to neurons firing on all

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.229
cylinders.

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.500
Another more recent study published in Human
Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.840
and Ergonomics Society found that people get
more exhausted when exerting both physical

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.869
and mental faculties than when just simply
working out.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.460
The researchers specifically noted that when
performing both physical and mental tasks,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.909
there was strong activity in the prefrontal
cortex and there was lower blood oxygen levels

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.350
in the PFC after a combined physical and mental
task than when just doing physical work.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.900
So following that line of thought, eating
foods high in glucose should improve performance.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.799
One review published in the European Journal
of Pharmacology found that glucose can improve

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.580
memory, but it depends on the dose and the
person.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.400
So there is something about mental tasks that
makes our brains work a little harder and

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.970
use up a little more glucose.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.570
But does it actually make us tired?

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.150
Well results are mixed.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.200
One small study published in the journal Psychosomatic
Medicine found that people who just completed

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.869
memorization and attention tests ate 200 more
calories than those just relaxed.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.640
But… it might be more than just brain drain.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.620
One scientist, Claude Messier of the University
of Ottawas, thinks maybe it’s just stress,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.390
that those students were just stress eating.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.140
Which is a very real thing.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.620
So while test taking might be zapping your
energy, maybe it’s the classroom you’re

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.620
in.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:48.480
Matt Lieberman explains how Carbon dioxide
in the classroom might make for slower brains.
