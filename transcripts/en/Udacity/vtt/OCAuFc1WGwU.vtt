00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.610
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, it looks like we're only at 12,000 Hz right now, Andy.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.170
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, and it looks like they are all able to hear that. Lauren, when can we

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.920
expect to see contestants to drop off?

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.385
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, the range for human hearing is between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz. So, if

00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:18.685
I had to put my money on it, I would guess we'd see people drop off at around

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:30.738
17,000 to 18,000 Hz. And for those of you trying to compete at home, I'd

00:00:30.738 --> 00:00:43.608
recommend turning your sound up, closing your eyes, and trying to see which of

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:54.894
these tones you can identify it.

00:00:54.894 --> 00:00:55.573
[SOUND].

00:00:55.573 --> 00:00:58.315
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That was really exciting Andy.

00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:00.729
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It was. Let's see if we can talk to the winner as they prepare for the next

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.335
event. Susan, are you there?

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:06.764
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi Andy, I can hear you loud and clear. You must be talking between 20 and

00:01:06.764 --> 00:01:11.573
20,000 hertz, right? I've got the winner here of the pitch absolute threshold

00:01:11.573 --> 00:01:15.445
competition, Jacques. That was incredible, how did you do it?

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:17.810
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I've always taken good care of my ears.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.661
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, thank you and congratulations. I'll let you go ahead and prepare for your

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:24.265
next event. Back to you, Lauren and Andy.

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:28.660
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks Susan. We're going to take a brief break, and get a word from one of our

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.870
sponsors while the next event is being prepared.
