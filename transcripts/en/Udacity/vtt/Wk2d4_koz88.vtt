Congratulations. We're now at the end of

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.340
lesson five. In this lesson we covered the

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:13.140
big heavy stuff. Such as mem cache, push queues, pull queues and cron jobs. All

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.320
essential components to build a big application.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.440
We also looked at scaling options for your

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.490
App Engine application. In the next lesson, we

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.320
will wrap it up by building a mobile

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.450
front end using cloud end points. Come join us.
