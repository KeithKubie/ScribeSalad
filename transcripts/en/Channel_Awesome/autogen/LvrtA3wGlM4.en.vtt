that you know just immediately he shows
 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.300
that you know just immediately he shows

building this kid up he seemed wiser
than that and again he merely knows his

mistake and he apologizes and

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849
mistake and he apologizes and
 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.580
mistake and he apologizes and
understands if he should not be shown

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590
understands if he should not be shown
 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.379
understands if he should not be shown
how to do this or if he should keep away

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389
how to do this or if he should keep away
 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.659
how to do this or if he should keep away
from the fire because he knows I get

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669
from the fire because he knows I get
 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.349

not have self-control that's one of the
 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.950
not have self-control that's one of the
reasons he became this general for this

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960
reasons he became this general for this
 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.450

him and Aang is it's not powerful enough
 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.140
him and Aang is it's not powerful enough
so he has to use his wit and he

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150
so he has to use his wit and he
 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.480
so he has to use his wit and he
remembers what he said that he was a

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490
remembers what he said that he was a
 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.180
remembers what he said that he was a
student and he did not have self-control

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190
student and he did not have self-control
 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.540
student and he did not have self-control
so I like that he used his knowledge of

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550
so I like that he used his knowledge of
 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.689
so I like that he used his knowledge of
his own self-control and his own anger

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699
his own self-control and his own anger
 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.969
his own self-control and his own anger
in his own frustration to use against

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979
in his own frustration to use against
 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.640
in his own frustration to use against
him and ran around the ships and that

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650
him and ran around the ships and that
 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.439
him and ran around the ships and that
can't make him angry and angry or

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449
can't make him angry and angry or
 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.540
can't make him angry and angry or
taunting him saying how bad his powers

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550
taunting him saying how bad his powers
 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.909
taunting him saying how bad his powers
are and so forth and what insult he is

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919
are and so forth and what insult he is
 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.369
are and so forth and what insult he is
he's not even feeling it and make him

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379
he's not even feeling it and make him
 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.230
he's not even feeling it and make him
matter matter because we get more and

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240
matter matter because we get more and
 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.790
matter matter because we get more and
more angry you get more and more stupid

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800
more angry you get more and more stupid
 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.570
more angry you get more and more stupid
and he burns the ships and they have no

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580
and he burns the ships and they have no
 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.029
and he burns the ships and they have no
way to get back so that that was nicely

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039
way to get back so that that was nicely
 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.890
way to get back so that that was nicely
good I like how that all tied together

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900
good I like how that all tied together
 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.360
good I like how that all tied together
I wish there could have been a little

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370
I wish there could have been a little
 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.610
I wish there could have been a little
bit more time if they if they took out

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620
bit more time if they if they took out
 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.559
bit more time if they if they took out
the carnival they probably could had a

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569
the carnival they probably could had a
 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.350
the carnival they probably could had a
little bit more time to dedicate to that

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360
little bit more time to dedicate to that
 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.519
little bit more time to dedicate to that
and some of these things would have

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:26.529
and some of these things would have
 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:27.719
and some of these things would have
connected a little better but they

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729
connected a little better but they
 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.709
connected a little better but they
connected okay so it is a good episode

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719
connected okay so it is a good episode
 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.660
connected okay so it is a good episode
and it goes a little bit

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670
and it goes a little bit
 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.100
and it goes a little bit
the filler because I think it gives a

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110
the filler because I think it gives a
 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.020
the filler because I think it gives a
little background just into the nature

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030
little background just into the nature
 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.050
little background just into the nature
of the fire nation without necessarily

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060
of the fire nation without necessarily
 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.720
of the fire nation without necessarily
having to spell it out for you I think

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730
having to spell it out for you I think
 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.090
having to spell it out for you I think
this episode even if you don't explain

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100
this episode even if you don't explain
 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.830
this episode even if you don't explain
too much else I'm sure they will go into

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840
too much else I'm sure they will go into
 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.420
too much else I'm sure they will go into
more detail but you maybe don't explain

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430
more detail but you maybe don't explain
 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.060
more detail but you maybe don't explain
too much else you understand how the

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070
too much else you understand how the
 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.570
too much else you understand how the
Fire Nation took over just by the nature

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580
Fire Nation took over just by the nature
 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.980
Fire Nation took over just by the nature
of fire and what they are I know if it's

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990
of fire and what they are I know if it's
 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.330
of fire and what they are I know if it's
born with or whatever but what they're

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340
born with or whatever but what they're
 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.940
born with or whatever but what they're
growing up with so that's I found that

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950
growing up with so that's I found that
 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.470
growing up with so that's I found that
very fascinating if they do give more

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.480
very fascinating if they do give more
 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.770
very fascinating if they do give more
detail great but they have it set and I

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780
detail great but they have it set and I
 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.170
detail great but they have it set and I
thought just by these little hints and

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180
thought just by these little hints and
 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.760
thought just by these little hints and
not even saying this is why the Fire

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770
not even saying this is why the Fire
 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.170
not even saying this is why the Fire
Nation is like this just saying this is

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180
Nation is like this just saying this is
 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.690
Nation is like this just saying this is
what fire is like I thought that was a

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700
what fire is like I thought that was a
 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.540
what fire is like I thought that was a
very clever way of actually showing a

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550
very clever way of actually showing a
 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.480
very clever way of actually showing a
lot of human nature in a sense if you

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490
lot of human nature in a sense if you
 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.370
lot of human nature in a sense if you
were growing up with this power you

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380
were growing up with this power you
 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.230
were growing up with this power you
probably be a little bit of a bully too

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240
probably be a little bit of a bully too
 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.360
probably be a little bit of a bully too
because there's a lot of power to be

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.370
because there's a lot of power to be
 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.030
because there's a lot of power to be
growing up with so yeah it was a good

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.040
growing up with so yeah it was a good
 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.820
growing up with so yeah it was a good
