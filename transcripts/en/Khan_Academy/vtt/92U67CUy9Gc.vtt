00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:01.760
I want to talk a
little bit about

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.280
direct and inverse variations.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.150
So I'll do direct variation
on the left over here.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.930
And I'll do inverse variation,
or two variables that

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.590
vary inversely, on the
right-hand side over here.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.690
So a very simple definition
for two variables

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.660
that vary directly would
be something like this.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.010
y varies directly with x if y is
equal to some constant with x.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.450
So we could rewrite
this in kind of English

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:39.020
as y varies directly with x.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.720
And if this constant
seems strange to you,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.710
just remember this could be
literally any constant number.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.500
So let me give you a bunch
of particular examples

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.300
of y varying directly with x.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.470
You could have y is equal to x.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.430
Because in this situation,
the constant is 1.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.430
We didn't even write it.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.020
We could write y is
equal to 1x, then k is 1.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.660
We could write y is equal to 2x.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.850
We could write y
is equal to 1/2 x.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.970
We could write y is
equal to negative 2x.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.800
We are still varying directly.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.260
We could have y is
equal to negative 1/2 x.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.800
We could have y is
equal to pi times x.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.987
We could have y is equal
to negative pi times x.

00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:27.570
I don't want to beat
a dead horse now.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.840
I think you get the point.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.190
Any constant times x--
we are varying directly.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.380
And to understand this maybe
a little bit more tangibly,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.790
let's think about what happens.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.110
And let's pick one
of these scenarios.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.680
Well, I'll take a positive
version and a negative version,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.950
just because it might not
be completely intuitive.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.720
So let's take the version
of y is equal to 2x,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.500
and let's explore why we
say they vary directly

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.990
with each other.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.020
So let's pick a
couple of values for x

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.880
and see what the resulting
y value would have to be.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.410
So if x is equal to 1, then
y is 2 times 1, or is 2.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.470
If x is equal to 2,
then y is 2 times

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.630
2, which is going
to be equal to 4.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.900
So when we doubled x,
when we went from 1 to 2--

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.800
so we doubled x-- the
same thing happened to y.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.160
We doubled y.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.320
So that's what it means when
something varies directly.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.410
If we scale x up by
a certain amount,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.260
we're going to scale up
y by the same amount.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.770
If we scale down
x by some amount,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.010
we would scale down
y by the same amount.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.010
And just to show you it
works with all of these,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.010
let's try the situation with
y is equal to negative 2x.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.630
I'll do it in magenta.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.272
y is equal to
negative-- well, let

00:02:46.272 --> 00:02:48.480
me do a new example that I
haven't even written here.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.580
Let's try y is equal
to negative 3x.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.220
So once again, let
me do my x and my y.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.170
When x is equal to 1, y is
equal to negative 3 times

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.910
1, which is negative 3.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.880
When x is equal to 2,
so negative 3 times

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.950
2 is negative 6.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.840
So notice, we multiplied.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.030
So if we scaled-- let me do
that in that same green color.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.220
If we scale up x by 2-- it's
a different green color,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.845
but it serves the purpose--
we're also scaling up y by 2.

00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:25.230
To go from 1 to 2,
you multiply it by 2.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.630
To go from negative
3 to negative 6,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.180
you're also multiplying by 2.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.680
So we grew by the
same scaling factor.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.760
And if you wanted to go
the other way-- let's try,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.460
I don't know, let's
go to x is 1/3.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.220
If x is 1/3, then y is going
to be-- negative 3 times

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.280
1/3 is negative 1.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.520
So notice, to go from 1
to 1/3, we divide by 3.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.840
To go from negative
3 to negative 1,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.660
we also divide by 3.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.080
We also scale down
by a factor of 3.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.490
So whatever direction
you scale x in,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.190
you're going to have the
same scaling direction as y.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.680
That's what it means
to vary directly.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.000
Now, it's not always so clear.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.640
Sometimes it will be obfuscated.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.970
So let's take this
example right over here.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.672
y is equal to negative 3x.

00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:20.880
And I'm saving this real
estate for inverse variation

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.730
in a second.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.150
You could write it like this,
or you could algebraically

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.100
manipulate it.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.630
You could maybe divide both
sides of this equation by x,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.080
and then you would get y/x
is equal to negative 3.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.810
Or maybe you divide
both sides by x,

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.070
and then you divide
both sides by y.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.590
So from this, so if you
divide both sides by y now,

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.530
you could get 1/x is equal
to negative 3 times 1/y.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.930
These three statements,
these three equations,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.890
are all saying the same thing.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.330
So sometimes the
direct variation

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.780
isn't quite in your face.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.080
But if you do this, what I did
right here with any of these,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.500
you will get the
exact same result.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.690
Or you could just try
to manipulate it back

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.817
to this form over here.

00:05:04.817 --> 00:05:06.400
And there's other
ways we could do it.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.650
We could divide both sides of
this equation by negative 3.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.520
And then you would get
negative 1/3 y is equal to x.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.560
And now, this is kind
of an interesting case

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.380
here because here, this is
x varies directly with y.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.674
Or we could say x is
equal to some k times y.

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:25.840
And in general, that's true.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.080
If y varies directly
with x, then

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.456
we can also say that x
varies directly with y.

00:05:34.456 --> 00:05:36.080
It's not going to be
the same constant.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.496
It's going to be essentially
the inverse of that constant,

00:05:38.496 --> 00:05:40.595
but they're still
directly varying.

00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:41.970
Now with that
said, so much said,

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.770
about direct variation,
let's explore

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.870
inverse variation a little bit.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.622
Inverse variation--
the general form,

00:05:48.622 --> 00:05:49.830
if we use the same variables.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.538
And it always doesn't
have to be y and x.

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:52.620
It could be an a and a b.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.830
It could be a m and an n.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.430
If I said m varies
directly with n,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.510
we would say m is equal
to some constant times n.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.279
Now let's do inverse variation.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.820
So if I did it with
y's and x's, this

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.740
would be y is equal to
some constant times 1/x.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.070
So instead of being
some constant times x,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.215
it's some constant times 1/x.

00:06:14.215 --> 00:06:15.840
So let me draw you
a bunch of examples.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.670
It could be y is equal to 1/x.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.380
It could be y is equal to 2
times 1/x, which is clearly

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.810
the same thing as 2/x.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.370
It could be y is equal
to 1/3 times 1/x, which

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.190
is the same thing as 1 over 3x.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.140
it could be y is equal
to negative 2 over x.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.200
And let's explore this, the
inverse variation, the same way

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.590
that we explored the
direct variation.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.520
So let's pick-- I don't know/
let's pick y is equal to 2/x.

00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:54.360
And let me do that
same table over here.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.500
So I have my table.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.830
I have my x values
and my y values.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.660
If x is 1, then y is 2.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.300
If x is 2, then 2
divided by 2 is 1.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.370
So if you multiply x
by 2, if you scale it

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.670
up by a factor of 2,
what happens to y?

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.000
y gets scaled down
by a factor of 2.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.830
You're dividing by 2 now.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.970
Notice the difference.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.580
Here, however we scaled x, we
scaled up y by the same amount.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.140
Now, if we scale up
x by a factor, when

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.020
we have inverse variation, we're
scaling down y by that same.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.550
So that's where the
inverse is coming from.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.800
And we could go the other way.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.120
If we made x is equal to 1/2.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.420
So if we were to
scale down x, we're

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.340
going to see that it's
going to scale up y.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.050
Because 2 divided by 1/2 is 4.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.819
So here we are scaling up y.

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:48.610
So they're going to do
the opposite things.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.130
They vary inversely.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.650
And you could try it with
the negative version of it,

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:54.170
as well.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.500
So here we're multiplying by 2.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.310
And once again, it's not
always neatly written for you

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.230
like this.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.170
It can be rearranged in a
bunch of different ways.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.680
But it will still
be inverse variation

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.722
as long as they're
algebraically equivalent.

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:11.930
So you can multiply both
sides of this equation right

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.720
here by x.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.340
And you would get
xy is equal to 2.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.130
This is also inverse variation.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.440
You would get this exact
same table over here.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.420
You could divide both sides
of this equation by y.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:31.330
And you could get x is
equal to 2/y, which is also

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.870
the same thing as 2 times 1/y.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.141
So notice, y varies
inversely with x.

00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:39.140
And you could just
manipulate this algebraically

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.320
to show that x varies
inversely with y.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:50.200
So y varies inversely with x.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.639
This is the same thing as
saying-- and we just showed it

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:54.180
over here with a
particular example--

00:08:54.180 --> 00:09:00.239
that x varies inversely with y.

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:01.280
And there's other things.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.270
We could take this and
divide both sides by 2.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.000
And you would get
y/2 is equal to 1/x.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.720
There's all sorts
of crazy things.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.332
And so in general, if you
see an expression that

00:09:12.332 --> 00:09:13.790
relates to variables,
and they say,

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.970
do they vary inversely or
directly or maybe neither?

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.160
You could either try to
do a table like this.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.550
If you scale up x
by a certain amount

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.970
and y gets scaled up by
the same amount, then

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.570
it's direct variation.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.487
If you scale up x
by some-- and you

00:09:29.487 --> 00:09:31.320
might want to try a
couple different times--

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.180
and you scale down y, you
do the opposite with y,

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.780
then it's probably
inverse variation.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.510
A surefire way of knowing
what you're dealing with

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.320
is to actually algebraically
manipulate the equation

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.150
so it gets back to either this
form, which would tell you

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.480
that it's inverse variation, or
this form, which would tell you

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.676
that it is direct variation.
