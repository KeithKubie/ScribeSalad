00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.279
It’s not quite a Harry Potter-caliber invisibility
cloak, but scientists have developed a cloaking

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.460
device that will hide an object in motion.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.280
Hey everyone.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.860
Amy here for DNews.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.750
In the real world, invisibility comes down
to a trick of light.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.109
We see objects because light reflects off
them and hits our eyes.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.570
Cloaking an object involves bending the light
that hits our eyes around an object so we

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.560
can see what’s behind that object but not
the object itself.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.939
The problem with cloaking devices for a long
time has been that the object being hidden

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.840
and the person looking at the hidden object
need to be stationary; move at all and you’ll

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.790
see the object and the cloaking device, destroying
the illusion.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.950
But researchers from the University of Rochester
in New York have found a way around that.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.290
Or, more specifically, have found a way to
more effectively bend light around an object

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.670
so it can move and still be invisible to a
viewer.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.890
It’s the first device that can cloak multidirectionally
in three dimensions, and they’ve done it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.610
using nothing but four standard lenses like
you’d find in any lab.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.400
The key is in the set up; they figured out
exactly what power of lenses and how far away

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.960
to space these lenses to cloak a moving object.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.140
With the lenses in a row, light from a background
is focussed down to a point through one lens

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.490
then diverges out, bending around an object
placed in what they call the “cloaking field”

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.010
as it moves to be focussed down by the next
lens.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.790
As long as you’re looking through the first
lens, anything moving within about 15 degrees

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.120
of the centre of the cloaking field will remain
completely hidden.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.500
And it’s a system that can be scaled up
using larger lenses to cloak larger objects.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.860
This cloaking setup isn’t quite ready for
a night sneaking around.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.020
The scientists from Rochester anticipate more
scientific uses for their setup, like a surgeon

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.280
being able to operate on a tiny area without
having his view obstructed by his hands.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.490
So what do you guys think: are these multi-lens
setups the invisibility cloak of the future?
