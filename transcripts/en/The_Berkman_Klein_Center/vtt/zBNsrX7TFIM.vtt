00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.390
Hello.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.060
I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.300
This is the third in a series
of twelve lectures on copyright.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.020
The topics of the lectures
are set forth on your screen.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.700
In the first, I examined the
foundations of copyright,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.360
specifically the set of treaties
that cause considerable convergence

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.800
in the copyright systems in
various countries of the world.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.900
The concept of originality, and the
so-called idea expression distinction.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.730
In the second lecture, I discussed two
of the four main theories of copyright,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.790
the fairness and the
personality theories.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.840
In this lecture, I put theory to
the side and return to the law,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.940
focusing on the subject matter
of copyright, the kinds of things

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.000
that copyright law applies to.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
You can see from the slide
where we're going after this.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.170
There are two main
themes to this lecture.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.410
First, the subject matter
coverage of copyright law

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.260
has grown dramatically
over the years, and is now

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.330
a good deal larger than you might think.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.040
Certainly it reaches far beyond its
core, namely fine art and literature.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.460
Second, copyright law is
not unitary or homogeneous.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.500
Rather, the rules governing
the different kinds of things

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.860
now subject to copyright
protection vary considerably.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.950
Partly as a result, the
business models associated

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.080
with the different kinds
of works also vary.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.865
This second theme I refer to as
the disaggregation of copyright.

00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:53.680
I'll begin to develop
it in this lecture,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.120
but it will figure in
future lectures as well.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.130
As usual, the lecture
will be accompanied

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.430
by a fair amount of
illustrative graphic material.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.240
So I hope you're watching this
recording on a computer or a device

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.759
with a reasonably sized screen.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.040
One source of illustrative
material will be

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.790
a map, which summarizes the main
features of the US Copyright system,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.250
and some ways in which the
copyright law in other countries

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.720
differs from the US model.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.890
An interactive PDF
copy of that map can be

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.963
downloaded from my home page, the
address of which is tfisher.org.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.540
I'll begin with a brief overview of
the history of the subject matter

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.550
coverage of copyright,
and then start over

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.250
and examine each of the
sectors in more detail.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.810
US copyright law originates
in a 1790 federal statute.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.960
Only three kinds of works were
protected under the original statute--

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.910
books, maps, and charts.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.350
Over the course of the 19th and 20th
centuries, Congress and the courts

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.480
cooperated in expanding the
set of protected creations.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.840
Prints were added by statute in 1802.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.980
Musical compositions added in 1831.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.610
Dramatic works, in effect,
were added to the cluster

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.610
by an 1856 statute which granted
the owners of copyrights in books

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.170
the right to control public
performance of their works, which

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.420
is the only form of protection
truly valuable to playwrights.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.210
This extension was confirmed by
subsequent statutory amendments.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.470
Photographs were added
by statute in 1865,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.320
as we saw in the first of
the lectures in this series.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.660
In 1883, in the Burrow-Giles
case, the Supreme Court

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.260
rejected a constitutional challenge
to the addition of photography,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.340
but only because this posed
studio photo of Oscar Wilde

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.130
was, in the court's judgment, a
quote "useful, new, harmonious,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.130
characteristic and graceful picture".

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.240
Gradually, the aesthetic requirement
implicit in this ruling was softened,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.430
and copyright protection was tacitly
extended to photographs of all sorts.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.380
Paintings and drawings were added to
the set of protected works in 1870,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.250
as were statues-- meaning
three-dimensional works

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.210
of fine art-- a type
of work later subsumbed

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.200
into the broader category of works of
art and reproductions of works of art.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.440
Around the turn of the
century, advertisements

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.900
were accepted into the fold.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.120
During the 19th century,
courts had generally

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.830
been hostile to the extension of
copyrights to ads, on the ground

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.010
that they did nothing to quote
"stimulate original investigation,

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.560
whether in literature science, or art,
for the betterment of the people".

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.530
This skeptical position was
rejected by Justice Holmes

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.580
in the Bleistein case, which was
also discussed in lecture number one.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.600
Bleistein, as you'll recall,
extended copyright protection

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.710
to a circus poster.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.730
Holmes reasoned, quote "a picture is
nonetheless a picture, and nonetheless

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.000
a subject of copyright, that it
is used for an advertisement".

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.270
Motion pictures were invented by Thomas
Edison and his assistant William Dixon

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.500
in the 1890s.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.890
Shown on your screen is a photo
of one of the first machines

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.230
that they developed to view
their primitive movies.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.890
By 1903, an intermediate appellate
court had recognized movies

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.860
as copyrightable subject matter, a
position later confirmed by Congress.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.790
Lectures, sermons, and
addresses were added

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.530
to the list of copyrightable
materials by statute in 1909.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.540
Subsequently fictional
characters and plots

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.720
were recognized by judicial
decisions as objects of protection.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.910
This, as you might imagine, is a tricky
subject to which we'll return shortly.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.060
A complex series of steps
between 1909 and 1954

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.370
had the overall effect of
extending copyright protection

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.240
to some useful articles.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.870
Which ones, we'll consider in a moment.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.210
Sound recordings, as distinct
from the compositions they embody,

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.330
were added to the fold in 1972.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.930
Pantomimes and choreographic
works were added

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.310
as part of the 1976 general
reform of the copyright statute.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.770
Software was formally added in
1978, although, as we'll see,

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:04.320
early forms of protection for
software occurred in the 1960s.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.590
Last but not least, architecture was
grudgingly given special protection

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.870
by statute in 1990 in response to
the United States's belated accession

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.780
to the Berne Convention.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.190
That's where things stand today.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.920
Two gradual, intertwined
conceptual shifts

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.140
underlie this steady expansion
of the zone of coverage.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.670
The first, which is nicely
traced by Oren Bracha,

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:39.020
is a movement from a conception of
copyright as trade-specific regulation

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.410
to a conception that
sees copyright as founded

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.310
on the general principle
of the right of creators

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.220
to control their original works.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.060
This change was partially completed
in the 1909 general reform

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:57.850
of the copyright statute, and
fully completed in the 1976 reform.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.350
The second of the overall changes,
emphasized by Peter Jaszi,

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:08.390
is a shift in what copyright is thought
to protect, from the text to the work.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.710
At the start of the 19th
century, lawyers and judges

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.460
thought that copyright law
protected the sequence of words

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.400
used in a book-- in other
words, the text alone--

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.200
against verbatim reproduction.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.810
By the early 20th
century, by contrast, they

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.760
thought it shielded the market
value of the underlying work,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.560
no matter how it was expressed.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.240
As we'll see in lecture number seven,
the effect of this reconceptualization

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.679
was to render illegal, for the first
time, many forms of unauthorized use,

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:45.530
including translations, abridgments,
and, perhaps most importantly,

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.655
motion picture adaptations.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.400
Now that we've completed a brief
historical overview of the growth of US

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.010
copyright law during the last
two centuries, let's go back

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.410
and examine in more detail each of
the sectors of copyrightable subject

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.070
matter.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.700
For this purpose, we'll be using
the map on copyright law, which

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.110
I hope is by now familiar to you.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.090
As I mentioned, during this
survey I'll highlight the ways

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.670
in which the rules governing
the different kinds of things

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.260
now subject to copyright protection
vary, and how, as a result,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.480
the business models associated with
those types of works also differ.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.290
The underlying thesis, to repeat,
is that the copyright system

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.000
is disaggregated.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.520
As the map indicates,
the statutory basis

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.680
for the subject matter
coverage of copyright

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.950
is Section 102 of the federal statute.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:48.870
In the first lecture in this series,
we discussed subsection 102(b),

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.350
which embodies, as we saw
there, the idea/expression

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.690
distinction, and related
grounds for excluding work

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.140
from copyright protection.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.000
We now focus on 102(a), which
details the kinds of things

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.720
that copyrighted law includes.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.460
As you can see, the language
of 102(a) is capacious.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.320
It itemizes various kinds of things that
are subject to copyright protection,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.770
but it also includes a
blanket clause indicating

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.740
that quote "original works
of authorship, of any sort,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.670
can be protected".

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.150
In other words, the itemized list on the
left of your screen is non-exhaustive.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:37.720
The first entry in the itemized
list consists of literary works.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.940
Such works are often thought to be
the heart of copyright protection.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.850
Included in this
category are many things

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.190
you would naturally
think of as literary.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.990
For example, novels, short stories,
poems, newspaper or magazine articles,

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.230
and so forth.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.270
Also included are some less
obvious things, such as catalogs,

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.650
and, as we saw earlier,
advertising copy.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.550
Last but not least, the
term "literary works"

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:09.330
is now construed to
incorporate computer software.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.150
The history and economic implications
of this highly counter-intuitive

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.770
interpretation are very complicated.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.640
Here's a brief introduction
to the topic of software,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.750
a subject to which we'll
return several times.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.700
Before plunging into
the details of the law,

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.800
it's important to differentiate
the kinds of activities

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.630
that some-- not all--
software firms hope to curb.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.470
They're listed in the map.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:42.550
The first consists of consumer
reproduction of object code.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.720
By object code, I mean the
collection of ones and zeros

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.110
that embody the working
version of the program.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:54.330
By consumer reproduction, I mean the
behavior of individual software users.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.040
So for example, if I
borrowed a disc that you

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.900
had purchased containing
PowerPoint or Final Cut Pro

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:07.110
and made a copy of one of those
programs onto my own laptop hard drive,

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.280
my behavior would fall
into this first category.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.330
Commercial reproduction
of object code consists

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.390
of the same conduct
on a commercial scale.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.540
The vendors on the streets of
Beijing or Rio selling discs

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.330
containing pirated versions
of the Microsoft Office Suite

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:30.740
are engaged in commercial
reproduction of object code.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.660
Much different is the
activity of incorporating

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:39.230
parts of the source code of a
software program into a new program.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:44.990
Source code is the version of the
program in a human-readable language,

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.330
typically the language
which was originally

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:54.030
written before it was converted
or compiled into object code.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.630
Copying portions of the source code is
sometimes known as follow-on copying.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.860
This behavior includes a
wide range of behavior,

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.280
from the creation of modestly improved
versions of existing programs,

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.210
to the creation of
radically new programs

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.650
that incorporate small
bits of existing programs.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.640
Fourth and finally, some
developers-- not all--

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.260
wish to prevent what is sometimes
referred to as "non-literal" copying.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.390
This consists of the
creation of new programs

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:28.670
that have the same structure, sequence,
or organization as existing programs,

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.550
but use none of the code
of the existing programs.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.010
Suppose, for example, that I created
a program that worked exactly

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:40.480
like Photoshop, enabling
me to compete with Adobe,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.720
but I wrote my own code from scratch.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.800
My conduct would fall
into this fourth category.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.130
The reason for differentiating
these four categories is

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:55.130
that, as we'll see often during this
course, both the legal doctrines

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.560
and the policy issues that
they raise differ considerably.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.080
Now let's turn to the law.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.340
The history of efforts to use
law to discourage or penalize

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:11.550
the behaviors I just summarized
proceeded roughly as follows.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.310
In the 1950s and '60s, when the
computer industry was just getting off

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:20.620
the ground, a few integrated
firms provided-- typically

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.470
industrial-- customers both
hardware and associated software.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.690
These products typically
were task-specific,

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.570
and thus were often
customized for each client.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.430
The sellers and buyers of software
were usually-- though not always--

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.680
in contractual privity.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.800
Under this combination of circumstances,
the existing law of trade secrecy

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.090
provided reasonably good
protection against competitors.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:52.230
Typically, the software
and hardware firms

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.120
would provide their customers copies
of the object code of their programs

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.320
while retaining the source code.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.370
US courts ruled that public
distribution of object code

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.960
did not result in forfeiture
of trade secrecy protection,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.080
so long as the source
code was kept secret

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.480
and was reasonably hard
to reverse engineer.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.240
The combination of trade secret
law and the concentrated structure

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.230
of the software industry made
non-permissive copying rare.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.940
Gradually, however, the effectiveness
of trade secrecy protection diminished.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.100
Several factors were at work.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.020
They included the gradual
improvement of decompilers,

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:40.080
which facilitated reverse engineering,
the increased demand from customers

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.950
for access to source code, and
the fact that, in any event,

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.860
trade secrecy does not inhibit verbatim
reproduction of object code, which

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.530
is made public.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.000
Some firms responded to
these changing conditions

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.440
by increasing their reliance
on the law of contracts.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.490
They began to demand that
their customers agree

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:06.270
to various contractual restrictions
on their ability to reproduce, modify,

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:11.290
or redistribute the
programs provided to them.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.470
This strategy also worked
reasonably well for awhile,

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:20.280
but its effectiveness was
undermined by two circumstances.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.430
First, the firms came increasingly to
depend not upon expressed voluntary

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.490
acceptance of contractual
terms by their customers,

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:34.220
but instead upon so-called "shrink
wrap" or "click-through" licenses.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.710
The phrase "shrink-wrapped
license" refers to, ostensibly,

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.840
contractual commitments that were
printed on the outside of the boxes

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.100
that were sold to customers.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:50.730
A common term provided that, by breaking
the cellophane that enclosed the boxes,

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.350
the buyer agreed to all
the other provisions.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.220
The validity of such commitments
was far from certain.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:04.060
A decades-long struggle to settle this
question was, in the end, inconclusive.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.030
If you're curious about the
details of that struggle,

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.380
including the efforts
of a group of academics

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.910
to prevent the modification
of the Uniform Commercial Code

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.589
that would have resolved the matter
in favor of the software firms,

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.729
follow the link in the map
associated with the topic Contracts.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.879
The second limitation of contracts, from
the standpoint of the software firms,

00:17:27.879 --> 00:17:29.795
grows out of the peculiar
structure of the law

00:17:29.795 --> 00:17:32.590
of federalism in the United States.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.810
Briefly, contract law is state law,
whereas copyright law is federal law,

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:44.490
and under some circumstances, federal
law will trump or preempt state law.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:49.020
Skeptics of contractual limitations
on modifications or redistribution

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.320
of software sometimes challenge
those limitations on the grounds

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.860
that they were preempted.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:02.990
Another struggle, this time over the
scope of copyright preemption, ensued.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.060
Most of the cases that
were fought over this issue

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.560
eventually upheld
contractual limitations

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.260
against preemption challenges,
but the controversy

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.320
undermined the overall
effectiveness of this approach.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:24.880
By the late 1970s, the structure of the
software industry was changing fast.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.090
The increased use of integrated
circuits and microprocessors

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:33.330
made the price of
microcomputers drop rapidly.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.160
No longer was software
produced and sold primarily

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.800
by the hardware manufacturers.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.650
Instead, separate software firms
began manufacturing and distributing

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:45.390
both operating systems and
application programs designed

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.780
to run on devices
produced by other firms.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.090
These changes, combined with increased
dissatisfaction with trade secrecy

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.590
and contracts-- the
reasons I just suggested--

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.942
prompted some software firms
to seek increased protection

00:18:59.942 --> 00:19:01.025
from the law of copyright.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.780
Initially, copyright law
was not very hospitable.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.400
To be sure, as early
as 1964, the register

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.050
of copyrights in the United
States had expressed a willingness

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.490
to register copyrights in
software, but several uncertainties

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:25.640
in the relevant law and procedural
hurdles limited usage of this option.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.120
As of 1977, a total
of only 1,200 programs

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:37.100
had been registered, 80% percent
of them by either IBM or Burroughs.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:42.800
In 1974, as part of the long ramp-up to
the '76 general reform of the copyright

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.030
statute, Congress created
a commission known as CONTU

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.330
to consider the extent to which
copyright protection for software

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.360
should be clarified and expanded.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.660
The 1976 act itself recognized
copyright protection for software,

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.730
but did not settle all issues.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:08.220
CONTU's 1978 report, which was adopted
and implemented by Congress in 1980,

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.400
cleaned things up.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.300
The net result was that software
developers came to enjoy,

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.410
in the United States, all
of the entitlements enjoyed

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.910
by authors of other,
more traditional works.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.560
Europe soon followed suit.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.740
And finally, copyright
protection for software

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:31.640
was mandated by the TRIPS Agreement,
and is, thus, now close to universal.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.490
This is not the end
of the story, however.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.790
Copyright protection to not proved
to be a panacea, partially confirming

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.670
the arguments raised by CONTU's
critics, who thought copyright

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.720
protection for software was a
bad idea from the beginning.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.670
The limitations of copyright
prompted a subset of software firms

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:56.170
to press for patent protection, first
in the United States, then in Europe.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.610
They met with only mixed success.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:03.180
How and why copyright law
proved less than ideal

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:08.800
is a large and important question,
which we'll take up in another lecture.
