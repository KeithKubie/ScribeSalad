00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.920
Over, over?

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.860
Hell yes.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.360
Done.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.000
Okay good.  Because it's against Lair Policy anyway.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.120
I mean you shouldn't have been dating in the first place.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.200
Trust me, if my power were rewinding time, I would.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.140
What does that mean Hedgehog?

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.980
My name is Sonic.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.160
Yeah, the Hedgehog.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.460
God, how did I ever date him?

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.400
I don't know.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.120
Hey!

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.380
Look, I get it.  It's a 4-person Super Hero Team in close quarters

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.440
it was bound to happen.  But before I can get the paperwork rolling I need to know,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.640
is this official?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.700
Check my Facebook Page.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.160
Oh.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.680
Okay.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.240
*typing*

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.460
Uhm, no I don't want to update Firefox.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.500
Yeah.  Status single.  That is official.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.980
Boom.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.900
Dropped that mic.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.840
We done?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.240
Oh, and you haven't accepted my friend request yet.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.280
Oh, I don't go on Facebook a lot.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.460
Are you going to accept it?

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.660
I used to think Quickster was cute.  I mean

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.640
if he forgot my birthday, he could zip back with flowers before I could even get mad.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.880
But then I realized he's a self-involved douche bag and I broke it off.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.920
Not to mention that getting flowers wasn't the only thing he was quick at.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.320
I mean sex.  He came very quickly.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.080
Hey!

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.460
#Proud in and out.  Job done.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.800
I mean like if Chris Hemsworth is the sexiest man alive for playing a super hero,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.220
shouldn't I be the sexiest man alive for being a super hero?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.360
It kind of makes sense right?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.960
I really got to get this weapon inventory done.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.240
Oh yeah, yeah sure.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.980
Sorry. Uhm oh!  Also about this whole break up thing--you're team Quickster right?

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.900
Up top!

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.420
My man!

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.600
Get the weapons done.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.640
Yeah, I'm gonna get these done.  Okay.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.340
Thank you Quickster.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.840
I...

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.720
I just wish we had a bigger Lair.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.600
Since there are no other girls here, I'm really glad I have you.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.840
Yeah, I do not feel comfortable taking on a female role.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.220
But you're on Pinterest.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.820
Well yeah, I like to pin things.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.520
As the leader of a Super Hero group you have to manage a lot of egos.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.320
But love?  That is a battlefield I do not engage in.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.900
Psst!  Flamerod.  Hey, do you got some time for some girl talk?

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.560
No.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.120
I'll meet you at our spot.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440
I have got to change that name.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.520
Like I don't even want to get serious but then he wanted to label it

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.940
and suddenly I'm the needy one?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.800
What a jerk.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.220
Not to mention he was super quick in bed.  Did I tell you that already?

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.100
Yes yes yes yes, many times.  Too many times.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.200
I'm so glad I can open up to you, Flamerod.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.360
Yeah.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.020
*sobbing*

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.500
I told you, I want my cape back.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.280
It was a gift.  Besides, you said it slowed you down.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.860
Well I want it, so give it back!

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.360
No!

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.860
Yes!

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.360
No!

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.860
Yes!

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.360
No!

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.180
Everybody just settle down.  Please!

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.740
All right first order of real business, I'm changing my name from Flamerod to Firesticks.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.780
I'll get PR on that, get it out to the public asap.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.840
I'm HR, not PR.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.780
I believe in you.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.800
The best I can do is change it on your W-9.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.660
That's good enough.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.480
Can we hurry this meeting up?  It's my bath night.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.780
Okay, guys we're getting a new addition to the team.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.900
She comes highly recommended.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.980
She?!

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.340
We don't need another super hero.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.340
I agree.  We have plenty of powers between the 4 of us and this place is too small as is.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.200
There's just no room for someone else.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.720
Should I leave then?

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.500
But it would be crazy not to try and make it work.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.620
Hi.  I'm Sex Appeal.  Anyone care to show me around?

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.560
Yeah, that's actually my job.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.340
Sorry, they don't mean to stare.  Hey guys, c'mon.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.360
It's just been awhile since we've had a lady in the lair.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.300
Hey!

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.780
That's my ex, she means nothing to me, I'm completely sick of her shit.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.160
Hi.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.340
Hi.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.260
So, I'll give you a tour.  This meeting just wrapped up.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.540
Good meeting guys.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.960
Well--I'll join you on the tour.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.920
No I can, uh...

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.260
Why don't you finish up some of that?

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.200
No no, yeah.  We're done right?

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.300
*distant voices*

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.980
I've got stuff to do.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.680
I think the new girl seems great!

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.000
And over here we have the guns, no the buns!  Oh, I'm just joking, it's the weapons case.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.420
Oh, just in case?

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.560
Ahahaha!  Oh my God!  Just in case!

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.460
That's good!

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.640
It's a case.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.000
Wait is your other super power being super funny?

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.460
Maybe.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.700
I can't believe nobody was here to hear that.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.140
Hey girl, hey!

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.640
How are you settlin' in?

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.880
Oh, so great.  Everyone is being super nice.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:50.940
Yeah, yeah.  So uh, Sex Appeal, what exactly is your super power?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.960
Sex appeal.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.680
Hahaha.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.880
Yeah.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.120
Wait, you're serious?

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:07.140
But how do you defeat villains?  I mean this is not practical or tactical in any way.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.500
I mean you're basically a walking male fantasy.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.700
Don't you find that kind of degrading?

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.180
Oh, it's totally degrading.  But guess what?

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.560
95% of villains and their colleagues are men.  Therefore my body is my weapon.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.860
My breasts have a 70% effect on the male's ability to focus and think rationally.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.220
Thus giving me the advantage in the male-dominated crime fighting world.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.700
So we'll they're staring at my tits, you can get in there and take care of business.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.480
But that can't work on like every guy.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.280
*knocking*

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.020
Sex Appeal!  Are you decent?

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.880
No I'm not!  Come on in!

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.540
Sonic, hey!

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.340
Hi, you are here.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.920
Anyways I just wanted to check in on you and make sure you are settling in just fine.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.060
Everything is perfect.  Thank you.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.240
Great.  Now if you have any questions please uhm, just direct them to me.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.400
I'm the leader.  So I'm kind of the Top Dog here, lot of responsibilities, lot of muscles, ability to provide.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.380
I got a sense of humor--

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.020
Hey!  Sex Appeal!

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.560
Sex Appeal, I have some forms you need to finish?

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.520
Oh, I think I already filled them out.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.840
No, there's more.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.820
Still think it's not enough of a super power?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.120
Did you get your physical?  Actually before, uh, signing in here today?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.460
First off, we don't need her.  And second, Sex Appeal is a huge distraction!

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.700
What did you say?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.760
Exactly.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.420
Look, Sonic.  Sex Appeal has a very interesting set

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.380
of powers and abilities that could really help this super hero team.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.820
And so what if she's a little bit distracting.  I mean what's the worst that could happen?

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.380
*alarm sounding*

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.460
"Attention!  There has been a breach!"

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.160
I don't know, someone forgets to activate the force field!?

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.600
"I repeat!  There has been a breach!  All heros report!

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.220
*gasps*

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.400
Woa!

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.400
*applauding*

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.700
*cheering*

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.700
Oh!

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.720
For the camera! For the camera!

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.040
*cheering and applauding*

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.660
Guys don't worry.  I got this.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.860
Bring it.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.080
Ow.  He's super fast too.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.120
Sonic!  Do what you do.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.400
*screams*

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.140
Number 48 of things I don't miss about dating Sonic.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.940
*screaming continues*

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.220
I think his mask is like protecting him from my sonic blast or something.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.780
Dude, where did you get that?

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.900
Hey!

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.960
It's about time you filled out your termination form.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.860
I was going for the paper cut.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.980
HR!

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.660
All right breakdancing ninja!  Time to get poked by the Firestick!

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.060
Quickster where are you?

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.680
Hashtag that Super Hero life.  Mm!

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.600
Really Quickster?

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.740
Hey.  How's it going?

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.980
Dude, that's not going to work on me.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.220
Why not?

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.600
Because I am a heterosexual woman.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.180
Nice boobs though.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.360
I know.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.240
I think so too.  Totally great boobs.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.180
Please!

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.280
What are we going to do?

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.840
Don't you have any other super powers?

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.120
*Gun shot*

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.960
Oh!

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.960
God!

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.880
Ok that works!

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.660
Yeah.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.720
Ah, paper cut!

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.120
Ouch!

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.360
I'm trademarking that.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.820
Yeah!

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.320
Yeah.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.620
We did it!

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.400
We did it!  Yeah!

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.400
I did it!  HR.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.520
Great work team.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.920
I totally forgot I had my gun.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.720
Ahaha.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.160
This whole time!

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.600
That was really cool.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.560
That was cool.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.740
Bullets are like the one thing.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:59.740
Listen, we may not have worked out but you do a good job at keeping us all focused.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.880
And uhm, I'm really glad to be on a team with you.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.940
Thanks Quickster.  Me too.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.580
Hey, let's get a picture of all of us.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.080
Yeah!

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.980
A normal one, please.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.140
Of course.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.080
All right, that's good.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.760
Yeah, that last one was normal, I promise.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.120
All right let us see.
