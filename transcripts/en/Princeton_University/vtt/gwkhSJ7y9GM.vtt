CHRISTOPHER L.
EISGRUBER: I'd like

00:00:02.227 --> 00:00:05.520
to tell you a bit about the
2019 Princeton Pre-read, a book

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.080
that I'm really excited about
by James Williams called

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.980
"Stand Out of Our Light: Freedom
and Resistance in the Attention

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.007
Economy."

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:16.590
I'm excited about
this book because it

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.120
talks about some
changes that have

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.610
been happening in
our lives in ways

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.360
that we almost haven't noticed.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.250
Over the past decade or so,
we've all become dependent

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.070
on this digital technology
that's all around us now,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.860
where we carry our
phones with us,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.100
and if we ever happen to walk
out of our house without it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.470
or misplace it,
all of a sudden we

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.650
feel like we've lost a
lifeline of some kind.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.990
That digital technology
is having all kinds

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.850
of effects on our lives
that are terrific,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.570
which is why we want those
phones and that access

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.300
to digital media
during our days.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.010
But what James
Williams argues is

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.290
that they're also changing
our lives in other ways

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.840
that we haven't
come to appreciate.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.690
And that in doing so,
they're reducing our ability

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.040
to focus on the ends and the
goals that really matter to us.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.470
In the political
realm, for example,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.040
with all sorts of messages
all over the place

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.940
and a competition
for viewership,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.190
it's often the most
extreme messages

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.290
that get the most attention.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.480
And it has this feeling
that I think all of us

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.020
notice around us of kind
of heating up democracy,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.130
of making argument
and conversation more

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.960
volatile and often more
aggressive in character.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.080
It's affecting our
politics, and it also

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.260
affects a lot of what we do here
in the university and the way

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.720
we pursue our ordinary lives.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.110
So one of the things
that we do at University

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.530
is try to get people to take
the long-term perspective

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.720
and focus on ideas that
demand a lot of attention.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.440
But there are studies now that
suggest that simply having

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.250
your phone on you the way
that I do, or even next to you

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.790
as you're reading a book, can
diminish the level of attention

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.580
that you're bringing
to that book.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.200
So James Williams, in this
remarkable short book,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.990
raises a series of questions
that I think all of us

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.820
need to be thinking about.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.180
And I think Princeton
University is a great place

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.580
to be thinking about
these kinds of questions,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.710
because we have an
intellectual tradition here

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.070
that brings together
subjects like technology,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.500
and public policy, and ethics,
and the study of democracy.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.900
So I'm really thrilled
to be including this book

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.240
in our Pre-read tradition.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.460
Pre-read is something
that I created

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.065
as I took office six years ago.

00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:46.440
We're now distributing it to
all of our entering graduate

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.260
students as well as our
entering undergraduates,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.110
making it available to
others in the community who

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.610
are interested.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.050
And I hope that alumni and
others and faculty and staff

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.050
will be joining the incoming
students and me as we

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.660
read this book and talk
about the set of issues

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.036
that it raises.
