00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
♫ “Money, money, money” ♫

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.280
♫ “Must be funny” ♫

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.660
♫ “In the rich man’s world” ♫

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.960
There was a leak yesterday

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.760
but I think I fixed it

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.080
because it isn’t coming out today.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.280
Yes, it’s okay.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.360
Medium, like that.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.720
Stir it in there.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.240
It’s still a little bit thin and…

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.960
...like cottage cheese.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.280
Here she comes!

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.880
So how should I pour it?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.360
Here in the corner is a good place.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.080
I can hold the bucket with you.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.240
Oh…

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Get closer.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.920
(laughter)

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.040
It’s not so nice.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.120
(laughter)

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.520
Rauschenberg comes from Port Arthur, which
is an oil refinery town on the Gulf Coast

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.320
and the mud that you see here is bentonite
which is used in drilling

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.960
and I imagine he was familiar with the mud
pits that were the off-product of drilling

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.500
operations in Texas.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.120
I mean, it is wild because when it’s finely
done it’s bubbling and blurping…

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.480
Here it goes!

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.560
So it looks totally primordial

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.480
but on the other hand it’s futuristic.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.040
This is the technical cabinet

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.360
and this is where it all starts with the tape
recorder.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.889
On the tape you have low frequency and high
frequency sounds.

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:37.889
And that will be divided—split up—in
the light organ, so that’s why some bubbles

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:47.120
bubble when it’s low frequency and other
bubbles bubble when it’s high frequency.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.400
It’s the same way when the spotlights…

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.680
…in the disco work.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.840
Is that why you test it with ABBA?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.120
(laughter)

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320
Yeah.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.760
♫ “Money, money, money, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom…” ♫

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600
Now we need…

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.920
..eighty more.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920
Eighty more!

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.120
Give us like five more maybe?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.480
Five?

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.519
Five hundred.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.019
(laughter)
