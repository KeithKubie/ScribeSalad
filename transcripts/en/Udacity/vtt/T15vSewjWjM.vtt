This is Brian the Brain. He's going to help me show you what the brain's made

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:07.986
of The Cerebrum is the uppermost portion of the brain. It's also the largest

00:00:07.986 --> 00:00:11.933
part of the brain, covering about 2 3rd of the whole brain mass. And it's

00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:17.598
divided into two main hemispheres. Now, the outer layer of the Cerebrum is

00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:23.770
called the Cerebral Cortex. Interestingly, it's only about 1 10th or 1 5th of

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.491
an inch thick. However, even though it's really small, this is where much of

00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:34.355
our human thoughts, planning, perception, and consciousness take place. The

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:37.820
Frontal Lobe, in the front of the brain, of course, makes up about 1 3rd of the

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.040
area of the Cerebral Cortex. It's best known for its role in attention, working

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.135
memory, impulse control, being creative, and also abstract reasoning and

00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:53.930
thinking. It's what really makes us human. Because it's the youngest part of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.395
our brain, this is why children and teenagers can act more impulsively than

00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:02.290
adults. Their frontal lobes aren't fully developed. It isn't around until 20

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.718
years old or so, before the frontal lobe is fully developed. One important area

00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:12.554
of the frontal lobe is the primary motor cortex. This is in this area of the

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:17.429
frontal lobe. It's pretty cool how this was discovered. A German psychologist

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.540
in the 1860s notice that when he was caring for injured soldiers, he would

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.255
touch the surface of this area of the brain. And he found that a soldiers body

00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:30.280
would actually twitch on the opposite side. So, say he touched the right side.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.590
The left side of the soldier's body would twitch. From this and other research,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.662
we now know that different parts of the cortex are responsible for different

00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:41.991
functions. All of the parts of our body that we can move have a dedicated

00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:47.307
region of the motor cortex that is activated when we move our body parts. For

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:50.847
example, we have a region for our fingers, one for our wrists, one for our

00:01:50.847 --> 00:01:54.950
lips, one for our legs and more. You get the picture.
