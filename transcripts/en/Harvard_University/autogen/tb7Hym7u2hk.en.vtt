a serious discussion the first is do

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100
a serious discussion the first is do
 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.940
a serious discussion the first is do
people think this is a important problem

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950
people think this is a important problem

the reason why it's worth knowing that

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720
the reason why it's worth knowing that
 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.140

people don't even think about it
 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.220
people don't even think about it
the second question is do people

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230
the second question is do people
 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.020
the second question is do people
actually know people with this

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030
actually know people with this
 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.180
actually know people with this
experience and there you get a very

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190
experience and there you get a very
 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.930
experience and there you get a very
different reaction

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940
different reaction
 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.580

it doesn't enter into my life but if it
 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.590
it doesn't enter into my life but if it

is what is it that people think is

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790
is what is it that people think is
 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.360
is what is it that people think is
reason for this to happen and because

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370
reason for this to happen and because
 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.830
reason for this to happen and because
it's hard to solve problems that people

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840
it's hard to solve problems that people
 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.810
it's hard to solve problems that people
don't believe it is the reason then the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820
don't believe it is the reason then the
 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.200
don't believe it is the reason then the
last is and on this surface - there's

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210
last is and on this surface - there's
 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.120

some things that people should know when

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130
some things that people should know when
 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.770
some things that people should know when
all the X our planet will do they

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780
all the X our planet will do they
 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.720
all the X our planet will do they
actually know that is that what they

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730
actually know that is that what they
 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.940
actually know that is that what they
actually talk about about this issue so

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950
actually talk about about this issue so
 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.230
actually talk about about this issue so
I'm going to do this very very quickly

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240
I'm going to do this very very quickly
 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.410
I'm going to do this very very quickly
so first the slide is the people think

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420
so first the slide is the people think
 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.750
so first the slide is the people think
this is an important problem and the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760
this is an important problem and the
 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.240
this is an important problem and the
answer is it's actually a missus from

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250
answer is it's actually a missus from
 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.620
answer is it's actually a missus from
our national poll

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630
our national poll
 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.630
our national poll
as seen as great or greater than the

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640
as seen as great or greater than the
 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.640
as seen as great or greater than the
heroine threat in the United States so

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650
heroine threat in the United States so
 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.100
heroine threat in the United States so
if we had had a trend on this it

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110
if we had had a trend on this it
 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.600
if we had had a trend on this it
probably wouldn't have been anywhere

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610
probably wouldn't have been anywhere
 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.970
probably wouldn't have been anywhere
like this a decade ago and so this has

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980
like this a decade ago and so this has
 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.950
like this a decade ago and so this has
really gotten to be in the public mind

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960
really gotten to be in the public mind
 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.750
really gotten to be in the public mind
the second thing and this is the most

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760
the second thing and this is the most
 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.880
the second thing and this is the most
important thing next slide that I need

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890
important thing next slide that I need
 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.160
important thing next slide that I need
everybody to remember the rest is just

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:30.209
with chronic pain or have become
 

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:32.360
with chronic pain or have become
addicted to painkillers so what's going

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:32.370
addicted to painkillers so what's going
 

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.089
addicted to painkillers so what's going
on here how do you balance treating pain

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099
on here how do you balance treating pain
 

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:37.659
on here how do you balance treating pain
with the dangers of opioid addiction

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:37.669
with the dangers of opioid addiction
 

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.819
with the dangers of opioid addiction
yeah so when I think back on how we got

00:08:40.819 --> 00:08:40.829
yeah so when I think back on how we got
 

00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:42.889
yeah so when I think back on how we got
to where we got it it's really not that

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:42.899
to where we got it it's really not that
 

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:45.439
to where we got it it's really not that
surprising a lot of for a lot of reasons

00:08:45.439 --> 00:08:45.449
surprising a lot of for a lot of reasons
 

00:08:45.449 --> 00:08:47.689
surprising a lot of for a lot of reasons
first of all chronic pain is incredibly

00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:47.699
first of all chronic pain is incredibly
 

00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:49.069
first of all chronic pain is incredibly
common it's probably one the most common

people say yes they've had chronic pain

00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880
people say yes they've had chronic pain
 

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.220
people say yes they've had chronic pain
it doesn't mean that a hundred million

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:01.230
it doesn't mean that a hundred million
 

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.650
it doesn't mean that a hundred million
people need opioids or 100 million

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:03.660
people need opioids or 100 million
 

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.240
people need opioids or 100 million
people even need any medication but it's

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.250
people even need any medication but it's
 

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.759
people even need any medication but it's
just a chronic it's a common problem in

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:07.769
just a chronic it's a common problem in
 

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:10.400
just a chronic it's a common problem in
our society the other problem is that

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:10.410
our society the other problem is that
 

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.819
our society the other problem is that
we've approached chronic pain the same

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:13.829
we've approached chronic pain the same
 

00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:16.040
we've approached chronic pain the same
as we approach acute pain and acute pain

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.050
as we approach acute pain and acute pain
 

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.329
as we approach acute pain and acute pain
is a symptom it's after you have an

00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:17.339
is a symptom it's after you have an
 

00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:19.850
is a symptom it's after you have an
injury and it's life-sustaining chronic

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:19.860
injury and it's life-sustaining chronic
 

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.490
injury and it's life-sustaining chronic
pain is a very different problem and

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.500
pain is a very different problem and
 

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.870
pain is a very different problem and
it's it's much more like a chronic

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880
it's it's much more like a chronic
 

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.699
it's it's much more like a chronic
disease it's a multi-dimensional problem

00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:25.709
disease it's a multi-dimensional problem
 

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:27.139
disease it's a multi-dimensional problem
and and if you're trying to treat a

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:27.149
and and if you're trying to treat a
 

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:29.600
and and if you're trying to treat a
multi-dimensional problem like acute

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:29.610
multi-dimensional problem like acute
 

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.759
multi-dimensional problem like acute
pain you're gonna run into problems so I

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:31.769
pain you're gonna run into problems so I
 

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:33.290
pain you're gonna run into problems so I
think there's been an over-reliance on

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.300
think there's been an over-reliance on
 

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.360
think there's been an over-reliance on
treating chronic pain with medications

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.370
treating chronic pain with medications
 

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.819
treating chronic pain with medications
and medications only and take it one

00:09:37.819 --> 00:09:37.829
and medications only and take it one
 

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:39.410
and medications only and take it one
step further we've become very opiate

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420
step further we've become very opiate
 

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.300
step further we've become very opiate
centric in our approach to treating

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:41.310
centric in our approach to treating
 

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.720
centric in our approach to treating
chronic pain and and part of that is you

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:44.730
chronic pain and and part of that is you
 

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.670
chronic pain and and part of that is you
know society believing that opioids are

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680
know society believing that opioids are
 

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.860
know society believing that opioids are
somehow magical that they are the

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:48.870
somehow magical that they are the
 

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.300
somehow magical that they are the
treatment and and we now know that they

treatment and and we now know that they
 

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.730

necessarily the treatment in fact we
know that patients with acute pain

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:57.510
know that patients with acute pain
 

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.590
know that patients with acute pain
almost 100% of the time will respond

almost 100% of the time will respond
 

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.570
almost 100% of the time will respond
- an opioid but chronic pain it's more

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580
- an opioid but chronic pain it's more
 

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.250
- an opioid but chronic pain it's more

if people are expecting their pain to be

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:12.570
if people are expecting their pain to be
 

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.420
if people are expecting their pain to be
killed and gone

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.430
killed and gone
 

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.530
killed and gone
then they're gonna unrealistic

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540
then they're gonna unrealistic
 

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.150
then they're gonna unrealistic
expectations and they're gonna put a lot

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160
expectations and they're gonna put a lot
 

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.340
expectations and they're gonna put a lot
of pressure either on their provider to

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:19.350
of pressure either on their provider to
 

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.130
of pressure either on their provider to
increase the dose or they're gonna

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140
increase the dose or they're gonna
 

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.990
increase the dose or they're gonna
escalate the dose themselves so again if

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000
escalate the dose themselves so again if
 

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.460
escalate the dose themselves so again if
it's not working it's because they're

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:25.470
it's not working it's because they're
 

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.810
it's not working it's because they're
not on a high enough dose and so they

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820
not on a high enough dose and so they
 

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.519
not on a high enough dose and so they
start to escalate the dose and so I

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:28.529
start to escalate the dose and so I
 

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:30.590
start to escalate the dose and so I
think we've learned a lot about the

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600
think we've learned a lot about the
 

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.540
think we've learned a lot about the
complexities of chronic pain both how

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:32.550
complexities of chronic pain both how
 

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.130
complexities of chronic pain both how
calmer it is but also how complex it is

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140
calmer it is but also how complex it is
 

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.740
calmer it is but also how complex it is
and how we've been mismanaged in chronic

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:36.750
and how we've been mismanaged in chronic
 

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.120
and how we've been mismanaged in chronic
pain by relying too heavily on

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.130
pain by relying too heavily on
 

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.040
pain by relying too heavily on
medications and opioids in particular so

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.050
medications and opioids in particular so
 

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.900
medications and opioids in particular so
I think we need to focus more on that

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:41.910
I think we need to focus more on that
 

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.610
I think we need to focus more on that
and the one last complication when I put

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:46.620
and the one last complication when I put
 

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.949
and the one last complication when I put
on my primary care hat is this is very

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959
on my primary care hat is this is very
 

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:50.540
on my primary care hat is this is very
different than other things that I do in

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:50.550
different than other things that I do in
 

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.360
different than other things that I do in
primary care I use a risk-benefit

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:53.370
primary care I use a risk-benefit
 

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.220
primary care I use a risk-benefit
framework when I treat hypertension or

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:55.230
framework when I treat hypertension or
 

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.280
framework when I treat hypertension or
diabetes that is I prescribe a

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:58.290
diabetes that is I prescribe a
 

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.040
diabetes that is I prescribe a
medication I look for an objective

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.050
medication I look for an objective
 

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.410
medication I look for an objective
measure of benefit decrease in blood

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.420
measure of benefit decrease in blood
 

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.880
measure of benefit decrease in blood
pressure decrease in blood sugar and I

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:04.890
pressure decrease in blood sugar and I
 

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.920
pressure decrease in blood sugar and I
also look for objective measures in harm

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:06.930
also look for objective measures in harm
 

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.380
also look for objective measures in harm
maybe a blood tests maybe an increase in

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:09.390
maybe a blood tests maybe an increase in
 

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.150
maybe a blood tests maybe an increase in
and a blood test that tells me that

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160
and a blood test that tells me that
 

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.800
and a blood test that tells me that
there kidney function is suffering from

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:12.810
there kidney function is suffering from
 

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.060
there kidney function is suffering from
this medication so I have to balance

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.070
this medication so I have to balance
 

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.190
this medication so I have to balance
that benefit and risk when you're

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200
that benefit and risk when you're
 

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.340
that benefit and risk when you're
treating chronic pain with a medication

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:18.350
treating chronic pain with a medication
 

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.410
treating chronic pain with a medication
what's the benefit how do I measure pain

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420
what's the benefit how do I measure pain
 

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.390
what's the benefit how do I measure pain
how do I measure a function how do I

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:23.400
how do I measure a function how do I
 

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.280
how do I measure a function how do I
measure quality of life and how much of

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.290
measure quality of life and how much of
 

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.500
measure quality of life and how much of
those changes in those domains is enough

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:27.510
those changes in those domains is enough
 

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.449
those changes in those domains is enough
to say it's working and then how do I

00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459
to say it's working and then how do I
 

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:30.980
to say it's working and then how do I
measure harm what does addiction look

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:30.990
measure harm what does addiction look
 

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.260
measure harm what does addiction look
like and I'll say that a lot of patients

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:33.270
like and I'll say that a lot of patients
 

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.150
like and I'll say that a lot of patients
who are coming to me with pain and

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160
who are coming to me with pain and
 

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.640
who are coming to me with pain and
addiction don't see the addiction they

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:37.650
addiction don't see the addiction they
 

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.440
addiction don't see the addiction they
just focus on their pain issues and so

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:39.450
just focus on their pain issues and so
 

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.600
just focus on their pain issues and so
it's up to me to decipher this whole

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:41.610
it's up to me to decipher this whole
 

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.180
it's up to me to decipher this whole
thing in a 15-minute visit in a sterile

heroin recently did so after using
prescription opioids non-medically so we

transitioning and that transition
 

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.079
transitioning and that transition
happens over a period of time so we

happens over a period of time so we
 

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:11.790
happens over a period of time so we
clearly know we have lots of

continue to urgently address the
 

00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:25.170
continue to urgently address the

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.050
a drug overdose and prescription opioids
 

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.600
a drug overdose and prescription opioids
accounted for more of these deaths than

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:34.610
accounted for more of these deaths than
 

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.030
accounted for more of these deaths than
any other class of drug and while

that resulted from heroin use are rising

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:46.100
that resulted from heroin use are rising
 

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.230
that resulted from heroin use are rising
among all drugs from 2012 to 2013 heroin

among all drugs from 2012 to 2013 heroin
 

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.380
among all drugs from 2012 to 2013 heroin
had the largest upsurge overall with a

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:52.390
had the largest upsurge overall with a
 

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:57.340
had the largest upsurge overall with a
39% increase startingly from 2006 to

2013 heroin deaths increased by an
 

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.400
2013 heroin deaths increased by an
incredible 295 percent so we're gonna

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:03.410
incredible 295 percent so we're gonna
 

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.380
incredible 295 percent so we're gonna
talk about these solutions later on but

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:05.390
talk about these solutions later on but
 

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.880
talk about these solutions later on but
it's really important for us to

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:06.890
it's really important for us to
 

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.730
it's really important for us to
understand some of the challenges and

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:09.740
understand some of the challenges and
 

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.140
understand some of the challenges and
myths that we have about overdose

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:11.150
myths that we have about overdose
 

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.700
myths that we have about overdose
prevention and some of our treatment as

prevention and some of our treatment as
 

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.680
prevention and some of our treatment as
some of the data showed we clearly have

some of the data showed we clearly have
 

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.810
some of the data showed we clearly have
work to do to educate the people that we

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:49.580
happening in Massachusetts at a state
 

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.550
happening in Massachusetts at a state
level so this is a problem as you've

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:51.560
level so this is a problem as you've
 

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.289
level so this is a problem as you've
heard from director Botticelli that's

00:18:53.289 --> 00:18:53.299
heard from director Botticelli that's
 

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.879
heard from director Botticelli that's
affecting all of us at a national level

00:18:54.879 --> 00:18:54.889
affecting all of us at a national level
 

00:18:54.889 --> 00:18:57.759
affecting all of us at a national level
in the state of Massachusetts I'm gonna

00:18:57.759 --> 00:18:57.769
in the state of Massachusetts I'm gonna
 

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.289
in the state of Massachusetts I'm gonna
also give you these some numbers and I

00:18:59.289 --> 00:18:59.299
also give you these some numbers and I
 

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:00.700
also give you these some numbers and I
think the numbers are important because

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:00.710
think the numbers are important because
 

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.669
think the numbers are important because
has Professor blendin's polls showed

00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679
has Professor blendin's polls showed
 

00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:05.950
has Professor blendin's polls showed
there's still a lot of misconception and

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960
there's still a lot of misconception and
 

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.080
there's still a lot of misconception and
we don't you know we really need

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:07.090
we don't you know we really need
 

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.399
we don't you know we really need
information in order to move to action

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:09.409
information in order to move to action
 

00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:10.930
information in order to move to action
all right because if we don't have the

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:10.940
all right because if we don't have the
 

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.609
all right because if we don't have the
same baseline understanding it's harder

00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:12.619
same baseline understanding it's harder
 

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:14.769
same baseline understanding it's harder
to get to the point of action so in the

00:19:14.769 --> 00:19:14.779
to get to the point of action so in the
 

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:19.509
to get to the point of action so in the
year 2013 there were 978 unintentional

00:19:19.509 --> 00:19:19.519
year 2013 there were 978 unintentional
 

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:22.779
year 2013 there were 978 unintentional
opioid deaths in Massachusetts now what

00:19:22.779 --> 00:19:22.789
opioid deaths in Massachusetts now what
 

00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:24.070
opioid deaths in Massachusetts now what
do you make of that number just to give

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080
do you make of that number just to give
 

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.539
do you make of that number just to give
you something to compare that we're used

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:25.549
you something to compare that we're used
 

00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:26.499
you something to compare that we're used
to thinking about

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:26.509
to thinking about
 

00:19:26.509 --> 00:19:30.190
to thinking about
there were 371 motor vehicle accident

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200
there were 371 motor vehicle accident
 

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.970
there were 371 motor vehicle accident
deaths so two and a half times as many

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:33.980
deaths so two and a half times as many
 

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.340

documented unintentional opiate deaths
 

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.499
documented unintentional opiate deaths
as there were a motor vehicle accident

as there were a motor vehicle accident
 

00:19:38.509 --> 00:19:42.580
as there were a motor vehicle accident
deaths and behind those numbers right so

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:42.590
deaths and behind those numbers right so
 

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.259
deaths and behind those numbers right so
that's just the death that's the

00:19:44.259 --> 00:19:44.269
that's just the death that's the
 

00:19:44.269 --> 00:19:46.210
that's just the death that's the
ultimate indicator that we have but

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:46.220
ultimate indicator that we have but
 

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.409
ultimate indicator that we have but
behind that are at least 2,000 inpatient

00:19:50.409 --> 00:19:50.419
behind that are at least 2,000 inpatient
 

00:19:50.419 --> 00:19:54.580
behind that are at least 2,000 inpatient
hospital visits and over 4,500 emergency

room knows where to go if they need to

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:53.180
room knows where to go if they need to
 

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.610
room knows where to go if they need to
get their diabetes chapter they think

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:54.620
get their diabetes chapter they think
 

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.170
get their diabetes chapter they think
they have it and who should I talk to

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:56.180
they have it and who should I talk to
 

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.090
they have it and who should I talk to
but it's so different the way it's set

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:58.100
but it's so different the way it's set
 

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.910
but it's so different the way it's set
up so really this concept of different

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:00.920
up so really this concept of different
 

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.870
up so really this concept of different
treatments work for different

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880
treatments work for different
 

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.690
treatments work for different
individuals but there's data driven

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:03.700
individuals but there's data driven
 

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.100
individuals but there's data driven
medication assisted treatment but not

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:06.110
medication assisted treatment but not
 

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.690
medication assisted treatment but not
enough people know about and not enough

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:07.700
enough people know about and not enough
 

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.150
enough people know about and not enough
people have access to or know how to get

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:10.160
people have access to or know how to get
 

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.520
people have access to or know how to get
it and not enough capacity in the system

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:12.530
it and not enough capacity in the system
 

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.840
it and not enough capacity in the system
so that's really an important thing

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:13.850
so that's really an important thing
 

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.030

what is their risk of Meuse using this
opiate prescription and we know that a

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840
opiate prescription and we know that a
 

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.049

younger than 45 even having a nicotine
dependence put you at higher risk for

00:31:05.169 --> 00:31:05.179
dependence put you at higher risk for
 

00:31:05.179 --> 00:31:07.240
dependence put you at higher risk for
misusing an opiate prescription it

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:07.250
misusing an opiate prescription it
 

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.200
misusing an opiate prescription it
doesn't mean I'm not going to prescribe

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:08.210
doesn't mean I'm not going to prescribe
 

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:09.730
doesn't mean I'm not going to prescribe
it but it means that I'm gonna have a

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:09.740
it but it means that I'm gonna have a
 

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.289
it but it means that I'm gonna have a
conversation with you about your risk

00:31:11.289 --> 00:31:11.299
conversation with you about your risk
 

00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:13.120
conversation with you about your risk
and monitor you a little more closely

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:13.130
and monitor you a little more closely
 

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.820
and monitor you a little more closely
with the tools that I have to look for

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:15.830
with the tools that I have to look for
 

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.710
with the tools that I have to look for
misuse because oftentimes when people

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720
misuse because oftentimes when people
 

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.629
misuse because oftentimes when people
start misusing them they don't even

00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639
start misusing them they don't even
 

00:31:19.639 --> 00:31:21.430
start misusing them they don't even
recognize it themselves and so really

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440
recognize it themselves and so really
 

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.080
recognize it themselves and so really
what I'm looking for is measuring

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.090
what I'm looking for is measuring

what I'm looking for is measuring
looking at their urine drug test to make

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:24.710
looking at their urine drug test to make
 

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:25.779
looking at their urine drug test to make
sure they're taking what I'm prescribing

00:31:25.779 --> 00:31:25.789
sure they're taking what I'm prescribing
 

00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:28.029
sure they're taking what I'm prescribing
and not taking something else I'm we're

00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039
and not taking something else I'm we're
 

00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:29.379
and not taking something else I'm we're
doing pill counts to make sure they're

00:31:29.379 --> 00:31:29.389
doing pill counts to make sure they're
 

00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:31.419
doing pill counts to make sure they're
taking it exactly as prescribed and

we're checking the state prescription

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:32.809
we're checking the state prescription
 

00:31:32.809 --> 00:31:34.389
we're checking the state prescription
drug monitoring program which is a

00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399
drug monitoring program which is a
 

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:36.940
drug monitoring program which is a
database that the pharmacist the

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:36.950
database that the pharmacist the
 

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:38.680
database that the pharmacist the
pharmacies when they dispense a

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:38.690
pharmacies when they dispense a

medication a controlled substance like
 

00:31:40.429 --> 00:31:42.610
medication a controlled substance like
opioids enter it so I can look up for

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:42.620
opioids enter it so I can look up for
 

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.649
opioids enter it so I can look up for
any given patient to see what

00:31:44.649 --> 00:31:44.659
any given patient to see what

the pharmacy are they just coming for me

00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919
the pharmacy are they just coming for me
 

00:31:48.919 --> 00:31:50.710
the pharmacy are they just coming for me
are they doctor shopping going to other

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720
are they doctor shopping going to other
 

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.200
are they doctor shopping going to other
providers and so forth so these are all

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:53.210
providers and so forth so these are all
 

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.360
providers and so forth so these are all
the tools that I use and this is what we

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:55.370
the tools that I use and this is what we
 

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.490
the tools that I use and this is what we
train and I think probably one of the

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:57.500
train and I think probably one of the
 

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.930
train and I think probably one of the
most important things that these

00:31:58.930 --> 00:31:58.940
most important things that these
 

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.610
most important things that these
training programs cover is how to have a

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:00.620
training programs cover is how to have a
 

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.769
training programs cover is how to have a
conversation with patients because you

00:32:02.769 --> 00:32:02.779
conversation with patients because you
 

00:32:02.779 --> 00:32:05.080
conversation with patients because you
can imagine you go to medical school to

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:05.090
can imagine you go to medical school to
 

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.460
can imagine you go to medical school to
take care of people and you assume

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:06.470
take care of people and you assume
 

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:07.930
take care of people and you assume
there's a trusting relationship

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:07.940
there's a trusting relationship
 

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.390
there's a trusting relationship
and and back and forth and when you've

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:10.400
and and back and forth and when you've
 

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.460
and and back and forth and when you've
got somebody who's addicted to a

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:12.470
got somebody who's addicted to a
 

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:13.270
got somebody who's addicted to a
substance

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:13.280
substance
 

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.400
substance
you know they lie to themselves they lie

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:15.410
you know they lie to themselves they lie
 

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.450
you know they lie to themselves they lie
to their families and they lie to

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:16.460
to their families and they lie to
 

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.300
to their families and they lie to
providers and so it becomes a very

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:19.310
providers and so it becomes a very
 

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.150
providers and so it becomes a very
complicated conversation to to talk to

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:22.160
complicated conversation to to talk to
 

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.040
complicated conversation to to talk to
patients about the need to come off

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:24.050
patients about the need to come off
 

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.620
patients about the need to come off
these medications and get into treatment

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:26.630
these medications and get into treatment
 

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.480
these medications and get into treatment
and so we train people how to do that

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:30.490
and so we train people how to do that
 

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.520
and so we train people how to do that

that Massachusetts is one of the states
that requires that training to see that

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:45.860
that requires that training to see that
 

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:50.280

so many patients who were prescribed

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:50.290
so many patients who were prescribed
 

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.420

great outcome measure so I think it's

00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840
great outcome measure so I think it's
 

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.750
great outcome measure so I think it's
very important that physicians are

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760
very important that physicians are
 

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.640
very important that physicians are
required to do training here now

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:03.650
required to do training here now
 

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.740
required to do training here now
remember that the training is around

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:05.750
remember that the training is around
 

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:08.500
remember that the training is around
proper prescribing of pain medications

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:08.510
proper prescribing of pain medications
 

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.900
proper prescribing of pain medications
in which you know a component of that is

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:10.910
in which you know a component of that is
 

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:14.080
in which you know a component of that is
the issue around addiction and you know

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:14.090
the issue around addiction and you know
 

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.740
the issue around addiction and you know
it's it is three hours over two years so

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:17.750
it's it is three hours over two years so
 

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.600
it's it is three hours over two years so
I think it's definitely a starting point

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:19.610
I think it's definitely a starting point
 

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.760
I think it's definitely a starting point
and I think it's definitely a necessary

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:21.770
and I think it's definitely a necessary
 

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:24.610
and I think it's definitely a necessary
tool in our toolkit and I think all

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:24.620
tool in our toolkit and I think all
 

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.860
tool in our toolkit and I think all
prescribers should really be promoted to

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:26.870
prescribers should really be promoted to
 

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:31.180
prescribers should really be promoted to
do that at the minimum so am I surprised

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:31.190
do that at the minimum so am I surprised
 

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.720
do that at the minimum so am I surprised
no because most people don't get the

suppressing breathing so when someone is

00:34:30.309 --> 00:34:30.319
suppressing breathing so when someone is
 

00:34:30.319 --> 00:34:32.289
suppressing breathing so when someone is
in that situation where their breathing

00:34:32.289 --> 00:34:32.299
in that situation where their breathing
 

00:34:32.299 --> 00:34:34.480
in that situation where their breathing
is suppressed there's a medication

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:34.490
is suppressed there's a medication
 

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:36.579
is suppressed there's a medication
called naloxone many people know it as

really anybody and the way it's
 

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:42.700
really anybody and the way it's
administered it used to be that you had

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:42.710
administered it used to be that you had
 

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.289
administered it used to be that you had
to have a needle and inject it and the

00:34:44.289 --> 00:34:44.299
to have a needle and inject it and the
 

00:34:44.299 --> 00:34:48.039
to have a needle and inject it and the
latest form you put on this nasal

latest form you put on this nasal
 

00:34:48.049 --> 00:34:49.599
latest form you put on this nasal

from an opiate use wakes up so this can

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:08.030
from an opiate use wakes up so this can
 

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.930
from an opiate use wakes up so this can
be life-saving and a really important

tool in our toolkit when we're thinking
 

00:35:13.549 --> 00:35:16.180
tool in our toolkit when we're thinking
about opiate and especially around the

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:16.190
about opiate and especially around the
 

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.950
about opiate and especially around the
emergent situation where someone has

emergent situation where someone has
 

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.960
emergent situation where someone has
taken too much opiates and their

breathing is suppressed so in

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:21.530
breathing is suppressed so in

Massachusetts starting in 2007 we began

00:35:24.819 --> 00:35:24.829
Massachusetts starting in 2007 we began
 

00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:27.730
Massachusetts starting in 2007 we began
having pilots where initially we focused

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:27.740
having pilots where initially we focused
 

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.380
having pilots where initially we focused
on injection drug users who were

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:29.390
on injection drug users who were
 

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:31.510
on injection drug users who were
actively using and getting it out into

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520
actively using and getting it out into
 

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.549
actively using and getting it out into
the community so they were able to see

00:35:33.549 --> 00:35:33.559
the community so they were able to see
 

00:35:33.559 --> 00:35:35.440
the community so they were able to see
how this was how they can use this

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:35.450
how this was how they can use this
 

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.079
how this was how they can use this
within the community then we went to

00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:38.089
within the community then we went to
 

00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:40.030
within the community then we went to
what's called bystanders and that's

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040
what's called bystanders and that's
 

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.910
what's called bystanders and that's
really family members or friends who

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920
really family members or friends who
 

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.220
really family members or friends who
could be near somebody who they think is

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:45.230
could be near somebody who they think is
 

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:47.380
could be near somebody who they think is
at risk of overdosing so they can

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:47.390
at risk of overdosing so they can
 

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:50.950
at risk of overdosing so they can
administer the naloxone and in addition

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960
administer the naloxone and in addition
 

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.720
administer the naloxone and in addition
to providing the basic training that

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:52.730
to providing the basic training that
 

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.270
to providing the basic training that
comes with a naloxone we also did and we

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280
comes with a naloxone we also did and we
 

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.170
comes with a naloxone we also did and we
also do education on what opiate

00:35:59.170 --> 00:35:59.180
also do education on what opiate
 

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.030
also do education on what opiate
overdose looks like how to do rescue

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040
overdose looks like how to do rescue
 

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.339
overdose looks like how to do rescue
breathing's the importance of calling

00:36:03.339 --> 00:36:03.349
breathing's the importance of calling
 

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:05.740
breathing's the importance of calling
9-1-1 because as I mentioned the effects

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:05.750
9-1-1 because as I mentioned the effects
 

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.150
9-1-1 because as I mentioned the effects

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160
lasts for a short amount of time but
 

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.559
lasts for a short amount of time but
they still need to then get medical

00:36:08.559 --> 00:36:08.569
they still need to then get medical
 

00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:12.030
they still need to then get medical
attention and then from that starting in

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.040
attention and then from that starting in
 

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.490
attention and then from that starting in
2010 we then expanded further to first

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:15.500
2010 we then expanded further to first
 

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.620
2010 we then expanded further to first
responders so police and fire who

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:17.630
responders so police and fire who
 

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.140
responders so police and fire who
oftentimes get to an event right

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:20.150
oftentimes get to an event right
 

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.760
oftentimes get to an event right
somebody calls 911 when they get to an

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:21.770
somebody calls 911 when they get to an
 

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.740
somebody calls 911 when they get to an
event and they can tell that it's an

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:23.750
event and they can tell that it's an
 

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.589
event and they can tell that it's an
overdose but they have no tools and of

00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:26.599
overdose but they have no tools and of
 

00:36:26.599 --> 00:36:28.089
overdose but they have no tools and of
course as you can imagine if someone's

00:36:28.089 --> 00:36:28.099
course as you can imagine if someone's
 

00:36:28.099 --> 00:36:29.260
course as you can imagine if someone's
not breathing you have to quickly

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:29.270
not breathing you have to quickly
 

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.470
not breathing you have to quickly
reverse this

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480
reverse this
 

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.180
reverse this
so we have 23 different high risk

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:32.190
so we have 23 different high risk
 

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.370
so we have 23 different high risk
communities around Massachusetts who are

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:34.380
communities around Massachusetts who are
 

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:38.210
communities around Massachusetts who are
now using naloxone as a tool we've given

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:38.220
now using naloxone as a tool we've given
 

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.800
now using naloxone as a tool we've given
out since the beginning of this program

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:39.810
out since the beginning of this program
 

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.890
out since the beginning of this program
over 35,000 different kits and have

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900
over 35,000 different kits and have
 

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:47.089
over 35,000 different kits and have
documented over 5,000 reversals so it's

00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099
documented over 5,000 reversals so it's
 

00:36:47.099 --> 00:36:48.829

00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839
incredibly important tool that we've
 

00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:50.809
incredibly important tool that we've
seen I think first responders play a

00:37:50.809 --> 00:37:50.819
seen I think first responders play a
 

00:37:50.819 --> 00:37:53.660
seen I think first responders play a
critical role because in many parts of

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:53.670
critical role because in many parts of
 

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.190
critical role because in many parts of
the country we know that the issues

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200
the country we know that the issues
 

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.809
the country we know that the issues
around prescription drug and heroin and

00:37:56.809 --> 00:37:56.819
around prescription drug and heroin and
 

00:37:56.819 --> 00:37:59.000
around prescription drug and heroin and
then particularly hard hit in rural and

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.010
then particularly hard hit in rural and
 

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.460
then particularly hard hit in rural and
suburban areas and so particularly first

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:01.470
suburban areas and so particularly first
 

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.559
suburban areas and so particularly first
responders can play a critical role here

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:03.569

we don't see treatment programs where we
don't have other outreach programs so

00:38:15.319 --> 00:38:15.329
don't have other outreach programs so
 

00:38:15.329 --> 00:38:17.120

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:00.030
the sense of that we do if there is a
 

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.030
the sense of that we do if there is a
bright spot here we do have highly

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040
bright spot here we do have highly
 

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.400
bright spot here we do have highly
effective medications for the use of

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:04.410
effective medications for the use of
 

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.710

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:12.600
however are tremendously underutilized
 

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.690
however are tremendously underutilized
medications they are underutilized in

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700
medications they are underutilized in
 

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.010

our treatment system in our criminal

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020
our treatment system in our criminal
 

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.680
our treatment system in our criminal
justice system and we have an

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:18.690
justice system and we have an
 

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.010
justice system and we have an
opportunity to really build on the

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020
opportunity to really build on the
 

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.110
opportunity to really build on the
uptake of these medications along with

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:24.120
uptake of these medications along with
 

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.060
uptake of these medications along with
other behavioral therapies and that's

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:26.070
other behavioral therapies and that's
 

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.280
other behavioral therapies and that's
been a big part of our federal effort to

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:28.290
been a big part of our federal effort to
 

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:31.330
been a big part of our federal effort to
increase funding and to really require

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:31.340
increase funding and to really require
 

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:35.060
increase funding and to really require
our federal grantees to use these highly

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:35.070
our federal grantees to use these highly
 

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:36.680
our federal grantees to use these highly
effective medications as part of their

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:36.690
effective medications as part of their
 

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:39.650
effective medications as part of their
treatment regimen dr. Alfred to do

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660
treatment regimen dr. Alfred to do
 

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.480
treatment regimen dr. Alfred to do
anything yeah yeah and I think

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:41.490
anything yeah yeah and I think
 

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.460
anything yeah yeah and I think
historically we've held treatment for

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:43.470
historically we've held treatment for
 

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.190
historically we've held treatment for
addiction to a different standard than

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200
addiction to a different standard than
 

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.330
addiction to a different standard than
treatment of everything else that I do

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:47.340
treatment of everything else that I do
 

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.520
treatment of everything else that I do
in primary care that is if I put

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:49.530
in primary care that is if I put
 

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:51.410
in primary care that is if I put
somebody on a treatment and they get

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420
somebody on a treatment and they get
 

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.380
somebody on a treatment and they get
better I say the treatments working and

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:54.390
better I say the treatments working and
 

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:55.850
better I say the treatments working and
if I take the treatment away and their

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:55.860
if I take the treatment away and their
 

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.370
if I take the treatment away and their
problem becomes you know reoccurs it

00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:58.380
problem becomes you know reoccurs it
 

00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.750
problem becomes you know reoccurs it
gets bad I say that treatment really

00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760
gets bad I say that treatment really
 

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.260
gets bad I say that treatment really
worked

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:00.270
worked
 

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.480
worked
but with addiction treatment you you put

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:02.490
but with addiction treatment you you put
 

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:03.830
but with addiction treatment you you put
somebody on treatment they get better

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:03.840
somebody on treatment they get better
 

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.710
somebody on treatment they get better
you take the treatment away and it stops

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720
you take the treatment away and it stops
 

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.270
you take the treatment away and it stops
working and people say the treatment

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280
working and people say the treatment
 

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.790
working and people say the treatment
didn't work but really the treatment did

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800
didn't work but really the treatment did
 

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.010
didn't work but really the treatment did
work is just you took it away and so I

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020
work is just you took it away and so I
 

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.260
work is just you took it away and so I
think people need to understand people

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:15.270
think people need to understand people
 

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:16.310
think people need to understand people
need to understand that you know

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.320
need to understand that you know
 

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.900
need to understand that you know
addiction treatment needs to be long

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:17.910
addiction treatment needs to be long
 

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.060
addiction treatment needs to be long

or not you know again wearing my primary

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:22.380
or not you know again wearing my primary
 

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.230
or not you know again wearing my primary
care hat I know that there are lots of

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240
care hat I know that there are lots of
 

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.670
care hat I know that there are lots of
different medications I use for treating

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680
different medications I use for treating
 

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.340
different medications I use for treating
hypertension and diabetes and I wouldn't

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:28.350
hypertension and diabetes and I wouldn't
 

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.380
hypertension and diabetes and I wouldn't
say that you know one is absolutely the

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:30.390
say that you know one is absolutely the
 

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:32.600
say that you know one is absolutely the
better than another it's individualized

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:32.610
better than another it's individualized
 

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.580
better than another it's individualized
it depends on the person and there are

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:34.590
it depends on the person and there are
 

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.280
it depends on the person and there are
other comorbidities so I'd like to keep

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:37.290
other comorbidities so I'd like to keep
 

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:38.930
other comorbidities so I'd like to keep
an open mind where the diction treatment

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:38.940
an open mind where the diction treatment
 

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.070
an open mind where the diction treatment
to I mean there are some people who do

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:40.080
to I mean there are some people who do
 

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.170
to I mean there are some people who do
very well with with medication someone

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180
very well with with medication someone
 

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.180
very well with with medication someone
who do very well without medication and

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:44.190
who do very well without medication and
 

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:45.680
who do very well without medication and
so I think it's important for our

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:45.690
so I think it's important for our
 

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.270
so I think it's important for our
community to understand that that it's

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280
community to understand that that it's
 

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.560
community to understand that that it's
you know there are lots of different

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:48.570
you know there are lots of different
 

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.540
you know there are lots of different
treatments out there and some work for

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:50.550
treatments out there and some work for
 

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:54.020
treatments out there and some work for
some people and not for others do

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:54.030
some people and not for others do
 

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.610
some people and not for others do
we've had some mention of the

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:55.620
we've had some mention of the
 

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.680
we've had some mention of the
prescription drug monitoring program and

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:57.690
prescription drug monitoring program and
 

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.420
prescription drug monitoring program and
I wondered commissioner burrell can you

00:42:59.420 --> 00:42:59.430
I wondered commissioner burrell can you
 

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:03.470
I wondered commissioner burrell can you
talk about what that program does and

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480
talk about what that program does and
 

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.680
talk about what that program does and
how it works here in Massachusetts sure

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:06.690
how it works here in Massachusetts sure
 

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.390
how it works here in Massachusetts sure
I'd be happy to so I spoke earlier about

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400
I'd be happy to so I spoke earlier about
 

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.670
I'd be happy to so I spoke earlier about
the importance of data and having an

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680
the importance of data and having an
 

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.609
the importance of data and having an
understanding before we go to action and

00:43:12.609 --> 00:43:12.619
understanding before we go to action and
 

00:43:12.619 --> 00:43:16.070
understanding before we go to action and
another component of having data is this

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:16.080
another component of having data is this
 

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.970
another component of having data is this
prescription monitoring system and again

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:18.980
prescription monitoring system and again
 

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.170
prescription monitoring system and again
you know I'm just thinking as folks

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.180
you know I'm just thinking as folks
 

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.609
you know I'm just thinking as folks
we're talking about this you know the

00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619
we're talking about this you know the
 

00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:24.550
we're talking about this you know the
really the underlying current here is

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560
really the underlying current here is
 

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.380
really the underlying current here is
stigma and segregation to me so the

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:27.390
stigma and segregation to me so the
 

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:29.510
stigma and segregation to me so the
segregation of components and care and

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520
segregation of components and care and
 

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.700
segregation of components and care and
it's really this undercurrent of stigma

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:31.710
it's really this undercurrent of stigma
 

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:34.520
it's really this undercurrent of stigma
and how we as a society think about this

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:34.530
and how we as a society think about this
 

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.560
and how we as a society think about this
chronic disease versus any other one

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:36.570
chronic disease versus any other one
 

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.390
chronic disease versus any other one
that we treat so just to put that out

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400
that we treat so just to put that out
 

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.410
that we treat so just to put that out
there so as we're talking about the

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420
there so as we're talking about the
 

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.830
there so as we're talking about the
prescription monitoring system so in

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:42.840
prescription monitoring system so in
 

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.300
prescription monitoring system so in
Massachusetts we have a prescription

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:44.310
Massachusetts we have a prescription
 

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:45.950
Massachusetts we have a prescription
monitoring system in place that we've

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960
monitoring system in place that we've
 

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.560
monitoring system in place that we've
had for several years and several months

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:48.570
had for several years and several months
 

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.109
had for several years and several months
ago I used it as a clinician so what it

00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119
ago I used it as a clinician so what it
 

00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:52.880
ago I used it as a clinician so what it
is is that when you have a patient

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:52.890
is is that when you have a patient
 

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.680
is is that when you have a patient
sitting in front of you there's a

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:54.690
sitting in front of you there's a
 

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:57.140
sitting in front of you there's a
database that you can look so John Smith

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:57.150
database that you can look so John Smith
 

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:59.330
database that you can look so John Smith
comes in wants a medication I can then

00:43:59.330 --> 00:43:59.340
comes in wants a medication I can then
 

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.210
comes in wants a medication I can then
on my computer screen look up and see

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.220
on my computer screen look up and see
 

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.430
on my computer screen look up and see
which opiates he has received in the

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440
which opiates he has received in the
 

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.130
which opiates he has received in the
last 12 months so this has become a very

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140
last 12 months so this has become a very
 

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.160
last 12 months so this has become a very
powerful tool in the doctor's office to

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:10.170
powerful tool in the doctor's office to
 

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.170
powerful tool in the doctor's office to
be able to see what other prescriptions

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180
be able to see what other prescriptions
 

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:15.020
be able to see what other prescriptions
were given the way that the system works

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:15.030
were given the way that the system works
 

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.460
were given the way that the system works
is that it's throughout Massachusetts

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:16.470
is that it's throughout Massachusetts
 

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.070
is that it's throughout Massachusetts
and any patient was receiving any

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:19.080
and any patient was receiving any
 

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.780
and any patient was receiving any
prescription with an address in

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:20.790
prescription with an address in
 

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.160
prescription with an address in
Massachusetts so even if they get the

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:22.170
Massachusetts so even if they get the
 

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.260
Massachusetts so even if they get the
prescription out of state is in the

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:24.270
prescription out of state is in the
 

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:26.120
prescription out of state is in the
system so it's this huge database of

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:26.130
system so it's this huge database of
 

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.640
system so it's this huge database of
information it also is connected to the

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:28.650
information it also is connected to the
 

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:30.410
information it also is connected to the
pharmacy so the pharmacies have the same

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420
pharmacy so the pharmacies have the same
 

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.050
pharmacy so the pharmacies have the same
information and is meant to be again

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060
information and is meant to be again
 

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.450
information and is meant to be again
another tool to make an informed

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.460
another tool to make an informed
 

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:38.150
another tool to make an informed
decision around whether or not the

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160
decision around whether or not the
 

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.800
decision around whether or not the
person sitting in front of you is

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:39.810
person sitting in front of you is
 

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.050
person sitting in front of you is
struggling with addiction or needs pain

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:42.060
struggling with addiction or needs pain
 

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.310
struggling with addiction or needs pain
meds or where else they're getting their

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:43.320
meds or where else they're getting their
 

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.670
meds or where else they're getting their
prescriptions so we have had there at

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680
prescriptions so we have had there at
 

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.859
prescriptions so we have had there at
this point all physicians are required

00:44:48.859 --> 00:44:48.869
this point all physicians are required
 

00:44:48.869 --> 00:44:51.530
this point all physicians are required
to be on the system and connected to the

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540
to be on the system and connected to the
 

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.260
to be on the system and connected to the
system and 79% of physicians are and

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:54.270
system and 79% of physicians are and
 

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.940
system and 79% of physicians are and
it's a requirement related to their

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:55.950
it's a requirement related to their
 

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:57.500
it's a requirement related to their
license so eventually we'll have a

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:57.510
license so eventually we'll have a
 

00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:00.050
license so eventually we'll have a
hundred percent and our next step is to

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060
hundred percent and our next step is to
 

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.090
hundred percent and our next step is to
make it more user friendly because the

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:02.100
make it more user friendly because the
 

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.220
make it more user friendly because the
end user experience is still inhibiting

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:04.230
end user experience is still inhibiting
 

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.160
end user experience is still inhibiting
individuals from using it more actively

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:07.170
individuals from using it more actively
 

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.530
individuals from using it more actively
in their clinical flow so it's really

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:09.540
in their clinical flow so it's really
 

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.920
in their clinical flow so it's really
become a good way for individuals to get

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:12.930
become a good way for individuals to get
 

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.140
become a good way for individuals to get
notification and for pharmacies so that

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:15.150
notification and for pharmacies so that
 

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.430
notification and for pharmacies so that
they can yet then use that piece of

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440
they can yet then use that piece of
 

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.250
they can yet then use that piece of
to inform what they're doing speaking of

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:20.260
to inform what they're doing speaking of
 

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.340
to inform what they're doing speaking of
data dude do you know what percentage of

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:23.350
data dude do you know what percentage of
 

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:25.350
data dude do you know what percentage of
physicians are actively using the

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:25.360
physicians are actively using the
 

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.390
physicians are actively using the
database yes so that's a good question

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400
database yes so that's a good question
 

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.280
database yes so that's a good question
so in the way the current prescription

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:29.290
so in the way the current prescription
 

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.500
so in the way the current prescription
monitoring system is set up it's

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:31.510
monitoring system is set up it's
 

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.180
monitoring system is set up it's
probably about twenty to thirty percent

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:33.190
probably about twenty to thirty percent
 

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:35.490
probably about twenty to thirty percent
the problem with that number though is

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:35.500
the problem with that number though is
 

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.960
the problem with that number though is
that we don't have the denominator

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:36.970
that we don't have the denominator
 

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.600
that we don't have the denominator
because not every physician who signed

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:39.610
because not every physician who signed
 

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:40.980
because not every physician who signed
up it's mandatory to signed up is

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:40.990
up it's mandatory to signed up is
 

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.560
up it's mandatory to signed up is
actually prescribing opiates so we hope

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:43.570
actually prescribing opiates so we hope
 

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.680
actually prescribing opiates so we hope
we're going to enhance our prescription

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:46.690
we're going to enhance our prescription
 

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:48.060
we're going to enhance our prescription
monitoring system in the next few months

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:48.070
monitoring system in the next few months
 

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.470
monitoring system in the next few months
and hope to have a more sophisticated

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480
and hope to have a more sophisticated
 

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.080
and hope to have a more sophisticated
way to accurately report that part of

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:52.090
way to accurately report that part of
 

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:53.730
way to accurately report that part of
having individuals use it more though is

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:53.740
having individuals use it more though is
 

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.530
having individuals use it more though is
to have it be more user friendly which

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:55.540
to have it be more user friendly which
 

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:56.850
to have it be more user friendly which
is one of our primary things that we're

00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:56.860
is one of our primary things that we're
 

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.850
is one of our primary things that we're
working on now director do you want to

00:45:59.850 --> 00:45:59.860
working on now director do you want to
 

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.070
working on now director do you want to
talk about nationally what's happening

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:02.080
talk about nationally what's happening
 

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.590
talk about nationally what's happening
sure these programs so I think this

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:04.600
sure these programs so I think this
 

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.700
sure these programs so I think this
underscores where the commissioner is

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:05.710
underscores where the commissioner is
 

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:08.310
underscores where the commissioner is
talking about so a big part of our

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:08.320
talking about so a big part of our
 

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.550
talking about so a big part of our
strategy has been to increase the

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:11.560
strategy has been to increase the
 

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.260
strategy has been to increase the
prescription drug monitoring programs

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:13.270
prescription drug monitoring programs
 

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:17.490
prescription drug monitoring programs
and its utility so in 2006 I think we

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:17.500
and its utility so in 2006 I think we
 

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.200
and its utility so in 2006 I think we
had 20 states that had prescription drug

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:19.210
had 20 states that had prescription drug
 

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.840
had 20 states that had prescription drug
monitoring programs and as of today we

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:21.850
monitoring programs and as of today we
 

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:23.700
monitoring programs and as of today we
have 49 states in the District of

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:23.710
have 49 states in the District of
 

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:27.290
have 49 states in the District of
Columbia Missouri as the last holdout

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:27.300
Columbia Missouri as the last holdout
 

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:32.190
Columbia Missouri as the last holdout
and I won't talk about why but so part

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:32.200
and I won't talk about why but so part
 

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.200
and I won't talk about why but so part
of what we're doing is not just that we

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:34.210
of what we're doing is not just that we
 

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:35.970
of what we're doing is not just that we
have these programs operational but to

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:35.980
have these programs operational but to
 

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.590
have these programs operational but to
the commissioners point we have been

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:37.600
the commissioners point we have been
 

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.060
the commissioners point we have been
working at the federal level to make

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:39.070
working at the federal level to make
 

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:40.950
working at the federal level to make
sure that these programs can talk across

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960
sure that these programs can talk across
 

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.110
sure that these programs can talk across
state lines so interstate operability

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:43.120
state lines so interstate operability
 

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.080
state lines so interstate operability
has been a big goal we've also been

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:46.090
has been a big goal we've also been
 

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:48.150
has been a big goal we've also been
working on ways and pilot programs to

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160
working on ways and pilot programs to
 

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.250
working on ways and pilot programs to
increase the utility and usability of

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:50.260
increase the utility and usability of
 

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.290
increase the utility and usability of
these program so we've been working with

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:52.300
these program so we've been working with
 

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.690
these program so we've been working with
Office of National Coordinator on how do

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:54.700
Office of National Coordinator on how do
 

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.840
Office of National Coordinator on how do
you link these programs to electronic

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:57.850
you link these programs to electronic
 

00:46:57.850 --> 00:46:59.030
you link these programs to electronic
medical records and health information

00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040
medical records and health information
 

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.680
medical records and health information
exchanges so that physicians and

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:01.690
exchanges so that physicians and
 

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:03.660
exchanges so that physicians and
prescribers don't have to kind of log

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:03.670
prescribers don't have to kind of log
 

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:05.490
prescribers don't have to kind of log
off one system and log on another that's

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:05.500
off one system and log on another that's
 

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.190
off one system and log on another that's

me just say too that we've seen where
 

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:12.180
me just say too that we've seen where
these programs have been implemented

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:12.190
these programs have been implemented
 

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:13.800
these programs have been implemented
where we have robust prescription

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:13.810
where we have robust prescription
 

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:15.270
where we have robust prescription
monitoring programs and where they're

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280
monitoring programs and where they're
 

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.970
monitoring programs and where they're
used we've seen some tremendous success

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:17.980
used we've seen some tremendous success
 

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:20.130

relations around this and do you think

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160
relations around this and do you think
 

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:50.190
relations around this and do you think
these new technologies hold promise yeah

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:50.200
these new technologies hold promise yeah
 

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.570
these new technologies hold promise yeah
so I think we've learned some lessons

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:51.580
so I think we've learned some lessons
 

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.850
so I think we've learned some lessons
about extended-release long-acting

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:53.860
about extended-release long-acting
 

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.920
about extended-release long-acting
opioids where you know they're they're

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:55.930
opioids where you know they're they're
 

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:57.300
opioids where you know they're they're
essentially short-acting opioids but

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:57.310
essentially short-acting opioids but
 

00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:59.850
essentially short-acting opioids but
they're packaged in a way that when you

00:49:59.850 --> 00:49:59.860
they're packaged in a way that when you
 

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.230
they're packaged in a way that when you
ingest them the way you're supposed to

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240
ingest them the way you're supposed to
 

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.060
ingest them the way you're supposed to
do that is swallow them there's a slow

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:03.070
do that is swallow them there's a slow
 

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:04.920
do that is swallow them there's a slow
release so you get twelve hours worth of

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:04.930
release so you get twelve hours worth of
 

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.740
release so you get twelve hours worth of
relief as opposed to four hours the

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:07.750
relief as opposed to four hours the
 

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:09.030
relief as opposed to four hours the
problem being that you have to put a lot

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040
problem being that you have to put a lot
 

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.100
problem being that you have to put a lot
of molecule in that tablet in order to

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:11.110
of molecule in that tablet in order to
 

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:12.990
of molecule in that tablet in order to
get that 12 hours of relief and if if

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000
get that 12 hours of relief and if if
 

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.660
get that 12 hours of relief and if if
you crush it and snort it you get a lot

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:15.670
you crush it and snort it you get a lot
 

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:17.400
you crush it and snort it you get a lot
of short-acting and that becomes very

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:17.410
of short-acting and that becomes very
 

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.910
of short-acting and that becomes very
rewarding and very addicting and so as a

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920
rewarding and very addicting and so as a
 

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.580
rewarding and very addicting and so as a
result of that a lot of the

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:22.590
result of that a lot of the
 

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:25.050
result of that a lot of the
manufacturers of these medications are

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:25.060
manufacturers of these medications are
 

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.090
manufacturers of these medications are
creating formulations that are much

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:27.100
creating formulations that are much
 

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.750
creating formulations that are much
harder to crush or if you do crush them

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760
harder to crush or if you do crush them
 

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.430
harder to crush or if you do crush them
they become like a gel so you can't

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440
they become like a gel so you can't
 

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.800
they become like a gel so you can't
sniff it or you can't inject it and so

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:34.810
sniff it or you can't inject it and so
 

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:35.790
sniff it or you can't inject it and so
these are great these are great

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:35.800
these are great these are great
 

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.780
these are great these are great

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:49.350
that someone's going to figure out how
to how to misuse it if because you know

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:49.360
to how to misuse it if because you know
 

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.160
to how to misuse it if because you know
fundamentally the medication has to be

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:52.170
fundamentally the medication has to be
 

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:54.270
fundamentally the medication has to be
metabolized within the body in order to

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280
metabolized within the body in order to
 

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.550
metabolized within the body in order to
get the active drug so I'm sure there's

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:56.560
get the active drug so I'm sure there's
 

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.020
get the active drug so I'm sure there's
a chemist out there somewhere who could

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:58.030
a chemist out there somewhere who could
 

00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:59.610
a chemist out there somewhere who could
figure out how to bypass any of these

00:50:59.610 --> 00:50:59.620
figure out how to bypass any of these
 

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.650
figure out how to bypass any of these
but I think it's all good and I think

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:01.660
but I think it's all good and I think
 

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.770
but I think it's all good and I think
we've seen that as a formulation becomes

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:04.780
we've seen that as a formulation becomes
 

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.500
we've seen that as a formulation becomes
more abuse deterrent or resistant people

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:07.510
more abuse deterrent or resistant people
 

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:09.270
more abuse deterrent or resistant people
are much less likely to misuse it and go

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280
are much less likely to misuse it and go
 

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.470
are much less likely to misuse it and go
for some of the easier ones so and the

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480
for some of the easier ones so and the
 

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:17.520

FDA's role is really creating criteria

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:17.530
FDA's role is really creating criteria
 

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:19.410
FDA's role is really creating criteria
where as the manufacturers of these

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:19.420
where as the manufacturers of these
 

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.780
where as the manufacturers of these
medications in order for them to prove

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:21.790
medications in order for them to prove
 

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:23.940
medications in order for them to prove
that it's abuse resistant because as you

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:23.950
that it's abuse resistant because as you
 

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:24.780
that it's abuse resistant because as you
can imagine they're putting these

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:24.790
can imagine they're putting these
 

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:25.950
can imagine they're putting these
medications out there and saying it's

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960
medications out there and saying it's
 

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.660
medications out there and saying it's
abuse resistant but yet it hasn't really

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:27.670
abuse resistant but yet it hasn't really
 

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:29.040
abuse resistant but yet it hasn't really
been out there so you don't really know

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:29.050
been out there so you don't really know
 

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:31.740
been out there so you don't really know
so there are criteria as to what needs

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:31.750
so there are criteria as to what needs
 

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:33.960
so there are criteria as to what needs
to be satisfied in order to call it an

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:33.970
to be satisfied in order to call it an
 

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:37.080
to be satisfied in order to call it an
abuse deserve great well we've also had

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:37.090
abuse deserve great well we've also had
 

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.360
abuse deserve great well we've also had
some questions about alternative drugs

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:39.370
some questions about alternative drugs
 

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.120
some questions about alternative drugs
that aren't opioids so let's take one of

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:42.130
that aren't opioids so let's take one of
 

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.490
that aren't opioids so let's take one of
those there are drug options for

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:44.500
those there are drug options for
 

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.080
those there are drug options for
controlling pain that don't involve

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:46.090
controlling pain that don't involve
 

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.240
controlling pain that don't involve
opioids but they cost more than current

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:48.250
opioids but they cost more than current
 

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.520
opioids but they cost more than current
therapies I believe what can we do to

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:50.530
therapies I believe what can we do to
 

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:52.440
therapies I believe what can we do to
incentivize researchers and

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:52.450
incentivize researchers and
 

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:54.630
incentivize researchers and
pharmaceutical companies to develop

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640
pharmaceutical companies to develop
 

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.030
pharmaceutical companies to develop
these alternative

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040
these alternative
 

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.510
these alternative
occations they make them more affordable

00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:58.520
occations they make them more affordable
 

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.270
occations they make them more affordable
maybe I'll start so part of the work of

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280
maybe I'll start so part of the work of
 

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.360
maybe I'll start so part of the work of
the NIH and NIDA has really been to amp

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:05.370
the NIH and NIDA has really been to amp
 

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:07.870
the NIH and NIDA has really been to amp
up research to really focus on non

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880
up research to really focus on non
 

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.850
up research to really focus on non
narcotic analgesic pain therapy so

00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:10.860
narcotic analgesic pain therapy so
 

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.040
narcotic analgesic pain therapy so
clearly we know you know as Nora Volkov

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:13.050
clearly we know you know as Nora Volkov
 

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.720
clearly we know you know as Nora Volkov
talks about that we actually really

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:14.730
talks about that we actually really
 

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:17.240
talks about that we actually really
don't have a great kind of armamentarium

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:17.250
don't have a great kind of armamentarium
 

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:19.430
don't have a great kind of armamentarium
of good pay manage and particularly for

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440
of good pay manage and particularly for
 

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.870
of good pay manage and particularly for
chronic pain and that's a work that we

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880
chronic pain and that's a work that we
 

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.090
chronic pain and that's a work that we
have to do so there's clearly an

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:23.100
have to do so there's clearly an
 

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.830
have to do so there's clearly an
opportunity to do that but one of the

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:24.840
opportunity to do that but one of the
 

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.570
opportunity to do that but one of the
things and again this is where the all

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:26.580
things and again this is where the all
 

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:28.250
things and again this is where the all
sectors come together one of the things

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:28.260
sectors come together one of the things
 

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.110
sectors come together one of the things
that we've heard from physicians that we

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:30.120
that we've heard from physicians that we
 

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.090
that we've heard from physicians that we
have to continue to focus on is often

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:32.100
have to continue to focus on is often
 

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.100
have to continue to focus on is often
they don't want to prescribe narcotic

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:34.110
they don't want to prescribe narcotic
 

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:37.010
they don't want to prescribe narcotic
analgesics but often insurers won't pay

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020
analgesics but often insurers won't pay
 

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.710
analgesics but often insurers won't pay
for things like acupuncture and massage

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720
for things like acupuncture and massage
 

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.410
for things like acupuncture and massage
therapy and physical therapy so how do

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:42.420
therapy and physical therapy so how do
 

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.110
therapy and physical therapy so how do
we incentivize insurers and others for

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:45.120
we incentivize insurers and others for
 

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.660
we incentivize insurers and others for
physicians who and patients who don't

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:47.670
physicians who and patients who don't
 

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:49.760
physicians who and patients who don't
want to take narcotic analgesics but

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:49.770
want to take narcotic analgesics but
 

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:51.710
want to take narcotic analgesics but
need some pain relief so I think clearly

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720
need some pain relief so I think clearly
 

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.360
need some pain relief so I think clearly
there's opportunities as we go forward

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:53.370
there's opportunities as we go forward
 

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.580
there's opportunities as we go forward
to think about how we incentivize not

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:55.590
to think about how we incentivize not
 

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.650
to think about how we incentivize not
just the research but the practice

00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660
just the research but the practice
 

00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:00.380
just the research but the practice
around kind of pain management yeah

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:00.390
around kind of pain management yeah
 

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:01.610
around kind of pain management yeah
there's one other thing I'd like to add

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:01.620
there's one other thing I'd like to add
 

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.050
there's one other thing I'd like to add
is when I when I'm managing a

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:03.060
is when I when I'm managing a
 

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.510
is when I when I'm managing a
complicated disease or a patient with

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520
complicated disease or a patient with
 

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.490
complicated disease or a patient with
with a complicated form of diabetes or

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500
with a complicated form of diabetes or
 

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.150
with a complicated form of diabetes or

there's specialists that I can call upon

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:10.950
there's specialists that I can call upon
 

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:14.390
there's specialists that I can call upon
to get a consultation the field of pain

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400
to get a consultation the field of pain
 

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.000
to get a consultation the field of pain
medicine is fairly new and there aren't

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.010
medicine is fairly new and there aren't
 

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:18.650
medicine is fairly new and there aren't
enough pain specialists out there who I

00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:18.660
enough pain specialists out there who I
 

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.920
enough pain specialists out there who I
can rely on to get consultation so not

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:21.930
can rely on to get consultation so not
 

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:23.780
can rely on to get consultation so not
only do I not have these other treatment

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:23.790
only do I not have these other treatment
 

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:25.820
only do I not have these other treatment
modalities available to my patients that

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:25.830
modalities available to my patients that
 

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.740
modalities available to my patients that
I can then refer them to but I also

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:27.750
I can then refer them to but I also

I can then refer them to but I also
don't have specialists readily available

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:29.370
don't have specialists readily available
 

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:31.550
don't have specialists readily available
either to get help so it really is

the policymakers when they're thinking

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:52.590
the policymakers when they're thinking
 

00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:54.800
the policymakers when they're thinking
about you know creating fixes for this

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:54.810
about you know creating fixes for this
 

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:57.590
about you know creating fixes for this
problem that easy fixes oftentimes have

00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:57.600
problem that easy fixes oftentimes have
 

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.240
problem that easy fixes oftentimes have
unintended consequences and so though

00:55:59.240 --> 00:55:59.250
unintended consequences and so though
 

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:00.380
unintended consequences and so though
though I think they're all

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:00.390
though I think they're all
 

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.660
though I think they're all
well-intentioned that is you know there

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:02.670
well-intentioned that is you know there
 

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:04.250
well-intentioned that is you know there
are states that have put limits on the

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260
are states that have put limits on the
 

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.800
are states that have put limits on the
milligrams of opioids that you can

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:06.810
milligrams of opioids that you can
 

00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:09.860
milligrams of opioids that you can
prescribe or the duration and that

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:09.870
prescribe or the duration and that
 

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:11.360
prescribe or the duration and that
absolutely will decrease the amount of

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:11.370
absolutely will decrease the amount of
 

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:12.830
absolutely will decrease the amount of
opioids that are being prescribed but it

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:12.840
opioids that are being prescribed but it
 

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.870
opioids that are being prescribed but it
also puts the people who have chronic

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880
also puts the people who have chronic
 

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.250
also puts the people who have chronic
pain who might be benefiting from these

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.260
pain who might be benefiting from these
 

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.230
pain who might be benefiting from these
medications at risk as well and they

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240
medications at risk as well and they
 

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.270
medications at risk as well and they
also don't have a very unified voice and

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280
also don't have a very unified voice and
 

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:20.690
also don't have a very unified voice and
so I

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:20.700
so I
 

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:23.180
so I
just say that any kind of easy fix

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:23.190
just say that any kind of easy fix
 

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.890
just say that any kind of easy fix
should really be thought about in terms

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900
should really be thought about in terms
 

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.109
should really be thought about in terms
of is it too blunt of an instrument that

00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119
of is it too blunt of an instrument that
 

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:28.700
of is it too blunt of an instrument that
I'm going to adversely affect people who

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:28.710
I'm going to adversely affect people who
 

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:30.650
I'm going to adversely affect people who
might be benefiting but there's no

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660
might be benefiting but there's no
 

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:32.870
might be benefiting but there's no
question that the pendulum around opioid

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880
question that the pendulum around opioid
 

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.910
question that the pendulum around opioid
prescribing has swung way too far to

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920
prescribing has swung way too far to
 

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.859
prescribing has swung way too far to
becoming you know we're 2 o P eccentric

00:56:36.859 --> 00:56:36.869
becoming you know we're 2 o P eccentric
 

00:56:36.869 --> 00:56:38.180
becoming you know we're 2 o P eccentric
but I don't want to swing it all the way

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:38.190
but I don't want to swing it all the way
 

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:40.160
but I don't want to swing it all the way
