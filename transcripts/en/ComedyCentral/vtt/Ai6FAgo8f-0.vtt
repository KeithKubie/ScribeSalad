00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:14.613
and I'm like, "Hey, Matt.
You gotta go home."

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:16.783

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:20.780
- So, I was in Vegas,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.582
which is always
a great start,

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.750
and I feel like I'm cheating,
so I sorry for that.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.786
It's like,
when you tell a story in Vegas

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.755
it's like already
fucking insane.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.589
So it's like you're cheating,
but this is one

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.791
of my favorite stories ever.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:37.430
So, uh, my friend had
a CD release party,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.599
hot chick, awesome.
She's like,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.268
"Hey, I'm having like
my CD release party."

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.036
I don't know--I don't know
why she's a gay guy

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:45.037
all of a sudden, but...

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:46.305
[laughing]

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:48.140
But whatever.
[laughs]

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.145
No, she's--she's like,
"I'm having my CD release party,

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.813
like, you know,
you gotta come."

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:56.449
I'm like, "Okay,
can I get a plus one?"

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.616
And she's like, "Yeah."

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:59.218
I'm like,
"Okay, cool."

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:01.454
And that's like, you know
when you like get a plus one...

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.856
to anything,
but especially with like--

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.890
with it's an--
when it's an event

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.292
where it's like
something meaningful,

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.460
you're like,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.062
"Okay, who the fuck
am I bringing?"

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:14.133
Like, "Which friend
can fucking handle this,

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.301
and not be a disaster?"

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.036
You know
what I'm talking about.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:20.339
It's like you have to hook up
like, your rolodex of like,

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.876
Steve, no.
Rick, no.

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:27.146
Just like, you just have to go
through like all this shit.

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.747
So I call my friend Matt.

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:30.316
I'm like, "Right,
dude, we're going to Vegas.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.652
Like VIP,
fucking CD release party."

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:36.188
Like,
"Fucking handle your shit."

00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:38.191
He's like,
"Yeah, totally."

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.026
[laughing]

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:41.994
So we fucking show up,

00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:44.163
and we have a VIP booth,
and she's singing.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.566
She's like promoting
her album and everything.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.167
And it was
like really cool.

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.236
So we're sitting there
and like Matt is doing like,

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:54.106
way too much Jäger,
which is always a red flag.

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:56.676
Like when someone is like
rocking Jäger hard

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.110
like early in the night.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.578
I was like,

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:02.515
"Okay, Matt.
That's not what we planned on,

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.784
but...okay."

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.686
So he's just shredding it,

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.855
so she's singing.
She's singing...

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:12.725
at Caesar's, like, in this
like VIP stage.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.860
Fucking crowd is like,
"Yay!"

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.597
And fucking--
all of a sudden I'm like

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:20.299
in the booth like chilling,
like, "This is great."

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.800
All of a sudden,
Matt...

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.802
just decides
to make a beeline

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:26.906
to grab her tits...
[laughing]

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.110
In the middle
of her performance.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.279
He's just like
"Walking Dead, season four,"

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.049
just fucking...
[laughs]

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.952
I was like,
"Woah!"

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:41.053
Security immediately
tackles him,

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:42.555
fucking haymaker,

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.390
fucking tackles him.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.558
And fucking,
they like drag him like,

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:47.593
they're like,
"Is this your buddy?"

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:48.895
I was like,
"No."

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.062
[laughter]

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:52.431
Like, clearly I'm like,
"Fuck that!

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:53.933
Fucking asshole."

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:56.569
So they fucking
take him out,

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.737
he gets thrown out
of the fucking club.

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:00.640
I stay, I'm chilling,
you what I mean?

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.174
I got fucking moves.

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:06.746
And, uh, and then so,
like, fucking 15 minutes later,

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.080
he's back in the club.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.250
I looked down,
and he's shirtless.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.586
And I was like,
"What the fuck?"

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.922
So I go downstairs
and like go--I'm like,

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.190
I go, "Matt...

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.858
you gotta go home."

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:21.093
Like,
"You're inappropriate.

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:22.861
"This isn't cool.

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:25.631
"You've gotta to back
to the room, just...[whistles]

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.201
Sleep.
Sleep it off."

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:31.437
He's like, "All right, dude.
Fuck you!"

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:32.671
So he leaves.

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:34.640
So I fucking stay
another like hour.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.942
Then I go back.
This is all fucking real.

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:38.778
I go back
in the casino lobby,

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:42.114
and Matt is out there
in fucking--

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:45.384
his briefs,
like tighty whities...

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:48.620
on the casino
fucking floor!

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.957
In fucking briefs!

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.725
Now he has
no fucking pants!

00:04:53.725 --> 00:04:55.127
And I'm like,
"What?"

00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:58.030
And he's with a hooker.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.199
And I'm like, "Hey, Matt.
You gotta go home."

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.534
And the hooker was like,

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:03.502
"Hey, fuck you!
He's with me!"

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:05.971
I was like,

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:09.208
"Why don't you dial it down?
My buddy's drunk."

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.543
And she's like,
"No, fuck that! Fuck you!

00:05:11.543 --> 00:05:13.312
This is my
motherfucking man."

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:16.148
And I was like,
"Um, okay.

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:17.683
"First of all,
nobody carries a wallet

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:19.352
"in their briefs,

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:23.022
so I don't know how the fuck
you're getting paid."

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:25.591
I'm like,
"This is fucking...

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.860
"wallet's in his asshole,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.163
"and that's your fetish,
go for it,

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:33.332
but he's gotta go home."

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.601
So I fucking pull him away,

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.002
and I get him--
I'm like,

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:38.671
"Go back to the fucking room,
dude."

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.172
And then I, like,
I'm mad.

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:42.742
It was like one of those
Vegas things where I was like,

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:43.910
like I was like an adult.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.211
[chuckles]
I was like,

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:47.613
I was like,
"Here's the deal, man.

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:48.947
"Fucking be an adult.

00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:51.383
"Like, you're fucking
embarrassing.

00:05:51.383 --> 00:05:52.685
"Handle your shit.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.587
"All you do
is handle your shit.

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:57.189
"Just come,
be responsible, fucking--

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:59.358
"you just had to go
to a fucking party.

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:00.726
"Damn it!

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.294
"That's all
you had to do.

00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:03.763
"Go to your room!

00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:05.564
"Go to sleep!

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:07.066
"Now!

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:09.035
Go to sleep!"

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.369
And he's like,
"All right, man.

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.737
Sorry.
I fucked up."

00:06:11.737 --> 00:06:14.540
I'm like, "Yeah, you did,
motherfucker.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.142
Big time."

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.777
So then he left.

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:20.479
And then I went out.

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.415
[laughing]

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:26.218
And...
[laughs]

00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:27.419
And I blacked out,

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.890
and then, uh...
[laughing]

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.561
And then these are
two things that happened:

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:38.063
I woke up,
my other friend called me.

00:06:38.063 --> 00:06:39.899
He's like,
"Where are you?"

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:43.068
I go,
"I'm at the Hard Rock."

00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:44.603
He's like,
"Where are you?

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:45.738
We're in the casino."

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.406
I'm like,

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:49.108
"I'm under the guitar."

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:50.443
[laughing]

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.278
So...if you know
the Hard Rock,

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:53.846
I was outside...

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:55.982
sleeping under the guitar

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:59.184
of the fucking Hard Rock,

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:01.020
on the lawn

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.755
outside

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.623
of the casino.

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:05.691
I was fucking sleeping.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.927
Woke me up.
[babbling]

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.796
So he had to pick me up.

00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:13.632
Then we go out
after that...

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:16.335
again.
I still went out.

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:18.771
Baller.
[laughing]

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.773
But no,
so we go out after that,

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:21.841
and we go to a club,

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.842
and fucking get
more hammered.

00:07:23.842 --> 00:07:24.944
And then I black out,

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.647
and I'm not joking at all.

00:07:28.647 --> 00:07:31.217
This is how I woke up.

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:35.454
I woke up in a room
at the Hard Rock,

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.523
and fucking...

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.892
there was a fucking...
[chuckles]

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:44.697
A chick blowing me
and my friend at the same time.

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:46.532
A different friend,
not my buddy Matt.

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:49.968
He was dead.
[laughing]

00:07:49.968 --> 00:07:51.803
Blowing me and my friend
at the same time,

00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:55.341
and I woke up to that
and I was like,

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.509
"What the fuck?

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:00.145
What's happening?"

00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:02.481
It was like the weirdest way
to wake up.

00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:04.550
And then I look over,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.819
and there is, um...

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:10.589
a little person.

00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:13.659
Again, I'm not joking.

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:18.030
Um, fisting a chick
on a couch...

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.100
with cocaine
all over his face.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.504
Literally, literally
fisting a chick.

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:27.673
And I look over,
I was like,

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:28.841
"What the fuck?"

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:32.511
[laughter]

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:35.046
"Oh, my God."

00:08:35.046 --> 00:08:37.683
And then
we made eye contact.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:39.852
[laughter]

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:42.755
And he's like fisting her.

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:45.191
And, you know, it's...

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.392
[laughter]

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:47.559
You know what fisting is.

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:49.528
I don't have
to explain it.

00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:52.864
I don't have to walk you through
that fucking...

00:08:52.864 --> 00:08:55.801
And fucking--
he's fisting a chick,

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.303
and he looks over at me,

00:08:57.303 --> 00:09:00.539
and we make eye contact,
and he goes,

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:04.043
"Yeah!"
[laughing]

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:09.281 line:91%
It was like...
[laughs]

00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:11.750
And at that point,

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.052
I don't know what to do,
so I was like,

00:09:14.052 --> 00:09:16.555
"Yeah, dude.
I don't fucking...

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:19.091
know what happened."

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:21.627
But it was just
like the weirdest...

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:25.164
like, irony, you now,
me yelling at my friend, like,

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:28.066
"Hey, man.
You gotta fucking chill out."

00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:30.403
"You gotta fucking
handle your shit.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:31.837
"Fucking adult.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:33.505
It's ridiculous."

00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:34.773
And I'm fucking...

00:09:34.773 --> 00:09:36.608
"Yeah..."

00:09:36.608 --> 00:09:38.510
What is happening?

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.079
And then the next day,

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.080
I like--
we, like, woke up, like,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.349
and I saw him,
he was like,

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:44.683
"What did you end up
doing last night?"

00:09:44.683 --> 00:09:46.952
I was like,

00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:48.854
"Just fucking chill,
bro.

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:50.756
[laughter]

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:52.591
Nothing, dude."

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.092
Fucking...

00:09:54.092 --> 00:09:57.263
I couldn't, like,
throw myself under the bus.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.964
[laughing]

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:00.633
All right, anyway,
that's the end of my story.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:01.967
Thank you so much,
you guys.

00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:02.968
[cheers and applause]

00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:04.937
You guys are awesome!
