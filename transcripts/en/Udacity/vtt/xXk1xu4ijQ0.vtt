00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
Now, let's have you figure out the running time of another algorithm using Big O Notation.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.910
So, this is the algorithm that we are going to look at, it's just four lines

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.637
and actually the algorithm does not perform any very useful function.

00:00:15.637 --> 00:00:19.240
The most important part is that it's interesting to analyze its running times.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.729
So, there's not really any value or at least none that I can see

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:26.650
of actually producing this result down here.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.330
So, what I would like you to do is to figure out the running time

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.720
as a function of this value n here, and I'm going to give you a number of choices for your answer.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.810
So, the first choice is O (n) so it would be a linear algorithm.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:56.440
The second one is O(n¹. ⁵). Next one is O(n²). And the final one is O(n³).

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.740
So, I want you to check the box that states the correct running time of this algorithm

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.390
expressed as a function of n, and I'm also going to give you a little hint,

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:23.750
which is that if you add n + n-1+ n-2 and so on plus 2 plus 1 that is equal to n²+n/2.

00:01:23.750 --> 99:59:59.000
And once you analyzed the algorithm, you'll see that this hint is actually quite useful.
