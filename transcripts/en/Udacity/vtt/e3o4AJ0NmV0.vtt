00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.185
The two boxes you should have
selected are this one and this one.

00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:07.250
Five-sixteenths corresponds to this, and

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.130
we know that because each of these
hash marks is one-sixteenth.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.970
And so, we get one-sixteenth, 2 over 16,
3 over 16, 4 over 16, 5 over 16.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.695
And this corresponds to three-eighths,
that's because it's 1,

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:30.830
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and over 16, and
these are equivalent fractions.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.570
So this is great.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.720
We just saw that number lines
can help us compare numbers.
