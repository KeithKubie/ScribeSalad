00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.670
- So it's a weird story.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.380
It's weird, everything.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.830
I've been working on something
with a longtime friend and--

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.500
and a client.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.710
I don't even-- I don't even
know how to explain it, man.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.790
The client's cars, you know,
they arrived last night.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.380
And this gentleman is looking
to auction these vehicles off.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.670
They're great cars.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.580
So the whole object of the game
is to not change the integrity

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.080
of the cars because that would
change the value of the cars

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.040
because of who the client is.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.580
It's-- it's-- uh.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.580
What the client wanted--

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.420
the client is not--

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.250
who the client was.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.380
And I got-- I got a long-time
history with this cat,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.540
and it goes all the
way back to the '80s.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.080
But the client on these cars,
I'm gonna show you right now.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.670
No kidding.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.750
It was-- it was Burt Reynolds.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.210
- The Burt Reynolds?
- The Burt Reynolds.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.880
Oh, man.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.750
It's like, there's not a
lot of people that I idolize,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.040
but that--

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.460
that is the man right there.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.250
It's-- it's really--

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.040
it's really tough.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.080
I love this guy.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.620
We shared a building together
when I lived in South Florida.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.960
We knew each other
pretty, pretty well.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.290
And he's a huge car
guy and just one

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.880
of the coolest cats
you'd ever want to know.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.290
So the whole object of
the game is, you know,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.620
the Barrett-Jackson auction
is right around the corner.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.120
And he had a few vehicles
that he wanted to prepare

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.790
for the auction to sell.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.290
And I was the guy that he
trusted to send the vehicles to

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.960
and get them ready for auction.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.750
You know, he wants all the
proceeds-- wants the proceeds

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.000
to go, you know, to a retired
stuntman foundation, you know,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.250
because he's really
big into that stuff.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.790
Here's the thing, men.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.000
The goal is to carry
out the man's wishes,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.460
make them beautiful again, like
I was saying, without changing

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.960
the integrity of the car.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.170
They're his personal cars.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.170
And so I just want to do a
whole bunch of straightening out

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.460
some things, touching
up some things,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.670
buffing out some things,
just making them beautiful,

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.460
and getting them ready.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.420
OK.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.080
Can we look at these cars?

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.790
It's killing me.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.120
Yeah.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.920
This is really what
you think they are.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920
Oh, goodness.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.460
DANNY: This is actually--

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.500
that's actually Burt's
personal "Hooper" Trans-Am.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.670
This is really the one Burt's
personal "Bandit" Trans-Am.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.000
Wow.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.040
And the truck up
there, the crew cab

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.460
Dually from "Cannonball Run."

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.040
Hey, is that the truck
with the guy that talked

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.500
like a bear or something in it?
- Yeah.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.710
With the overalls.
DANNY: That's the one.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.540
- Yeah.
- Man, is that the jet car?

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.880
DANNY: That's--
that's-- that's-- yeah,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.380
that's the jet one.
- What?

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.210
Oh, my goodness.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.790
DANNY: I know, dude.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.120
We're just going to make
them as beautiful as possible

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.790
for the stuntman foundation.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.960
Don't you worry.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.960
We'll take very
good care of them.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.710
You know I won't drive it.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.290
DANNY: To be honest with you, I
drove this one home last night,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.330
just-- just because I could.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.500
You know what I'm saying?

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.040
I would too, man.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.380
Drive like in the movies.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.040
Yeah, I jumped the
bridge coming home.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.380
So gentlemen, just,
thank you, guys.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.620
And I'm going to try and clear
my head, get a cup of coffee.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.210
- Relax.
- Get the ball rolling.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.250
Thank you, guys.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.920
Sorry you lost your boy.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.750
Amen, we did.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.580
Amen, we did.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.920
We lost a star.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.420
Not-- not-- not a
celebrity, a star.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.170
Yeah.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.170
Man, you talk about literally
an emotional roller coaster,

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.040
I was so psyched when
Burt's people told me

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.670
that the cars were coming in.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.670
I didn't even get a chance
to tell the guys when I got

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.540
the call that Burt had passed.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.420
I mean, literally, I got
the cars the night before.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.170
So I just gotta say,
man, this project

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.580
has gone from fun
to just really,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.420
really, really important.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.580
I love Burt on screen.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.670
And I loved this man as I
got to know him off screen.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.040
I'm truly going
to miss this cat.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.250
This guy was a legend.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.540
Burt Reynolds' cars.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.960
Mike, no playing
with the CB, Mike.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.120
CB.
It's got the CB in it.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.460
[rock music playing]

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.380
DANNY: You know, we've done
a lot of special projects

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.120
here at Count's Kustoms.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.120
But I gotta say, man, getting
Burt Reynolds' couple of very

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.120
personal cars, very famous
cars, ready for auction for him,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.540
that's huge.
That's big.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.210
That means a lot to me.
Burt was a friend.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.380
He was somebody I knew
an awfully long time ago.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.960
And he was a huge legend.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.540
And we said goodbye to Burt
not too terribly long ago.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.540
And now we're saying goodbye
to two of his beautiful cars.
