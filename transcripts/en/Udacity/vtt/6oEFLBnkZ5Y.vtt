00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.852
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The first thing we need to do, as always, is think about what adds to equal

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:07.843
4, and multiplies to equal 4 times 1, or 4? In this case, our numbers are 2 and

00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:11.534
2. So instead of 4x, we can write 2x plus 2x, and of course the rest of the

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:15.780
expression as well. Then something interesting happens when we try to factor the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.021
first two terms and the second two terms. The first two are pretty normal, we

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:24.255
pull out a 2x from the 4x squared plus 2x, but then when we get to 2x plus 1

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:28.773
Well there are no common factors that 2x and 1 have aside from 1. So that's

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:34.430
exactly what we write, 1. And then the last two terms, 2x plus 1. Conveniently,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.663
this still works out perfectly and we get 2x plus 1 times 2x plus 1. Which we

00:00:39.663 --> 00:00:43.094
can also write as 2x plus 1 the quantity squared.
