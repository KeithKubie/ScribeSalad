00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.689
So models are cool. Not...those models.

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.290
I actually find that particular cultural institution
pretty peculiar.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.809
I'm talking about the kind of model that lets you experience things you otherwise couldn't experience.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.909
Maybe it's something that's too big to see all at once, like our solar system, or too small, like a cell,

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:23.189
or something that unfortunately doesn't exist,
like the Millennium Falcon.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.100
Or something that would just be way too dangerous
to have in your office, like a trebuchet.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.360
Sometimes it is difficult, maybe even impossible, to really understand things fully without making a model.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.890
But models don't have to be three-dimensional
objects.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.600
In scientific terms, a model is anything that represents something else, whether it's physical or conceptual.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.380
In the same way that musical notes on a page
are a model for music, the same goes for chemistry.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.989
Chemists use many models, or simplified versions
of reality,

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.160
to help them understand atoms and their interactions.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.890
Because the universe is weird.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.610
This ball-and-stick model is one idea of a
molecule —

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.860
perfectly spherical atoms connected by clearly
defined bonds.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.630
This version of a molecule is a great way
to begin understanding chemical bonds.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.240
But I gotta take you beyond beginners' stuff to understand some models that explain bonds with more delightful complexity.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.680
Digging into the details requires models that are more complicated, but also more fascinatingly awesome.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.140
So while this episode of Crash Course Chemistry
won't involve any Brazilians in swimsuits,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.720
I promise you will not be disappointed.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:32.280
[Theme Music]

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.280
It turns out that chemical bonds are not like
little sticks at all.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.689
Bonded atoms — molecules — are more like
groups of atoms hanging out just,

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.420
like, close to each other because that's where
their energy is minimized.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.659
So if I tossed all these models of atoms into
the air and let them fly apart from each other,

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.310
it's cool and fun for me,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.300
but those little balls would also have a lot more energy, and that's not the ideal situation for an atom, now is it?

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.439
In reality, the only thing connecting two atoms together in a chemical bond is a bunch of electrons,

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.579
and they don't sit still between the atoms
gluing everything together.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.080
Instead, they're in constant motion zooming all around the nuclei in a somewhat predictable pattern.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.130
In a covalent bond, the bonding electrons
spend most of their time between the nuclei,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.120
and the nuclei stay close together because
they're attracted to the electrons.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.780
And honestly, this concept of electrons holding everything together is itself just another model,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.840
an idea that represents molecules in a way
that can be visualized.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.430
And it's a more accurate representation of
reality than the ball-and-stick model.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.459
But the ball-and-stick model isn't useless.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.560
It helps us visualize and understand many important things about molecules. It also looks pretty cool.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.080
Imagine if, instead of making generalizations about how chemicals behave, like "water dissolves salt",

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.940
you had to memorize every single behavior
of every single substance.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.489
No one would ever get anything else done in
their lives.

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.530
We generalize so that we can free our minds
to do bigger and better things.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.520
So make no mistake, some models are great
even though they're oversimplified to the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.379
point of being outright lies.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.670
It's important, in fact, to realize that all
models are imperfect to some extent.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.190
I mean, think of the human models that people
compare themselves to.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.349
Do you think that women in underwear catalogs and the guys in those black-and-white cologne ads look like that

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.530
on Saturday morning after a long night of
doing whatever models do on Friday nights?

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.780
In fact, if a scientific model were a perfect representation of reality, it would cease being a model and become reality.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.100
So, in addition to understanding how a model
represents reality,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.780
you also have to recognize the ways that it
doesn't represent reality

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.330
so that you don't base a bunch of incorrect
assumptions on it.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.740
Unfortunately, sometimes models aren't merely oversimplified, sometimes they are just downright wrong.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.080
And the chemical bonding model is no exception.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.760
Over centuries, it's been updated as experimental results have provided information about how the universe actually works.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.380
Early scientists, including Isaac Newton, thought that atoms combined because they were literally sticky,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.360
or because they had tiny little hooks on them
like a kind of Velcro that held them together.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.159
That was their bonding model.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.440
In the 19th century, chemists like Berzelius
discovered positive and negative charges associated

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.239
with chemicals in certain situations.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.920
He and his contemporaries theorized that this
was the force holding molecules together.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.720
That's a much better model than the first
one, but still not entirely accurate,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.019
because they thought that atoms more or less
attracted each other like magnets.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.320
Only after the discovery of electrons in the 1890s could chemists begin to understand the true nature of chemical bonds.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.700
Then, in 1916, American chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis described a covalent bond as 2 atoms sharing electrons.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.740
Modern chemists still use this model as a simple way to represent chemical bonds on paper.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.380
A Lewis structure is a two-dimensional model that represents covalent bonds as straight lines

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.700
and un-bonded, valence electrons, those in the outermost energy level of an atom, as dots.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.279
Inner electrons aren't shown at all, and although
it was developed to explain covalent bonds,

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:43.969
it also works for ionic bonds.

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.129
In Lewis structures, bonds are formed by pairs
of valence electrons, called bonding pairs,

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.979
in the space between the two atoms.

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.389
Pairs of electrons that are attached to only
one atom are known as lone pairs.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.050
As you probably remember, atoms are most stable
when their outermost electron shells are filled.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.229
For many atoms, that takes eight electrons,
so it's called the octet rule.

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.499
And if you're bracing yourselves for some
exceptions to this rule, well, you are correct.

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.639
Tiny little hydrogen can only hold two electrons
total, not eight

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.079
— that'll make more sense when you watch
our upcoming episode about atomic orbitals —

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.159
but also elements in the third row of the periodic table and below often have more than 8 valence electrons.

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:22.689
Beryllium and boron are notorious for having
weird numbers like 6 or 12 electrons.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.449
So yeah, the whole octet thing is really more
of a gentle nudge than a rule.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.589
Let's stick to rows 1 and 2 of the table to
keep it simple.

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.139
Let's say I want to draw the Lewis structure
for sodium chloride.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.279
Sodium has one valence electron and chlorine has 7.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.780
Since sodium is a metal, this must mean that it's going to be an ionic bond, meaning that electrons are transferred.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.900
Sodium transfers its one valence electron
to chlorine,

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.029
creating a +1 charge on the sodium and a -1
charge on the chlorine.

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:51.240
The two ions are attracted to each other due
to their opposite charges.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.499
They're written slightly separated because
the electrons aren't shared,

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.080
but they're not too far apart because the ions stay close enough together to neutralize their charges.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.099
Lewis structures use a line to note covalent
bonds,

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.539
but we're not doing that here because there
are no covalent bonds.

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.860
It's an ionic bond, and there's no physical
contact been the ions.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.020
So that is what salt looks like from a Lewis
dot structure point of view.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.840
Covalent bonds: a little more complicated, and it works best if you follow some specific steps.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.219
Let's try it out with water.

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.339
First, figure out how many total valence electrons
are available.

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:23.389
It doesn't matter which atoms they come from
or how they're arranged before you start.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:28.729
Each hydrogen atom has one valence electron,
and oxygen has six, for a total of eight electrons.

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.360
Neither hydrogen nor oxygen has enough valence
electrons to be stable,

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.199
so they share electrons to make up the lack.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.540
And, just like how sharing a snack can make a new friend, the sharing creates a bond between the atoms.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.710
Lay out the molecules and create the bonds.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.559
Both hydrogens are bound to oxygen, so the
oxygen goes in the middle.

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:49.740
Remember, in Lewis's model each bond requires
a pair of electrons.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.100
So we used four of the eight available electrons to form the bonds. Now fill in the outermost energy levels.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.919
Hydrogen atoms only need two electrons total,
so they're already full.

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.319
Oxygen, on the other hand, needs an octet
— eight electrons.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.050
So place the remaining electrons around it
in pairs to complete the structure.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.029
Finally, again, Lewis structures use lines
to represent covalent bonds,

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:12.009
so put those in the place of the bonding electrons,
and you have it.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.360
Water contains two covalent bonds and two
lone pairs. Simple enough.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.479
Well, it can get a little trickier.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:21.270
Let's do carbon dioxide, another tremendously
important molecule on our planet.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.669
Carbon has four valence electrons, and each
oxygen has six, for a total of 16 electrons.

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:32.460
Both oxygens bond to the carbon, so put the carbon in the middle and make the bonds using 4 of the 16 electrons.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.400
All three of these atoms, they need a full
octet, so fill that in next.

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:39.979
So yay! Now all the atoms have a full octet,
but take a closer look;

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:45.830
20 electrons are needed to fill the octet,
but only 16 are available. So, what to do?

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:51.260
When there aren't enough electrons to fill all the octets with normal sharing, atoms have to share more of them.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:57.580
In this case, they form a double bond by putting 2 pairs of electrons, for a total of 4, between each pair of atoms.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:04.400
All 4 bonding electrons count toward both atoms' octets, so we need fewer lone pairs to fill all the octets.

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:07.749
The double bonds allow us to use only 16 electrons.

00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:11.559
Replace the bonds with double lines, and the
Lewis structure is complete,

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:14.229
with 2 double bonds and 2 lone pairs on each
oxygen.

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:18.839
That was a little weird, so surely we can
do something simple like molecular nitrogen.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:21.529
Just 2 atoms of nitrogen bonded together,
right?

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:26.419
Well, nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and
there are 2 atoms, so that's a total of 10 electrons.

00:08:26.419 --> 00:08:30.800
Let's put in the bond and complete the octets,
and we've used 14 electrons.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.979
That — we don't have that many.

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:37.459
We can try a double bond, but that still uses
12 electrons, 2 more than we got,

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:40.110
so we still don't have enough electrons to
go around.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.039
Let's kick it up one more notch and make it
a triple bond.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.199
That's when atoms share three pairs of electrons.And
that does it.

00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:48.930
Just 10 electrons, and all the atoms have
a full octet.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.800
Switch the lines to bonds, and it's done.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.540
A triple bond, and a lone pair on each atom.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:59.000
And this is why molecular nitrogen is really
hard to break up to form, like, fertilizer and stuff.

00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:01.610
In case you're wondering, three is the maximum
number of bonds.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.529
There is no such thing as a quadruple covalent
bond.

00:09:03.529 --> 00:09:08.310
So that's the Lewis model — separate, discrete
bonds formed by sharing specific electrons.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.850
It's a good model, and pretty close to the
modern definition of a covalent bond,

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.519
but it is still grossly oversimplified and
unfortunately not 100% accurate.

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:19.490
But here's the thing about models: even when
they're partially wrong,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.500
you can build on the good parts to create even better models, and that is what Linus Pauling did.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.880
While he was in college, Pauling read Gilbert Lewis's chemical bond research, published just 3 years earlier.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.680
Lewis's model inspired Pauling to spend the rest of his life studying the relationships between

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.649
the properties of substances and their molecular
structures.

00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:39.481
After getting his PhD in physical chemistry,

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.500
he traveled to Europe to study the new field
of quantum mechanics

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.029
with great physicists like Arnold Sommerfeld,
Niels Bohr, and Erwin Schrödinger.

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:51.550
Quantum mechanics basically involves the idea
that some things, like light and electrons,

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.940
are both particles and waves of energy.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.190
So Pauling applied the quantum mechanics model
to chemical bonds,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.430
and this was the birth of the bonding model
that we know today,

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.740
which conceives of chemical bonds as a sort
of overlap of atoms' individual electron clouds,

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.240
rather than the simple sharing of specific
electrons.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.750
We'll explore that in more detail when we
talk about orbitals,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.529
but this is the electrons-holding-everything-together model that I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,

00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:17.651
and that we pretty much take for granted today.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.839
Pauling's contributions to the model of chemical
bonding made such an impact on how we understand

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:25.279
the universe that he won a Nobel Prize for
it in 1954.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.810
It may not sound totally mind-blowing today,

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:31.920
but imagine figuring this out when your only concept of atoms was little bits of stuff like Newton.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.939
Or even just a vague idea of charges in an
atom like Berzelius. It's mind-boggling.

00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:40.810
Our ability to understand chemistry at all
is a direct result of the models that scientists

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.110
like Lewis and Pauling have provided, so to
them I say thank you.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.139
And thanks to you for watching this episode
of Crash Course Chemistry.

00:10:48.139 --> 00:10:52.039
I think you're all...
model students.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.920
If you paid attention today you learned that

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.519
a scientific model is anything that represents
something else in a different way,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.640
that we often learn the most when we try to understand why things don't work the way that we expect,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.440
and that you can build new models on the foundation
of old ones.

00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:08.910
You also learned that the chemical bonding
model developed by the great Linus Pauling

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.980
is crucial to our understanding of chemistry, and also the universe, and you learned how to draw Lewis structures.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.139
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was written by Edi González and edited by Blake de Pastino.

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:20.529
Our chemistry consultant is Dr. Heiko Langner.

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:23.060
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.740
