RACHEL O'MEARA:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.340
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.060
I'm Rachel O'Meara, and I am
usually in the San Francisco

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.010
office, but today I'm
really happy to be here

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.760
in Mountain View to
host Chris Guillebeau.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.750
He's here on a tour
for his third book,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.077
called "The Happiness
of Pursuit,"

00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:22.160
and today he's going to
talk to us about this book

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.230
and what it means to find
passion in your life.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.100
The people that he's met through
his travels of every country

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.799
in the world, which is
awesome-- he's actually

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.340
encountered quite
a few people that I

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.965
think he'll share
some of those stories

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:40.470
today with us about what
he's learned from them,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.440
and how they've harnessed
their own passions,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.560
and to have meaning
in their own lives

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.900
through quests of knowing and
wanting more for themselves

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.190
through travel and other ways.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.940
I hosted say Chris two
years ago in San Francisco

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.590
for his second book, "The
$100 Startup," so some of you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.794
may know that.

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:02.210
And it's just a real pleasure
to have him back here today.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.150
So, Chris, I would love you to
come on up, and we welcome you.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.710
Thank you.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.876
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Thank you.

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:09.690
Thanks a lot.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.490
Thank you so much, Rachel,
and good afternoon.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.430
So glad to be back at the
Googleplex for my third visit,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.930
actually.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.460
I was here for the
first book, also,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.490
and a couple years ago
for "$100 Startup,"

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.130
so I'm thrilled to
see all you guys,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.110
and hello to everyone
who's watching elsewhere.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.840
So what I'd love
to do is, I know

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.754
people are having
lunch, which is great.

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:35.420
I don't want to give
you a long lecture,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.619
but I'll talk for
maybe 15, 20 minutes,

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.910
I'll tell you a little bit
about quests and adventures,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.860
and why I pursued
my journey, and what

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.342
I learned along the way.

00:01:43.342 --> 00:01:45.800
And then we'll do some question
and attempted answer-- QAA.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.970
So sometimes it goes
better than others,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.150
but I'm sure here at
Google, it will be awesome,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.140
and you might get the chance
to help me with an answer.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.742
And as we begin, I do, actually,
have a question for all of you.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.200
A very serious,
important question.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.910
How many of you have ever played
the video game "Super Mario

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.937
Bros.?"

00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:06.770
You raise your hand.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.080
Yeah.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.220
OK, I was expecting a pretty
high per capita group,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.225
which is great.

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:13.420
"Super Mario Bros." is a
trans-generational video game.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.120
It first came out 29 years ago.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.230
I remember playing it at the
age of six with my grandmother,

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.920
and my dad also
liked to play, but he

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.050
wasn't as good as grandma.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.990
So whenever I got stuck
on the water level,

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.960
I would pass the
controller to grandma,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.001
and she would help me out
and give it back to me.

00:02:32.642 --> 00:02:34.350
And for all of you
who played this game--

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.970
and it's OK if you haven't-- you
may remember that there are all

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.950
kinds of stages and levels
and obstacles and enemies

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.770
and puzzles, and all these kind
of things that you have to do.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.800
And you, this Italian plumber,
are on a quest, essentially.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.000
And you're not doing
this for no reason.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.542
Some of it seems a
little bit random,

00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:56.416
but there's actually a
purpose for everything

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:57.240
that you're doing.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.970
So, open question to the
smart audience at Google.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.960
What is Mario trying
to accomplish?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.086
What's he trying to do?

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:04.960
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
Mario, but your princess

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.420
is in another castle.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.030
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: That's right.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.090
That's what he encounters
first, and then he

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.930
encounters it seven more times.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.120
But he's actually trying to
save the princess, right?

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.020
To save the princess.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.460
Who is Mario's adversary?

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:21.910
AUDIENCE: Bowser.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.170
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Bowser.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.710
Does anyone remember that?

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.210
Great.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.000
So if you know Bowser, and
it's OK if you don't, you

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.182
may recall that he's this super
large turtle who's really upset

00:03:30.182 --> 00:03:31.890
about something, and
he's been determined

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.320
to cause disorder in
the Mushroom Kingdom.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.830
But does anyone know why?

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.227
Does anyone know
why Bowser is so

00:03:38.227 --> 00:03:39.560
agitated that he had to do this?

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:42.530
There's actually
not a good answer.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.170
There's not a good
reason, right?

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.950
And we as players are just
kind of thrown into this world,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.017
and we get this controller,
and there's Mario,

00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:51.100
and there's these enemies.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.391
And we understand that the
princess has been kidnapped,

00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:56.050
and that's all we care about,
because we have to overcome

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.534
these stages to get to that end.

00:03:57.534 --> 00:03:59.700
And as you mentioned, we
don't get there right away.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.650
It takes some time
before we get there.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.430
OK, so how many of you have
ever seen any Star Wars film?

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.710
Once again, raise your hand.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.770
Great.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.230
Pretty fair assumption.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.370
Any Indiana Jones film?

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.860
Any Lord of the Rings film?

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.300
That's great.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.360
Is there any one person
here who has never

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.720
seen any one of these films?

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.485
Star Wars, Star
Trek, Indiana Jones.

00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:23.480
AUDIENCE: I met someone
who hadn't seen Star Wars.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.550
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: So did I. I
did two nights, ago, actually.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.410
I was in Milwaukee,
and there was

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.770
one person who raised their
hand, and I was like, great.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.910
My next book will be
written all for you,

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.271
and you and I will have
a meetup of two people,

00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:38.270
and we'll talk about it.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.340
But for now, I'm going
to talk to everyone else.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.960
So, thankfully, everyone
here knows a little bit

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.047
about Star Wars or Star
Trek or Indiana Jones.

00:04:46.047 --> 00:04:48.130
And it's OK if you don't
remember all the details,

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.680
because all of
these stories have

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.910
a number of things in common.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.210
All of these stories, just
like Mario, have a destination.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.200
They have a goal.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.520
There's something that the
hero or the group of heroes

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.050
is trying to accomplish.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.300
There's a princess who
needs to be rescued.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.710
There's a galaxy
that must be saved.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.220
There is something that
has to be reclaimed,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.120
or something has been
stolen or captured,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.380
and you have to go
out and seek this.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.970
And it's going to
take some time.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.750
There are lots of milestones
and stages along the way.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.060
There are lots of challenges.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.337
In fact, challenge is the
essence of these stories.

00:05:24.337 --> 00:05:25.920
Challenge is the
essence of adventure.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.180
It's all about the challenge.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.230
And that's what we want as
viewers, as readers of books,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.544
as video game players.

00:05:33.544 --> 00:05:34.460
We want the challenge.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.280
We don't want it to be too easy.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.720
We don't want a scenario in
which the heroes are sent out

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.385
from the village, and
there's this huge sendoff,

00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:44.350
and then they go off
on this epic voyage,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.180
and they have to fight some
terrible enemy at the end.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.560
But the epic voyage is
actually really simple,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.280
and there's a nonstop
flight to their destination.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.814
And then they come to the
end, and the dragon is asleep.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:57.480
And then they just
kind of take the ring

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.840
or whatever it is, and they
go back, and they're like,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.820
yeah, it was supposed
to be really tough,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.980
but we did it in one day.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.650
Great.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.660
That would be the most
boring movie, right?

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.900
That would be the
most boring story,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.275
because challenge,
once again, is

00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:07.620
the essence of these adventures.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.170
So one more thing that I haven't
mentioned in all these stories

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.980
thus far is that all of these
stories, so far, are not true.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.170
All of these stories are
mythological stories.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.400
They're fiction,
fantasy-- something

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.120
that has been created
for our entertainment,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.520
for our enjoyment.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.210
I hope I'm not breaking
any news to anyone.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.064
Sometimes I speak to audience--

00:06:32.064 --> 00:06:32.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.400
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: I know.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.310
No, I wasn't going to
mention that, actually,

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.010
because sometimes there are
children-- they aren't here

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.110
today, but I just don't
touch holidays at all.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.866
So it doesn't mean that
these stories lack value.

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:45.490
We can still be
entertained, as I said.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.740
We can be inspired, even.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.460
There's lots of good
things about them,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.959
but fundamentally,
they're not true.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.510
About 10 years ago, I became
interested in the study

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.160
and pursuit of real life
adventures or real life

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.360
quests-- things that
involved epic journeys.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.302
Things that involved
a lot of challenge.

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:09.760
Things that involved
something that

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.420
had been lost that
had to be reclaimed,

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.830
or something that had
to be accomplished

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.370
through a long series
of obstacles and tasks,

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.610
but were actually being
done by real people.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.090
And I kind of stumbled
into this myself,

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.500
through my own quest,
which was to visit

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.340
every country in the world.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.309
And for the past
10 and 1/2 years,

00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:28.850
as I've been doing
some other things,

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.140
I've been making steady
progress toward that goal.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.310
And when I first had the
idea, it wasn't so much

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.760
that I had just been to
one country and I said,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.723
oh, I want to go to
the 192 that remain.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.030
I kind of came to it
out of a lot of travel.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.380
So I lived in West
Africa for a few years.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.710
I was working as an aid
worker in Sierra Leone,

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.590
traveled a bit in
the region there.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.140
Then I traveled in Europe a bit.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.410
I'd been to like
30 countries or so.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.660
I was always a big list maker.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.814
I was always writing
down lists and my tasks

00:07:57.814 --> 00:07:58.730
and to dos and things.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.610
And once I started
traveling, I started

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.950
making a list of all
the places I had been.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.340
And as I got to, like, 30
countries, I was like, wow,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.740
wouldn't it be cool to
go to 100 countries?

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.260
Sometime in my life-- I'm
very goal oriented, also--

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.760
and I was like,
sometime in my life,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.730
I want to go to 100 countries.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.590
And then I started
working closer to that.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.850
And then I realized, well,
maybe 100 countries is not

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.150
that challenging, because
I can pick and choose

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.427
which countries to go to.

00:08:23.427 --> 00:08:24.510
I can avoid the hard ones.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.830
If I get stuck, I'll
just go somewhere else.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.930
And so then I decided
to take on the goal

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.120
of going to every
country in the world.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.409
So perhaps the
first observation is

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.692
that these kinds of
visions for quests

00:08:37.692 --> 00:08:39.400
and these kinds of
grand adventures-- you

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.070
don't always know the whole
story in the beginning.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.030
You don't always
have the confidence

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.610
that you develop later to
take on something really big.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.920
The confidence comes
through experience.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.655
So in my case, out
of a love of travel

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:53.799
and out of a love of lists,
as I traveled, as I wrote down

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:56.340
my countries, that's when I was
like, I want to take on more.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.480
I want to do something further.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.810
I want to not just
travel, but I want

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.810
to create some
structure around this.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.500
I want to create some
parameters around that.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.480
So that made a big
difference for me.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.220
And then, along
the way, as happens

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.470
with every quest,
every good adventure,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.210
I met a lot of really
amazing, remarkable people.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.130
And I actually began
this journey just

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.480
as kind of a solo
independent traveler.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.480
I was super introverted.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.230
I didn't have a blog.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.063
I didn't have books.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.627
There was no public
persona with any of this.

00:09:26.627 --> 00:09:28.960
And about halfway through--
maybe about 70 countries in,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.890
actually-- I started
writing about it.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.990
And then, just by
default, I started

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.940
learning from lots
of other people

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.825
who came along to
participate, or to read,

00:09:37.825 --> 00:09:40.560
or to engage, or to
challenge me on something,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.592
or to meet me
somewhere in the world.

00:09:42.592 --> 00:09:44.300
And then by the time
I arrived at the end

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.100
of the journey--
again, 10 years later,

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.410
which was last year--
I flew to Norway,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.540
my final country, number 193.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.310
And by the time I went there,
it was a good representation

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.931
of how the project had
transformed, because I started

00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:58.930
just doing stuff by myself,
and then at the end,

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.055
there were about 200 people
who came along with me.

00:10:01.055 --> 00:10:03.170
And we had an end
of the world party

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.574
in Norway to celebrate not just
the accomplishment of my quest,

00:10:06.574 --> 00:10:07.990
but all these
different people who

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.390
were doing fun
things themselves.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.960
So I started studying
quests and adventures,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.700
and started to
understand, OK, why

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.520
do people pursue
this grand journey?

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.055
Even if it's not
travel related, why

00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:21.770
do they choose to
embark upon something

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.730
that will change their
lives, that will also involve

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.880
a lot of challenge,
as I mentioned,

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.354
that may involve
sacrifice, or may require

00:10:29.354 --> 00:10:30.520
them to trade something off?

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.650
Like, why do they do that, and
what can we learn from that?

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.109
How can we apply
that to our lives,

00:10:35.109 --> 00:10:37.483
even if we don't want to visit
every country in the world

00:10:37.483 --> 00:10:39.000
or do something like that?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.480
So I met a lot of
people first doing

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.860
some really just crazy,
incredible kind of things,

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.570
and I called these the
"oh my God" stories.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.870
So I met a guy who ran 250
marathons in a single year.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.035
I met the young woman
who's actually a teenager,

00:10:56.035 --> 00:10:58.790
or was a teenager, when
she sailed around the world

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.940
by herself in a small
sailboat, becoming the youngest

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.115
person ever to do that.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.680
I talked with a
team in Brisbane,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.070
Australia led by
a classical music

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:14.500
DJ who had spent about 28 years
trying to produce the world's

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.960
largest symphony,
and the symphony

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.716
required more than 800
performers, multiple choirs,

00:11:20.716 --> 00:11:22.215
lots of specialized
instrumentation.

00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:24.124
It was just this
crazy thing that

00:11:24.124 --> 00:11:26.290
hadn't been performed
anywhere in the world for more

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.339
than 40 years until
they put it together.

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:30.380
And so there were all
these failures and missteps

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.213
and things along the
way, until they finally

00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:36.260
produced that symphony to a
sold out crowd three years ago.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:41.710
I met the guy who took a 17
year vow of silence, initially

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.330
as an environmental
protest, initially

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.390
as he was troubled through an
oil spill in the San Francisco

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.500
Bay.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.360
But then, more than just that.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.610
More of a self
discovery project.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.170
More of a travel project as
he earned a Master's degree

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.500
and a Ph.D. all
without speaking,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.860
and advocated on behalf of
the cause that had founded.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.470
So I heard all of these
incredible stories,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.170
but then I also
heard a second group

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:09.780
of stories that were more
about ordinary people

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.246
just like me doing really
interesting things.

00:12:12.246 --> 00:12:13.620
So people that
didn't necessarily

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.080
want to take a 17 year vow of
silence, who didn't necessarily

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.180
want to sail around
the world or whatever.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.140
Maybe they had a job.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.640
Maybe they had a
family or whatever.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.200
But they were still
able, somehow,

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.100
to cultivate the value of
adventure and their lives,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.970
or to create a quest
for themselves.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.920
And so my favorite
story in that regard

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.060
is the story of Sasha Martin.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.780
And Sasha is a young mother
who's living in Oklahoma now,

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.130
but she grew up in Europe
and some different places.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.960
And after she married
and settled down,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.640
she had a daughter.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.117
She wanted to raise
her family with

00:12:45.117 --> 00:12:46.325
an international perspective.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.849
But she wasn't able to travel.

00:12:48.849 --> 00:12:51.140
And so she was trying to
figure out, how can I do this?

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.101
How can I show my daughter
a world beyond Oklahoma,

00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:55.600
even though I'm not
able to take her

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.440
to every country in
the world or whatever?

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.780
So Sasha had a
culinary arts degree,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.080
and she decided to cook
a meal from every country

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.010
in the world.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.007
And so she created a quest
for herself and her family,

00:13:09.007 --> 00:13:11.090
starting from when her
daughter was six months old

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.070
and first beginning
to eat solid food.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.860
Her first meal is
Afghan chicken,

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.810
starting with
Afghanistan, A, and then

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.940
going through the alphabet,
country by country,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.530
once a week, for more
than three years.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.180
And Sasha talks
about how this quest

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.080
has transformed
her family's life.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.240
It wasn't just about food.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.350
It was also about culture.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.380
It was about people.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.640
They would spend the week
studying recipes and playing

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.044
music from that country,
and maybe meeting anyone

00:13:34.044 --> 00:13:35.960
from that area who is
either from that country

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.200
or had been there.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.750
And then Sasha started posting
her recipes online and inviting

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.960
other people to participate,
either for the whole project

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.124
or just for a little
bit in their own way.

00:13:46.124 --> 00:13:47.540
So again, she talks
about how this

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.164
has made a huge
difference in her life,

00:13:49.164 --> 00:13:51.310
because she didn't
just decide-- and this

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.760
is the key part--
she didn't just

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.240
decide to cook a
bunch of foreign food.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.814
She created a quest, and
she had these parameters,

00:13:57.814 --> 00:13:59.230
and she had these
specific things.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.590
OK, I'm going to do every single
country, no exceptions, right?

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.242
So I met all these great people.

00:14:04.242 --> 00:14:06.700
There are many other stories
in the book and on my website,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.699
and I learned a lot of lessons.

00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:09.490
I'm a slow learner.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.740
I took me 10 years.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.200
But I did learn a few things.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.362
And I will tell you just
two to three things,

00:14:14.362 --> 00:14:15.820
and then we'll have
a conversation.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.840
So first thing--
first lesson-- is

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.210
that if you have a dream,
if you have this crazy idea,

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.730
you must believe in it,
even if no one else does.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.285
So when I had the idea to go
to every country in the world,

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.660
that's kind of
what it felt like.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.980
It felt like this crazy idea.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.570
It was like, this just sounds
totally ridiculous and absurd,

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.180
but I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.670
And I realized that
if I didn't pursue it,

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.510
I would always regret it.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.870
And that knowledge-- that
fear of regret-- kind of

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.200
drove me to say yes.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.700
And I talked to
lots of other people

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.800
who used very similar language.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.580
There's a guy from
Portland, Maine

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.540
whose crazy idea was
to walk across America.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.624
And he wasn't even sure,
like, how does that work?

00:14:56.624 --> 00:14:57.831
How much time does that take?

00:14:57.831 --> 00:14:59.010
Has anyone done this before?

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.460
It was this crazy idea that
wouldn't leave him alone.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.720
And so one morning, he
left his home in Maine,

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.170
and he started walking.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.549
And seven a half months later,
he arrived in San Francisco.

00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:11.590
And I talked to him
throughout the whole journey.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.040
I talked to in the
beginning, and in the middle,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.665
and in the end.

00:15:13.665 --> 00:15:15.760
And I asked him, what
were the challenges like,

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.980
and how did that go?

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.890
And he said something
that stayed with me

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.520
for the rest of my journey.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.215
He said, you know, there were
lots of external challenges.

00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:27.590
It was hard on the body to
get used to walking that much.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.070
Lots of things went wrong.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.240
There were some emotional
challenges as well.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.730
He had just had
a breakup, and he

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.740
was kind of processing
all of this.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.230
He said, but what I
realized about two weeks in,

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.840
once I stopped
complaining and grumbling

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.630
about the whole
thing-- he said, I

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.600
realized that my task
was pretty simple.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.660
All I had to do was
walk, essentially.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.510
And if I did nothing else--
if I got up every morning

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.460
and I made a little bit of
progress, then eventually,

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.559
I would reach the goal.

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:56.350
Eventually, I would
arrive in San Francisco

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.700
and achieve that goal--
reach that destination.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.250
And it sounded really simple,
but it's kind of stayed with me

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.195
for the final two
years of my quest,

00:16:05.195 --> 00:16:07.070
because that's how I
felt it was for me, too.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.650
All I had to do was
get to 193 countries.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.850
And I had my list of countries,
and I was making progress.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.817
And if I got stuck
somewhere, eventually I'd

00:16:14.817 --> 00:16:16.400
have to overcome
that challenge, but I

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.440
could go and do
some others first.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.434
And I liked the logical,
analytical progress of it.

00:16:21.434 --> 00:16:22.850
It's something
that related to me.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:23.774
So just keep going.

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:25.190
You have to believe
in your dream,

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.930
even if no one else does.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:32.680
Second lesson, discontent
is a very powerful force

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.550
for positive change.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.620
So a lot of people
that I talked to

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.390
came to their quest
or their project out

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.492
of a sense of discontent-- out
of a sense of being unsettled.

00:16:42.492 --> 00:16:44.200
It doesn't mean that
they were miserable,

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.460
necessarily, but it
does mean that they

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.610
had kind of a stirring or a
yearning for something more.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.680
They kind of felt
like, I have this idea,

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.026
or maybe I don't even actually
know what the full idea is yet,

00:16:55.026 --> 00:16:56.900
but I want to do something
else with my life.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.620
I want my like to
count, and I really

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.820
want to live with urgency.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.540
So they found a way to combine
that discontent with something

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.700
specific-- with something
that was inspiring to them

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.715
with something that they
could take action on,

00:17:10.715 --> 00:17:13.089
and with something that had
those parameters, as I talked

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.060
about, because the parameters
really was key to the quest.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.460
And the last lesson that
I'll share with you before we

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.619
do question and
attempted answers

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:25.220
is that thinking about
the end of our lives

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.980
can help us with the
rest of our lives.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.240
So a lot of the
people that were drawn

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.340
to these kind of journeys--
for some reason or another,

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.290
they had always been
sensitive to death.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.530
And some of them had had a close
brush with death themselves.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.570
Others had experienced
the loss of a family

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.755
member or a close friend.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.200
But they all talked about
living with urgency.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.175
They talked about wanting
their lives to count.

00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:52.800
There was a woman in the Midwest
named Phoebe [? Snetsinger ?].

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.390
And Phoebe had raised a family.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.390
And when she was almost
40, she was thinking,

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.047
I want to do something
for myself now.

00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:02.630
It was great to raise
my family, but I

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.170
want to do something
more for me.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.940
And so she started pursuing the
hobby of bird watching, which

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.440
is all about being in nature,
and exploring the environment,

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.812
and seeing as many birds as
possible and recording them.

00:18:12.812 --> 00:18:14.270
And just as she
was kind of getting

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.380
into this new thing
for herself, she

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.390
received what was initially a
terminal diagnosis of cancer.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.420
And the very first
thing she thought

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:27.020
when she received that
diagnosis was, oh no.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.120
There's so many more
things I wanted to do.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.200
There's so many things I feel
are left undone in my life.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.350
And so she resolved to
spend the rest of her life--

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:40.240
however much time that was--
traveling, and going abroad

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.732
for the first time, and seeing
as many birds as she could,

00:18:42.732 --> 00:18:44.690
and going into the
rainforest, and the jungles,

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.630
and going to Africa, and the
Amazon, and all these places.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.160
And fortunately for Phoebe,
her diagnosis was premature,

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.760
and she lived more than
20 years after that.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.275
And she spent those 20
years pursuing this quest.

00:18:57.275 --> 00:18:59.430
And right before she
died, she actually

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.950
set the Guinness World
Record of seeing more birds

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.090
than anyone else in
history, a record that

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.120
had previously only
been held by men.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.890
So she had really
chosen to focus

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.180
on that topic of
urgency-- of how can I

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.290
do something for myself?

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.220
How can I find something
that's worth living for,

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.870
and how can I embark on that?

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.240
And how can I craft
my life around that?

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.980
And the very last
thing I want to say

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.332
is I know that some
of you have probably

00:19:22.332 --> 00:19:23.290
written books yourself.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.900
Rachel is writing a
book, and some of you

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.280
probably want to write books.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.155
And I always think it's
important for authors

00:19:30.155 --> 00:19:33.190
to say why they wrote
any particular book.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.700
And in the case of
all of my books,

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.106
the goal is always the same.

00:19:37.106 --> 00:19:38.980
I don't want people to
read them and say, oh,

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.500
that was a great book.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.660
I would love someone
to read the book,

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.320
or come to a talk like this,
or connect with someone

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.440
in our community, and say, yeah.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.360
I read that, or I
came to that, and then

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.620
I went and thought
differently about something,

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.232
or then I took some
action in my life.

00:19:54.232 --> 00:19:55.690
Maybe this made a
small difference.

00:19:56.682 --> 00:19:58.390
Maybe it wasn't that
amazing or anything,

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.900
but there's something I did
differently because of it.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.970
And in the case of this book,
"The Happiness of Pursuit,"

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.485
I didn't want to just
write a travel memoir.

00:20:07.485 --> 00:20:09.610
I didn't want to just say,
here are Chris's stories

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.700
of traveling the world.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.370
I wanted to present this
prescriptive message,

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.060
and that message is that a quest
can bring purpose and meaning

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:18.730
to your life.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.050
And embracing the
value of adventure

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.390
or cultivating the value
of adventure in your life

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.500
is a good thing.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.185
And so I think there's
a quest for all of you.

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:30.560
I think there's an adventure
of some kind for all of you,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.160
whatever that looks like.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.780
That's what I'm trying to
encourage or advocate for.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.200
I think there's a princess
you have to rescue.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.345
I think there's a
galaxy you need to save.

00:20:39.345 --> 00:20:40.720
And then the last
thing I learned

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.550
was once you go down the road
of adventure-- 10 years ago,

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.825
I said yes to this adventure--
and once you go down

00:20:45.825 --> 00:20:47.450
the road of adventure,
you don't always

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.180
know where you're
going to end up.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.281
But you never know.

00:20:50.281 --> 00:20:52.530
It could bring you to Mountain
View, California, here,

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.430
this afternoon, where
we're all having lunch.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.070
And I'm grateful to
Rachel for hosting us,

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.120
and I'm grateful to all of you.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.620
Thank you.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.977
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:00.977 --> 00:21:02.560
RACHEL O'MEARA:
[INAUDIBLE] questions,

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.120
and I'll have to just pass
this mic around so that we

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.700
can capture you on audio for
the livestream and on video.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.410
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.110
My name's Sean.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:13.800
I was most curious about
your travel to so-called more

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.577
dangerous countries,
such as North Korea.

00:21:15.577 --> 00:21:17.160
It's always been a
fascination of mine

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.460
to go there, to go to Iran.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.001
I've had a lot of
friends from there.

00:21:20.001 --> 00:21:22.245
Tell me about your trip to
North Korea specifically.

00:21:22.245 --> 00:21:22.970
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU:
Well, I'll tell you

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.330
about dangerous countries
in general to start with.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.110
So the first thing is
there's actually not

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.940
a ton of dangerous
countries in the world.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.252
It's a pretty short list.

00:21:31.252 --> 00:21:32.960
I think it's important
to highlight that.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.060
So there's 193
countries in the world.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.391
As an American or
Canadian-- as a westerner

00:21:38.391 --> 00:21:40.140
with those passports--
you can pretty much

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.862
go to 120 of them
no problem, easily.

00:21:42.862 --> 00:21:45.320
You can go to another 40 of
them with a little bit of work,

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.540
like applying for a
visa or something.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.320
So you're really only talking
about less than 10 countries,

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.861
I think, that are
actually difficult.

00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:53.730
And there's always a way.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.220
So with North Korea,
there's a tour

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.364
you can go on from Beijing.

00:21:56.364 --> 00:21:57.780
And you fly to
Beijing, and you go

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.380
on this state sponsored tour.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.360
That's the only way
to do it, essentially.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.330
But you go on this
tour, and they'll

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.746
take your cell phone away from
you, and get it back later.

00:22:04.746 --> 00:22:07.400
And it's all a little creepy,
but it's also interesting,

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.077
right?

00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:09.660
As for Iran, the
other thing I learned

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.680
is that there's often more than
one way to go to somewhere.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.010
Iran, there's an
island called Kish

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.590
which you can fly to from Dubai.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.340
It's a visa free zone.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.230
Anyone can go there.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.730
So you actually don't have to
go through the normal process.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.950
Somalia-- you can go to
Somaliland, which is still

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.050
very much a culturally,
ethnically authentic part

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.520
of Somalia, but it's also
autonomous politically,

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.730
and so it's much safer.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.410
So actually, when I went to
Somalia, I went to Somaliland.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.715
So I guess through studying
each particular place

00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:39.590
and figuring out, OK,
what are the obstacles?

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.589
What are the challenges?

00:22:40.589 --> 00:22:42.790
That's how I'm going to
overcome that and go there.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.750
Thanks, Sean.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.380
AUDIENCE: I guess my question
kind of revolves around-- we

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.950
all have these
great ideas, right?

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:55.279
And at the same time, we have
responsibilities and mortgages

00:22:55.279 --> 00:22:55.820
and whatever.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.180
So I guess I'm just wondering
what your advice is to people

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.490
who want to go out and
pursue certain things,

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.430
but there are also certain
limitations, I guess,

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.820
that we have to exist within.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.129
I mean, I guess we don't, but
I can't walk away from my condo

00:23:13.129 --> 00:23:14.670
tomorrow and walk
across the country.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.490
It probably wouldn't
work out well for me.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.999
But yeah.

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:17.790
What's your advice?

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.440
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU:
That's a great question.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.900
But do you want to walk
across the country?

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.010
Is that your aspiration?

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.484
So I'm a big fan of
defining our aspirations

00:23:25.484 --> 00:23:27.650
and then crafting our life
around them, essentially.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.469
And so the quest to visit
every country in the world,

00:23:31.469 --> 00:23:33.718
for example-- I was thinking
about this the other day,

00:23:33.718 --> 00:23:35.340
because people ask
how much it cost.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.850
And the first 100 countries
cost about $30,000.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.560
So $30,000, at
least I would argue,

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.220
is not a huge amount
of money for going

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.270
to 100 countries and
all the life experience

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.110
that I got through that.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.309
And also, I didn't have
to pay it all right away.

00:23:49.309 --> 00:23:51.600
You pay as you go, essentially,
on something like that.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.267
So these limitations, as
you said-- maybe let's

00:23:56.267 --> 00:23:57.350
not call them limitations.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:58.660
They're responsibilities,
especially

00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.710
people with families.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.690
You don't just leave your family
and walk across the country.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.150
But, again, there
are ways to cultivate

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.310
the value of adventure.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.050
That's why I like the story of
Sasha and what she did at home.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.855
There's a woman in Omaha
who's knitting 10,000 hats.

00:24:11.855 --> 00:24:13.730
Her passion, the thing
that she really loved,

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:14.670
was always knitting.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.180
And one Christmastime
or holiday time, she

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.310
made 100 hats for her
friends and family.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.000
And she was like,
that's really fun.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.894
I want to do 1,000.

00:24:21.894 --> 00:24:23.560
But 1,000 is not a
big enough challenge,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.320
so she took on this
goal of 10,000 hats.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.174
And there's a charity
component to it.

00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.840
You can connect with
her o n her website

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.990
and eventually get a hat.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.220
So, I mean, I don't know.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.825
Responsibilities
and things are real,

00:24:33.825 --> 00:24:35.200
but if something
matters to us, I

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.010
guess I'm also a believer in
figuring out how to do that,

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:39.510
right?

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.801
We do have to trade off things.

00:24:40.801 --> 00:24:42.080
We do have to sacrifice.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.160
And especially for all of us
with so many opportunities

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.935
available to us, it's a
matter of prioritization.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.930
It's a matter of I can
probably do anything I want,

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.480
but I can't do
everything, right?

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.996
So if this thing really
does matter to me,

00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:58.620
whether it's walking
across the country

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.960
or whatever it is in
your case, then it's

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.070
something that you have
to plan for and build for.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.566
And for me, it was
worth it to do that.

00:25:05.566 --> 00:25:08.295
AUDIENCE: But whose definition
of a country did you use?

00:25:08.295 --> 00:25:09.640
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Oh, great.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.310
Whose definition of a country?

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.170
I used the UN
definition's of a country.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.020
So I used the 193
UN member states.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.880
And there are a few different
competing definitions

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.060
of states and
countries, but I just

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.380
decided to be consistent
and go with that.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.420
The followup that's
often asked is,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.630
what happens if a new
country is added, you know?

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.050
And that did happen once.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.400
So South Sudan
gained independence

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.580
about four years ago, and so
I did I did visit South Sudan.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.279
The original goal was to go to
192, and then it became 193.

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:41.570
AUDIENCE: So I think a lot
of what you're talking about

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.160
has a lot of
sticktoitiveness-- like,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.571
the grit that is over
a long period of time.

00:25:46.571 --> 00:25:48.070
And you always have
these situations

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.220
where you have this really
intense aspiration that kind of

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.450
peters out after a while.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.960
Do you have any
situations where you

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.900
started very strongly
believing in something

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.483
and wanting to hit
that goal, and then

00:25:57.483 --> 00:25:59.134
deciding, maybe
this isn't for me?

00:25:59.134 --> 00:26:00.050
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Yes.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.340
Fantastic question.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.060
What happens if your
motivation peters out?

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.180
I think a couple of things.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.460
I think it depends on how
far along you are, maybe.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.970
And I think it also depends
on what the long term

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.600
outcome is of what you're doing.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.058
I'll give you a
couple of examples.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.500
In my case, it was
a 10 year thing.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.380
So I think if I didn't have
motivation in year two,

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.311
I think the best advice
would be just give up

00:26:27.311 --> 00:26:29.060
and do something
different, and that's OK.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.180
Like, I think it's terrible
advice to say never give up.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.360
If you're doing
something that sucks

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.776
or you don't believe
in it, if you

00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:36.380
don't have the motivation,
why continue, right?

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.430
And I think it's totally normal
to change course and do that.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.162
But maybe if it was year
9 of my 10 year thing,

00:26:43.162 --> 00:26:45.120
maybe the best advice
would be just keep going,

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.852
because you're almost there.

00:26:46.852 --> 00:26:48.560
So I'll tell you one
story from the book.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.910
There's this guy named Mark
Boyle, and he's from England.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.140
And his original quest was
to walk from England to India

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.050
without spending any money.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.520
So he thought this was
a great idea at first.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.105
And he was a hero
in his hometown,

00:27:03.105 --> 00:27:04.480
and people were
buying him beers,

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.105
and like, yeah, that's
great, you know?

00:27:06.105 --> 00:27:08.840
And then he leaves England
and he finds pretty quickly

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.674
that the whole concept
doesn't really translate.

00:27:11.674 --> 00:27:14.340
And he can't speak the language,
and people think he's a beggar.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.340
And the whole point he's
trying to barter his work.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.670
And that's his whole project.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.310
But it didn't work, essentially.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:23.330
And so about three weeks after
leaving England, he gave up.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.280
He did go back home.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.120
He's kind of
embarrassed and ashamed.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.370
But then he started
thinking, OK,

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.180
what was the underlying
value of this goal?

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.960
It wasn't really
about walking to India

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.140
without spending money.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.430
What he believed in was
this world without currency.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.649
Or at least he believed in
this idea that some of us,

00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:41.940
at least, could live in a
world without spending money.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.570
And so he adjusted
his quest, and he

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.650
decided to live in
England for three years

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.870
without spending money.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.770
And that was something
that was possible.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.620
And he created this
whole barter economy

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.620
and attracted a lot of
people to his cause,

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.920
and just lived very simply.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.672
So I think it's also OK to
change course and change

00:27:58.672 --> 00:28:00.380
directions if something
doesn't work out.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.421
That's the short version.

00:28:02.411 --> 00:28:04.410
AUDIENCE: I assume you're
familiar with the work

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.180
of Joseph Campbell
and the hero myth,

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.140
and also Matt Dances
Around the World.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.098
And so I was wondering
if you have any thoughts

00:28:11.098 --> 00:28:12.058
on either of those two.

00:28:12.058 --> 00:28:13.090
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: On
either of those two.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.436
That's a good little mashup.

00:28:14.436 --> 00:28:15.810
Joseph Campbell,
the hero's myth.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.860
A lot of what I'm talking
about, quests and adventures,

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.590
is something that has existed
for a long period of time.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.280
I guess what I'm trying to do
is apply more of a modern day

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.200
twist to it and talk about
real life adventures, not just

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.095
mythological stories.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.730
But as for Matt dances
around the world,

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.688
I believe the website's
wherethehellismatt.com.

00:28:35.284 --> 00:28:39.810
He's had a wonderful
quest of not just gaining

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:43.600
fame and notoriety,
but exploring culture

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.090
around the world and dancing.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.673
I don't actually
know him super great,

00:28:46.673 --> 00:28:48.190
but I think it's a fun project.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.240
AUDIENCE: I've been a longtime
blog reader of yours, actually,

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.430
and I know that your
total identity revolves

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:56.590
around a couple of things.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.650
You're a writer, you're a
traveler, an entrepreneur.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:02.410
You were also a pretty
serious runner for some time.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.230
And I remember one blog post
you wrote a little while back

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.287
about how you look
back on some things

00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:09.620
that you wish you had followed
through better on, right?

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.019
Because I remember you
mentioned that you didn't really

00:29:13.019 --> 00:29:13.810
believe in balance.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.620
You believed in doing
everything that you

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.337
could as best as you could,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:29:18.337 --> 00:29:19.920
And so on the topic
of prioritization,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.420
I was just wondering
what principles

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.316
you used to prioritize
and deprioritize

00:29:24.316 --> 00:29:25.940
these aspects of your
identity, and how

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.410
you deal with the struggle of
wishing that you would have

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.390
maybe followed through on
another part of your identity

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:32.920
moreso while you
were prioritizing

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.670
writing or traveling.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:33.960
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Yeah.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.440
That's great.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.480
Thank you for sharing
that, and thank you

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.330
for reading the blog as well.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.079
I appreciate that.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.180
I don't think I could say I
was ever a serious runner.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.370
I was a pretty
serious 5K runner.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.260
I would run three
miles really seriously.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.260
I ran some marathons,
but it was hard.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.010
Yeah.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.710
I mean, not everything
worked out super great.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.540
And lots of things
I do kind of wish,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.090
oh, I wish I had
built that better.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.673
I did have to make
a lot of tradeoffs.

00:29:59.673 --> 00:30:03.210
And as I was coming to the
end of the quest, like,

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:04.890
my business is doing
well, and I have

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.848
all these different
opportunities to do things.

00:30:06.848 --> 00:30:08.620
And I'm really good
at starting things,

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.970
and I'm not so great at
seeing them through, right?

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.480
So these are all these
weaknesses and strengths.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:18.880
I guess what I loved so much
about the ten year quest was

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.200
I always knew what to do next.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.390
And I would go away at
the end of the year,

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.340
and I would plan my
year, and I'd look ahead

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.820
at all the different
projects, and everywhere I

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.800
wanted to go, and
everything I wanted to do.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.952
But I had this constraint.

00:30:29.952 --> 00:30:31.660
Maybe I'll use the
word limitation again,

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.810
but in a positive way.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.330
I had this constraint
of like, OK, I

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.560
have to go to 18
countries next year.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.939
And again, just like Nate
walking across the country,

00:30:38.939 --> 00:30:39.980
all I have to do is walk.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.021
All I have to do is keep
making progress on that.

00:30:42.021 --> 00:30:43.992
So the quest was an anchor.

00:30:43.992 --> 00:30:45.700
It was like a foundation
for all of that.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.280
And even though my identity,
just like everyone's identity,

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.780
is complex, and we do
lots of different things,

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.090
it was a perfect
central point from which

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:55.860
I could do a bunch of
other stuff as well.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.590
So then I came to the end, and
I don't have the quest anymore,

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:58.800
and it's more complicated.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.650
But that's the short part.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.410
AUDIENCE: Now that
you've iterated once,

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.735
I want to know if
there's any place where

00:31:05.735 --> 00:31:07.860
you feel you have some
unfinished business that you

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.330
feel a need to return to.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.080
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Any
unfinished business?

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.370
You know, the great
thing about traveling

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.780
is you don't have to do
everything all at once.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.110
And there were a number
of places that I went to,

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.680
and I was like, oh, I would
love to spend more time here,

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.710
or something.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.830
But then the whole
point was I can go back.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.470
I knew that.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.679
I wasn't troubled by only
being in a place for a week

00:31:30.679 --> 00:31:32.845
or something, when I wanted
to be there for a month.

00:31:32.845 --> 00:31:34.700
So I don't know if it's
unfinished business,

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.491
but there's a number
of places in the world

00:31:36.491 --> 00:31:39.290
that I felt a special attachment
to that I hope to return to.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:43.605
So a few of those would be
Bhutan, in Southeast Asia.

00:31:43.605 --> 00:31:45.730
I had a wonderful
experience there.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:49.390
Macedonia and Lithuania are two
really small European countries

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.645
that, for some reason, I
just had a great time in,

00:31:51.645 --> 00:31:53.040
and I would love to return to.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.970
I haven't been
back to West Africa

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:58.070
in a number of years,
since I was living there.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.065
I would like to return.

00:31:59.909 --> 00:32:01.700
And I also just like
the process of travel.

00:32:02.647 --> 00:32:04.980
And that was a good thing,
since I was always traveling.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.450
So I liked the coming
and going to places,

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.250
and being in transit and motion.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.322
And it wasn't all about
the destination for me.

00:32:11.322 --> 00:32:12.780
It very much was
about the journey.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.520
So my last day at
Google is Thursday,

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.650
not to make this about
me, but I kind of

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.460
have an unstructured
quest in the works.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.880
And one of the things
I'm most afraid about

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.330
is being alone
traveling, and I wonder

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.140
if you can talk about that
challenge in particular,

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.500
and maybe how you dealt with it.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:31.980
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Sure.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.521
I think traveling
alone is wonderful.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.300
I really do.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.801
I mean, I have
traveled with others.

00:32:36.801 --> 00:32:37.800
I've traveled in groups.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.170
And I think it's good to mix it
up and do things differently.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.160
But I kind of like
traveling alone.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.840
And I think when
you travel alone,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.000
you experience, sometimes,
a kind of loneliness

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.650
that is not always bad.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:54.740
You experience an isolation,
in some ways, that

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.670
can be helpful and
reflective, and you also

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.230
don't have to be alone
if you don't want to.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.320
I mean, these days, this
interconnected world,

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.317
with couch surfing, with social
networking, lots of meet up

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:08.400
groups everywhere-- like,
anything you want to do,

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.900
you can.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.335
But I also think maybe
it's good to try it

00:33:12.335 --> 00:33:13.590
out a little bit on your own.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.256
You've traveled on your
own, haven't you, Rachel?

00:33:17.256 --> 00:33:17.750
RACHEL O'MEARA: Yeah.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.110
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Did you
have a good experience?

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.985
RACHEL O'MEARA: Yeah.

00:33:19.985 --> 00:33:23.080
I've traveled a two month
[INAUDIBLE] on my own,

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.390
and here and there in India.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:29.203
And I would say just
go with your gut,

00:33:29.203 --> 00:33:30.676
and do a little planning.

00:33:30.676 --> 00:33:32.640
I like to do a
framework and be like,

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.604
I'm gonna go in and
try it from there.

00:33:34.604 --> 00:33:36.347
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: That's great.

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:37.805
Congratulations on
your transition.

00:33:37.805 --> 00:33:38.410
All the best.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.010
That's great.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.920
AUDIENCE: I was curious about
setting a goal for your quest.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.970
You can do it two ways.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:51.410
One is you either one big goal,
like climbing Mount Everest

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.100
or getting a new job, or a
bunch of smaller incremental

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.625
[INAUDIBLE] along the way,
like climb 10 mountains.

00:33:59.149 --> 00:34:00.690
How would you think
about both those?

00:34:01.597 --> 00:34:03.930
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: How would
I think about both of those?

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:05.680
Well, I guess I
like them in tandem.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.280
I guess the general principle
is I am pro-goal, right?

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.120
I am pro-parameters, you know?

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:16.120
There's this good story in the
book about a woman named Elise

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.942
[INAUDIBLE] who's
a serial crafter,

00:34:17.942 --> 00:34:19.900
and she makes all this
stuff, and she shares it

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.010
with the world, and she's
incredibly prolific.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:25.280
And her whole advice is
she says people are always

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.120
telling you to think
outside the box.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.690
She says, my advice is to
get in the box, basically.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:30.850
Make yourself a box.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:33.421
Make yourself these parameters,
these goals, whatever.

00:34:33.421 --> 00:34:35.670
Again, it's not something
that's being imposed on you.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:36.739
That's really the clear point.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:38.219
It's not like someone
saying, here's your goal.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:39.302
Here's what you should do.

00:34:39.302 --> 00:34:40.672
No, it's you.

00:34:40.672 --> 00:34:42.380
It's things that you
select for yourself.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:46.987
But I believe there's so much
possibility in those parameters

00:34:46.987 --> 00:34:48.820
or in those constraints,
as we talked about.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.344
So whether it's like, my goal
is to climb Mount Everest,

00:34:51.344 --> 00:34:53.219
or maybe it's the 10
mountains, or something.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:54.670
And stages are also good.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:57.396
So stages are milestones--
the levels in Mario Brothers.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.220
For me, it was
like, 50 countries.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.630
100 countries.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.250
Then it was like,
every continent.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.172
Once I finished all of
Africa, that was a big thing.

00:35:06.172 --> 00:35:07.880
So I do think it's
important to celebrate

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.442
small wins along the way.

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:12.150
AUDIENCE: So what
advice do you have?

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.570
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: OK, great.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:14.690
So, writing a
book-- was that part

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:16.230
of the quest, or something
that came afterwards?

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.922
And for those who want to write
a book, what advice do I have?

00:35:18.922 --> 00:35:20.630
I don't know if it
was part of the quest.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.020
What was your name again?

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.080
AUDIENCE: Jay.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:25.560
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU:
Jay said something

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.101
about how I don't
believe in balance.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.680
I believe in alignment
or convergence.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.440
Everything that I do, I try to
relate in some way to another.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.660
So I knew as I was coming
to the end of the journey,

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.270
I wanted to write a book.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.001
I knew I didn't want it
to just be all about me.

00:35:41.001 --> 00:35:42.875
But I don't know if it
was part of the quest.

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:46.150
As for advice on
writing books, there's

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.430
a lot we could say about that.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.620
I would say I could start
with some mechanics,

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.060
and say that the
mechanical thing that

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.660
helped me the most for writing
books over the past few years

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.140
is to have a quota.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.820
Again, a rule or a parameter.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.499
And I had this quota of
a thousand words a day.

00:36:00.499 --> 00:36:02.540
And if I'm in a book
writing mode, it's like, OK,

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.040
a nonfiction book is
about 70,000 words.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.625
So I can write about
1,000 words a day.

00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:09.700
Obviously, I'm not going
to write every day,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.240
and there's going to be
a whole editing phase.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.323
There's all kinds of other
stuff that comes later.

00:36:13.323 --> 00:36:15.560
But the first goal is really
to capture that outline

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.930
and to understand what I
want to communicate, and then

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:18.970
to get the first draft down.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:20.410
So I'm going to work
toward that in stages,

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:21.810
just like I do everything else.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.420
That's the mechanical advice.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.950
Maybe the more
important advice is

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:27.120
to know what you want
to say, and to really

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.640
start with a clear idea.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.540
And if you have the
idea, I feel like so much

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.567
can flow from that.

00:36:31.567 --> 00:36:33.650
And you don't have to have
a ton of ideas, either.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:36.480
I feel like in my first book,
I didn't have one big idea.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.390
I just had a whole
lot of things,

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:39.710
and I was kind of throwing it
all out, and that was great.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.710
But I think it's a lot easier
if you just have one clear idea,

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.334
and then you can
extrapolate from that.

00:36:44.962 --> 00:36:46.170
Are there other authors here?

00:36:47.859 --> 00:36:48.900
Well, soon there will be.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.550
That's great.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:50.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
re-write code.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.280
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: That's right.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:51.780
I know.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:52.380
That's great.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.230
Rachel, you had a question.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:53.350
Sorry.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:53.930
That's great.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:55.765
AUDIENCE: So I had a question.

00:36:55.765 --> 00:36:56.980
I have two questions.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:00.070
So the first question is,
in terms of prep-- so,

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:04.212
going to different countries--
what do you allow for yourself?

00:37:04.212 --> 00:37:04.920
Are you prepping?

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.405
Does it depend on
the type of country?

00:37:07.405 --> 00:37:09.280
Are you just going to
wing it a couple times?

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.150
Did you try everything?

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.441
I'm just really curious to
know what your planning was.

00:37:12.441 --> 00:37:13.786
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Yep, yep.

00:37:13.786 --> 00:37:15.160
I did try everything,
and I think

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.470
it kind of evolved a
little bit as I went along.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:19.990
So in the beginning
of my travels,

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.610
I did a lot more research
than I did toward the end.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.429
In the beginning,
I was all like, I'm

00:37:24.429 --> 00:37:26.470
going to read up on my
Lonely Planet or whatever.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.844
I'm going to find the top five
things I want to do there.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.370
And I started doing that less
and less as I went along.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:37.050
And I also started lightening
up a little bit more,

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:38.710
because I was really
an anxious person.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.418
I was always worried
about lots of stuff.

00:37:40.418 --> 00:37:42.845
And so, ironically,
actually, I had more things

00:37:42.845 --> 00:37:44.720
that went wrong toward
the end of the journey

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.720
than I did in the beginning.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.480
And I think it's because
in the beginning,

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.870
I was like super
worried all the time,

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.580
and I was double checking
everything and triple checking

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:50.960
things.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.930
And at the end, I was
just like, I don't care,

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:54.290
because it's going to be fine.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.190
If I miss the flight, whatever.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:59.350
If I don't have the visa,
I'll figure something out.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.390
So I kind of gained
confidence along the way,

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:03.020
and I also stopped planning.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.370
And so I would go to
countries and just be.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.160
And I would go on long walks.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.097
And I often knew readers there,
because of the community.

00:38:11.097 --> 00:38:12.680
So through Twitter
or through my blog,

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.485
I might connect with
someone locally,

00:38:14.485 --> 00:38:16.610
and they would show me
around, and I would probably

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.110
have a much better
experience than I

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.380
would have had I done
hours of research

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.630
in advance, because they're
going to show me something

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.772
that's authentic and natural.

00:38:24.772 --> 00:38:25.730
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.188
And then my other question is
more on a philosophical level

00:38:28.188 --> 00:38:30.310
of just learning about yourself.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.540
So everyone who
travels, I think, really

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.080
comes in touch with
what's going on with them.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.290
So what would you
say you tapped into?

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.960
Or did you find another part
of yourself in a journey

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.340
that you weren't aware of,
or that you didn't know?

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.765
And would you mind sharing that?

00:38:46.765 --> 00:38:47.640
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: No.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.420
I didn't learn anything.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.060
No, probably the greatest
change or transformation for me

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.530
was in going from,
like, this is just

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:01.110
something I'm doing for myself
because I believe in it,

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.440
and I think that's also good.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.550
I think that's OK.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.170
I don't think every
quest or adventure

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.300
has to have a super
humanity backdrop behind it.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.310
I think it's OK to pursue
something that you believe in.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:16.450
But having said that, for
me, the greatest change was I

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.160
started doing this by
myself, for the most part.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.670
And then I did begin to connect
with this great community

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.205
of awesome people
who read the blog

00:39:23.205 --> 00:39:25.290
and are doing awesome
things of their own.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.750
And that just changed the
whole trajectory of the project

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:28.250
for me.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.850
It changed the
whole focus for me,

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.250
and it helped me understand
just how much more important

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:32.750
that is.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.080
And ultimately, I hope,
like-- visiting every country

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.090
in the world, I'm
super glad I did it.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.050
No regrets.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:42.040
But I think hopefully, that's
more like a footnote in my life

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.140
later, because so many
better things are coming out

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.320
of all these other things
that people are doing.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.736
So that's more of my focus
now, a that was the big change.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.570
AUDIENCE: So I heard
about that guy that

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:55.910
walked talking
for awhile on NPR.

00:39:56.914 --> 00:39:58.580
For some reason, it
felt like I knew him

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.960
after I heard the
audio article on him.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.866
Tell me about your
experience with that guy.

00:40:03.866 --> 00:40:05.699
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: That
guy was John Francis.

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:08.110
As I said, he was an
environmental activist.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.660
He has a project
called Planet Walker.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.660
And he actually has a new
project with an Indiegogo

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.360
that's happening now.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.320
Yeah, he was, as I said,
initially disturbed

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.720
by this oil spill, and his
first goal was actually

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.385
to stop using
motorized transport.

00:40:22.385 --> 00:40:24.790
He was like, I'm
just going to start

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:28.030
walking everywhere
and not taking cars.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:29.550
And he did that for a while.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:33.570
And then he felt
like he was having

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.630
to explain himself all the time.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.150
And he felt that some
people were kind of offended

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.950
at his goal, because he felt
like he was judging them

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.700
or something-- that's
what they perceived.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.510
They thought because
he wasn't taking cars,

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.880
they thought they were bad
or something for doing so.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.400
So he just decided to kind
of cut that whole thing out,

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.870
and he did a silent retreat
for two or three days,

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.700
and then decided to keep going.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.450
And he just did that for a
year, and then two years,

00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:59.570
and it went on for
more than a decade.

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:01.175
And he traveled with a banjo.

00:41:01.175 --> 00:41:03.460
So he started walking
across America,

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.345
and he enrolled in
a graduate program,

00:41:05.345 --> 00:41:06.970
and he learned all
these different ways

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:08.190
of communicating with people.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.023
So he's got an interesting
story of his own,

00:41:10.023 --> 00:41:11.820
but you can learn
more at Planet Walker.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:12.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what your interaction--

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:13.940
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: What my
interaction with him was?

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:14.950
AUDIENCE: Was he
speaking at the time?

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.000
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: He was
speaking at the time, yeah.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.620
I wasn't his first
words or anything.

00:41:18.722 --> 00:41:20.180
I think he called
his mother first.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.831
He decided to call his mother.

00:41:21.831 --> 00:41:22.330
Yeah.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:26.670
He's just a very gentle
soul, as you would expect.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.665
But he also has a
great sense of humor.

00:41:28.665 --> 00:41:30.290
We do this event
every year in Portland

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.760
called World Domination
Summit, and he was actually

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.639
a speaker at that this year.

00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:36.680
So there's a video up
online, if you want to see.

00:41:37.022 --> 00:41:39.480
RACHEL O'MEARA: Thank you so
much, Chris, for coming today.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:39.780
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Thank you.

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:40.470
Thank you guys.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:41.370
Thank you so much.

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.220
Thank you.
