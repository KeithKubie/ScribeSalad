00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.390
Love, as they say, is in the air.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.960
And Hollywood has made trillions of dollars
because of it.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.750
There’s just something about watching two
people become completely obsessed with each

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.060
other that audiences find endlessly satisfying.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.180
But we aren’t the only ones who feel it,
and sometimes the chemistry on screen appears

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.900
real because it is.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.539
These are 10 Famous Actors Who Hooked Up With
Their Co-stars.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.870
Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes, The Place Beyond
the Pines

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.010
In 2012’s The Place Beyond The Pines, the
chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.690
is so prevalent, it’s bound to steam up
the inside of your screen.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.199
Director Derek Cianfrance tells the gritty
story of a man dead set on providing for his

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:43.199
family.

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.260
After learning about the birth of his son,
Gosling quits the carnival and gets himself

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110
a big boy job as a bank robber.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.280
It just so happens he’s one hell of a driver
so it was the natural choice.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.600
In addition to the movie, Gosling and Mendes
are a couple in real life, and even have two

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.739
kids.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.580
Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, Brokeback
Mountain

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.430
Brokeback Mountain did a lot of things for
cinema, and it focused viewers attention on

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.580
the topic of love.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.310
The cast is stacked with talented young actors,
and because director Ang Lee is behind the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.810
camera, it’s also beautiful.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.280
The movie won three Oscars, and three of the
lead actors, including Heath Ledger and Michelle

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.320
Williams, were nominated for their work in
it.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.740
This film is where the two actors began their
relationship.The couple were together from

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.930
2004 to 2007, and their daughter Matilda was
born in 2005.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.759
Kit Harrington and Rose Leslie, Game of Thrones
John Snow has been causing quite a stir these

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.630
days, and is quickly turning into the most
talked about character in Game of Thrones.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.579
And if you’re keeping up with the show,
you know it’s for a good reason.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.999
But more than a few fans lost their collective
shit when his lady-love, Ygritte, was killed

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:46.420
off by the ruthless and cold-hearted George
R.R. Martin- a man who is famous for destroying

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.530
everything you love.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.659
There’s one thing he can’t kill though,
and that’s love.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.350
Kit Harrington and Rose Leslie have been dating
for real, on and off, since meeting on set.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.429
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Days of Thunder
Tom Cruise may be known for his couch-jumping,

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.749
Oprah stunt in which he loudly declared his
love for Katie Holmes.

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:08.369
But back in 1990 it was love at first sight
between him and leading lady Nicole Kidman.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.480
The two met while filming Days of Thunder,
in which Cruise plays a young stock car driver

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.740
with a big dream.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.970
And Kidman is a girl with some big hair.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.920
The two fell head over heels and got married
that same year.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.310
They were a couple until 2001, and even did
a few more movies together along the way.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.070
Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, The Amazing
Spider-Man

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.030
When Andrew Garfield described meeting Emma
Stone for the first time in 2011, he said

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.580
it was “like diving into whitewater rapids
and having no desire to hang on to the side”.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.600
Which is just about the cutest thing we’ve
ever heard.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.560
The two began dating while working on The
Amazing Spider-Man, and stayed together for

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560
four years.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.850
It’s a good thing the two liked each other,
since the movie had a pretty intense promotional

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.140
schedule that saw them spending every single
day in close proximity for months.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.950
And despite their break up in 2015, they remain
friends.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.640
Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, Step Up
Before he was Magic Mike, Channing Tatum was

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.620
dancing up a storm in a little movie called
Step Up.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.200
In the wake of some poor decisions, his character
Tyler ends up at a performing arts school.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.340
A troublemaker with a checkered past and a
passion for dance, Tyler soon finds himself

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.180
enamored with a student named Nora.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.090
And just as Tyler had a thing for Nora, Tatum
was falling in love for real with the girl

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.070
playing her; Jenna Dewan.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.480
But you might know her as Jenna Dewan Tatum.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.940
The two have been together for ten years,
and married in 2013.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.180
There are entire blogs dedicated to the idea
of “relationship goals”, and these two

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.430
always make the list.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.250
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Mr. and Mrs.
Smith

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.560
Brangelina is a certified Hollywood power-couple,
but it hasn’t always been rainbows and sunshine.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.040
The tale of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s
romance actually started off a little rocky.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.170
The actors met while working on the film Mr.
and Mrs. Smith, and the rumor mill began to

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.170
churn.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.680
Pitt was in a relationship with Jennifer Aniston
at the time, and it didn’t take long for

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.700
rumblings of infidelity to start.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.410
Shortly after the actor separated from Aniston,
he began a relationship with his Mr. and Mrs.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.840
Smith co-star, which was huge news at the
time.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.120
The couple is now known for their human rights
advocacy work, have six children, and got

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.380
married in 2014.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.790
Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively, Green Lantern
Opening to largely negative reviews, 2011’s

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.160
Green Lantern was panned by audiences for
its liberal use of CGI.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.410
Especially when it came to the titular character’s
suit.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.530
But all was not lost.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.510
And one really great thing happened as a result:
the real life romance of Blake Lively and

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.510
Ryan Reynolds.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.060
Sure, there was some time in between those
events, but it’s the end result we’re

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.060
interested in.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.900
Both on screen and off, the two make a really
great team.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.530
Which is a good thing, since the two had their
first child in December of 2014.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.030
Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston, Wanderlust
For a while there, Jennifer Aniston could

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.260
not catch a break.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.070
All eyes have seemingly been on her romantic
life since Friends took over television in

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.070
the nineties.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.120
And the actress has gone through more public
breakups than anyone should ever have to endure.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.259
After her divorce from Brad Pitt in 2005,
the airwaves exploded with controversy.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.430
For a long time, everyone had an opinion on
who the starlet should (and should not) be

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.430
dating.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.199
But after meeting Justin Theroux, the two
became fast friends.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.569
And, after a few years of knowing each other,
the two were married in 2015.

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.830
Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell
When two genuinely nice people get together,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.270
we can’t help but cheer.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.039
And in 2007 Dax Shepard found Kristen Bell.

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.099
The two hilarious blondes met and fell in
love, despite viewing themselves as complete

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.099
opposites.

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.900
But their adoration for one another is so
obvious, especially on the red carpet.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.639
They’re always laughing, and are constantly
gushing about each other in interviews.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.319
Shepard and Bell are that couple who are so
cute, it physically hurts.

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.590
Technically they didn’t meet on set, but
they have worked together on more than one

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.590
occasion.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.699
The couple have two kids, and got married
in 2013.

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.080
