00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:02.157
Want to make a few clarifications

00:00:02.157 --> 00:00:04.827
on the video on the marriage penalty.

00:00:04.827 --> 00:00:08.603
The first is to point out
a minor arithmetic error

00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:11.004
is that when I calculated
the amount of taxes

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:12.470
to pay on this bracket,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.603
so the 15% of the increment
between 17,850 and 72,500,

00:00:17.603 --> 00:00:21.136
that is actually 8,198

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:24.074
and since that was 8,198
this right over here

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:25.741
would have been $10 higher.

00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:29.137
So it's 43,466.

00:00:29.137 --> 00:00:30.671
It doesn't change at all the ideas.

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:31.907
It's actually a small amount of money

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:32.963
in the whole context of things,

00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:36.074
but I just wanted to get the
math a little bit more correct,

00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:38.407
but you still see that you
have a marriage penalty.

00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:40.408
But the more important
thing that I want to clarify

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:43.137
is I saw in the discussion on
the marriage penalty videos,

00:00:43.137 --> 00:00:43.734
some people saying,

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:48.363
"Okay, fine. If it costs more
to file married jointly,"

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:51.055
"well, why don't those people
just opt to file as individuals"

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:53.227
"and then they'd just have
to pay this right over here"

00:00:53.227 --> 00:00:55.857
"and they could essentially opt
out of the marriage penalty."

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.242
And I want to clarify is
that is not an option.

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:03.468
If you are married, you
don't use the pure individual

00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:05.908
tax schedule. You don't
use this over here.

00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:08.824
Instead, if you are married
but you want to file separate,

00:01:08.824 --> 00:01:13.243
you use the married filing
separate tax schedule

00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:16.347
and you see in this, that this
is ... this is exactly ...

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:19.005
it's different ... It's the same
as the individual tax schedule

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:21.870
up until in these first three brackets,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.804
but then as we go above that bracket,

00:01:23.804 --> 00:01:25.907
it gets into the higher tax rates

00:01:25.907 --> 00:01:27.937
faster than the individual ones

00:01:27.937 --> 00:01:30.407
and it does it ... If you
look at these brackets here,

00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:32.908
you see that they're
exactly half the brackets

00:01:32.908 --> 00:01:35.270
of the married filing jointly

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.004
and that's because, at least
for this couple right over here,

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:39.908
that's making identical incomes,

00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:42.005
they're going to pay
the exact same amount,

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.074
taking into account some roundoff error,

00:01:44.074 --> 00:01:48.537
for married filing separate as
they are married filing jointly.

00:01:48.537 --> 00:01:50.538
And we can go through that exercise.

00:01:50.538 --> 00:01:52.992
So each of them had
100,000 in taxable income

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:55.562
and in Couple A example that I gave

00:01:55.562 --> 00:01:59.137
and so the first 10 per or the first 8,925

00:01:59.137 --> 00:02:00.271
they're going to pay 10%.

00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:04.997
That's just rounding. That's 890 ... 893,

00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:09.825
actually I could even say 892.5
if I want. 892.5 is 10% of that.

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:12.491
Then on the next bracket,
they're going to pay 15%.

00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:16.936
So that is $4,099 ... $4,099.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:21.491
And then on the next bracket,
they're going to pay 25%.

00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:24.991
So 25% of this right over here,
actually I think I rounded

00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.337
this number, but we'll take
into consideration a little

00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:32.658
round off error. So 9, 238
and then they're going to pay

00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:38.158
28% ... 28% on the
increment ... The increment

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:43.658
above 73,200. So they each
have 100,000 ... 1,2,3

00:02:43.658 --> 00:02:49.242
in taxable income. Subtract
73,000, 200 from that

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:52.671
and they're paying 28%
on it and this gets us,

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:54.741
each of them having to spend 20

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:58.741
or have to pay 21,733.5 in taxes.

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:02.492
If we combine the two for
both parties to the couple,

00:03:02.492 --> 00:03:10.575
we have 43,467 ... 43,467
which is essentially the same

00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:12.137
as if they would have had to file jointly,

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:13.670
the difference between the 6 or the 7

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.604
that's just because of some of
the round off right over here,

00:03:16.604 --> 00:03:19.158
but they had to pay the
functionally equivalent tax rate.

00:03:19.158 --> 00:03:22.736
So just to be clear, if you are
married you either have to do

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:26.004
married filing jointly,
married filing separate.

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:27.670
There's also a separate head of household,

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.671
but you do not have the option
of filing under an individual,

00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:32.915
so you can't just opt out
of the marriage penalty,

00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:35.660
if it happens to exist for the scenario

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.660
that you happen to fall into.
