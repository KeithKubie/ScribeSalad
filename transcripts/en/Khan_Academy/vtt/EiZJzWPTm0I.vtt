00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.150
We're on problem 248, truly
the home stretch.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.740
Right triangle pqr is to be
constructed on the xy plane.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.710
Let me draw an xy plane,
that seems like

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.370
it should be useful.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.620
So that's x, and y -- I'm sorry,
that's y and that's x.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.780
Let me label them since
I said them wrong.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.170
y and x, that should be second
nature to you at this point.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.220
If you start the xy plane so the
right angle is at p, and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.740
pr is parallel to the axis
-- so it's going to look

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.670
something like that, where
that's p and that's r,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.840
parallel to-- and p is the right
angle, right, so it's

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.040
going to look something
like that.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.540
So q has to be right below p.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.770
The x- and y-coordinates of p,
q, and r are to be integers

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.260
that satisfy the inequality
minus 4 is less than or equal

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.530
to x, which is less than
or equal to 5.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.860
And it tells us that 6 is less
than or equal to y, which is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.650
less than or equal to 16.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.900
How many different triangles
with these properties could be

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140
constructed?

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.840
So let's first draw
this range.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.525
So x could be between
minus 4 and 5.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.650
And x and y are always
going to be integers,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.140
so that's our boundary.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.470
And it could be minus
4 or 5, right?

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.650
And then y is between
6 -- let's just say

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:43.350
this is 6 -- and 16.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.500
So let's think about this.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.110
Let's think about where we
can place the point.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.320
So first of all, how many
different legitimate places

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.050
can we put the point p?

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.210
Let's just kind of figure out
how many different ways we can

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.750
construct this thing.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.330
So if we have to pick its
x-coordinate, how many

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.160
different x-coordinates
are valid?

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.590
So you have minus 4, minus 3,
minus 2, minus 1, 0, 1,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.180
2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.520
Right?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.890
They should be -- 5 minus
5, so it should be 9.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.930
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 --
oh actually, no, it's 10

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.650
different points, because we
could include minus 4, right?

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.210
So it could be -- x could be
minus 4, minus 2, 3 -- right,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:35.720
this is minus 3, minus 2, minus
1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.280
Right?

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.620
So this x value can take on
any of these 10 spots.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.310
So p can take on 10
different values.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.080
Well, its x-value could take on
10 different values, right?

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.070
So p's x can take on 10
different values.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.540
And how many values can
its y take over?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.240
Well, this top boundary is 16,
this bottom boundary is 6.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.010
And we can be either
one, right?

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.870
So 16 minus 6 would be 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.160
But we can include
6 as well, right?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.500
If you just said 16 minus 6,
that would give you 10 spots,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.450
but since we're including 6, the
y could take on 11 spots.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.620
You could count them, maybe
it'll be beneficial for you to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.310
see all the different
y's it could be.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.410
It could be anything between 6
and 16, including 6 and 16.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.950
So there's 11 possibilities
for the y.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.880
So that means that there are
110 different possible p's.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.792
Let me just draw one of them.

00:03:39.792 --> 00:03:43.080
Let's say that's our p.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.020
So our p is there.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.750
For any given p, how
many different

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.480
possible r's are there?

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.950
Well r is in the
same line as p.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.320
So whatever p's y value is,
r has to be the same.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.120
But r could be any of the other

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.610
leftover x spaces, right?

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.950
So if p took up one of them, r
could be here, it could be

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.620
here, it could be here.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.000
r could be in any of
these spots, right?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So how many left over
x spots are there?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.890
Well there were 10 x spots,
10 x-coordinates.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.400
p took up one of them.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.004
So now r could only be in one
of nine x-coordinates.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.450
Fair enough.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.560
And r is limited to its y.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.350
Once we pick a y coordinate for
p, that's got to be the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.040
same coordinate as r, right?
r has to be on the same

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.300
y-coordinate as p.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.500
Because they told us
that this line is

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.850
parallel to the x-axis.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.200
Fair enough.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.420
So how many possibilities --
once we've picked a p and an

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.900
r, how many different
possibilities

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.130
do we have for q?

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.390
Well q is going to have the
same x value, because they

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.670
told us that this is a
right angle, and so

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.380
this has to be q.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.590
So q has to be in the same
vertical line as p.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.050
It has to have the
same x-value.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.230
And so on how many different
y-values can it have?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.550
Well there were a total of -- we
said there were originally

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.910
11 potential y-values, right?

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.450
That's what we said when we
picked our p. p could be

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.820
anywhere between 6 and 16.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.675
q could be any of those numbers,
but it can't be at

00:05:18.675 --> 00:05:20.030
the same point as p, right?

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.250
This side has to have
some length.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.580
So if there were 11 original
slots, 11 original y slots, p

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.490
takes one of them up.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.570
So then q could be any
of one of 10 y slots.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.820
So if we want to know the total
number of potential

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:46.390
triangles like this, there are
110 potential places to put p.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.240
Once we've put p, there are nine
potential places to put

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.680
r, and once we've put p, there's
also 10 potential

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.590
places to put q.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.310
So this is what, 110 times 90.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.570
That's the same thing as 11
times 9 with two 0's, right?

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.145
Which is choice c.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.025
And we're onto our last -- I'm
glad this a new video, that

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:17.290
took me six minutes.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.110
Problem 249.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.445
Hopefully it won't take you
that long on the GMAT.

00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:23.160
It takes less time if you don't
have to explain it.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.280
If n is a positive integer less
than 200 -- so n is less

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.680
than 200, it's positive and it's
an intiger -- and 14 over

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.465
n -- 14n over 60
is an integer.

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:42.140
So that means that 14n divided
by 60 -- or 14 is divisible by

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.190
60 then n has how many different
prime factors?

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.030
Let's simplify this first.
Divide the top and

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.880
the bottom by 2.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:59.590
You get -- this is also saying
that 7n over 30 is an integer.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.100
Well multiplying by 7 doesn't
make it any easier to be

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.570
divisible by 30, right?

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.300
Because 7 and 30 share
no common factors.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.625
14 and 60 did, 2, but
we got rid of it.

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:15.430
So we have 17 and 30, so n has
to be divisible by 30.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.610
Right? n has to be divisible
by 30 for

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.250
this to be an integer.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.970
Well, I don't know, let's just
pick the smallest one.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.460
I mean, there's a lot of
different candidates.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.920
n could be 30, or 60,
or 90, or a bunch

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.620
of different numbers.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.740
But let's just pick
n is equal to 30.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.720
They just say that n is less
than 200, so let's just say

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.620
that n is equal to 30.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.430
If n is equal to 30, then they
say, how many different

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.690
positive prime factors?

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.370
Well let's just do a prime
factorization of 30.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.480
2 times 15, which
is 3 times 5.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.600
So it has 3 positive
prime factors.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.740
So that's choice b.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.540
I don't know, I'm
just curious.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.560
So let's see if that would've
worked if we

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.320
picked n equals 60.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.195
If you'd have done the prime
factorization of 60, you'd

00:07:57.195 --> 00:08:02.860
have gotten 2 times 30,
which is 2 times 15,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.120
which is 3 times 5.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.330
And yeah, you still have
only three factors.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.610
You're using one
of them twice.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.920
So this is the same thing as
2 squared times 3 times 5.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.220
So you still have actually
three different

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.490
positive prime factors.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.230
So it would work for any
of the multiples of 30.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.300
Anyway, choice c.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.630
And we're all done.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.780
I don't know what I'm going to
do next, maybe I'll do some

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.130
LSAT videos, or maybe
I'll get back to

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.590
actually teaching something.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.800
Anyway, see you in a
future play list.
