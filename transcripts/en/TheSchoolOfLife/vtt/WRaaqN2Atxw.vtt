00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.180
The story of the path to coldness in love is well known:

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.880
we start off full of affection for one another

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.540
and then, with time, feelings fade.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.700
We start prioritizing work,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.520
we check our phones while they're speaking,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.600
we don't especially want to hear how their day went.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
There's a popular surface explanation for this kind of emotional frost:

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.460
that people naturally get bored of one another

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.280
in the same way as they get bored with everything else:

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.020
the gadget that once seemed so amazing,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.980
the film they used to love.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.140
Going cold is, in this story, simply the unavoidable consequence of familiarity.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.900
But there's another explanation, dark at first,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.340
but in the end, more hopeful.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.880
The loss of interest isn't either natural, or inevitable.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.680
The boredom is something at once more complicated and more active -

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.600
It exists, because we fell hurt by, angry with or scared of our partner

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.160
and because we haven't found a catharthic way to tell ourselves, or them, about it.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.540
Tuning out isn't inevitable, it's a symptom of disavowed emotional distress,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.720
it's a way of coping.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.880
We're internally numbed, not just a touch bored.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.700
This can sound strange, after all we might have no active sense

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.980
that our partner has been hurting, angrying or frightening us.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.540
The idea apears laughable or extreme

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.280
It makes our partners sound like monsters or ourselves like weaklings,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.540
neither of which is true.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.900
But the self that loves within a relationship

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.360
is not the normal, adult self we know from other zones of our lives.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.860
We may mostly be hugely resourceful and resilient, but the person who loves is an infinitely more vulnerable being.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.540
We should imagine it like a smaller, younger, more defenceless version of ourselves

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.940
that lives in our heads and is no tougher and not much wiser than we were as babies,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.340
which is when so many of our needs for and ideas about love were formed

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.460
It's this vulnerable self that continues to direct our hearts even if we're 6'2" with a pointy beard.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.600
The loving self has a gossamer thin ego.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.640
It gets hurt, frightened and upset with desperate ease.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.640
You can deeply distress it by interrupting it during the story it's telling you about the sandwich it had for lunch,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.080
by not asking it enough about the little spot it got on it's arm yesterday,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.940
by preferring a book to cuddling,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.280
or being a bit tricky about which channel it should watch on TV.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.680
Of course, these are, by ordinary adult standards, tiny slights

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.400
but we don't love by adult standards.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.560
These small arrows are enough to wound the self that loves to it's tender, emotional core.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.120
Ideally, of course, the small self would at once point out what's happenned,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.280
It would carefully explain that it'd been frustrated and hurt,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.960
it's voice would be measured, undefensive and charming,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.540
but mostly it just stays silent.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.420
That's forgiveable - it doesn't properly understand what's wrong,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.260
it just knows it's in pain

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.820
and it's driven by an instinct to withdraw and protect itself

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.720
which translates into behaviour that looks pretty cold.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.960
If the adult self had to give voice to the loving self's upset, it could sound and feel absurd,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.840
which is partly why it doesn't.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.960
There can be something especially humiliating in having to say:

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.720
'I don't feel you took enough interest in the details of my lunch break.'

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.820
or 'I'm 45 years old but not capable of sharing a TV remote control'.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.380
These truly are small issues for an adult to dwell on,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.580
but the parts of us that make themselves vulnerable in love don't obey the ordinary adult rules

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.200
The consequence is that the loving self dries up, it doesn't want to have sex,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.400
it gets sarcastic and irritable,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.000
but it doesn't even know why it's like this.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.080
It isn't putting on an act, it's confused.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.680
To learn to cope, we need a prominent mutual awareness and forgiveness

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.280
of this dynamic of sensitivity and distress

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.800
and a commitment to decode it when disengagement and indifference descend.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.620
We have  to create a forum in which so-called minor, love-sucking hurts can safely be aired

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:24.300
without the other dismissing, as they always so easily can, the issues at stake as childish or imagined.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.500
The touchiness of the loving self is ridiculous, if judged by the more robust standards of the rest of life,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.200
but this is not the rest of life

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.060
When we've gone cold, we may not truly have lost interest in our partners,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.180
we might just need an opportunity to imagine that we are quietely really rather hurt and furious with them

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.300
and we should have access to a safe forum

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.480
in which our tender but critical feelings can be aired, purged and understood without risk of humiliation
