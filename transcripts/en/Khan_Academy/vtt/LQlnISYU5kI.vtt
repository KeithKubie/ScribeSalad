00:00:00.423 --> 00:00:02.753
- [Voiceover] This is the
third video in a series

00:00:02.753 --> 00:00:05.473
about tackling the Long Essay Question

00:00:05.473 --> 00:00:09.129
on the AP U.S. History exam.

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.967
Now in the last video we were kind of

00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:14.235
weighing the evidence about the New Deal.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:16.859
Considering the ways in
which the government,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.236
the economy and race, class and gender,

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:22.186
may have been either conservative during

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:25.158
the New Deal or radical.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.003
And we came up with some good evidence

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:28.930
to support either side.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.228
And now it's up to me to choose which way

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:33.412
I'm going to go.

00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:35.293
So I think I'm actually
going to choose the

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:37.956
conservative side here
because I think it's

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:40.133
just a tiny bit more convincing.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.895
And if you're wondering why I think it's

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:43.325
a tiny bit more convincing,

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:46.454
I think the part about
Eleanor Roosevelt being

00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:51.009
an advocate for race and
Frances Perkins being a

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.123
visible woman in a government cabinet,

00:00:54.123 --> 00:00:57.079
they to me don't seem like
maybe substantive changes.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.827
They seem maybe like they're
a little bit more like

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:01.496
figure heads like things
went well for this one person

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:03.469
or maybe just a tiny group of people,

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.581
but in the grand scheme
of things it wasn't

00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:07.067
that big of a change.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.110
Anyway, you may feel different from me.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.844
You may decide that you would have written

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:13.793
an article about how
radical the New Deal was,

00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:17.369
but I'm going to do an example
of a conservative argument

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.948
about the New Deal.

00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:22.617
Now our task here is take
these themes that we've noticed

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:25.659
and the evidence that
we have assembled about

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.945
these themes and turn it
into a five paragraph essay.

00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:33.065
And that essay is going
to include an introduction

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:34.794
with a thesis statement

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:47.126
and a paragraph that
explores one of these themes,

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:52.237
and I think I might start
with the government theme.

00:01:55.377 --> 00:01:57.853
A paragraph that explores another one.

00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:01.475
I think I'll go with the economic theme.

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:04.480
And because we're talking
about economics here,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.895
I actually think we're going
to roll class into that one

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:09.706
because it's about people who are rich

00:02:09.706 --> 00:02:10.989
and people who are poor.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.418
And lastly I want to
talk about the effect on

00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:15.951
woman and minorities.

00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.044
So that's our last theme.

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:26.321
And then we'll finish it
all up with a conclusion

00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:29.724
where we talk about how right we were.

00:02:29.724 --> 00:02:31.179
All right. Are you ready for this?

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:33.083
So let's start with our thesis statement.

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:36.079
So we've decided that we
think that the New Deal

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.890
was ultimately conservative.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.165
So we could start our
introduction by saying,

00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:45.165
"Although the New Deal
seems really radical

00:02:48.547 --> 00:02:53.547
"because it brought on a
new relationship between

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:58.505
"the federal government
and the economy and

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.059
"there were so many new programs.

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:06.059
"In fact, it was actually
essentially conservative.

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:14.625
"And it was conservative
because it did not really change

00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:23.496
"the essence of American government,

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:27.264
"the America economy,

00:03:27.264 --> 00:03:31.822
"or the lives of ordinary
Americans including

00:03:31.822 --> 00:03:36.157
"women and minorities."

00:03:36.157 --> 00:03:37.612
All right. I think that's pretty good.

00:03:37.612 --> 00:03:39.214
So let's move into our first paragraph

00:03:39.214 --> 00:03:40.143
about the government.

00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:42.465
Now with our thesis
statement here we've kind of

00:03:42.465 --> 00:03:45.948
set up a pattern for
ourselves to say the things

00:03:45.948 --> 00:03:48.827
that seem radical,

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:51.939
but really are conservative.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.843
And we're going to do that
in each of these paragraphs.

00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:04.210
So we can say what seems radical.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.343
Specific examples of things
that might seem radical.

00:04:08.343 --> 00:04:10.758
And it's in giving these
specific examples where

00:04:10.758 --> 00:04:13.601
you're going to really
wow the reader by showing

00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:15.203
the breadth of your knowledge.

00:04:15.203 --> 00:04:18.397
So it might seem radical that there's

00:04:18.397 --> 00:04:23.397
a whole new government
bureaucracy around the economy.

00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:29.726
It might even seem radical
that there are women

00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:32.344
in cabinet positions.

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.621
It might even seem radical
that FDR had this kind of

00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:42.964
first 100 days thing where he said,

00:04:42.964 --> 00:04:46.122
"I'm going to achieve so
much in my first 100 days.

00:04:46.122 --> 00:04:47.887
"I'm going to hit the ground running."

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:50.348
So that seems like a very
different form of government

00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:52.750
than what you might have had in the 1920s.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.813
In fact you can even
say that FDR is such a

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:59.251
active President, right?

00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:03.338
Mean he is bringing a force of personality

00:05:03.338 --> 00:05:07.587
and also governing
ability to this role that

00:05:07.587 --> 00:05:10.308
really hadn't been established that much

00:05:10.308 --> 00:05:12.430
except for, you know, a few people say

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.520
Lincoln or Teddy Roosevelt.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.005
So it does seem like
he's changing the office

00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:18.895
of President quite a bit,

00:05:18.895 --> 00:05:22.689
but in fact it's really
conservative because they're not

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.359
throwing the baby out
with the bathwater, right.

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:29.328
They're saying that essentially
the democratic system works,

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:31.743
and you can even compare
the American government

00:05:31.743 --> 00:05:34.413
with governments in other
parts of the world right now.

00:05:34.413 --> 00:05:38.894
I mean think about Germany
where this economic depression

00:05:38.894 --> 00:05:40.752
leads to the rise of Hitler.

00:05:40.752 --> 00:05:44.096
So the United States could
conceivably have become

00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:46.486
a fascist government in this time period,

00:05:46.486 --> 00:05:47.570
but they did not.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.515
All right. Let's talk about economics and

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:51.791
the class system in the United States.

00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:54.716
So first let's think about
things that might seem radical.

00:05:54.716 --> 00:05:58.989
Well it's radical that the
government puts together

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:03.989
all of these new economic
initiatives like social security,

00:06:05.792 --> 00:06:10.436
or the federal deposit
insurance corporation, the FDIC,

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:14.012
which are new regulations
about the banking and

00:06:14.012 --> 00:06:16.311
economic system that are kind of designed

00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:20.444
to make sure that ordinary
people don't lose everything

00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:23.718
if the banking system
crashes or maybe if they're

00:06:23.718 --> 00:06:26.179
in old age and lose their job.

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:30.920
And there's also a new
sense that being wealthy is

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.245
not something that's
necessarily deserved, right.

00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:37.063
That there's an element
of chance that goes

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.013
into your economic status.

00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:42.891
So I think it really
tears down a long standing

00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:47.891
stereotype in the United
States that the wealthy

00:06:47.918 --> 00:06:51.960
deserve to be wealthy and
the poor deserve to be poor,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.593
this is a very popular
notion in the gilded age.

00:06:56.593 --> 00:06:58.280
And instead says,

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.811
"You know, sometimes bad
things happen to good people."

00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:03.481
It's not everyone's fault
if there's a depression

00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:05.385
because we couldn't have stopped it.

00:07:05.385 --> 00:07:08.205
Now we can to talk about how
it was really conservative.

00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:10.524
And what we're saying here is that the

00:07:10.524 --> 00:07:14.966
capitalist system itself
didn't fall apart.

00:07:14.966 --> 00:07:19.588
If you compare the New
Deal to a true revolution,

00:07:19.588 --> 00:07:22.119
like for example the French Revolution,

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:24.162
or the Russian Revolution,

00:07:24.162 --> 00:07:25.996
and these are examples where the poor

00:07:25.996 --> 00:07:28.736
rose up against the rich
and were cutting people's

00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:30.919
heads off and taking their land.

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:33.520
Then the New Deal seems very conservative.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.286
In fact,

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:36.422
what most of these New Deal programs

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:39.952
are trying to do is not
to demolish capitalism,

00:07:39.952 --> 00:07:41.809
but to fix capitalism.

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:45.836
So they accept the basic
premise that capitalism is good.

00:07:45.836 --> 00:07:48.204
And that certainly wasn't the
case in many other countries

00:07:48.204 --> 00:07:49.296
in the time period.

00:07:49.296 --> 00:07:50.874
Okay, last paragraph.

00:07:50.874 --> 00:07:53.313
So again we're looking
at things that seem like

00:07:53.313 --> 00:07:54.404
they might be radical.

00:07:54.404 --> 00:07:55.263
And you could say,

00:07:55.263 --> 00:08:00.263
"It seems like Frances
Perkins and Eleanor Roosevelt

00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:06.811
"are women that have
established a real presence

00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:10.124
"in the government."

00:08:10.124 --> 00:08:11.587
And you could say that,

00:08:11.587 --> 00:08:16.388
"New Deal programs did
employ many African Americans

00:08:16.388 --> 00:08:19.105
"and at the national
level were not intended

00:08:19.105 --> 00:08:21.906
"to be discriminatory."

00:08:21.906 --> 00:08:23.534
But you could say,

00:08:23.534 --> 00:08:27.946
"At the local level administrators
are often preventing

00:08:27.946 --> 00:08:30.941
"African Americans and other
minorities from getting jobs."

00:08:30.941 --> 00:08:34.238
And you could also say that,
"A lot of the New Deal programs

00:08:34.238 --> 00:08:37.907
"were really definitely intended for men."

00:08:37.907 --> 00:08:40.252
And you could, for example, say,

00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:45.252
"The Civilian Conservation
Core was a program only

00:08:45.268 --> 00:08:46.638
"for young men."

00:08:46.638 --> 00:08:48.588
So women are often
booted out of these jobs

00:08:48.588 --> 00:08:51.444
or they're not even
actually eligible for them

00:08:51.444 --> 00:08:52.679
in the first place.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:55.372
So even though the New
Deal is supposed to be

00:08:55.372 --> 00:08:58.530
this great economic turnaround
in the United States,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.270
it really doesn't change
the status of women

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.502
and minorities much at all.

00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:05.040
Okay, time to conclude.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.037
So I think we can pretty much just sum up

00:09:07.037 --> 00:09:08.476
what we've said here.

00:09:08.476 --> 00:09:12.076
That there are a lot of things
that look really radical

00:09:12.076 --> 00:09:13.260
about the New Deal,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.061
but in the end it doesn't
actually change that much

00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:20.041
about the basic assumptions
and basic structure

00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:22.503
of the American society and economy.

00:09:22.503 --> 00:09:24.031
And you might even mention that it's not

00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.910
going to be for another 20 or 30 years

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.114
that things like this change
for women and minorities.

00:09:30.114 --> 00:09:33.958
And even during the 1940s things,
things kind off go back to

00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.547
the status quo before the
great depression, right.

00:09:36.547 --> 00:09:39.291
It's this moment during the New Deal

00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:42.240
where there are a lot of
government experiments

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.468
about how to reorganize American society

00:09:45.468 --> 00:09:47.999
and reorganize the American economy,

00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:51.249
but by 1940 things kind
of go back to the way

00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:52.447
that they had been.

00:09:52.447 --> 00:09:55.041
They're only a few things
that still remain with us

00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:56.922
from the New Deal and I think those things

00:09:56.922 --> 00:10:01.078
are important like the
FDIC, social security,

00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:03.888
and the idea of an
interventionist government

00:10:03.888 --> 00:10:05.049
in the first place.

00:10:05.049 --> 00:10:08.058
But from the 1920s to the 1940s,

00:10:08.058 --> 00:10:10.452
there's not a gigantic revolution,

00:10:10.452 --> 00:10:13.997
an American Democracy, capitalism,
