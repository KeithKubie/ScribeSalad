00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.390
So they tell us that Hiram
solved the equation, 5 plus

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.930
the square root of x plus 14
is equal to x plus 7, using

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.800
the following steps.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.950
Let's see what he did.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.830
He subtracted 5 from
both sides.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.860
Yeah, that's reasonable
enough.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.030
That got that 5 out
of the way.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.120
And then 7 minus 5 is 2.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.850
And then he squared
both sides.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.690
The square root of x plus 14
squared is just x plus 14.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.310
That makes sense.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.700
And x plus 2 squared is
x plus 2 squared.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.040
And then he uses the pattern for
square binomials to expand

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.690
the right-hand side.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.220
OK, so he just multiplied out
x plus 2, times x plus 2, to

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.650
get x squared plus 4x, plus 4.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.975
Then he subtracted x plus 14
from both sides, so he gets a

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:41.830
0 on the left-hand side.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.260
So when you take x from
4x, you get 3x.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.650
When you take 14 from 4
you get negative 10.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.840
So that all makes sense.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.450
Then he factored the
right-hand side.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.580
Let's see, 5 times negative
2 is negative 10.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.540
5 plus negative 2 is 3.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.320
That makes sense.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.480
Then he uses a 0 product
property

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.280
to solve the equation.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.330
That's just this property--
look, if you have two things

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.950
and you take their product and
it equals 0, one or both of

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.610
them must be equal to 0.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.920
So that means x plus 5 is equal
to 0, or x minus 2 is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.950
equal to 0.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.660
And so if x plus 5 is equal
to 0, that's x is equal to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.710
negative 5.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.190
x is equal to 2 of 0, that's
x is equal to 2.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.550
Let me just write
that down here.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.070
So all he did in this step
is he says, x plus

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.700
5 is equal to 0.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.210
Or x minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.320
From this you get this right
over here, because you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.670
subtract 5 from both sides.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.620
And then from this you get
that right over there.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.820
Then he checked both answers.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.200
He substituted negative 5 into
the original equation.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.762
So he substituted negative
5 in there.

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:43.230
It shows up twice.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.610
5 plus the square root of
negative 5, plus 14 is equal

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.370
to negative 5 plus 7.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.410
Let's see what else he did.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.405
Then this becomes square
root of 9.

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:51.420
This becomes 2.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.070
Then you get 5 plus 3 is equal
to 2, which is false.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.280
This is not true.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.790
And he wrote that down.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.430
And then he tried out 2.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.740
His other solution.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.950
When you substitute 2 you get
2 plus 14, which is 16.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.960
2 plus 7 is 9.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.340
Square root of 16 is 4.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.410
And this is the principal root
of 16 we're talking about, so

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.940
we're taking the positive
square root.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.150
And then 5 plus 4
is equal to 9.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.900
So this works out.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.785
And then he says that
the answer is x

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:16.590
equals 2, which is right.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.810
Now this whole exercise, all
they want us to know is, is

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.900
this an example of deductive
reasoning?

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.210
Explain.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.760
And it is an example of
deductive reasoning.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.540
He started off with a known
statement, with a known-- we

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.160
could call that a known
fact-- if we assume

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.070
that that's a fact.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.460
He started off with that.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.440
And just doing logical
operations, he was able to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.370
deduce, step by step,
he was able to

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.860
manipulate other truths.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.020
He started with a fact and using
logical operations he

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.050
was able to come up
with other facts.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.580
And go all the way down here
and then check his answers,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.680
and eventually come up with
the notion that if this is

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.930
true, then this must
also be true.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.420
So that is deductive
reasoning.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.020
You start with facts, use
logical steps or operations,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.030
or logical reasoning to come
up with other facts.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.200
He's not estimating.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200
He's not generalizing.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.350
He's not assuming some
trend will continue.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.310
He started with something he
knows is true and gets to

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.990
something else he
knows is true.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.010
And this is a bit of a review.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.520
You're probably wondering
why the

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.480
negative 5 wasn't a solution.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.780
And as a little bit of a hint
here-- and I'll let you think

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.050
about why it didn't end up as a
solution-- when we took the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.460
square root of 9 here, we took
the positive square root.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.110
And when anyone just says a
square root like that, that

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.710
means the positive
square root, the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.330
principal square root.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.670
But if we were to take the
negative square root here,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.640
this equation would
have held up.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.200
Because 5 plus negative
3 is equal to 2.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.780
So I'll let you think about at
what step of this equation

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.530
would a negative number
have worked?

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.810
And it has something
to do with when

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.200
we square both sides.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.890
But that has nothing to do with
the actual question at

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.190
hand, so I'll leave you there.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.360
We explained it before,
in the past. So this

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.480
was deductive reasoning.
