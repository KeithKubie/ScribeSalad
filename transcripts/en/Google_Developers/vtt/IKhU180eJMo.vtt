Hi, my name is Pratip Banerji.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.990
I'm a product manager on the
Google Play for Education team.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.800
I'm excited to be
here today to talk

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.850
to you about Google
Play for Education.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.510
What we've launched,
why we launched it,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.810
and what we're launching
new this summer.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.170
So just to start
off, when we built

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.820
Google Play for
Education, we went out

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.980
and we talked with
a bunch of educators

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.250
to really get a good
sense for the challenges

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.310
that they faced with deploying
technology in the classroom.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.680
And what we heard from
them was four things.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.030
First, we heard they really
wanted an affordable choice

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.240
of devices to use
in the classroom.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.810
They wanted devices at
different price points,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.410
with different sets of features,
with different form factors.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.880
Second, we heard that
IT departments really

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.980
wanted a solution that scales.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.872
They wanted a solution that made
it easy to provision tablets.

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:48.330
They wanted a
solution that made it

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.970
easy to manage those tablets
once they were provisioned.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.650
They wanted all this
in an environment

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.400
that was safe and secure for
student use in the classroom.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.230
Third, educators told
us that they really

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.920
wanted to get tools
that empower teachers.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.644
Teachers are close to students.

00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:05.060
They see where
they're struggling.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.920
They see where
they're succeeding.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.730
Teachers want to be able to
find the content that they need

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.140
and actually manage which
things go out to students.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.830
And last, we heard
educators wanted

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.230
a broad set of digital content
available at their fingertips,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.540
ranging from apps to books
to videos that they actually

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.220
controlled and were
able to push out

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.060
to students when they needed it.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.060
So I'm going to walk
through each of these areas

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.800
and talk a bit about
what we've done

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.470
to solve some of these problems.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.000
So with Google
Play for Education,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.610
we've made available a broad
set of Android devices.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.530
Today, we've actually got a
seven inch Nexus tablet that's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.140
available for
schools, as well as

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.739
a Samsung Galaxy
Tab for education.

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:45.530
We've also announced
that we're rolling out

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.837
an ASUS Transformer, as
well as an HP Slate 8 Pro.

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:50.670
What this means is that
schools can actually

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.366
choose from many different
types of tablets.

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:54.990
And when they buy
one of these tablets,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.830
they know it's going to
work within the classroom

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.371
environment, and
they know it's going

00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.670
to work with Google
Play for Education.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.174
Once you buy one
of these tablets,

00:02:03.174 --> 00:02:04.590
how do you actually
get it working

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.340
in a classroom environment?

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.740
Many of you have set
up Android tablets,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.720
and you know that
it's multi-step.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.430
So you have to add a
Wi-Fi configuration.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.840
You' actually have to set
up a username and password.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.190
You have to go and
download device policy.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.710
And then you have
to download apps

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.560
that you want to
use on your tablet.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.970
This is fine if you're setting
up a couple of tablets.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.720
But once you're an IT
administrator that's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.100
trying to do this for 5,000
tablets across the district,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.260
it actually gets
pretty cumbersome.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.830
So we built is this device
activation and set up tool.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.420
So an admin downloads this
tool onto their device.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.180
And then all they need to do
is NFC bump every other tablet

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.970
with this admin tablet.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.300
And those tablets
automatically start

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.980
setting up Wi-Fi, adding a
student profile with a username

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.700
and password, downloading
device policy,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.230
and downloading
any apps that need

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.330
to be pre-installed
on that device.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.210
So then that tablet can be
just handed to a student.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.670
So what this means is instead of
taking days or weeks to set up

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.450
a district of tablets, you could
do that in a matter of hours.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.180
So once one of these
tablets is set up,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.240
how does an educator
actually find content for use

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.534
on that tablet?

00:03:13.534 --> 00:03:14.950
So with Google
Play for Education,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.790
what we built is a new set
of search filters and browse

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.560
filters that let
educators find apps that

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.170
align with specific subjects,
that align with specific grade

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.050
levels, that actually
can align with

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.320
specific common core
curriculum standards as well if

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.360
applicable.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.610
And the way we do this is
that we allow developers

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.870
to opt into Google
Play for Education.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.860
And then any app that's opted
in goes to a third party network

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.360
of teachers that review
the app, make sure

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.800
that the app works well in
a classroom environment,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.830
and assign metadata
to that app that

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.640
allows for us to surface
that app in the right way.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.006
So for example, if
a third grade math

00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:54.380
teacher is looking for an app
that teaches their kids how

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.080
to do multiplication,
they just look for math,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.880
they look for third
grade, and they

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.970
look for a common core
curriculum standard that's

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.660
going to align with
multiplication.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.576
And they're going to see
every single app that

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:06.910
exists within the Play
for Education Store that

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.110
aligns with that.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.600
So once they've found an app,
how does the teacher actually

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.290
get this app into the
hands of the student?

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.630
Obviously, a teacher can use the
standard distribution mechanism

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.564
of putting in a student's
username and send to a student.

00:04:21.564 --> 00:04:22.980
But the cool thing
that we've done

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.450
is we've actually
made the ability

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.930
to do bulk distribution
by having a teacher set up

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.460
Google Groups for a
classroom, for a entire grade,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.419
or for subsets of a class.

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.210
And then when a teacher
actually provisions

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.670
to one of these groups,
the app is pushed out

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.290
to every single student
that's in the group.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.200
So a teacher could set up a
group for basic math student

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.440
and a group for
advanced math students,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.510
find apps that make sense for
each of those sets of students,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.080
and then provision those apps
directly to those students.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.540
And those apps will just show
up on the student's devices.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.610
So with the apps that
are getting pushed out,

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.550
we've also build a broad
set of management tools

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.370
that really works for schools.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.080
We heard from schools
that they really

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.870
did not want to pay
with credit cards.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.370
That just didn't work
with their buying process.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.160
So we built the ability
to accept purchase orders.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.640
So the way this
works is a school

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.840
sends Google a purchase order.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.630
Google logs that purchase order.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.025
And then schools can make
purchases against that purchase

00:05:21.025 --> 00:05:22.910
order with a balance declining.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.510
And then on a monthly
basis, we invoice a school

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.260
so that they see how
much they've spent,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.850
what they've spent it on.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.610
The cool thing about this is
that this happens completely

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.359
transparently to the developer.

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:35.150
The developer doesn't
have to know anything

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.121
about purchase orders.

00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:38.370
They just know that they
sold a certain number of apps

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.250
and that they get a
check in the mail.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.730
We've also built tools
that allow for teachers

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.470
to manage the apps are actually
present on the devices.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.360
So if a student is
done with an app,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.650
a teacher's able to use
Google Play for Education

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.340
to remotely uninstall that app,
either from a specific student

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.350
or from a set of students,
as well as reassign that app

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.960
to another student if one
student is done with it

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.770
and another student
needs to use it.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.140
So no digital content
solution in the classroom

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.270
would be complete without books.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.140
So we've actually launched
a flexible rental model

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.980
that has publishers, including
top textbook publishers, as

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.580
well as trade
fiction publishers.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.290
We've also made available
YouTube education videos.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.470
So YouTube has a
broad set of content

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.290
that's available that works
great in the classroom.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.850
Using Google Play for Education,
educators could actually

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.710
find those YouTube Edu videos,
using the same search criteria

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.670
that we have for
apps and provision

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.080
those videos to
students as well.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.800
So what are we launching new?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.460
This summer, we're
excited to announce

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.335
that we're expanding
the availability of Play

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.480
for Education to
Chromebook schools.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.980
So for those of you
that don't know,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.780
Chromebooks are
doing extremely well

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.270
in the classroom environment.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.210
In 2013 Q4, 25% of all edu
devices sold were Chromebooks.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.160
And over 10,000 schools
are using Chromebooks today

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.920
by millions of students.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.670
So this summer, admins
of Chromebook schools

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.210
are going to be able to enable
Google Play for Education

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.720
on their domains, which is
going to allow educators

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.710
in those domains to find
the same book and video

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.340
content that Android Edu schools
can find, as well as find

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.020
Chrome apps that are available
in the education space.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.380
And all this content can
be provisioned and managed

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.060
using the same
management tools that

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.692
are available for
Android schools.

00:07:24.692 --> 00:07:26.650
The last thing that we're
launching this summer

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.358
that we're super
excited to be announcing

00:07:28.358 --> 00:07:32.640
is the ability for teachers to
leave tips for other teachers.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.290
What we've heard over and
over again from teachers

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.350
is that they want to
know what's working

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.630
for other teachers
in the classroom.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.180
So what we are enabling
now is allowing a teacher

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.330
to actually leave a tip that
talks about an app, what

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.970
the goals were when they used in
the classroom, how they used it

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.930
in the classroom.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.640
They can link to YouTube videos
showing how they used it.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.650
They can link to a curriculum
or a lesson plan that

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.974
shows how it really
worked in the classroom.

00:07:58.974 --> 00:08:00.640
So then other teachers
that are actually
