definitely taught me that research is a
 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.920
definitely taught me that research is a
process and it's not something that can

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930
process and it's not something that can
 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.080

when I present a meeting of the minds
I'm hoping just to show that art

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630
I'm hoping just to show that art
 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.080
I'm hoping just to show that art
research is possible and that

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090

that I created over the summer as well
 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.730
that I created over the summer as well
as working on layout and creating some

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740
as working on layout and creating some
 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.890
as working on layout and creating some
new images as well as I continued

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900
new images as well as I continued
 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.290
new images as well as I continued
through the project I'd walk away from

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300
through the project I'd walk away from
 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.270
through the project I'd walk away from
pieces and then come back and realize

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280
pieces and then come back and realize
 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.930
pieces and then come back and realize
that need to be changed or go to

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940
that need to be changed or go to
 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.420
that need to be changed or go to
something small that didn't bother me

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430
something small that didn't bother me
 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.610
something small that didn't bother me
before but now it started to bother me

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620
before but now it started to bother me
 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.210
before but now it started to bother me
so I think my project really needed a

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220
so I think my project really needed a
 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.240
so I think my project really needed a
year of completion for completion next

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
year of completion for completion next
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.860
year of completion for completion next
week at meeting the mines they'll have

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870
week at meeting the mines they'll have
 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.350
week at meeting the mines they'll have
about 10 printed pieces and then I'll

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.480
about 10 printed pieces and then I'll
have my book on display for people to

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490
have my book on display for people to
 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.820
have my book on display for people to

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.590
present my project talk with people why
project and also for people to see it in

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600
project and also for people to see it in
 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.900

book form to be able to turn pages and

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910
book form to be able to turn pages and
 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:19.830
book form to be able to turn pages and
read a little bit about what I learned

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840
 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.449
there's a lot of people that have been

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459
there's a lot of people that have been
 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.979
there's a lot of people that have been
stopping by and asking me about the

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989
stopping by and asking me about the
 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.809
stopping by and asking me about the
project it's really nice to have like

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819
project it's really nice to have like
 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.970

visual components from the book and then

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980
visual components from the book and then
 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.000
visual components from the book and then
the actual book as well because people

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010
the actual book as well because people
 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.949
the actual book as well because people
are able to see it larger and then they

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959
are able to see it larger and then they
 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.990
are able to see it larger and then they
can actually feel the pages and turn

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000
can actually feel the pages and turn
 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.300
can actually feel the pages and turn

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.729
enjoy explaining to a lot of people have
been suggesting to me that I explore

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739
been suggesting to me that I explore
 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.500
been suggesting to me that I explore
contacting publishers and maybe trying

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510
contacting publishers and maybe trying
 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.610
contacting publishers and maybe trying
to see if i can get it beyond

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620
to see if i can get it beyond
 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.350
to see if i can get it beyond
self-publishing which I think might be a

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360
self-publishing which I think might be a
 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.630
self-publishing which I think might be a
good idea
