00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:04.640
SPEAKER 1: So a
vertical guideline

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.867
is, basically you can think of
it as a new edge of the screen.

00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:09.950
So it's like I have one
on the left of the screen.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.720
I have one on the right screen.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.300
And now I've put an
edge of the screen

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.049
in the middle of the
screen that I can use

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:15.267
as an anchor for constraints.

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:17.100
I'm going to go ahead
and move that to where

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.900
I'd like it in my design.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.940
And now, I could just
take those text views

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.480
and create constraints from
those to this guideline.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.700
And to kind of visualize what
this is doing underneath,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.400
if I move the
guideline, it's actually

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.230
going to move the
entire layout now.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.742
So if we go into Helpers and
we use Add Vertical Barrier,

00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:40.700
this allows you to add
a barrier to the screen.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.990
And what a barrier is, is it's
kind of like a view group.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.270
And it's actually
called a grouping code.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.280
So we can open up
the componentry,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.370
select our email and
password, and drag that down

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.260
to be inside of our barrier.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.760
Now, it's not
actually a view group.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.593
It's just a view that's
added to the screen.

00:00:56.593 --> 00:01:00.250
It's positioned on one side or
the other of all of the views

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.851
that are inside of it.

00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:02.350
Right?

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.290
By default, it's on the left,
but if I open up the Attributes

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.757
pane and scroll
down to the bottom,

00:01:06.757 --> 00:01:08.590
I'm going to find a
barrier direction, which

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.650
I can set to the end.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.890
And now that I've done that, I'm
going to set up my constraints

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.610
and then translate my
English over to German.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.360
And everything's going
to relay out and do

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.762
exactly what I expected.

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:23.970
SPEAKER 2: We've added the
ability to add constraints

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.170
directly with the context menu.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.450
So in this case, if
you have components

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.950
that are really
close to each other,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.850
this makes it a lot more precise
and more direct to actually set

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.420
those constraints.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.310
So in this case--

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.770
and this is
available in 3.3 beta

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.966
as well, so you can
try it out today.

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.840
And so in this case, we
select one component,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.130
which we have this
lovely cat picture.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.590
You can just simply
constrain it to the parent.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.730
So what does it look like if
you have multiple components?

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.390
So in this case, we have
these two text views that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.170
are really close to each other.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.157
And so, I'm not
sure if people have

00:02:01.157 --> 00:02:03.240
tried to create constraints
between two text views

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.410
that almost overlap--

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.034
it becomes a little
painful when you're

00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:08.940
going from the bottom of
one to the top of the other.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.009
And so with this
new Context menu,

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.539
you can actually just
keep the two selected.

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:15.330
And then when you open
up the Context menu,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.981
there's now this Constrain menu.

00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:19.230
And so you can actually just
see that the two elements

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.989
that you want to use are there.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.280
And then you can easily
cascade to the right constraint

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.863
that you want.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.270
The design surfaces has always
had a bunch of view options

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.900
to take advantage of when you're
working with your layouts.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.930
So the two I'll talk about
specifically which we added

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.636
is Show All Constraints
and Live Rendering.

00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:40.010
What we've done
in Android Studio

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.030
3.3 is we've added this option
to show all constraints.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.400
But it's actually
turned off by default.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.830
And so here's a quick video to
show you what that looks like.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.190
And so what we'll do
instead is we only

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.550
show the constraints on the
actively selected component.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.644
So this makes it easier to
just work with the component

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.060
that you're actually
working with,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.870
and not be distracted by all
the arrows and margins that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.780
usually come with the layout.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.880
The other view option we
have is Live Rendering.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.490
So we've actually done
live rendering by default

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.960
in constraint layout
for quite some time.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.670
And so it's on by
default. But depending

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.420
on the specs of your
machine [INAUDIBLE],,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.259
it can actually
be a little slow.

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.550
You've actually been able to
zoom and pan in the layout

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.080
editor for a while now.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.497
And it comes really
in handy when

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.830
you're dealing with constraint
layouts, especially when,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.770
again, when things
are really small

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.420
or when they're really close
to each other or overlapping.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.370
But what we've done in
3.3 is we've actually

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.740
changed the keyboard
shortcuts to match

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.650
more of what we expect from
the design tools like Photoshop

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.590
and Sketch.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.390
And so to zoom in, you can
use Command or Control,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.507
depending on what OS you're
on, and then the equals sign.

00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:50.090
And then with the mouse wheel,
you can hold Command or Control

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.360
and scroll up.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.380
And then if you have a trackpad,
you can just pinch in to zoom.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.120
Then the opposite
is for zoom out.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.850
So it's Command and Control
minus, then Command and Control

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.340
with the mouse wheel to
scroll down, and then pinch

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.724
in the opposite direction.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.390
And then zoom to fit.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.990
So if you're zoomed in and you
want to get back to that layout

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.920
where you can see
the whole thing,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.960
you can just use Command
and Control plus 0.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.550
And so then, if you're zoomed
in and you don't actually

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.800
want to zoom out, but
you want to pan around,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.350
you can actually do so by
holding Space and then using

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.240
the mouse to click and drag.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.690
