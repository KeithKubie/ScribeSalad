Okay, time for you to do some work. That's right, it's quiz

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.860
time again. In the instructors column you have a link, go to this

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.090
link and explore the supported property

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.160
types. Then answer the following question, which

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.350
are property types? String, geographical point,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.070
name, rating and zip code. Good luck.
