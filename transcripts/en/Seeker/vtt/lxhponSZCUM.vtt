00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:10.250
It’s not easy being green.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.040
Just ask Venus.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.330
Hello!

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.960
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News, and I thought I’d pop into the studio

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.440
today to talk about a planet that rarely gets
much press, even though it’s considered

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.440
Earth’s evil twin.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.090
I am of course talking about Venus -- a world
that’s closer to the Sun than Earth is,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.169
but has an environment that is EXTREMELY hazardous
to life.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.800
Well, for LIFE AS WE KNOW IT, anyhow.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.190
(There might be little cloud-floating aliens…
who knows!

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.890
But that’s for a different episode.)

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.130
For a long time, Venus remained a tantalizing
mystery for astronomers -- the thick hazy

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.399
atmosphere completely obscured its surface,
keeping it a well guarded secret.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.000
But after decades of observations by telescopes
on the ground, unmanned spacecraft flybys,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.309
plus a Soviet lander and balloon-borne atmospheric
probe (yes, we’ve floated a balloon in the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.960
atmosphere of another planet!), we’ve come
to realize that Venus is a deeply fascinating

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.960
place.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.680
But we won’t see astronauts exploring its
surface any time soon -- because, ya know,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.680
they’d MELT.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.610
So we tend to focus more attention on Earth’s
red sibling, Mars.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.430
Now that the European Space Agency has the
Venus Express satellite in orbit around Venus,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.160
there’s been a lot more interest in the
clouded planet and the mysteries its atmosphere

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.780
contains -- and one of the most mysterious
things about Venus is its green glow.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.410
On Earth, we have the aurora -- also known
as the Northern, or Southern Lights.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.190
When seen by the naked eye, we see predominantly
green light at high altitudes, but the aurora

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.920
comes in a whole range of colors.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.610
The aurora happens more frequently during
times of high solar activity, so when the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.630
Sun throws a coronal mass ejection, basically
a vast magnetized bubble of high energy particles,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.640
in Earth’s direction, our planet’s global
magnetic field deflects the particles and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.590
injects them into the Earth’s poles.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.750
The high energy particles, mainly protons
and electrons, slam into the high atmosphere,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.210
causing atmospheric gases to generate light.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.330
The green light we often see is oxygen emissions
and at the same time we’ll also see a red

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.670
emission, that is also oxygen atoms, only
at higher altitudes.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.040
But Venus doesn’t have a global magnetosphere
like Earth, so for the past 40 years, astronomers

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.730
have been trying to understand whether or
not Venus can even have auroral activity.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.150
Using a high resolution spectrometer attached
to the 3.5-meter telescope at Apache Point

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.340
Observatory in New Mexico, researchers were
able to spot green emissions from the Venusian

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.680
ionosphere when coronal mass ejections slammed
into the planet.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.269
However, these emissions were more diffuse
all over the Sun-facing side of the planet

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.030
as there is no magnetosphere to concentrate
the high-energy particles at the poles, like

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.030
Earth.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.329
Also, there was no sign of red aurora activity
at high altitudes.

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.459
Now they are trying to understand what chemical
reaction is causing this green glow; is it

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.139
the small quantities of molecular oxygen in
the atmosphere, or is something else going

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.139
on?

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:39.799
More Earth-based observations and help from
Mars Express are needed.

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.749
This is an exciting result as we are beginning
to understand how space weather impacts planets

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.969
without global magnetic fields, including
Mars.

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.079
All in a day’s work for our space weather
forecasters...

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.239
Do you have any wild theories to explain why
Venus produces this green glow?
