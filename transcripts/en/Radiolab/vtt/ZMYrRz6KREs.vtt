00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.430
You are listening to radio lab radio, w.

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:10.040
N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.290
All right. Let's start with an encounter. Yes.

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.440
<v 2>Hello? Hello. Okay. Can, can you hear me okay? I can barely hear you.</v>

5
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.270
<v 0>Okay, so this is a well, our producer, Lulu Miller, uh,</v>

6
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:29.320
with calling around trying to find some stories for this hour. Let's see.

7
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.550
She ended up on the phone with a woman named Barbara smarts. Is that any better?

8
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.980
Yeah, Barbara Smith's is now with University of Michigan,

9
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:40.981
but years ago she was a field researcher in Tanzania working with the Great Jane

10
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.680
Goodall, you know,

11
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.700
following chimps at a distance and writing down everything they do and that kind

12
00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:49.420
of thing. Right. And when she was in Tanzania, she ran into,

13
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:50.860
in Gumby national park,

14
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.450
particularly young male chimp name Goblin is where you told me the story of

15
00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:56.284
Goblin.

16
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.670
<v 2>Oh, sure.</v>

17
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.680
<v 0>First of all, what does he look like?</v>

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.750
<v 2>Well, he's an adolescent male [inaudible].</v>

19
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.450
He stood up to come up to quite a bit above my waist. Yeah.

20
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.770
And almost immediately he started picking on me in a sense that,

21
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:18.430
you know, he would walk past me and just kind of jab me casually as he went by.

22
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.220
And sometimes he would punch me with a fist.

23
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.250
Sometimes he would just kind of whack me with an open hand or just kind of use

24
00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:30.100
his body to just kind of shove at me as he went past. You know,

25
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.930
he'd look at me as he approached and I'd be going, oh no.

26
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.730
<v 0>And is that, that's something they would often do with humans or was this no,</v>

27
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.030
<v 2>right, no, he was in a phase of life when a male, as a male matures,</v>

28
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.310
he rises in rank and before he challenges any other adult male,

29
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.950
he rises kind of step by step through the female hierarchy.

30
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.360
He basically intimidates female after female until they give in and acknowledge

31
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:03.680
that he's superior and then he'll pretty much leave them alone. So, um,

32
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.740
he was at the point where he dominated all but probably two of the adult females

33
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.170
and you and me. So that's part of it is where Goblin wasn't.

34
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.640
The other part of it is that I'm really small.

35
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.810
<v 0>So as you're out there doing your research, what do you think is going on?</v>

36
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.950
Did you think he,

37
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.880
<v 2>I just felt like he was a bully and I was an easy target. Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.790
And in the evening I would say that Jane Goodall, you know,

39
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:34.500
tell her what happened. Yeah. Ask her what to do. And she would say,

40
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.730
just ignore him, you know? Eventually he'll get bored and he'll stop doing it,

41
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.190
which was, you know, this is kind of standard advice,

42
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.760
this sort of myth of total scientific objectivity.

43
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.110
Just ignore it and it'll go away. But instead he escalated.

44
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.620
I remember one time I was sitting at the top of a hill and he came up behind me

45
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:57.210
and jumped on my back,

46
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.900
which forced me to roll down hill and he kind of rolled down with me, you know,

47
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:06.190
we were like the ball rolling down a hill again.

48
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:10.050
I would tell Jane ask her what to do and she would always say the same things to

49
00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:14.590
ignore it. But one day during, during the race, it was the rainy season.

50
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.080
So we all carried raincoats with us,

51
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.920
and when it wasn't raining, we would

52
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.190
carry them on our backs so that it wasn't in the way.

53
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.880
And Goblin walked up to me one day and yanked on my raincoat and these

54
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.290
raincoats, they were like our most valuable possession, you know, the raincoat.

55
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.700
So he grabbed it and he was, you know, he was gonna run away with it. Um,

56
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.480
and so we had this tug of war and so the two of us were standing facing each

57
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:52.840
other, you know, tugging on this, um, raincoat.

58
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.640
And then I did something that was not premeditated at all.

59
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.103
Um,

60
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.953
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

61
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.200
<v 2>I just leaned forward and I punched him as hard as I could in the face.</v>

62
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.620
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

63
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.450
<v 2>And</v>

64
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.680
<v 0>what did you think, like right after you'd done it,</v>

65
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:12.800
were you shocked at yourself that you [inaudible]

66
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.690
<v 2>yeah, I'd never punched anybody. It's, you know,</v>

67
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.670
much less these chimp who I was posed to be, I think from a distance.

68
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.900
So I think I was shaking.

69
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.990
<v 0>What did he do?</v>

70
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.900
<v 2>He just collapsed. He like turned into a little baby, you know,</v>

71
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.840
he collapsed on the ground and started whimpering and then he looked to Sagan,

72
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.440
who was the Alpha male at the time who was sitting nearby. And he was like,

73
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.270
Figgins little sidekick always kind of hanging out with Fagan and playing up to

74
00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:41.570
him.

75
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.570
He ran over to Sigrun screaming like this being just beat up on me.

76
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.300
Come on, let's get her. And fortunately,

77
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.520
and did not take it seriously. I remember he just reached over with this,

78
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.360
you know, great big hand. And without even looking at Goblin,

79
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.880
he patted him on the head,

80
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.000
went back to what ever who is doing,

81
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.630
cause it could've been really bad if he had taken it seriously.

82
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.890
I did not go back and tell Jane Goodall I had punched Goblin in the nose and I

83
00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:18.230
just, I didn't tell the story for a long time.

84
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.310
<v 0>Why not?</v>

85
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.140
<v 2>Well, um, I think I,</v>

86
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.910
you know, I would've gotten a lot of disapproval. Yeah. Anyway,

87
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.510
Goblin never bothered me again.

88
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.780
<v 0>So here's the reason we played that story because here you've got this moment</v>

89
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.210
where you've got a scientist Barbara smarts, who's at, you know,

90
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:43.690
a trained scientists get scientific rules of objectivity and all that,

91
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.960
and he totally loses it and she slips

92
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.673
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

93
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.630
<v 0>And for just that moment, she's not really a human. He's not really a chimp.</v>

94
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.670
The raincoat is still the important thing, the borders.

95
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.013
It was really what's happening

96
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.630
<v 5>now. We're used to thinking of borders now between us and the animals as being</v>

97
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.250
<v 6>fixed. And most people would say, this is good. Keep them there.</v>

98
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.030
Keep us here, keep a separate, but

99
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.570
<v 5>not in this hour.</v>

100
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.770
You're gonna meet people who decided to go the other way.

101
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.990
People who are trying to intimate and I mean really intimate,

102
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.610
really big wild animal. Something you could either call incredibly stupid

103
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.210
<v 0>or our last great hope because there are so many of us on the planet.</v>

104
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.610
So coming up, we've got two stories of radical experiments in

105
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.970
<v 7>Sharon. Yeah, I'm Jan [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

106
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.290
This is radio lab.

107
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.120
<v 0>Okay. Story one.</v>

108
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.520
This whole shown way began with a conversation with this fellow, Charles. CBRE,

109
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.180
<v 7>I am. I'm an author and a journalist. Um, Eh,</v>

110
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.780
<v 0>and he wrote a book called the West Shula Woods accord,</v>

111
00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:04.720
which is a great book in which he tells a story,

112
00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:09.520
which he told us in studio as well, uh, about a chimpanzee named Lucy.

113
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.680
So let's just start at the beginning. Who, who is Lucy?

114
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.100
<v 7>Lucy is, um, a chimpanzee that, uh, actually, well,</v>

115
00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:22.000
this was found out later born to a circus entertainer born in their camp.

116
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:25.450
What country are we in in the u s they traveled up and down the east coast.

117
00:07:25.451 --> 00:07:28.690
The main old chimp arc shows something like that.

118
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.510
They were very popular in the forties and 50s.

119
00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:33.220
They were wildly popular apparently. Oh.

120
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:36.460
So this was a mom and pop entertainment operation that would go from town to

121
00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:38.440
town in the Middle Atlantic states.

122
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.980
And so Lucy was born to two of the chimps that performed in this thing. Yeah.

123
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.790
And they used to do things like the Houston stage wrestling matches with human

124
00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:46.120
beings.

125
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.090
The he-man of the town would come in and challenged the chimp to a wrestling

126
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.920
match. What would happen, you know,

127
00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:54.340
a chimpanzee and adult chimpanzees about five times the strength of a human.

128
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.770
And this guy would walk in thinking, you know,

129
00:07:56.771 --> 00:07:59.860
I'm going to give this chimp or I have no money and like one swipe of this

130
00:07:59.861 --> 00:08:04.180
chimps four-part that the guy would be on queer street. It'd be carried out.

131
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.510
It would end so quick then how spam go.

132
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.600
[inaudible]

133
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.130
<v 0>okay. So getting back to our story about, uh, Lucy, this is a story that, uh,</v>

134
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.240
begins in 1964 and it's one that Charles would have never heard about had he not

135
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:22.160
bumped into this obscure

136
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.920
<v 7>old memoir long out of print. Yeah. What's the name of the book?</v>

137
00:08:25.921 --> 00:08:27.240
Do you actually have it with you? Yeah, hold there.

138
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.330
It's called Lucy growing up human,

139
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.200
a chimpanzee daughter in a psycho therapist family by

140
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.970
Maurice K Tamerlan Maurice k 10 Merlin. He is the psychotherapist.

141
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.180
He's a psycho therapist

142
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.330
<v 0>and he's also the dad in this story in his wife Jane, who's a social worker.</v>

143
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:53.590
She's the mom. Now the thing to know was it, especially for Maurice Timberland,

144
00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:57.750
this was more than just a baby chimp. This was an experiment. Yeah.

145
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.390
He wanted to know, given the right upbringing,

146
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.400
how human could Lucy become what he says early on in this book.

147
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.930
<v 7>Would she learn to love us and perhaps have other human emotions as well?</v>

148
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.910
Would she be well, well behaved, rebellious, telogen or stupid? What about sex?

149
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.940
<v 0>Maurice Timberland actually died in 1989 but these are his words.</v>

150
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.360
Read by radio host David Garland. Would she mother her offspring?

151
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.630
But she learned to talk. How intelligent might she be?

152
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.050
And so how did they get her? He says that [inaudible],

153
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.750
<v 7>um, he and his wife Jane made all the arrangement,</v>

154
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.450
went and got the chimp from the day the infant was born.

155
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.560
The mother was anesthetized. In the early morning of her second day,

156
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.510
Jane Fed the mother a Coca Cola, which had been spiked with fen secluding,

157
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.650
a drug which puts chimpanzees into a deep, pleasant sleep.

158
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.583
<v 4>Um,</v>

159
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.930
<v 7>and the baby was taken away.</v>

160
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.230
Jane named her Lucy and brought her home on a commercial airline,

161
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.710
carried in a bassinet her face covered with a lacy blanket.

162
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.300
We were blissfully unaware of the complexities we were creating on the day.

163
00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:12.020
Lucy came home, the baby,

164
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.310
<v 8>they are too old. Just two days old. So it wasn't leaning. No.</v>

165
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.020
And that was part of the experiment. They bottle feed her. Yep.

166
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.140
She quickly learned to hold her own bottle a two months.

167
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.270
Her eyes would focus at three months.

168
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.530
She was trying to climb out of her crib to go to people and it's six months.

169
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.570
She was pretty mobile on all four lamps.

170
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.930
<v 0>My morning goes on the, by the time she was about, yeah,</v>

171
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.730
<v 8>a year old, she was eating at the table with us for expense knives.</v>

172
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.820
You would see us using silverware and immediately do so herself.

173
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.000
She began to dress herself in skirts. She would often grab my hand,

174
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.340
pull me to my feet and begged me to chase it.

175
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.500
Always looking back to see that daddy was not too far by the

176
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.160
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

177
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.810
<v 7>You know, he really went at this with this sort of full bore earnestness,</v>

178
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.830
you know when he calls her his darling daughter and I took great pride in my

179
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.510
daughter's achievement. He does feel like a real parent to Lucy.

180
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.720
She was so responsive to being looked at held and stroke.

181
00:11:08.721 --> 00:11:13.400
But he's also to make no mistake treating this as a very intense cutting edge

182
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.403
experiment.

183
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.550
<v 0>The next phase of the experiment, which occupies a good deal,</v>

184
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.900
the book involves one of those, uh,

185
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.930
talents that we thought used to only be limited to us language.

186
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.640
Okay. Can you introduce yourself please? Okay. My name is Roger Fouts. I,

187
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:34.890
I'm a professor of psychology and I've worked with chimpanzees since 1967.

188
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.120
Roger Fouts was called in by Maurice Timberland to address one of the crucial

189
00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:42.850
questions at the experiment, which you learn to talk. Right.

190
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.710
And at the time he was the guy,

191
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.790
he'd just been part of a team that had a proven for the first time that chimps

192
00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:52.690
could use sign language to communicate. So his job with Lucy,

193
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.250
what's the teacher had assigned.

194
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.870
<v 9>And I think I, uh, came into her life when she was, as I remember, it was 1970,</v>

195
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:01.330
I think it was four or five. She was four or five years old.

196
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.020
Roger taught her signs for airplane, Baby Doll Ball,

197
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.430
banana barrette right, Barry? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

198
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.440
So I was sort of like blanket p p the tutor friend babysitter that would come

199
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:18.160
over for a few hours though, tie each day in and spent some time just, you know,

200
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:21.460
just playing with Lucy Candy. I would work on signs camped,

201
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.640
we'd read books together or we'd go for walks and I would chat with her basic

202
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:30.760
cry dirty and he sends the Lucy enough,

203
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.820
just sort of picked it up that all up. It was like, again,

204
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.860
<v 7>she learned some 250 signs. And the big question is, okay,</v>

205
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.890
so is it me or mimicry or are they able to spontaneously create words and put

206
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:48.700
them together in a new original way?

207
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.930
And there's been a lot of anecdotal evidence that in fact,

208
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:54.410
Lucy did, um,

209
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:59.490
spontaneously create words in a later session when shown a piece of watermelon,

210
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.070
Lucy tasted it and she called it

211
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.750
<v 9>candy drink. Huh. And, uh, radish, uh,</v>

212
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.000
had gotten quite old and one day, you know,

213
00:13:09.001 --> 00:13:13.260
she was calling it food and food for I think several days of the study.

214
00:13:13.261 --> 00:13:17.220
And then she's decided to eat this old radish and she took a bite and spit it

215
00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:21.870
out. And I said, well, what is that? And she called it cry, hurt food. Wow.

216
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.900
She would also lie to me. Yes. Yeah. Yep.

217
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.900
<v 0>And lying we should also say is another one of those things that people used to</v>

218
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:30.100
think only we do.

219
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:31.400
<v 9>During one of my sessions,</v>

220
00:13:31.401 --> 00:13:34.580
I came in and she had a potty accent that she had been potty trained,

221
00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:37.430
but sometimes she didn't always make it to.

222
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:42.200
And I was upset because I was now faced with having to clean it up.

223
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.710
And so I said, whose is that? And she said, sue, who sue sue was one of, uh,

224
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.240
one of my students that would come in and spend time with Lucy too. And I said,

225
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.650
no, Sue's not here.

226
00:13:51.651 --> 00:13:55.910
And finally she blamed fessed up and said to Lucy and sorry. And so

227
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.870
<v 0>sue, yes. This is sue Sue's heavy drum bar.</v>

228
00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.960
The Grad student of yours who says she didn't actually see that lie and take

229
00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:06.220
place. Yes. Well, I wasn't there, but she told us that when she met Lucy,

230
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.310
she was blown away by, well, the incongruity of it all. Like for instance,

231
00:14:11.311 --> 00:14:12.660
every time she'd walk in the House,

232
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.470
Lucy would just walk casually into the kitchen and search through the cupboard

233
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:22.300
for the kind of tea she wanted that day and put some water in a kettle and put

234
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:25.300
it on the stove and make us tea. Yep.

235
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.230
<v 9>Became a routine. I'd come in and she would start the tea,</v>

236
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.640
<v 0>the casualness with which she did it. The kind of air about it that yes,</v>

237
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:36.250
I'm making tea and I would like you to have some too,

238
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.780
because tea is what we did.

239
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:44.310
And so the thing to do is to sit down and to casually sip the tea with Lucy and

240
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:49.540
casually look through the magazines, listen to the radio,

241
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:51.820
and what magazines would she look at? Well, she,

242
00:14:51.821 --> 00:14:55.330
she looked at I think house and Garden and um,

243
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.940
some magazines that had pictures of women and children in them,

244
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:01.300
whatever the timberlands had out. Wow.

245
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.430
Lucy had developed an awareness of our emotions.

246
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.400
If Jane is distressed Timberland's wife,

247
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.390
Lucy notices that immediately and attempts to comfort her by putting her arm

248
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:14.630
about or grooming her, kissing her. If Jane is sick,

249
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.620
Lucy would exhibit tender protectiveness toward her bringing her food,

250
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.980
sharing her own food. And as we get to this next part,

251
00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:23.420
this is sort of the mid point of the memoir.

252
00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:26.060
It's useful to sort of remember a basic fact of biology.

253
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.360
Speciation happens when you've got one group of creatures that gets divided into

254
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:32.030
two,

255
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.050
and then these two groups evolve away from one another and eventually they get

256
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:38.960
so far away from each other that they can't have babies in nature.

257
00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:43.961
Make sure that they can have babies by making one species basically undesirable

258
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:47.690
to the other. You look across your baboons, you'll look across at a champion,

259
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:51.050
you go, Eh, yeah, you're only sexually attracted to your own kind.

260
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:56.350
That is essentially what a species is. Now,

261
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.330
this isn't something you're supposed to be able to learn or unlearn.

262
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.920
This is just the way it is. Yeah.

263
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.770
Which brings us to some troubling passages in the book. Um,

264
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.230
beginning really on page one oh five, can you read it yet?

265
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.570
And we should warn that, uh,

266
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.630
this next minute and a half contains a sexual reference.

267
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.340
One afternoon around five o'clock,

268
00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:19.090
Jane and I were sitting in the living room when we observe this sequence of

269
00:16:19.091 --> 00:16:22.120
behavior, Lucy for that and we're living, went to the kitchen,

270
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.990
opened the cabinet and took from it a glass over the different cabinet and

271
00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:30.460
brought out a bottle of gin. Jen. Yeah, she loved Gin and tonics.

272
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.420
That's actually not the important part. It's what happens next. She takes her,

273
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.460
Jen goes back to the living room, sits on the couch and from a coffee table,

274
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.060
there's really no other way to say this. She starts to masturbate.

275
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.790
But even that's not the important part. It's actually in the very next moment.

276
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:51.000
Did a boundary that took proximately 6 million years to establish

277
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.240
<v 10>dissolves. Nah, Nah,</v>

278
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.283
Nah, Nah.

279
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.630
<v 0>Mr Timberland sees Lucy doing this. Any things?</v>

280
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.660
<v 10>No, no, no, no.</v>

281
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.770
<v 0>This is a perfect experimental moment. So he runs off to the mall,</v>

282
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.660
<v 11>well buys a copy of playgirl magazine and brings it back to her just full of</v>

283
00:17:15.661 --> 00:17:19.210
naked guy. Yeah. And Lucy would, uh,

284
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.230
masturbate to these centerfold.

285
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.800
<v 0>I was not a part of that. I was never there.</v>

286
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:29.801
When Lucy looked at the Borno with sue says that she was there for what happened

287
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:31.700
next. Yes, yes.

288
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:37.190
I was there when she was introduced to her first a adult male chimpanzee.

289
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.800
Had Lucy ever seen another chimpanzee before,

290
00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:42.760
ever seen another chimpanzee from the moment of birth. Wow.

291
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.570
She says they brought this male chimp and see if Lucy was attracted to

292
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.710
chimpanzee males and was she aye. Well,

293
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.980
the male chimpanzee would sit there with his hand held out toward her and she

294
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.300
was very frightened and she tried to move away.

295
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.240
It was then says sue, that she realized that in every way that mattered.

296
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.310
Lucy was no longer at chimp.

297
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:18.140
She was stranded right in between this great divide that I knew was there

298
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:22.890
between humans and non-humans and not, I did not know how to negotiate this.

299
00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:27.891
There is no category in our language except a mythical one for something that's

300
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:29.490
not human and not animal.
