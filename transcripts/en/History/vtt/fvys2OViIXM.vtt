00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.880
DOUG: Up first is our qualifying
test.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.380
Ben?

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.880
BEN: Bladesmiths, in this
sudden elimination round,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.000
I will be smashing your
knives into these blocks

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.710
of ice 10 times.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.210
Steve, you're up first.
Are you ready?

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.330
Let's do it.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.710
[music playing]

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.000
It's W2 that had
to be a chopper,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.210
so I tried to design for that.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.040
Got some weight up
front that'll hopefully

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.580
carry it through here.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.830
I think my blade will
destroy that ice.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.210
[music playing]

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.250
[metallic dinging]

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.250
Oh.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.250
[grunt]

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.670
[music playing]

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.420
BEN: Well, Steve,
we have a problem.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.000
On the 10th strike,
the knife broke.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.750
That's because, if you
look closely at this blade,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.330
you'll see that there's a
brown section of the crack.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.880
The brown section was an
old crack that happened

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.420
probably in the quench.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.290
It's been there a while.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.120
It's actually rusted.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.710
The rest of the edge
is still pretty sharp.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.460
But at the end of the
day, it did break.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.790
DOUG: Steve, that's what we call
a catastrophic blade failure,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.960
and you all know
what that means.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.790
But it's not over yet.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.460
Each of your blades must
survive all 10 ice block

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.040
chops in order to move forward.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.380
You guys will be
counting to 10 like you

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.290
never have before in your life.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.460
BEN: Well, Brian,
you're up next.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.380
Are you ready?
- Let's do it.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.420
This is the longest
blade I've ever made.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.540
I put a maple handle on it.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.960
I don't think I'm
nervous at all.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.790
I know that Steve's
blade just broke,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.170
but I know my blade's solid.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.420
[music playing]

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.330
BEN: Well, Brian, your
edge held up perfectly.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.670
It's like it never
even saw the ice.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.830
It's still like the
minute you brought it in.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.170
Got a nice finish to it.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.000
It's got a great shape.
Very well done.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.500
Thank you.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.290
BEN: Matt, you're up.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.000
You ready?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.790
I'm ready.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.670
[music playing]

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.750
I used a piece of W2.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.000
I made it short, robust, strong.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.500
And I think it feels
good in the hand,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.580
so I think it's
going to do well.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.380
I hope.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.210
[music playing]

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.620
Nice.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.120
BEN: Well, Matt, your
knife held up very well.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.540
It's got a very thick edge.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.170
It's still sharp and
it's still in one piece.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.120
Well done.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.290
Thank you.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.500
BEN: Tyler, you're up.
You ready?

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.170
Swing it like you mean it.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.040
I made it out of W2.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.380
It may be the best blade
that I've ever made.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.250
But I just hope mine holds
up, and I make it to 10.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.580
[music playing]

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.580
BEN: Well, Tyler,
this extreme curve

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.920
that you have here made it
so that, as I was chopping

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.420
the ice, I ended up hitting
my knuckle on the ice instead

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.250
of the blade.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.330
But it held up.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.920
The edge is still sharp.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.170
Well done.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.330
Thank you.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.750
BEN: Joey, you're up.
You ready?

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.080
Let's get her done, brother.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.080
I've never made a
competition chopper before.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.920
So I seen what one
looked like, and went out

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.420
and did my best to recreate it.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.170
I'm really very nervous.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.290
I'm hoping it's
going to do the job,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.460
and survive through that chop.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.210
[music playing]

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.460
BEN: Well, Joey, your
edge held up perfectly.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.120
I like the shape of
it, the weight of it.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.580
It's a great chopper.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.120
Did some damage on the ice.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.960
Well done.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.620
Thank you, sir.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.960
DOUG: Well, gentlemen, I don't
think that any bladesmith is

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.620
really prepared for
the ice block chop,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.790
and how devastating it can be.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.920
That being said, Steve,
because your blade suffered

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.670
a catastrophic weapons
failure, I have to ask

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.170
you to please leave the forge.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.170
To get eliminated before
getting to work in the forge

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.000
is really, really disappointing.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.500
But hopefully, this is going
to take me to the next level

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.500
of being a better smith.
