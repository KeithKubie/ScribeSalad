00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.510
woman: So could you start off by introducing your company and give me a bit of an overview of your application and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.010
your motivations behind creating it?

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.359
Francisco Tolmasky: Sure, my company is called 280 North. We actually have two products that use the Google APIs, the

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:16.700
first one is called 280 Slides,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.880
It's kind of like powerpoint or keynote on the web and the other is a opensource framework called cappucino for

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.799
creating applications like 280 Slides.

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:27.969
woman: So tell me a bit about how you chose to use the Open Web for your app.

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:32.290
Francisco: Sure, I mean it was pretty clear from the beginning that we wanted to do web based applications, since it's

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:38.159
the best distribution platform there is. And the Google APIs in particular allowed us to use a lot of existing

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:44.790
services in particular we use both google images and the youtube apis to allow people to bring in rich media into

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.330
their slides and applications.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.889
woman: So, do you have any war stories that you can share with us?

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:54.599
Francisco: Uh, actually, interestingly enough, the war stories are not so much about the Google APIs in general, but

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:56.809
having to use a number of APIs because

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.270
we also use, like, Flickr APIs, and obviously they're designed differently than the Google ones, so it was kind of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.029
unfortunate that we had to have two separate code bases. So often times, when we would use one set of APIs, we were

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:12.319
thinking, like, the other ones, then that would lead to some interesting stories.

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:19.399
woman: So if you could snap your fingers today and instantly have some sort of key web standard or feature available

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.099
across all browsers today, what would that be?

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.669
Francisco: Canvas. Easily. That's an easy question.

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:25.959
woman: Why canvas?

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:31.949
Francisco: Uh, because it's, I think the last remaining component to fully being able to do just about everything from

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:37.090
the desktop on the web. Just being able to have pixel-level control completely changes the space.

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:41.329
woman: So what part of HTML5 are you most excited about?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.829
Francisco: i think i'm most excited about, well, canvas but also web workers. I think, you know, the ability to

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.699
have... kind of... threads is really exciting.

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:56.669
Obviously one of the big problems today is that the heavy JavaScript locks up the UI, and being able to put stuff off

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:58.389
on a web worker is really exciting.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:03.369
woman: So, how does what you're doing now fit into the Open Web?

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.290
Francisco: So our main product is a web product, and the framework that we're developing is for developing

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.949
applications on the Open Web. So they're kind of exactly aligned, uhm, and specifically-- the reason we designed our

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:22.380
framework-- is to allow people to use open standards and open technologies and have a solid framework such as .NET or

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.799
Cocoa that they already have on the desktop, but on the web.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.119
woman: So where do you think the web should go in general, what are some significant problems that haven't been solved

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.369
yet?

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:36.900
Francisco: I would very much like to see a lot more low-level control. I think web workers and canvas are a good start

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:45.129
to this, but up to now the trend with the web has been... kind of... enabling specific features as opposed to specific

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.159
abilities. Like, css has always been about-- if you want to do this kind of layout, use this feature-- as opposed to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.799
just having really low level control, being able to do everything you can on the desktop.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.679
woman: So what do you most need from AJAX and HTML?

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:57.939
Francisco: Uh, for it to get faster.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.279
[laughter]

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.080
woman: Faster? That's it? Just faster faster faster?

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.430
[laughter]

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:05.720
Francisco: Yes that's it. That's basically the number one thing that we want.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.689
woman: that's cool. So, have you learned anything at I/O that you're really excited about?

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.539
Francisco: Uh, yeah. I got to learn a lot about the Android platform. which I actually didn't know anything about

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:20.609
before. And I got a free phone so I can actually start developing for it, and that's exciting, uhm, and yeah, a lot of

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.330
HTML5 stuff I got to learn more in depth, so...

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.089
woman: That's cool. Well, thank you for coming to talk to us.

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.540
Francisco: thank you.
