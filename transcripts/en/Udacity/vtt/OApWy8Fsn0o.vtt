00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So the final formula gives us the following, =1/NΣXi²-1/N²(ΣXi)².

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And noticed we didn't use any of these elements over here so let me just take them off.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Notice how the calculation of σ² which we're going to rewrite a little bit as follows.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This obviously the same. Noticed how this calculation doesn't rely on this term here anymore.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It solely uses the terms over here. In particular, we have the ΣXi², we have N.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
N² is easily calculated from N, and we have ΣXi²--sum them up and when they all summed up,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we find the square of the sum of it--so here the square is outside

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and here the square is inside as we sum the elements.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So the counter statistics of ΣXi, ΣXi² and N are sufficient to compute the variance

00:00:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and the single pass through the data, let's just calculate the variance.
