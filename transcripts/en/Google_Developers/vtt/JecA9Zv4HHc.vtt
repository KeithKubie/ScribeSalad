00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:02.868
Thanks a lot.

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:04.200
You know,
that was pretty cool.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.234
But I'd actually
like to see something

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:08.167
that uses
Google Web Toolkit a bit more

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:09.868
and App Engine more
to sort of test the limits

00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:13.734
and shows exactly how easy
Google Web Toolkit makes it

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:16.767
to build very rich,
powerful web applications.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.734
So to do that,
I'd like to invite up

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:20.400
Iein from Appirio

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.868
who's been working
on some applications

00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:24.067
using Google Web Toolkit
and App Engine.

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:25.534
He'll show them
to you now.

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:29.334
Thanks, Kevin.

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:31.334
So I'm Iein Valdez,
a product manager

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:32.868
and developer
with Appirio.

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:34.200
If you haven't heard of us,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.067
we helped some of the
largest companies in the world

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:37.300
do more with on-demand

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.167
and take advantage
of the cloud companies

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:41.567
like Genentec,
Qualcomm, and Starbucks.

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:43.734
So I'm here tonight
to tell you about

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:46.634
my experience building
a real customer application

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:48.400
using Google Web Toolkit
and Java App Engine

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.634
and sort of
bringing together

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:51.601
everything
we've seen tonight.

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.434
Now, in this particular case,

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:56.734
I needed to build an app
to help a customer

00:00:56.734 --> 00:00:58.434
better manage
their recruiting process

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:01.200
and get the word out
about new job openings.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.567
Now, as a developer,

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:04.801
I know Java but
I'm not an Ajax wizard,

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.267
and it was important to me
to spend my time

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:08.400
writing my code
and not worrying about

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.067
how I was
going to deploy it,

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:11.567
what stack
I was going to use,

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:14.334
or the tools that
I was going to choose.

00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:16.400
So let me show you
what we built

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.367
end-to-end in Java
in just over a week.

00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:26.634
So here's
our recruiting app.

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:28.100
And what you can see here

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.033
is that we were able to use
off-the-shelf GWT components

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.934
to quickly put together
an effective interactive UI

00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:36.501
and also to style it.

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:39.400
And this is the interface
that a hiring manager would see

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.934
when they log in to the app.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.701
We even have some nice
visualizations of our data here.

00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:46.400
So let's go in

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.634
and let's take a look
at our applicant list here.

00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:50.767
So I'm going to go ahead
and click into "Applicant List"

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:54.067
and you probably noticed
how quickly that loaded.

00:01:54.067 --> 00:01:56.534
And the page itself
actually never refreshed,

00:01:56.534 --> 00:01:58.200
and that's thanks to GWT

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.801
handling the Ajax calls
to App Engine on the back end,

00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:02.734
pulling my data,
bringing it back up to my UI,

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:04.100
and refreshing it.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.467
So that makes
for an effective

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:08.300
and really interactive
user experience.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.701
So let's go ahead
and choose a person here

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:13.801
and let's go ahead
and edit their details.

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:16.334
And let's say
I want to change their status

00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:18.667
from "New" to "Interview."

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:20.033
So I'm going to go ahead
and click "Save"

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.734
and you'll see
that we were alerted

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:25.767
that our changes have been
stored to the back end

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:28.400
and also that our data UI
was refreshed

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.501
with the new information.

00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:34.234
So great--
we have a great, effective way

00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:36.601
to manage our job postings,
manage open positions,

00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:37.968
and now how do
we get the word out

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:39.601
about these job openings?

00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:41.334
So the first place
I'll start

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:43.234
is obviously on
a company's public website.

00:02:43.234 --> 00:02:45.734
So in this
particular example,

00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:48.868
what we did was we took
the customer's website

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.667
and embedded
within the iframe

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:52.033
our App Engine app.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.534
So we're able to use
GWT and App Engine

00:02:54.534 --> 00:02:55.801
to power this UI

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:58.200
which used to be
hand-coded HTML.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.367
We have all of our
job openings listed here.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.467
We can get more detail
about a job,

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:04.367
apply on the spot,

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:06.767
or we can even
send it to a friend.

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:08.400
And let's say
I have someone here

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.033
that might be interested.

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:14.567
Oops.
Sorry about that.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:18.467
Let's go back.
"Email to a Friend."

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:20.367
Going to send that.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.734
And you'll see that,
again,

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.367
our Ajax notifications
and UI

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:25.501
was all preserved
within the customer's website,

00:03:25.501 --> 00:03:26.834
which is very cool.

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:28.634
So great--
we can now get the word out

00:03:28.634 --> 00:03:30.601
on our public
company website,

00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:31.834
but, you know,
what's a better way

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:33.567
to get the word out
about these job openings?

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:35.133
So what we've done

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:37.767
is we've connected
our App Engine app--

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:40.634
thanks to Open Web APIs
and the cloud--

00:03:40.634 --> 00:03:42.501
and as soon as this loads,

00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:44.634
you'll see
that what we've done

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:46.567
is we've connected
our job postings

00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:50.734
with Appirio's Facebook
Viral Recruiting app

00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:53.534
which connects this particular
company's employees' friends

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:54.868
with open job postings,

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:57.400
which is a great way
to get the word out.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.601
So to close up,
there are three points

00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:04.000
that I think we wanted
to bring to the tables.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.434
One, we love
the development experience.

00:04:06.434 --> 00:04:07.701
It was integrated--

00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:09.701
end-to-end Java,
GWT on the front end,

00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:10.868
App Engine
on the back end,

00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:14.100
there was no
hand-coded HTML,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.667
it was cross-browser
compatible,

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:17.767
and we could debug
everything in Eclipse--

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:19.868
end-to-end, all the way,
from data store

00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:21.367
up to browser.

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:23.300
Two, the app is completely
in the cloud

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.534
without servers.

00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:26.968
So with no up-front
infrastructure costs,

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:29.334
we were able
to get our app out there.

00:04:29.334 --> 00:04:31.467
And third, we now believe
that real enterprise apps

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:32.801
can be built
on App Engine.

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:35.767
In a little time,
using Standard Java,

00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:37.267
we were able to build
a customer app

00:04:37.267 --> 00:04:38.467
and get it out there.

00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:40.267
So I appreciate the time.

00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:42.200
Thanks very much.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.133
[applause]
Back to you, Kevin.
