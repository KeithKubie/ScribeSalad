[LIGHT TECHNO MUSIC]

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And here we
are in the Code Labs area.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.220
This is a special part
of Google I/O where

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.010
if you've always wanted to learn
a new API, or tool, or service,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.880
you get to come here and
work on the Code Lab.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.470
And if you have any issues or
you want to get in more depth,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.920
you can ask a Googler
for their help.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.292
Any question you happen to have.

00:00:30.292 --> 00:00:31.750
I'd like to learn
a little bit more

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.670
about what it feels like
to do Code Lab here at I/O,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.189
and to do that, Claire.

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:37.064
CLAIRE: Hey, Timothy.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How you doing?

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.900
CLAIRE: I'm great.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.360
It's been a long couple of
days but a fun couple of days.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.401
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I hope
that means a lot of people

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.470
learning a lot of things.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.636
CLAIRE: Oh, most definitely.

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:48.985
We've had lines waiting
pretty much the entire day.

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:50.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's very cool.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.220
So what's the setup like here?

00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:54.790
CLAIRE: The set
up here is a bunch

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.300
of computers that are all
preconfigured with the steps

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.400
to do--

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.464
learn pretty much
whatever you want.

00:01:00.464 --> 00:01:02.880
You can tell what's going on
by the status of these lights

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.510
up here.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.790
If they're green, it
means the computer

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.020
is ready to go, ready for
you to come up and learn.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.700
If they're blue it means
Code Labs in progress.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.767
And when they turn red,
it means that someone

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.850
needs a little bit of help,
or has got a question,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.730
and one of our staff
will zip over right away

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.990
and help them out with that.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.490
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's totally cool.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.790
Now this is a special Code
Lab station that actually

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.998
has a whole bunch of devices.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:22.970
What's going on there?

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.845
CLAIRE: That's right.

00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:26.480
So right now we're in our
special IoT Code Labs section.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.540
We've got a couple
different devices over here

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.817
that people can run a bunch of
various of our Code Labs on.

00:01:31.817 --> 00:01:34.150
And they'll actually get to
interact and play with them.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.358
This one's got some buttons,
and lights, and numbers.

00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:39.130
It's got a button that's very
fun-- very fun to play with.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.027
It's a good time

00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:41.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
right, is there anything

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.318
else you want to
say about the day?

00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:45.070
How's it been going?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.910
CLAIRE: Really good.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.510
We've had a lot of people with
very insightful questions,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.302
a lot of people showing
a lot of enthusiasm

00:01:50.302 --> 00:01:52.426
for the subjects, which is
always my favorite thing

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:53.070
to see.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.861
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome,
thank you so much.

00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:56.130
CLAIRE: Thanks, Timothy.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.770
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
that's the Code Labs area.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.800
Thanks so much for joining me.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.120
Remember, I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.570
And if you'd like to catch some
more of these videos after I/O,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.430
