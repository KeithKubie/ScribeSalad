00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.440
scruffy kids and pagans and energies to
actually set this off and i think that's

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450
actually set this off and i think that's
 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.909
actually set this off and i think that's
a little bit partly coming out of this

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919
a little bit partly coming out of this
 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.550
a little bit partly coming out of this
fact that took an obama victory and

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560
fact that took an obama victory and
 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.529
fact that took an obama victory and
subsequent lack of any real policy

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539
subsequent lack of any real policy
 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.560
subsequent lack of any real policy
change so there's that but there's also

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570
change so there's that but there's also
 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.600
change so there's that but there's also
the tactical diffusion that

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610
the tactical diffusion that
 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.800
the tactical diffusion that
up and through these networks of

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810
up and through these networks of
 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.890
up and through these networks of
activists both in New York that then had

and that this tactic of the General

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849
and that this tactic of the General
 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.879
and that this tactic of the General
Assembly got diffused and developed

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889
Assembly got diffused and developed
 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.920
Assembly got diffused and developed
through these like international links

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930
through these like international links
 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.749
through these like international links
and that's something that you know it

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759
and that's something that you know it
 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.520
and that's something that you know it
got tried here and it took off and it

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530
got tried here and it took off and it
 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.839
got tried here and it took off and it
but it took a while for it to get

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849
but it took a while for it to get
 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.420
but it took a while for it to get
developed abroad and then to get to get

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430
developed abroad and then to get to get
 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.540
developed abroad and then to get to get
imported here okay so that's my point

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550
imported here okay so that's my point
 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.029
imported here okay so that's my point

know of I think a variety of evidence I

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930
know of I think a variety of evidence I
 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.179
know of I think a variety of evidence I
know I don't know anybody who thinks

percent of income is pretty much driven
 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.420
percent of income is pretty much driven
by the financial sector and in fact

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430
by the financial sector and in fact
 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.100
by the financial sector and in fact
there's this lovely graph that you can

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110
there's this lovely graph that you can
 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.749
there's this lovely graph that you can
show about the index of financial

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759
show about the index of financial
 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.689

into finance and it pretty much you know

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860
into finance and it pretty much you know
 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.439
into finance and it pretty much you know
could tracks fairly well in the time

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449
could tracks fairly well in the time
 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.589
could tracks fairly well in the time
series and it's important to realize

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599
series and it's important to realize
 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.450
series and it's important to realize
that finance is particularly funny right

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460
that finance is particularly funny right
 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.129
that finance is particularly funny right
it's a it's a claim on a future

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139
it's a it's a claim on a future
 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.559
it's a it's a claim on a future
uncertain economy and it's you know we

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569
uncertain economy and it's you know we
 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.119
uncertain economy and it's you know we
would call these things commodities and

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129
would call these things commodities and
 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.920
would call these things commodities and
then we buy and sell them but they're

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930
then we buy and sell them but they're
 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.600
then we buy and sell them but they're
really figments of our institutions and

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610
really figments of our institutions and
 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.930
really figments of our institutions and
laws and in 2008 we sort of realized in

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940
laws and in 2008 we sort of realized in
 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.430
laws and in 2008 we sort of realized in
the middle of this financial crisis that

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440
the middle of this financial crisis that
 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.719
the middle of this financial crisis that
actually all of this is up for grabs

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729
actually all of this is up for grabs
 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.779
actually all of this is up for grabs
that all of this can be renegotiated and

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789
that all of this can be renegotiated and
 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.939
that all of this can be renegotiated and
it's actually brute political power that

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949
it's actually brute political power that
 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.040
it's actually brute political power that
decides whose balance sheets get bailed

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050
decides whose balance sheets get bailed
 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.600
decides whose balance sheets get bailed
out and whose balance sheets don't get

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610
out and whose balance sheets don't get
 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.869
out and whose balance sheets don't get
bailed out and so and you know and so

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879
bailed out and so and you know and so
 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.959
bailed out and so and you know and so
there's a so then we also then sort of

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969
there's a so then we also then sort of
 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.179
there's a so then we also then sort of
see who's got the power to renegotiate

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:56.189
see who's got the power to renegotiate
 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.920
see who's got the power to renegotiate
these financial crisis and renegotiate

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930
these financial crisis and renegotiate
 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.170
these financial crisis and renegotiate
the nature of financial property and you

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180
the nature of financial property and you
 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.459
the nature of financial property and you
know there's a hint it's not homeowners

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469
know there's a hint it's not homeowners
 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.110
know there's a hint it's not homeowners
and then further in finance when we

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120
and then further in finance when we
 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.459
and then further in finance when we
think about the kinds of policies that

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469
think about the kinds of policies that
 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.920
think about the kinds of policies that
are effectively insulated from citizens

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930
are effectively insulated from citizens
 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.140
are effectively insulated from citizens
it's really monetary policy its

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150
it's really monetary policy its
 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.809
it's really monetary policy its
financial regulation and it's

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819
financial regulation and it's
 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.670
financial regulation and it's
redistribute of policy more generally so

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680
redistribute of policy more generally so
 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.439
redistribute of policy more generally so
I think there's a overwhelming a very of

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449
I think there's a overwhelming a very of
 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.040
I think there's a overwhelming a very of
evidence from political economy and that

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050
evidence from political economy and that
 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.980
evidence from political economy and that
suggests that yes the Fed is distinctly

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990
suggests that yes the Fed is distinctly
 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.379
suggests that yes the Fed is distinctly
biased towards the banking industry that

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389
biased towards the banking industry that
 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.179
biased towards the banking industry that
yes the financial industry has been very

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:29.189
yes the financial industry has been very
 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:30.499
yes the financial industry has been very
effective at capturing financial

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509
effective at capturing financial
 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.689
effective at capturing financial
regulation and that yes generically the

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699
regulation and that yes generically the
 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.459
regulation and that yes generically the
interest of politicians tends to report

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469
interest of politicians tends to report
 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:35.839
interest of politicians tends to report
respond to that of the richer

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849
respond to that of the richer
 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:37.420
respond to that of the richer
constituents

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430
constituents
 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.830
constituents
okay so when you've got this sort of

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840
okay so when you've got this sort of
 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.990
okay so when you've got this sort of
realm of policy that's roughly that's

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000
realm of policy that's roughly that's
 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.390
realm of policy that's roughly that's
pretty insulated from from citizen

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400
pretty insulated from from citizen
 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.790
pretty insulated from from citizen
control well then that starts that lets

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800
control well then that starts that lets
 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.499
control well then that starts that lets
us think about Occupy Wall Street is

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509
us think about Occupy Wall Street is
 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.420
us think about Occupy Wall Street is
like a democratization movement so it's

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430
like a democratization movement so it's
 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.490
like a democratization movement so it's
about bringing these sort of realms of

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500
about bringing these sort of realms of
 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.159
about bringing these sort of realms of
policy that are not in the realm that

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169
policy that are not in the realm that
 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.080
policy that are not in the realm that
are sort of generally insulated from

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090
are sort of generally insulated from
 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.200
are sort of generally insulated from
from popular control into the realm of

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210
from popular control into the realm of
 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.550
from popular control into the realm of
okay let's put them on the table as

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560
okay let's put them on the table as
 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.920
okay let's put them on the table as
something that we can that we can talk

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930
something that we can that we can talk
 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.350
something that we can that we can talk
about and because they're not on the

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360
about and because they're not on the
 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.029
about and because they're not on the
table in the formal political system it

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039
table in the formal political system it
 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:09.559
table in the formal political system it
takes Street politics to put them on the

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:09.569
takes Street politics to put them on the
 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.529
takes Street politics to put them on the
table and but Street politics is is is

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539
table and but Street politics is is is
 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.939
table and but Street politics is is is
unpredictable and volatile and you can

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:16.949
unpredictable and volatile and you can
 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:18.649
unpredictable and volatile and you can
only ever mobilize people for very short

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:18.659
only ever mobilize people for very short
 

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:22.640
only ever mobilize people for very short
periods of time and so you know we have

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650
periods of time and so you know we have
 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.990
periods of time and so you know we have
this literature and formal political

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000
this literature and formal political
 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.149
this literature and formal political
economy on how democratization movements

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:26.159
economy on how democratization movements
 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:27.890
economy on how democratization movements
look and they generally temporarily

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900
look and they generally temporarily
 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.350
look and they generally temporarily
mobilize and then the government can

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360
mobilize and then the government can
 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.689
mobilize and then the government can
respond either by repressing them as in

respond either by repressing them as in
 

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:35.540

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.430
few policy fixes or by democratizing and
 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.820
few policy fixes or by democratizing and
the difference between a reform and a

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:40.830
the difference between a reform and a
 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.890
the difference between a reform and a
democratization is that a reform can be

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900
democratization is that a reform can be
 

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.070
democratization is that a reform can be
reversed later on so that you can get

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080
reversed later on so that you can get
 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.499
reversed later on so that you can get
something today but the but it can be

00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:48.509
something today but the but it can be
 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:50.570
something today but the but it can be
reversed tomorrow and the thing that's

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580
reversed tomorrow and the thing that's
 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.159
reversed tomorrow and the thing that's
different about a democratization is

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:52.169
different about a democratization is
 

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:53.719
different about a democratization is
that when you win it you don't just

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729
that when you win it you don't just
 

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:55.610
that when you win it you don't just
change the policy today you change your

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620
change the policy today you change your
 

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.529
change the policy today you change your
ability to change policies tomorrow and

00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539
ability to change policies tomorrow and
 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:07:59.300
ability to change policies tomorrow and
so that's what makes democratization

00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.310
so that's what makes democratization
 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.439
so that's what makes democratization
kind of the big stakes from from this

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:03.449
kind of the big stakes from from this
 

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:05.659
kind of the big stakes from from this
kinds of from this kind of mobilization

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:05.669
kinds of from this kind of mobilization
 

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:08.689
kinds of from this kind of mobilization
and so this explains I think a little

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:08.699
and so this explains I think a little
 

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:10.100
and so this explains I think a little
bit of the splits inside Occupy Wall

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.110
bit of the splits inside Occupy Wall
 

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.510
bit of the splits inside Occupy Wall

wild-eyed kids that are like no we're
 

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.779
wild-eyed kids that are like no we're
going to hold it and keep holding it and

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:23.789
going to hold it and keep holding it and
 

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:25.999
going to hold it and keep holding it and
nothing's going to make us leave and the

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:26.009
nothing's going to make us leave and the
 

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:27.830
nothing's going to make us leave and the
idea there is that this is in fact not

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840
idea there is that this is in fact not
 

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.019
idea there is that this is in fact not
just about any particular policy it's

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:30.029
just about any particular policy it's
 

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:32.300
just about any particular policy it's
about building a poll for lots of

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.310
about building a poll for lots of
 

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.670
about building a poll for lots of
different policies and that maybe this

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680
different policies and that maybe this
 

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.639
different policies and that maybe this
could be sort of an ideological place

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:37.649
could be sort of an ideological place
 

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:40.699
could be sort of an ideological place
and a physical place to actually act as

00:08:40.699 --> 00:08:40.709
and a physical place to actually act as
 

00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:43.219
and a physical place to actually act as
an amplifier for not just any particular

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:43.229
an amplifier for not just any particular
 

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:45.230
an amplifier for not just any particular
policies but for a bunch of popular

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240
policies but for a bunch of popular
 

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.060
policies but for a bunch of popular
economic struggles from the south

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:47.070
economic struggles from the south
 

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.350
economic struggles from the south

one of the things that I think the
 

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:07.370
one of the things that I think the
people that are in the that see this as

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:07.380
people that are in the that see this as
 

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.960
people that are in the that see this as
a democratization thing is like well

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:08.970
a democratization thing is like well
 

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.310
a democratization thing is like well
what we need to do is actually build

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320
what we need to do is actually build
 

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.710
what we need to do is actually build
this to be much more political power and

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720
this to be much more political power and
 

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.449
this to be much more political power and

distress fights and and then over the
 

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.949
distress fights and and then over the
long haul we'll be able to ask for like

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959
long haul we'll be able to ask for like

other thing that's kind of interesting

00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459
other thing that's kind of interesting
 

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:37.009
other thing that's kind of interesting
about this is also the very organization

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019

sees that that this is kind of the basic
structure of self-governance that

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:48.750
structure of self-governance that
 

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.840

a political mobilization like this and

a political mobilization like this and
then what I think the though you know

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140
then what I think the though you know
 

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.790
then what I think the though you know
the the wild-eyed kids sort of like

about that is that it's that this is
actually suggests some putting even more

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540
actually suggests some putting even more
 

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.569
actually suggests some putting even more
of the basic structure of the American

political economy on the table so it's

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:28.769
political economy on the table so it's
 

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:30.439
political economy on the table so it's
like how do you make decisions why do

00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:30.449
like how do you make decisions why do
 

00:10:30.449 --> 00:10:32.449
like how do you make decisions why do
you have representatives who gets to

00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459
you have representatives who gets to

who gets to speak for who and all of
that stuff becomes up for grabs and so

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:38.850
that stuff becomes up for grabs and so
 

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.550
that stuff becomes up for grabs and so
we renegotiate it all and we

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560
we renegotiate it all and we
 

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.230
we renegotiate it all and we
renegotiated all day every day and you

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240
renegotiated all day every day and you
 

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.090

know it kind of drives men mad but it's

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100
know it kind of drives men mad but it's
 

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.210
know it kind of drives men mad but it's
a but it's kind of like exactly how you

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220
a but it's kind of like exactly how you
 

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.160
a but it's kind of like exactly how you
take a bunch of diverse interests and

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.170
take a bunch of diverse interests and
 

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.680
take a bunch of diverse interests and
turn them into a general well as we're

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:54.690
turn them into a general well as we're
 

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.980
turn them into a general well as we're
sort of rethinking all of that and then

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:57.990
sort of rethinking all of that and then
 

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.620
sort of rethinking all of that and then
also economically it's that the way in

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:00.630
also economically it's that the way in
 

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.650

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:16.930
this idea that if you build a
 

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.140
this idea that if you build a
constitution for people that you think

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.150
constitution for people that you think
 

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.380
constitution for people that you think
of as mean-spirited and selfish that hey

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:22.390
of as mean-spirited and selfish that hey
 

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.120
of as mean-spirited and selfish that hey
they'll become mean-spirited and selfish

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.130
they'll become mean-spirited and selfish
 

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.980
they'll become mean-spirited and selfish
but if you actually design a little

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:25.990
but if you actually design a little
 

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.960
but if you actually design a little
space that you're expecting people to

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:27.970
space that you're expecting people to
 

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.880
space that you're expecting people to
enter into on the basis of reciprocity

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:29.890
enter into on the basis of reciprocity
 

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.180
enter into on the basis of reciprocity
and and frame it that way then in fact

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.190
and and frame it that way then in fact
 

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.440
and and frame it that way then in fact
you'll get a whole lot of people that

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:34.450
you'll get a whole lot of people that
 

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.730
you'll get a whole lot of people that
are quite willing to approach this as

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:35.740
are quite willing to approach this as
 

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.440
are quite willing to approach this as
like not a place where they're out to

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:37.450
like not a place where they're out to
 

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.420
like not a place where they're out to
maximize their self-interest but rather

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:39.430
maximize their self-interest but rather
 

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.530
maximize their self-interest but rather
a place where they're sort of working

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:40.540
a place where they're sort of working
 

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.390
a place where they're sort of working
for some common end and what's

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:42.400
for some common end and what's
 

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.620
for some common end and what's
interesting about this is that it's

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:43.630
interesting about this is that it's
 

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.450
interesting about this is that it's
working despite the fact that the

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:45.460
working despite the fact that the
 

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.090
working despite the fact that the
population is constantly in flux so

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.100
population is constantly in flux so
 

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.650
population is constantly in flux so
people come in and go out and it's

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:49.660
people come in and go out and it's
 

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.720
people come in and go out and it's
always the same different phases so it's

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:51.730
always the same different phases so it's
 

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:52.950
always the same different phases so it's
not just kind of the enlightened

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:52.960
not just kind of the enlightened
 

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.330
not just kind of the enlightened
self-interest of the small community

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:54.340
self-interest of the small community
 

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.040
self-interest of the small community
that's staying like in permanent

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.050
that's staying like in permanent
 

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.750
that's staying like in permanent
relation it's in fact that when you

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760
relation it's in fact that when you
 

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.280
relation it's in fact that when you
enter the space you're sort of taking on

00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.290
enter the space you're sort of taking on
 

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.440
enter the space you're sort of taking on
a whole different way of relating to an

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:01.450
a whole different way of relating to an
 

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.350
a whole different way of relating to an
economy and I think David Graeber is in

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360
economy and I think David Graeber is in
 

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.210
economy and I think David Graeber is in
multiple ways kind of talking about this

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:06.220
multiple ways kind of talking about this
 

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.640
multiple ways kind of talking about this
in the right in sort of the the right

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:08.650
in the right in sort of the the right
 

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.170
in the right in sort of the the right
frame that in fact there's a whole

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:10.180
frame that in fact there's a whole
 

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.880
frame that in fact there's a whole
diversity of economic structures that

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:11.890
diversity of economic structures that
 

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.040
diversity of economic structures that
are happening in the park and you know

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.050
are happening in the park and you know
 

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.450
are happening in the park and you know
and that tells you that the economy

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:15.460
and that tells you that the economy
 

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.460
and that tells you that the economy
isn't a monolith that's in fact there's

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:17.470
isn't a monolith that's in fact there's
 

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.600
isn't a monolith that's in fact there's
well there's lots of different things

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:18.610
well there's lots of different things
 

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.770
well there's lots of different things
you could do okay so what next so I'm an

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:22.780
you could do okay so what next so I'm an
 

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.930
you could do okay so what next so I'm an
economic historian and I generally think

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:24.940
economic historian and I generally think
 

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.390
economic historian and I generally think
you only see the clear picture kind of

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:27.400
you only see the clear picture kind of
 

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.610
you only see the clear picture kind of
long after the dust is settled so it's

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:29.620
long after the dust is settled so it's
 

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.270
long after the dust is settled so it's
really difficult to make sort of i think

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:32.280
really difficult to make sort of i think
 

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.560
really difficult to make sort of i think
really well informed judgments in them

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:34.570
really well informed judgments in them
 

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.960
really well informed judgments in them
in the middle of it so i'm going to hold

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:36.970
in the middle of it so i'm going to hold
 

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.480
in the middle of it so i'm going to hold
off on sort of the what next as a sort

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:39.490
off on sort of the what next as a sort
 

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.300
off on sort of the what next as a sort
of an economist but as a participant i'm

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:42.310
of an economist but as a participant i'm
 

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.340
of an economist but as a participant i'm
thinking that the goals are you know

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:44.350
thinking that the goals are you know
 

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.680
thinking that the goals are you know
hold the park through the winter hold it

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:46.690
hold the park through the winter hold it
 

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.890
hold the park through the winter hold it
through the next election cycle and hold

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:49.900
through the next election cycle and hold
 

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.660
through the next election cycle and hold
it in particularly in the face of all

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:51.670
it in particularly in the face of all
 

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.490
it in particularly in the face of all
the infiltration and all the repression

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:53.500
the infiltration and all the repression
 

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.770
the infiltration and all the repression
and particularly all the demoralization

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:54.780
and particularly all the demoralization
 

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.820
and particularly all the demoralization
so you have to just see it's like

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:56.830
so you have to just see it's like
 

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.050
so you have to just see it's like
there's a lot of people that are like

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:58.060
there's a lot of people that are like
 

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.930
there's a lot of people that are like
one more day and I'm out and so it's an

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:00.940
one more day and I'm out and so it's an
 

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.370
one more day and I'm out and so it's an
incredibly stressful environment and

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:02.380
incredibly stressful environment and
 

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.100
incredibly stressful environment and
there's just a you know it wears on

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.110
there's just a you know it wears on
 

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.200
there's just a you know it wears on
people and so keeping up that energy i

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.210
people and so keeping up that energy i
 

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.970
people and so keeping up that energy i
think is actually the the hardest thing

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:10.980
think is actually the the hardest thing
 

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.890
think is actually the the hardest thing
but then if you can hold it and it's way

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:13.900
but then if you can hold it and it's way
 

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.449
but then if you can hold it and it's way
too early to tell

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:15.459
too early to tell
 

00:13:15.459 --> 00:13:17.970
too early to tell
um if you can hold it it'll wind up

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:17.980
um if you can hold it it'll wind up
 

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.220
um if you can hold it it'll wind up
looking like a pretty important set of

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:20.230
looking like a pretty important set of
 

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.689
looking like a pretty important set of
alternatives when all the things that

00:13:21.689 --> 00:13:21.699
alternatives when all the things that
 

00:13:21.699 --> 00:13:23.699
alternatives when all the things that
that it's attached onto and all the

00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:23.709
that it's attached onto and all the
 

00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:27.179
that it's attached onto and all the
energy it's it's created and it'll wind

00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:27.189
energy it's it's created and it'll wind
 

00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:30.030
energy it's it's created and it'll wind
up sort of you know look whatever

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040
up sort of you know look whatever
 

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.280
up sort of you know look whatever
remains will be pretty pretty solid and

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:32.290
remains will be pretty pretty solid and
 

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.199
remains will be pretty pretty solid and
then I think we can start to talk about

00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:34.209
then I think we can start to talk about
 

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:36.030
then I think we can start to talk about
real impacts so right now I think it's

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.040
real impacts so right now I think it's
 

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.429
real impacts so right now I think it's
still too early but give it a year let's

00:13:38.429 --> 00:13:38.439
still too early but give it a year let's
 

00:13:38.439 --> 00:13:40.710
still too early but give it a year let's
see what happens and then then maybe we

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720
see what happens and then then maybe we
 

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.919
see what happens and then then maybe we
can we can actually see we see if this

00:13:43.919 --> 00:13:43.929
can we can actually see we see if this
 

00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:48.540
can we can actually see we see if this
has legs thank you well thank you very

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:48.550
has legs thank you well thank you very
 

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.150
has legs thank you well thank you very
much because you refresh my mind on many

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160
much because you refresh my mind on many
 

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.699
much because you refresh my mind on many
issues concerning what they teach

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:53.709
issues concerning what they teach
 

00:13:53.709 --> 00:13:56.460
issues concerning what they teach
generally but here is a kind of teaching

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:56.470
generally but here is a kind of teaching
 

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:01.859
generally but here is a kind of teaching
in the making now I would say that this

00:14:01.859 --> 00:14:01.869
in the making now I would say that this
 

00:14:01.869 --> 00:14:06.329
in the making now I would say that this
movement seems to me a a movement that

00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:06.339
movement seems to me a a movement that
 

00:14:06.339 --> 00:14:07.949
movement seems to me a a movement that
wants to reclaim representation

00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:07.959
wants to reclaim representation
 

00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:12.269
wants to reclaim representation
representation in in a very complex way

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279
representation in in a very complex way
 

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:15.239
representation in in a very complex way
perhaps because on the one hand it is a

00:14:15.239 --> 00:14:15.249
perhaps because on the one hand it is a
 

00:14:15.249 --> 00:14:18.090
perhaps because on the one hand it is a

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:18.100
is true that his headless movements
 

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.280
is true that his headless movements
doesn't have a leader doesn't have a

doesn't have a leader doesn't have a
 

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.039
doesn't have a leader doesn't have a
kind of party organization that is able

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:23.049
kind of party organization that is able
 

00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:26.309
kind of party organization that is able
to present claim somewhere within the

institution or to whom within the

institution but it is a movement that
 

00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:34.289

realize a lot about what's happened

00:14:34.289 --> 00:14:34.299
realize a lot about what's happened

because of the contestation character so
 

00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:40.769
because of the contestation character so
there is a kind of demonstrations

there is a kind of demonstrations
 

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:42.359
there is a kind of demonstrations
against that those who are inside the

legitimacy in some sense and also
 

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.609
legitimacy in some sense and also
because it is an appeal to principles

00:15:02.609 --> 00:15:02.619
because it is an appeal to principles
 

00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:05.249
because it is an appeal to principles
that are common to those who are inside

relation to this famous one percent
which is very interesting because

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:37.180
which is very interesting because

them because they don't need to defend

is an interesting example of fight

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:06.650
is an interesting example of fight
 

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.160
is an interesting example of fight
inside or democratic institutions

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:08.170
inside or democratic institutions
 

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.360

never disappears in democracy is always
there and reappears regularly in moments

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160
there and reappears regularly in moments
 

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.990
there and reappears regularly in moments
of great disadvantage disadvantaged by

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000
of great disadvantage disadvantaged by
 

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.600
of great disadvantage disadvantaged by
those who are in the many and they can

those who are in the many and they can

be they become poor as I saw things to
 

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.310
be they become poor as I saw things to
say so in these moments they are very

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:27.320
say so in these moments they are very
 

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.040
say so in these moments they are very
dangerous for the one person few so

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.050
dangerous for the one person few so
 

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.270
dangerous for the one person few so
equality becomes a very radical form a

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:33.280
equality becomes a very radical form a
 

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.210
equality becomes a very radical form a
topic now is we used to talk about the

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:37.220
topic now is we used to talk about the
 

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.460
topic now is we used to talk about the
quality frequently all the time but now

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:39.470
quality frequently all the time but now
 

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.160
quality frequently all the time but now
the call for equality acquires a

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:42.170
the call for equality acquires a
 

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.400
the call for equality acquires a
different kind of meaning precisely

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:45.410
different kind of meaning precisely
 

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.580
different kind of meaning precisely
because it is targeted against those who

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:48.590
because it is targeted against those who
 

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.510
because it is targeted against those who
are always able to claim equality but

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:52.520
are always able to claim equality but
 

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.000
are always able to claim equality but
now they really don't want to share in

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.010
now they really don't want to share in
 

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.990
now they really don't want to share in
the fact of equality so it is a kind of

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000
the fact of equality so it is a kind of
 

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.400
the fact of equality so it is a kind of
reconsideration of the foundations and

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:00.410
reconsideration of the foundations and
 

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.110
reconsideration of the foundations and
those who are in and those who are out

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120
those who are in and those who are out
 

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.000
those who are in and those who are out
of the pack of equality is very

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.010
of the pack of equality is very
 

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:08.770
of the pack of equality is very
interesting and another issue that this

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:08.780
interesting and another issue that this
 

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.920
interesting and another issue that this
brings me to the question of

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:11.930
brings me to the question of
 

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.640
brings me to the question of
contagiousness movements are contagious

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:14.650
contagiousness movements are contagious
 

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.980
contagiousness movements are contagious
movements are not simply one drop in the

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:17.990
movements are not simply one drop in the
 

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.010
movements are not simply one drop in the
water it's one drop that creates circles

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:21.020
water it's one drop that creates circles
 

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.550
water it's one drop that creates circles
that creates waves so these movements is

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:24.560
that creates waves so these movements is
 

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.460
that creates waves so these movements is
a long time as a long history according

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:27.470
a long time as a long history according
 

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.070
a long time as a long history according
to me doesn't it didn't start one month

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080
to me doesn't it didn't start one month
 

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.540
to me doesn't it didn't start one month
ago or so it started in many different

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:33.550
ago or so it started in many different
 

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.919
ago or so it started in many different
meetings of the ga

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:35.929
meetings of the ga
 

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:39.070
meetings of the ga
to g7 in the past years and then it

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080
to g7 in the past years and then it
 

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.389
to g7 in the past years and then it
became very important with the Greek

00:17:43.389 --> 00:17:43.399
became very important with the Greek
 

00:17:43.399 --> 00:17:46.090
became very important with the Greek
with the Greek movement of december two

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:46.100
with the Greek movement of december two
 

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.489
with the Greek movement of december two
thousand eight and which was in the same

00:17:48.489 --> 00:17:48.499
thousand eight and which was in the same
 

00:17:48.499 --> 00:17:51.070
thousand eight and which was in the same
year of the election of Obama so okay

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080
year of the election of Obama so okay
 

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.409
year of the election of Obama so okay
again a great interesting movement of

00:17:53.409 --> 00:17:53.419
again a great interesting movement of
 

00:17:53.419 --> 00:17:55.299
again a great interesting movement of
democratization which was completely

00:17:55.299 --> 00:17:55.309
democratization which was completely
 

00:17:55.309 --> 00:17:56.919
democratization which was completely
different from the kind of

00:17:56.919 --> 00:17:56.929
different from the kind of
 

00:17:56.929 --> 00:17:58.509
different from the kind of
democratization movement inside of

00:17:58.509 --> 00:17:58.519
democratization movement inside of
 

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:00.879
democratization movement inside of
parties so it was a kind of self

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:00.889
parties so it was a kind of self
 

00:18:00.889 --> 00:18:03.489
parties so it was a kind of self
promoted movements and and said glowing

00:18:03.489 --> 00:18:03.499
promoted movements and and said glowing
 

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:05.470
promoted movements and and said glowing
movement and some in some sense and

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480
movement and some in some sense and
 

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.730
movement and some in some sense and
finally they the spring the Arab Spring

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:09.740
finally they the spring the Arab Spring
 

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.970
finally they the spring the Arab Spring
at the beginning of this year and so on

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:12.980
at the beginning of this year and so on
 

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.830
at the beginning of this year and so on
so forth so there is a sense of

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:14.840
so forth so there is a sense of
 

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.409
so forth so there is a sense of
contagiousness but because the topic is

00:18:17.409 --> 00:18:17.419
contagiousness but because the topic is
 

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:19.960
contagiousness but because the topic is
the same of course the topic is not the

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:19.970
the same of course the topic is not the
 

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.509
the same of course the topic is not the
same in North Africa as it is here but

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:22.519
same in North Africa as it is here but
 

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:26.519
same in North Africa as it is here but
is a call for in any case or against

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:26.529
is a call for in any case or against
 

00:18:26.529 --> 00:18:29.200
is a call for in any case or against
despotic dominations in one form or

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:29.210
despotic dominations in one form or
 

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.080
despotic dominations in one form or
another one so it has the characteristic

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.090
another one so it has the characteristic
 

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.480
another one so it has the characteristic
of a protest movement wherever it is and

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:34.490
of a protest movement wherever it is and
 

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.850
of a protest movement wherever it is and
it has the characteristic of a call for

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:36.860
it has the characteristic of a call for
 

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.810
it has the characteristic of a call for
and democratic principles sir but i

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:40.820
and democratic principles sir but i
 

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.909
and democratic principles sir but i
would say that in comparison of

00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:42.919
would say that in comparison of
 

00:18:42.919 --> 00:18:44.859
would say that in comparison of
paradoxically and i'm very pessimistic

00:18:44.859 --> 00:18:44.869
paradoxically and i'm very pessimistic
 

00:18:44.869 --> 00:18:48.489
paradoxically and i'm very pessimistic
more than you perhaps because I'm I

00:18:48.489 --> 00:18:48.499
more than you perhaps because I'm I
 

00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:50.080
more than you perhaps because I'm I
don't know I like Machiavelli more than

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:50.090
don't know I like Machiavelli more than
 

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:56.669
don't know I like Machiavelli more than
you so I think that paradoxically and

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:56.679
you so I think that paradoxically and
 

00:18:56.679 --> 00:19:01.840
you so I think that paradoxically and
this movement is in a war shape that the

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:01.850
this movement is in a war shape that the
 

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.299
this movement is in a war shape that the
movements in the growing or developing

00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:04.309
movements in the growing or developing
 

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:07.480
movements in the growing or developing
or democratic movements in in the North

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:07.490
or democratic movements in in the North

important fact that needs to be and this
is the

it is a battle for a different
 

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.749
it is a battle for a different
conceptions of how we should put money

conceptions of how we should put money
in the public or what should we do with

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700
in the public or what should we do with
 

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.970
in the public or what should we do with
our money in government losing this

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.269
our money in government losing this
battle it's a well it's very very

00:20:14.269 --> 00:20:14.279
battle it's a well it's very very
 

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:18.560
battle it's a well it's very very
terrible for the possibility for a

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:18.570
terrible for the possibility for a
 

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.450
terrible for the possibility for a
democracy not to become more immoral

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460
democracy not to become more immoral
 

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.049
democracy not to become more immoral
lurking so the question does it's very

00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059
lurking so the question does it's very
 

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:27.440
lurking so the question does it's very
according to me it's very challenging

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:27.450
according to me it's very challenging
 

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:32.619
according to me it's very challenging
and and so this brings me to

00:20:32.619 --> 00:20:32.629
and and so this brings me to
 

00:20:32.629 --> 00:20:35.450
and and so this brings me to
representation again so this movement

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460
representation again so this movement
 

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.220
representation again so this movement
was an attempt to edit is an attempt to

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:39.230
was an attempt to edit is an attempt to
 

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.739
was an attempt to edit is an attempt to
shake the institutions and show them

00:20:42.739 --> 00:20:42.749
shake the institutions and show them
 

00:20:42.749 --> 00:20:46.460
shake the institutions and show them
that there is citizenship outside of

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:46.470
that there is citizenship outside of
 

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.480
that there is citizenship outside of
them and this citizenship is not a an

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:50.490
them and this citizenship is not a an
 

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:53.989
them and this citizenship is not a an
enemy but it is the other face of the

00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:53.999
enemy but it is the other face of the
 

00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:56.899
enemy but it is the other face of the
calling of representation so when there

00:20:56.899 --> 00:20:56.909
calling of representation so when there
 

00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:59.019
calling of representation so when there
is a break of correlation or

00:20:59.019 --> 00:20:59.029
is a break of correlation or
 

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:02.629
is a break of correlation or
communication between the two this is a

00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:02.639
communication between the two this is a
 

00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:06.109
communication between the two this is a
grave risk for democracy to decline in

00:21:06.109 --> 00:21:06.119
grave risk for democracy to decline in
 

00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:08.810
grave risk for democracy to decline in
one way or another way so it is an

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820
one way or another way so it is an
 

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.999
one way or another way so it is an
attempt to ask for attention this

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:11.009
attempt to ask for attention this
 

00:21:11.009 --> 00:21:15.200
attempt to ask for attention this
movement calls for an attention it was

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.210
movement calls for an attention it was
 

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.539
movement calls for an attention it was

the important faculty also was very very
 

00:21:20.999 --> 00:21:25.430
the important faculty also was very very
good in them in writing that is creating

any reason or another correct those who
are in the institution because they

00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159

according to other reasons but doesn't
 

00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:44.090
according to other reasons but doesn't
matter the intentions of the actors it

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100
matter the intentions of the actors it
 

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.590
matter the intentions of the actors it
is important that these climate of

is important that these climate of
 

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.649
is important that these climate of
attention that can shake

00:21:50.649 --> 00:21:50.659
attention that can shake
 

00:21:50.659 --> 00:21:53.589
attention that can shake
institutions is here and so it is a

00:21:53.589 --> 00:21:53.599
institutions is here and so it is a
 

00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:55.419
institutions is here and so it is a
claim to be heard indeed this movement

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:55.429
claim to be heard indeed this movement
 

00:21:55.429 --> 00:21:58.029
claim to be heard indeed this movement
it doesn't want to add unless I think

00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039
it doesn't want to add unless I think
 

00:21:58.039 --> 00:21:59.710
it doesn't want to add unless I think
there is somebody who does know to

00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720
there is somebody who does know to
 

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.249
there is somebody who does know to
present a candidate for right there is a

00:22:03.249 --> 00:22:03.259
present a candidate for right there is a
 

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:06.399
present a candidate for right there is a
candidate from Boston that she is

00:22:06.399 --> 00:22:06.409
candidate from Boston that she is
 

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:09.099
candidate from Boston that she is
preferred yeah yeah so there is an

00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:09.109
preferred yeah yeah so there is an
 

00:22:09.109 --> 00:22:11.430
preferred yeah yeah so there is an
attempt to translate these movement into

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440
attempt to translate these movement into
 

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.690
attempt to translate these movement into
something more stable inside of

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:13.700
something more stable inside of
 

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.460
something more stable inside of
dissolution this is not that because it

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:15.470
dissolution this is not that because it
 

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.320
dissolution this is not that because it
is a way of at least giving voice to

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:19.330
is a way of at least giving voice to
 

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.089
is a way of at least giving voice to
these issues which are important they

00:22:22.089 --> 00:22:22.099
these issues which are important they
 

00:22:22.099 --> 00:22:24.339
these issues which are important they
require important decisions than the

00:22:24.339 --> 00:22:24.349
require important decisions than the
 

00:22:24.349 --> 00:22:26.049
require important decisions than the
required simply mobilization they

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:26.059
required simply mobilization they
 

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:29.200
required simply mobilization they
require decisions and so it is important

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:29.210
require decisions and so it is important
 

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:33.279
require decisions and so it is important
that they find a kind of support inside

00:22:33.279 --> 00:22:33.289
that they find a kind of support inside
 

00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:35.919
that they find a kind of support inside
so it is an attempt and this is general

00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:35.929
so it is an attempt and this is general
 

00:22:35.929 --> 00:22:38.440
so it is an attempt and this is general
I have to say so where is in the

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:38.450
I have to say so where is in the
 

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.899
I have to say so where is in the
movements of North Africa there was not

00:22:40.899 --> 00:22:40.909
movements of North Africa there was not
 

00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:42.669
movements of North Africa there was not
these issues because of course there was

00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679
these issues because of course there was
 

00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:46.029
these issues because of course there was
nobody there inside of institutions they

00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039
nobody there inside of institutions they
 

00:22:46.039 --> 00:22:48.430
nobody there inside of institutions they
simply wanted to overturn the regime and

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440
simply wanted to overturn the regime and
 

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.460
simply wanted to overturn the regime and
created these institutions here the risk

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:51.470
created these institutions here the risk
 

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:55.330
created these institutions here the risk
is to not to be listened to that is the

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:55.340
is to not to be listened to that is the
 

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.879
is to not to be listened to that is the
risk is that okay the newspapers they

00:22:57.879 --> 00:22:57.889
risk is that okay the newspapers they
 

00:22:57.889 --> 00:22:59.799
risk is that okay the newspapers they
tell us about every day about this wall

00:22:59.799 --> 00:22:59.809
tell us about every day about this wall
 

00:22:59.809 --> 00:23:02.219
tell us about every day about this wall
street but resources the strategy of

00:23:02.219 --> 00:23:02.229
street but resources the strategy of
 

00:23:02.229 --> 00:23:06.249
street but resources the strategy of
letting time pass by and people sooner

00:23:06.249 --> 00:23:06.259
letting time pass by and people sooner
 

00:23:06.259 --> 00:23:08.680
letting time pass by and people sooner
or later will get tired and so nothing

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:08.690
or later will get tired and so nothing
 

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.239
or later will get tired and so nothing
will happen so there is the sense of a

00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:12.249
will happen so there is the sense of a
 

00:23:12.249 --> 00:23:15.129
will happen so there is the sense of a
consuming energy sometimes and at the

00:23:15.129 --> 00:23:15.139
consuming energy sometimes and at the
 

00:23:15.139 --> 00:23:18.849
consuming energy sometimes and at the
end that this may hang producing this

00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:18.859
end that this may hang producing this
 

00:23:18.859 --> 00:23:23.310
end that this may hang producing this
effect of having this attention and

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320
 
 

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:28.799
 
prospect that it can have I think so and

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:28.809
prospect that it can have I think so and
 

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:32.519
prospect that it can have I think so and
these are the kind of reflections that I

00:23:32.519 --> 00:23:32.529
these are the kind of reflections that I
 

00:23:32.529 --> 00:23:37.469
these are the kind of reflections that I
would like to share with you and finally

would like to share with you and finally
 

00:23:37.479 --> 00:23:43.180
would like to share with you and finally
finally one um those who participate in

00:44:18.449 --> 00:44:20.449
something that that might deviate a bit
from the discussion but is I think very

00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:20.459
from the discussion but is I think very
 

00:44:20.459 --> 00:44:23.929
from the discussion but is I think very
important for us to think about ah first

00:44:23.929 --> 00:44:23.939
important for us to think about ah first
 

00:44:23.939 --> 00:44:25.160
important for us to think about ah first
of all there is no doubt about the fact

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:25.170
of all there is no doubt about the fact
 

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:26.269
of all there is no doubt about the fact
that we're talking about an

00:44:26.269 --> 00:44:26.279
that we're talking about an
 

00:44:26.279 --> 00:44:29.179
that we're talking about an
international thing we really have to

00:44:29.179 --> 00:44:29.189
international thing we really have to
 

00:44:29.189 --> 00:44:30.890
international thing we really have to
understand it that way which isn't to

understand it that way which isn't to
 

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.739
understand it that way which isn't to
say that we ignore the particulars and

00:44:33.739 --> 00:44:33.749
say that we ignore the particulars and
 

00:44:33.749 --> 00:44:36.739
say that we ignore the particulars and
the specifics and it and I don't know if

takes people figuring it out and so it's
 

00:52:49.079 --> 00:52:50.599
takes people figuring it out and so it's
not sort of this immediate thing that

00:52:50.599 --> 00:52:50.609
not sort of this immediate thing that
 

00:52:50.609 --> 00:52:52.670
not sort of this immediate thing that
