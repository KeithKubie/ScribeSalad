00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:10.290
James called us from
Twitter asks what are some of the most

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.650
exciting astrophysics discoveries we've
made in 2015

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.260
oh well the new Horizons flyby of Pluto
Pluto rock in the whole year Dawn's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.840
Wi-Fi of Ceres and Charles: On September 14, 2015,
there was a gravitational wave that came through earth.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.480
Eugene: So what's a gravitational wave?
Neil: So, Einstein showed that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.420
gravity is not best thought
of as a force the way Newton did, but

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.500
you are good to think of it as a
deformation in the fabric of space and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.570
time. And if there is a disturbance in
that gravity, in that object, in the mass

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.860
of that object, it will send a ripple,
through the fabric of space and time

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.350
moving at the speed of light. And in
order to detect such a ripple you need a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.519
very specially designed telescope. It
uses things like interferometers and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.799
lasers and all manner of
things so that when that wave washes

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.189
over you you can detect a slight change
in the distance between two points, which

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.909
would come about because there's
this, what word did they use Charles?

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.140
It's not a shearing effect, it's a...
there's a word they use for so it.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.630
It's a stretching and shrinking of the fabric
of space, and if you measure the distance

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.130
between two points extremely accurately
you will notice when this wave passes

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.380
across you. Now how accurately? A fraction
the diameter of an atomic nucleus.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.720
That is how accurate you have to be, and
that's why it was 30 years

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.079
technologically in the making to make
that discovery on September 14.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.939
Charles: September 14th is when the 
event occurred and the detection

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.399
happened then but it took months for the
scientists involved with what's called

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.250
the advanced LIGO project to confirm
that indeed it was a gravitational wave

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.069
that resulted from the collision of two
black holes more than one billion

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.799
light-years away from Earth and its
remnant energy through space-time

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.639
rippled through the earth in a fraction
of a second. Neil: Right, oh and it happened

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.959
more than a billion years ago only
just hitting us now. So yes, that happened

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.900
in September so that was good this is
Startalk

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.360
