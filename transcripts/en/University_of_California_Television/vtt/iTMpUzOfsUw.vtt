00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.590
- [Announcer] This UCSD-TV program is
presented by university of California

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.920
television. Like what you learn? Visit our
website or follow us on Facebook and

programs.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.610
- We are the paradoxical ape, bipedal,
naked, large brained,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.200
long the master of fire, tools, and
language.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.740
But still trying to understand ourselves,
aware that death is

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:51.010
inevitable, yet filled with optimism. We
grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge, we

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.080
empathize and deceive. We shape the future
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.810
CARTA brings together experts from diverse
disciplines to exchange insights on who we

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.410
are and how we got here. An exploration
made possible by the generosity

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.670
of humans like you.

00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:23.610
- [Rick Potts] I just have some brief
concluding wrap up comments that I would

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.550
like to make, making some observations.
We've come a long way in this symposium

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.990
across an extraordinary range of time
scales. Probably a greater range of time

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.670
than has been attempted by any CARTA
symposium I would suspect. And I would

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.941
like to, given that we've made
this transition from

00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:56.260
the study of human evolution and
paleoclimate, to the present and

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.250
predictions about the future, I'd like to
take us back to CARTA's mandate to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.860
understanding where we come from. And to
try to provide that my wrap up comments as

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:20.540
a way of framing what we've heard in the
last several talks. I would have five

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.350
observations that arise from the study of
human origins that are worthy to consider

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.380
the context of the human present
and future. I mean, there are many, many

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.151
more observations that could be made but,
the use focusing on

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:41.611
the specific topic of this symposium.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.200
The first is, we examined early on is that
the predecessors they were the adaptations

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.980
of our predecessors. Not just their
physical appearances but also their

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.090
behaviors, their ways of life, evolved in
a earth that was trending in particular

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.880
directions toward drying and cooling but
also in a highly dynamic world. A world of

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.730
dynamic climates, of dynamic landscapes,
changing resources, changes in social

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.440
surroundings and so on. And so many
aspects of the CARTA mission explore

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.230
these areas. Now, that's the first. The
second is that the baseline adaptations of

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:38.300
our species evolved, embedded in
ecosystems. Embedded in the dynamic

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:46.410
environments and climates those ancestors
of ours encountered. The fundamental

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:53.750
charge of paleoanthropology, the study of
human evolution is to understand how human

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.430
qualities, including our capacity for the
diversity of cultural histories that have

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.000
unfolded over the past thousands of years
and are, of course, unfolding now.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.020
That these qualities have emerged in the
natural world, in or by the processes of

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.360
nature. So in other words, the takeaway
message there is that humans are integral

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.140
to life, humans are integral to the
history of life and that is inescapable

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:31.760
and it's inescapable in the anthroposy.
Third, the overarching narrative of human

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:39.760
evolution has significantly changed. It is
a change from a worldview and a story of

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.880
how the human lineage came to supposedly
have control and dominion over some

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.870
primordial ancestral environment, mastery
of that environment. And it has come about

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.340
through scientific studies, particularly
looking at human origins in its

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.090
environmental context to a story of
evolving resilience, adaptability and

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.260
persistent change and the challenges of
survival. With regard to my own research,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.330
I used to see like so many others, Africa,
the place where I do my

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:24.840
a lot of my field research as the cradle
of human kind. A kind of nurturing image.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.370
The caldron of human evolution is the term
I now prefer, reflecting the churning

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:38.400
process that define the line between
survival and extinction in the era of

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.010
human origins. The fourth point follows
from the third one. And that is that the

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:51.500
ways of life of our evolutionary ancestors
and cousins have come and gone. Extinction

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.420
has involved not only the end of gene
pools and lineages, it has also entailed

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:04.120
the demise of ways of life. So for
example, a Homo erectus was certainly an

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:13.460
ancestor of Homo sapiens, the way or ways
of life of Erectus are not longer around.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.040
Out of the minimum of
depending upon whether again this term

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:24.140
lumper or splitter by how you divide up
the fossil record. But out of the minimum

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.620
that most paleoanthropologists recognize
of 18 different homo lineages that had

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.811
significant time depth to them. Only one
lineage, of course our species survives.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.740
All the other ways of life of earlier
hominance have gone extinct, even though

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.741
each species possessed at least some of
the unique distinguishing

00:07:46.741 --> 00:07:48.330
qualities of our species.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.970
Now, I have come across people who have
said, "Yeah. But we are around." And

00:07:52.970 --> 00:08:00.190
that's cool. If anyone sees that as good,
it must involve a very jaded view of

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:05.600
biodiversity including biodiversity in our
own evolutionary tree. The ways of life of

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.860
our ancestors and evolutionary cousins
were sustainable but only for a time, and

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:17.570
they ultimately came to an end. And fifth
and finally, Homo sapiens lives in the

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:24.760
world by altering it. It is our survival
mechanism. Even simple interactions with

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.090
the environment as we look back through
pre-historic time and making up a stone

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:35.880
tool, moving resources around the
environment, managing fire, building

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:43.310
shelters, planting a seed to try to secure
food, all of these basic activities change

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:49.440
the immediate surroundings. And this way
of life essential to all human beings

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.681
today no matter where they
live on earth,

00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:54.871
was so successful that it
spread worldwide.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:01.800
And so now we find ourselves where the
planetary scales of human influence is

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:08.690
unquestionable. We have the rapidity of
change in landscape that may be quite

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.330
different from anything that has ever been
experienced before. In evolutionary

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:19.110
history the planet is packed with people,
and are ways of changing our immediate

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.730
surroundings and also surroundings that
affect people in terms of the atmosphere

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.850
and the ocean. And places affect people
that we have never met and will never

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:36.970
meet. And so this afternoon we have heard
evidence and arguments that are grounds

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:43.040
for pessimism and optimism about the
future. And whether the glass is half full

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:49.870
or half empty, I think that we have before
us say, grand societal project. And that

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:55.630
grand societal project is to be carried
out by the first species that has

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:01.050
awareness of extinction, including it's
own extinction but as also the extinction

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.411
of other forms of life on earth.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:13.410
We are aware of human societies on all
parts of the globe and we are connected to

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:18.960
them. It seems to me that many of the
problems that we have addressed here,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.520
having yet brought up the matter of
whether the scale or the problem can be

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:31.530
matched by the scale of our compassion. We
are a species capable of developing

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:38.310
principles, of living in a purposeful and
meaningful world, and acting according to

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:45.960
those principles and values, depending
upon how much we care. The future will be

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:52.500
a world of our own making, that's who we
are. I'd like to thank my wonderful

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.750
colleagues who have made presentations
today and we are very eager to open up the

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.751
conversation with you all, thank you for
being a terrific audience.

00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:13.011
- [Charles Kennel] This is the moment in
which I act as your master of ceremonies.

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:26.481
We had a tremendous number of responses
to the questions. And I had to exercise

00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:31.660
the chairman's privilege and select a few
that I thought were of general interest,

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.370
and I also tried to make sure that
everybody got

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:40.720
asked a question. And so, I'm first of all
going to ask the person to whom the

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:48.230
question is directed, to come up here and
give the answer from here. So we've got,

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:54.370
surprisingly, an interesting list of
questions. The first one is the simplest

00:11:54.370 --> 00:12:01.230
to ask and maybe one of the more difficult
to answer. And it's for Professor Hublin,

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.881
and it's simply, "Did homo sapiens kill
Neanderthals?"

00:12:07.141 --> 00:12:16.540
- [Prof Hublin] Yeah. That's a simple one
The answer is probably, occasionally. This

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:22.920
being said, there are many ways to take
the land and the resource of other people

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:31.930
than killing individuals. This is a little
bit politically incorrect but we like to

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:40.960
think on hunter or gatherers as equal
pacifist or people living in equilibrium

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:48.870
with other groups and et cetera. But we
know that chimpanzees go to war some time

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:55.430
and modern humans did quite well. So it
would be very surprising than between the

00:12:55.430 --> 00:13:00.990
common ancestral of chimpanzees and humans
and modern humans nothing similar happens.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.180
But this being said, we don't have any
direct evidence of that.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:15.040
- [Charles] Thank you. So here is one for
Dr. deMenocal. Can you come up? There

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:20.280
you are. Here's one. "Are ocean currents
changing fast enough to impact human

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.940
existence?" In other words, the shifting
monsoons resulted in wiping out ancient

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.860
civilizations. Are oceans circulations,
you think, it's going to do the same

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.681
change is going to do the same to us?

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.360
- [Dr. deMenocal] That's a great question
whoever asked that, and thank you for

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.680
that. Actually a colleague of mine Richard
Seager at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:45.900
where I work has actually addressed that
very question. The answer is yes, that

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.380
changes in oceans currents
actually that changes in sea surface

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.450
temperature distributions, where it's
warming and where it's cooling is shifting

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:58.230
where it rains actually. And so, that's
one of the reasons why the American

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.830
Southwest and somewhat for California is
experiencing exceptional drought right

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.950
now. It's due to changes in the ocean
currents. So this isn't so much the

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:11.680
overturning circulation as is the wind of
uncirculation. But nonetheless, that is

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.370
contributing to impacting our
sustainability. So, great question.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.330
- [Charles] Thank you. Looks like
we are going to

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:30.600
I'll select a few more. For Rick, I've got
a question for you. It's a chicken and egg

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:37.340
question. "Was the development of
agriculture at least in part a consequence

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.401
of increased population no longer being
supportable by the

00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:43.201
hunter/gatherer economy?"

00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:55.350
- [Rick Potts] That is a question that was
in my understanding was first addressed

00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:02.290
by an  anthropologist, Ester Boserup, a
demographer and anthropologist who

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:09.720
suggested exactly that. That it was a
population pressure thing. I think one of

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:17.890
the things that's interesting when I think
also of Jack's talk and of Bill Ruddiman's

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:24.740
talk is to recognize that the origin of
agriculture didn't happen just once. There

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.840
were multiple centers of agriculture. And
that there were

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:38.401
it's hard to say that, well because 12000
years ago for example, that there was one

00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:44.671
thing going on. I think that there
may be examples of how populations due to

00:15:44.671 --> 00:15:47.941
the archeological evidence, that
populations were moving up and down,

00:15:47.941 --> 00:15:54.941
different elevations, and had quite an
adaptable system. That there is only

00:15:54.941 --> 00:16:01.500
really one answer to whether population
pressure results in settling down and

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.351
domestication and the
intensification of agriculture.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:11.660
When you look, for example, in Mexico, the
independent center of agricultural origins

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:17.460
in Mexico, you actually see thousands of
years. This is the work of Kent Flannery,

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.990
but thousands of years where it wasn't
just hunting and gathering or agriculture,

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.920
it was actually mixed and people were
doing whatever they could to get enough

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:35.280
food. And to, in some ways to buffer some
of the seasonality, differences, times of

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:41.140
dearth and drought. And so I think that we
have to come up with a more meaningful and

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.510
more, in fact, more complicated scenario
that it's just population pressure that

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.471
pushes agriculture and that it's a simple
and easy transition.

00:16:50.681 --> 00:16:56.560
- [Charles] I'm going to take one. I don't
know to whom it is addressed, but the

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.840
question is, "Do any of the changes in
climate correlate with the geomagnetic

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:09.180
polar shift?" And what I do know from my
earlier work in geomagnetism is the idea

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:16.920
that there are occasions in the evolution
by the way, the geomagnetic pole moves

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.710
around with about a 20 thousand-year
cycle, and it reverses direction. And

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.790
during the period of time when it's
reversing direction, the magnetic field

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:32.030
that the earth is very small relative to
other times. And that lets more cosmic

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:38.720
rays into the lower atmosphere, and
there's a thought that that can affect

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:44.430
populations of animals through a radiation
of their genetic material. So with that,

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:51.260
I'm going to finish that one. Here's one
for Bill Ruddiman. This one's going to

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.081
provoke a little bit of discussion here.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:18:01.401
"The dating of the inception of the
anthropocin has political implications."

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:07.190
So I'm sure you'd struggle with, does
moving the date back to the rise of

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:13.160
agriculture 10,000 years ago dilute the
recognition of the effects of the rapid

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.211
carbon dioxide increase today?

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:21.290
- [Robert Ruddiman] I don't think it
changes any the mainstream view of

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:26.751
what's been happening for the last
100, 150 away. I look at it, I'm

00:18:26.751 --> 00:18:33.340
mainstream climate scientist, I look at
the rise of carbon dioxide, methane and

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:40.780
temperature in the last 150 to 200 years
as a sharp acceleration, the same as every

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:47.300
other mainstream scientist. What I would
add to it is there's this long prior, slow

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.880
period where we are adding methane and
carbon dioxide. We are not so much as

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:58.870
warming the earth as we are cancelling or
cooling, part of a cooling. So this is

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:05.611
still the same way as it was before, we
are just adding an earlier story.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:16.670
- [Charles] So, here's one for Jeff
Severinghaus. "How are oceans suffering

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.541
acidification, different rates and how
will our climates

00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:22.281
marine terrestrial change?"

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.811
- [Jeff] Yeah. Thanks for asking that
excellent question. Of course, this as

00:19:26.811 --> 00:19:32.590
Naomi said, that this is the other problem
besides the other CO2 problem. CO2

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:38.010
is causing ocean acidification and quite
separate from its climate impacts of

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:44.320
course. And that's a serious issue for
many organisms that secrete calcium

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.540
carbonate shells. It's going to get harder
and harder for them to secrete their

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.920
shells and of course, the impacts are not
uniformly distributed across the globe.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:20:01.190
They are much worse in the colder parts of
the ocean and somewhat milder in the

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:06.590
warmer parts of the ocean. That just
simply is because the calcium and

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:14.550
carbonate physical solubility is much
higher in the colder parts of the ocean.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:23.820
So, yes, it certainly is uneven, it's in
fact going to wipe out the deep dwelling

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:28.300
corals probably before it wipes out
anything else. So yeah, it certainly part

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.941
of the ongoing extinction story.
Does that answer it?

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:37.090
- [Charles] And I have another, don't go
away. As it turns out, I found another one

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:42.460
for you. "What was the cause of the
moisture for the high snow load in the

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:47.881
north during the last ice age? Was it the
Arctic Ocean, was that ocean and icery?

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:54.460
- [Jeff] Probably not. The Arctic
Ocean probably was covered by what we call

00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:00.970
an ice shelf, a floating glacier during
the last ice age. So it wasn't a source of

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:07.750
moisture but it's not so much that there
was a lot of extra snowfall in the north

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:13.850
so much as it was a lot colder and so the
snow didn't melt, and so it stuck around.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:18.740
That's in fact, the accumulation rates
that we see in the Greenland ice course

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:24.370
are about half and during the glacial of
what they are today. So colder equals

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.741
drier, it's a good rule of thumb.

00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:33.020
- [Charles] Thank you. So, I have a
question and I think, if I'm right, I can

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:39.050
divide between two speakers. The first
part of the question is, "How accurate are

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:44.500
the temperature rise predictions for
2050?" And I think that's one for Ram. But

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.270
then, "What will the effects be on
vegetation and agriculture?" That could be

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.271
Dr. Hadly. So if you both would come up.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.060
- [Ram] Yeah. I remember what Charlie
said, "Predictions are difficult

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:03.110
particularly of the future." So, in
general, over climate model and

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:10.660
uncertainties but the 90% confidence
interval is (+) or (-) 50%. Remember of

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:15.430
the two degrees, the planet has already
warmed by .85. So you apply the

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:21.380
uncertainty of (+) or (-) 50% to the
projection. So when I say two, it could

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.500
one and a half, or it could be two and a
half. I won't be alive if it's

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.151
disapproved, but that's

00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:34.411
- [Charles] So
sorry, forgive me.

00:22:34.411 --> 00:22:40.210
- [Dr. Hadley] It's okay. So the question
was I believe about forests or vegetation

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:47.290
and I'll answer the agriculture question
first and say that, the green revolution

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:52.380
did a lot to feed all these people that we
have on the planet. And really, the only

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:58.390
place that hasn't truly been transformed
by the green revolution is Africa. And the

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:05.470
reason it hasn't is because Africa is not
one country. It's many countries. And each

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.810
of we tend to think
about Africa as a

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:16.430
country, but those boundaries play a big
role in how resources, particularly water

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:22.650
and infrastructure move between those
boundaries. And so in some places, there's

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.510
been too much water for
agriculture to really

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.620
the green revolution to take hold, and
other parts of Africa there's not been

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:35.060
enough. So I'll say that, increasing
temperatures are only likely to exacerbate

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:43.580
that and from what I know about our stocks
of seeds and the wild relatives of our

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.150
cultivars, we don't have. Right?

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.850
We have eliminated so many of the wild
cultivars and the wild relatives of our

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:58.820
crops that we don't have the genomic
repertoire of the plants that we subsist

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:04.860
on to really handle two to four degrees
increase in temperature. And then in terms

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:10.650
of vegetation around the world, I'll
answer it in terms of not so much climate

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:17.930
change but deforestation. It's an enormous
problem and I have this extraordinary

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:25.150
picture of the Amazon that shows it's from
satellite photo and it shows that you can

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:31.100
define the boundary of South America. The
Amazon, the boundary between the land and

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:37.910
the sea based purely on individual clouds.
It expresses that every day trees are

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:43.300
respiring and releasing oxygen into the
atmosphere, and including they are

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:49.950
releasing water vapor. Every day, trade
winds come and they push those clouds up

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.881
toward the front of the Andes where they
then rise and come back

00:24:53.881 --> 00:24:55.611
over the Amazon as rain.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.410
In the absence of trees, the tropical
forest there there's poor soil and it's

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:07.160
really difficult to get tropical forest to
grow again. So our deforestation is

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.341
actually feeding back, it's causing a
state shift in climate

00:25:11.341 --> 00:25:12.941
both locally and globally.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.000
- [Charles] Now I'm going to take a
question for myself. And the reason is,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.310
the question was so good because it
pointed out the things that I should have

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:26.900
said and didn't say. And so I feel
obligated to correct, record it. And there

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:34.310
are two of them here. The first one is,
"What you are calling a hiatus is actually

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:38.410
a decrease in the rate of warming."
That's absolutely true. The public calls

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:44.990
it a hiatus. The climate science committee
has adopted the name to describe that

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:51.950
period, but in fact, the rate of increase
over the last 17 years is probably about a

00:25:51.950 --> 00:26:00.090
third what it had been in the previous 25
years or so. So that's correct. Then the

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:04.390
second part was, "In the past, there have
been changes where the rate of warming

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:09.180
increased." We just came out of one. It
was surface temperature warming and from

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:15.170
'75 to '98 the temperature increased by
about a half a degree centigrade.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:20.560
And then it increased by much last in the
last 17 years even though we were putting

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.080
more energy from the greenhouse effect
into the system. That energy was going

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:31.060
deep into the oceans. So in the past have
there been changes where the rate of

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:36.430
warming increased? Yes. And in fact, you
could argue that the change that I

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:42.050
described is just simply a change that the
climate science, what is called the

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:46.840
Pacific Decadal Oscillation which
oscillates back and forth every 30 years

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:53.320
or so. With the additional caveat that
greenhouse warming thinned the Arctic ice

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.900
and created a much more rapid entrees a
decrease of ice than we would have thought

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:05.740
of. The other question is, "We are aware
of the effect of the gulf stream on

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:11.190
Europe. Is there a similar ocean effect on
the Pacific, and how does it affect

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.900
climate and weather in North America?" And
actually, I showed both of them.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:22.780
The Pacific one is the El Nino/La Nina
cycle. There are studies of tree rings

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:30.370
that go back about 1000 years. And studies
of lake sediments in Ecuador that show

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:35.160
during El Nino period is a great
deposition of mud at the bottom of the

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:41.470
lake. The El Nino cycle has been with us
for at least 5000 years. And it leads to

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:47.890
dramatic changes in the climate in west
and north America as I indicate. So the El

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:58.450
Nino is to west and north America as the
Atlantic oscillation is to Europe,

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:02.500
Easter North America. And we have the
and then if you are interested, for the

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:10.510
rest of the world, we have the north, the
east Asia and Indian Monsoons are large

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:18.000
climate cycles that have big impact. So
thank you for your indulgence. Rick Potts,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.100
here's one for you. "Could we frame the
legend of the great flood as a period of

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:29.590
climate change leading to a large loss of
population and a bottleneck leading

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.941
through cultural evolution?" That's an
easy one I think.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:46.400
- [Rick Potts] In March, I spoke at a
conference convened by the AAAS, The

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.290
American Association for the Advancement
of Science. It was a conference attended

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:57.070
by 100 scientists and 100 Christian
evangelicals. And I thought we made

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:03.430
progress in conversation and discussion.
I'm not quite sure I can make progress in

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:09.910
answering this question.
But I think that the

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:19.620
like all narratives of origin that emerge
out of traditional society and traditional

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:27.120
text that they often take something that
is unique to a particular region, and may

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.660
see that region because that's all they
know as something that is worldwide. It's

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:39.340
their cosmos, that's the essence of how we
develop the powerful stories, we do about

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:45.760
how we relate to the world. Now we have as
part of our cross-cultural endeavor to

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.411
understand one another.

00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:53.170
Something that crosses philosophies,
cultures, languages, religions and so on,

00:29:53.170 --> 00:30:01.500
we have at least one other avenue with
regard to understanding the story of how

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:09.650
humans in a broader sense came into being.
And when we put that into a climate

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:16.930
perspective, yes, we see that there were
times that were far wetter than others.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:22.700
The part of the question that deals with
the matter of bottleneck, that maybe we

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.380
are referring to the idea that geneticists
have come up with

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:32.320
some geneticists, that there was either a
very, very long period of time, a very low

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.610
effect of population size, that is
breeding populations size. The group that

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:45.250
comes out of Utah would say, perhaps
10,000 in breeding population size, about

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:50.770
10,000 individuals. There have been then
studies, one published in PNAS,

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:56.400
Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences in the late 2000s, 2008 I

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:01.811
believe, that look at a whole variety of
genetic biomarkers.

00:31:01.811 --> 00:31:06.941
And suggested that the effect of a
breeding population size of our species,

00:31:06.941 --> 00:31:12.541
from which all modern human genetic
diversity, nuclear genomic diversity arose

00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:20.801
was from a breeding population size of
perhaps 600. Yeah. We were perhaps once an

00:31:20.801 --> 00:31:28.211
endangered species ourselves. That should
give us pause. And so, the one thing that

00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:32.281
seems to be by many people who work in
Africa, they do not see the explosion of

00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:37.411
Mt. Toba in Indonesia as being the driver
of that, but rather that was a time of

00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:42.411
very strong oscillation between wet and
dry cycles. And a number of us who have

00:31:42.411 --> 00:31:46.811
gotten drill cores out of the ground to
look at long climate sequences over the

00:31:46.811 --> 00:31:51.211
last 500,000 years are going to take a
very close look at that. But that's as

00:31:51.211 --> 00:31:55.011
much of an answer as I have right at the
moment, I'll try to come back in a couple

00:31:55.011 --> 00:31:56.741
of years and tell you the answer.

00:31:56.741 --> 00:32:02.380
- [Charles] Thank you. Now, I'm going to
close, we have several more questions but

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:06.480
I'm going to warn all the speakers at the
end that I'm going to ask them to come

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:13.420
here and give a brief answer to the last
question. And so, here's one, and I think,

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:19.220
I didn't quite know who to address it, but
I think I'll address it to Ram. "Recent

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:24.840
results in behavioral economics say humans
aren't rational. How do we design

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.211
strategies for survival as a civilization
that transcend

00:32:29.211 --> 00:32:31.411
national and cultureal limitations?"

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:42.630
- [Ram] Charlie, I clearly told you my
origin is in quantum mechanics. Yeah. I

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:52.510
don't know if I'm really qualified to
answer this. Certainly, as of the behavior

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:58.820
issue I don't know if I can touch that.
But clearly what I would emphasize is what

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:06.380
we concluded and you were there at the
Vatican workshop, thinking about the

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:13.430
sustainability issue. It brings in
intergenerational equity, generations to

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:19.270
come damaging the planett. And
intragenerational equity, which is what

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:26.740
few of us are doing is going to
negatively impact. Then it's clear we

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:34.910
fundamentally need to change our attitude
towards nature and to each other. And how

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:39.620
do you make that happen? Maybe a social
scientist could tap into the rational part

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:49.390
of our brain. But I certainly think this
is really the domain of the religions.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:54.180
They talk about morality and the smaller
issue, we all have the change of a

00:33:54.180 --> 00:34:01.600
behavior. So I would more appeal to the
religious leaders to help us out than

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.211
appeal to the rational part of our brain.

00:34:07.081 --> 00:34:11.770
- [Charles] And I would just add that one
theme that lodged in my mind from that

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:20.510
great conference goes something like this,
"The society that cares for all its

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:26.450
members will also care for all the
environment and if we don't do that, they

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:39.430
both will go down together." So I now
have two questions for Naomi. Well,

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:44.750
there's two of them and then we'll end
with our final question here. For you

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:50.920
Naomi, "In light of Hanson's action and
critical feedback and the need for

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:56.411
disruptive politics as you argued, what is
your advice to young scientists?"

00:34:58.341 --> 00:35:03.820
- [Naomi] All right. Well, it's a very
good question. I think my advice to young

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:08.980
scientists is this, we all have to do the
interventions that we are able to do based

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.910
on our personalities, and our talents and
our skillset. And if you are an aspiring

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:16.940
scientist and you are good at science,
then that's what you should be doing. So I

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:21.660
don't think scientists need to become
politicians or artists or something like

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:26.270
that, I don't think that makes sense. But
I do think that scientists have very

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:30.670
important role to play in terms of
explaining not just the facts of the

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:35.260
science but what they mean for people's
lives. And I do think the scientific

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:39.270
community needs to do that because no one
else really can. Well, historians of

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:43.330
science can but there's just aren't very
many of us. So, I think it's that

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:47.751
explaining, what is the temperature rise
of one-degree mean?

00:35:47.751 --> 00:35:49.471
Most people have no idea.

00:35:49.471 --> 00:35:52.560
Governor Kulongoski of Oregon who came
here a couple of years ago when his son

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.160
Justin was a student at Scripps, he said,
"I go out into the countryside, I talk to

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.760
farmers and I say, 'it's going to be two
degrees warmer,' well, first of all they

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:04.480
think it's Fahrenheit. And then they
think, 'Oh, so instead of a 68 degree day

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.690
it's a 70 degree day' that sounds good."
Right? So that translation of the science

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:13.671
into it's human meaning, is really, really
crucial. I think that all scientists

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:15.211
can contribute to that.

00:36:15.211 --> 00:36:19.811
- [Charles] And this next question is a
precursor to the final one.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.370
And while Naomi is speaking, I
would like to ask all the speakers to come

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:29.640
to the front. And you may or may not wish
to answer the question that I pose or has

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.580
been posed but I would like you up here,
please. So Naomi for you, "Given the

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:40.040
conclusion that we could all have a mass
extinction in the 21st Century, how do you

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.541
determine that humans will not
also become extinct?"

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:48.510
- [Naomi] Well, it's certainly possible
and never say never. But if you look at

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.840
the history of the
the geological history that Liz Hadley

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.770
showed us and that many of us are familiar
with, there have been five mass

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:00.830
extinctions in the history of the planet,
four and a half billion years. So that

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:06.410
means, statistically, the odds of a mass
extinction any time in our lifetime is

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:11.770
extremely low. Although some people have
argued we may be facing a sixth extinction

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:16.380
based on what we are doing to other
species on this planet, but that's a sixth

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:21.760
extinction which we survive but wipe out
all these other things. So it's not that

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.340
it isn't possible that it could happen,
it's just not very likely. And I don't

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.860
think it's really the relevant question,
because if we are thinking about ourselves

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:34.120
and our lives and the interventions that
we can make as people living today, really

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:37.211
the big question facing us is
the next 100 years.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:42.750
It's what happens between now and 2050,
whether we stay below that two degree

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:47.480
limit or head towards four degrees and
beyond. And the consequences, the

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:51.390
different between staying below two
degrees versus going to four, five or six

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:55.151
or beyond are very, very grave. And so I
really think that's the

00:37:55.151 --> 00:37:56.741
question that we need to focus on.

00:37:56.741 --> 00:38:05.280
- [Charles] Thank you. Okay, gang. Now,
here's the question and I'm going to ask

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:11.490
you to think of a brief answer, but it
will be a yes or no question with a couple

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:17.690
of sentences as to why you think so. All
right, so, here's the question. "After

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:23.510
this insightful and informative symposium
on climate change, should we walk away

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:28.941
more hopeful or less hopeful?" Somebody
would want to give it a try?

00:38:28.941 --> 00:38:30.481
- [female] I think that the
answer is yes.

00:38:37.681 --> 00:38:40.211
- [Charles] I'd like everyone
to give it a try.

00:38:43.281 --> 00:38:46.071
- [male] I think we should be more
optimistic.

00:38:46.071 --> 00:38:47.741
- [male] [Inaudible 00:38:46].

00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:49.411
- [Charles] Let's use the
microphone, yeah.

00:38:49.411 --> 00:38:54.201
- [Prof Hublin] I think we should be more
optimistic because there's a global

00:38:54.201 --> 00:38:56.541
awareness of the problem of course.

00:38:57.741 --> 00:39:04.220
- [Dr. Hadley] I think that because you
are here, that's hopeful for me. Generally

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:11.300
I'm pretty depressed about this day in
the world. But I'll say that one thing I

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:15.810
didn't tell you about, although Ram really
gave a nice example of is that I think

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:20.930
that we need to look for an inspiration to
the three billion people that are living

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:25.520
below poverty. And it's not so much that
they should look to us but we should look

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.990
to them, because they are leap frogging
technology and they are showing us how

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:34.071
well we can do with little. That's what
gives me optimism in the world.

00:39:38.881 --> 00:39:43.820
- [Ram] I strongly endorse what Dr.
Hadley said, absolutely. I'm certainly

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:50.801
very hopeful. Remember, don't forget it's
$450 problem. It's just climate change.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:40:00.600
- [Prof deMenocal] Looks like we are all
optimists here. My view is really simple

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:05.490
is that, I think we have to be optimistic.
And the reason is that, any other view is

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:14.450
just too depressing. It's impossible to
tell the lowest three quarters of the

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:17.630
world's population that things are going
to be worse for them than they are

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:22.900
already, because we are already pretty
dire. And so we have to not only envision

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.951
a future that's better but we actually
have to make it. So, that's my view.

00:40:30.411 --> 00:40:36.100
- [Severinghaus] Well I'm an optimist too.
I believe that this is just actually very

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:41.600
hopeful situation in many ways and partly
because if you look back at history again,

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:50.330
I love history. The whole recognition of
disease as a problem having to do with

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:55.530
public health and sanitation, that didn't
happen overnight. There were public health

00:40:55.530 --> 00:41:00.780
advocates that were working for maybe half
a century, maybe even a whole century

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:08.190
before we got sewage treatment systems. I
like to tell the audiences I speak to that

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:12.820
there's no such thing as republican sewage
treatment and democratic sewage treatment.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:18.670
Everybody is in favor of it, right? So
that's a way to look at this problem, it

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.881
didn't get solved overnight, but we are
going to get there.

00:41:27.141 --> 00:41:32.030
- [Ruddiman] I've gotten this question a
lot over the last 10 or 12 years. And I

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:37.420
have an answer that's well rehearsed but
it's changed a little bit. I usually start

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:45.141
off by saying, "I was born a naive
idealist and I aged into a gentle cynic."

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:55.070
My assessment of the level of human
selfishness, there are plenty of wonderful

00:41:55.070 --> 00:42:00.240
people in the universe, there are a lot of
very selfish people too . And so I think

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:06.090
left to their own devices, people that
large would not sacrifice to a solution

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:13.970
even though many of you may. I usually
then say, "I don't get asked to give

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:23.220
inspirational speeches." However, the
last couple of years, I've started to

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:30.220
shift that opinion and that is, there are
things happening technologically with

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:36.040
solar rays and battery storage and a
number of other areas that so far they are

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.811
incremental but they are accelerating.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:44.640
And I see the possibility of something
that's just absolutely transformative in

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:50.300
the next, even in the next five years,
much less the next 10 or 20. So I'm not

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.941
quite the cynic that I was five years ago.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:07.951
- [Potts] I guess I'm a glass half full
kind of guy. In 2005, there was of course

00:43:07.951 --> 00:43:15.481
on Christmas day there was the terrific
loss of life. Two hundred and seventy some

00:43:15.481 --> 00:43:19.741
thousand people was it? I can't remember
the exact number, but due to the Tsunami

00:43:19.741 --> 00:43:26.671
hitting Indonesia. And there was a science
reporter for the Washington Post who wrote

00:43:26.671 --> 00:43:32.001
an article a couple of weeks later, saying
that he had been at the December meeting

00:43:32.001 --> 00:43:37.871
of the American Geophysical Union. And he
heard a talk, which had a title that went

00:43:37.871 --> 00:43:42.141
on forever, which had words like,
subduction zones and things like this.

00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:50.471
It described exactly what happened on that
Christmas day, exactly. And the Washington

00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:56.351
Post science writer said, the only thing
that scientists couldn't say is, "Run. Run

00:43:56.351 --> 00:44:03.830
for your lives!" And I think that what
that communicates to me and I hope to all

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:11.920
of us is that we won't make progress just
simply, just only by trying to throw

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:17.471
evidence, throw data at people and expect
them to understand.

00:44:17.471 --> 00:44:22.741
Data is no guarantee for caring.

00:44:22.741 --> 00:44:30.081
And no matter what we argue from a
scientific standpoint, it's no guarantee

00:44:30.081 --> 00:44:37.951
for caring and for acting. And so I am
optimistic partly because we have the

00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:43.341
capacity, not only as scientists but
people involved in society and working

00:44:43.341 --> 00:44:50.941
with young people and people from all
walks of society to activate a moral

00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:57.881
conscience and a societal conscience, that
makes use of the fact that we are

00:44:57.881 --> 00:45:05.141
culturally contingent species. And that
means that we have the ability to make

00:45:05.141 --> 00:45:11.671
choices and that we have the ability to
act in ways that change life and lives and

00:45:11.671 --> 00:45:17.611
our understanding of our relationship to
the planet. Historians can point to much

00:45:17.611 --> 00:45:27.271
like Naomi did to matters of slavery, in
South Africa the end of apartheid, matters

00:45:27.271 --> 00:45:33.551
of with regard to global climate.
The response ultimately

00:45:33.551 --> 00:45:38.151
to the ozone hole and
the end of CFC use.

00:45:38.151 --> 00:45:44.611
And actually the tipping point go to use
the term that Liz Hadley used, the tipping

00:45:44.611 --> 00:45:51.401
point in society and all of those
societies actually took years, just years

00:45:51.401 --> 00:45:56.471
to do. Not 10 years. Of course, there was
a big build up, but it took years to do.

00:45:56.471 --> 00:46:01.000
And I think that we have the possibility
of doing that and developing ethics,

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.660
morality, compassion that is joined at the
hip with the science that we presented

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:15.930
today. And as co-chair, I can only point
out that Charlie was also a member of our

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:18.341
panel today and so he needs to answer.

00:46:23.081 --> 00:46:27.820
- [Charles] So, I think that when
you look at the

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:33.020
well, first of all let's just realize what
you heard was scientists speaking today.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:38.900
And we all live inside our disciplines and
we all live inside a limited sphere of

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:44.870
knowledge. But we are all pessimistic it
would seem because to a person in the

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:50.330
sustainability arena, each of us would
say, within our limited perception that

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:56.240
we've never seen problems quite of this
scale. And more than that, nobody is

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:03.810
listening. Those are big problems, and so
we are pessimistic. But you have to step

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:08.290
back from the structured knowledge that
we've tried to relate to you and think

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:14.200
more philosophically. We are thinking
about the next century but I'd like to

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:21.310
point out the tremendous problems in the
last century that our grandparents and

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:29.230
parents solved. They solved, they grew,
the century started with terrible mass

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:35.471
warfare. Conflicts between dictators, much
reduced. The nuclear threat

00:47:35.471 --> 00:47:38.871
unprecedented much reduced.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:52.620
Colonialism, gone to a large extent. And
finally, we began to solve the fundamental

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:58.510
problem of the third world. And we now
have set, as a civilization the forbidding

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:04.420
on the way to a decent way of life. So
these are enormous transformations in

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:10.600
society that took place that no one in the
year 1900 could have predicted, much less

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:16.350
the airlines and space travel. And so I
count on the creativity of human beings,

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:21.610
this enormously competent culture that we
all live in, I count on increased

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:31.200
connectivity in that culture. And that
connectivity is sustained and propagated

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:36.920
by our concern for each other and the
ethical concern that we will develop for

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:45.130
ourselves as a civilization and for our
climate environment as a whole. So with

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:52.140
that, I commend you for staying with us,
complicated and long and very informative

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.271
technical discussion. I hope you'll give

00:48:55.271 --> 00:48:59.211
all our speakers a chance
and some applause.

00:49:10.471 --> 00:49:13.560
- [Margaret Schoeninger] I'm Margaret
Schoeninger, I'm one of the co-directors

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.940
of CARTA and I want to just thank
everyone. I would like to start really

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:25.780
with our co-chairs. That was just the
phenomenal series of presentations that

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:34.350
you have put together. I would also like
to speak to the speakers. Each one of you,

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:38.440
I think the thing that struck me was how
integrated you were. Even though I don't

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:45.510
know that you knew that when you started,
but it brought us a whole piece of

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:52.380
something. I greatly appreciate that. And
I will also thank our supporters. There

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:57.360
may be many of you in this room, but there
are many people who are our supporters who

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:02.750
are not in this room. And so I want to
thank the people who have supported us.

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:07.920
And finally, I want to thank the audience.
And also want to say that those were the

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:14.060
best set of questions I think I have heard
at a CARTA symposium. So I want to thank

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:21.040
you all of you for thinking this through
and asking some very simulating questions.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:28.071
So I will now close, and thank you all for
and thank you all for a great speaking.
