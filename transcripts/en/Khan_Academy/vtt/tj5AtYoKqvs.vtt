00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.079
- [Tutor] Let's see if we can figure out

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.941
what four and four fifths
divided by one and one half is

00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:06.632
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:08.048
and see if you can
figure it out on your own

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:09.373
and I'll give you a hint,

00:00:09.373 --> 00:00:12.227
see if you can rewrite these mixed numbers

00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:16.685
as what is sometimes
called improper fractions.

00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:19.110
Alright, now let's do this together,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.231
so how can we rewrite
four and four fifths?

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.186
Well, four and four
fifths is the same thing

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:26.762
as, if we take the four,
that's the same thing

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:30.679
as four plus four fifths,
four plus four fifths

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:35.065
and four is the same thing as 20 fifths,

00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.168
so 4 is the same thing as 20 fifths

00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:42.539
and then plus four fifths,
well, what are you going to get?

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.257
Your going to get, you add the numerators,

00:00:44.257 --> 00:00:46.674
you get 24 fifths, 24 fifths,

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:50.378
another way to think about
it is take this denominator,

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:54.663
take the fifths, multiply
by four, you get 20 fifths,

00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:59.102
plus the four fifths that
you already have is 24 fifths

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:02.372
and so this is the same
things as 24 fifths

00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:04.854
divided by, use the same idea,

00:01:04.854 --> 00:01:08.437
one and a half is the same
thing as one plus one half,

00:01:08.437 --> 00:01:11.751
one is the same thing as two halves

00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:14.986
plus one half and so that's
going to be, add the numerators,

00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:18.435
that's going to be three
halves, so just like this,

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:21.150
we're able to rewrite our expression

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.948
as 24 fifths divided by three halves

00:01:23.948 --> 00:01:26.115
and now the key realization is

00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:28.503
is that that is the same thing

00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:29.503
as 24 fifths

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:34.773
times the reciprocal of three halves,

00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:36.512
so times, pause the video,

00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:39.043
what's the reciprocal of three halves?

00:01:39.043 --> 00:01:40.485
Well, the reciprocal of three halves,

00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:42.339
you just swap the numerator
and the denominator,

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:45.762
it's going to be two over three,

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:47.649
now what is this going to be?

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.660
Well, there's a couple of ways to do it,

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.718
you could just straight
up multiply the numerators

00:01:51.718 --> 00:01:54.729
and you would get 48 and then
multiply the denominators

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.272
and you would get 15,
so you get 48 over 15,

00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:00.487
but you might be able to rewrite that

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:04.728
in sometimes what's called
a more simplified way,

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:06.220
but another way of thinking about this

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.413
is you could just say,
well this is the same thing

00:02:09.413 --> 00:02:11.580
as 24 times two, times two

00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:16.758
over five times three and simplify things,

00:02:16.758 --> 00:02:19.415
before you even multiply them out,

00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:21.665
five times five times three

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.730
and you realize that look,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.670
24 and three are both divisible by three,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.371
so let me divide them both by three,

00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:33.816
so 24 divided by three is eight

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:37.316
and three divided by three is equal to one

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:40.150
and then you could multiply the numerators

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.483
and the denominators and so,

00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:47.141
and so you get in the numerator,

00:02:47.141 --> 00:02:48.831
eight times two is 16,

00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:51.599
in the denominator, you get a five,

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.940
so you get 16 fifths

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.177
and then if you wanna express
that as a mixed number,

00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:59.951
16 over five, well, five goes into 16

00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:01.808
three times with one left over,

00:03:01.808 --> 00:03:04.308
so this is three and one fifth

00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:07.909
and one thing to
appreciate, right over here,

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.365
I simplified that the 24
and the three of this step,

00:03:10.365 --> 00:03:13.454
sometimes you'll see people
simplifying at this step,

00:03:13.454 --> 00:03:16.175
so they'll say, hey look,
eventually I'm gonna have

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:17.887
a 24 in the numerator and
a three in the denominator,

00:03:17.887 --> 00:03:20.664
so let me divide both of those by three,

00:03:20.664 --> 00:03:23.131
so they'll say 24
divided by three is eight

00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:25.283
and then three divided by three is one

00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:27.849
and this is sometimes
called a cross reduction,

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.849
but this is all that's
going on right over here.
