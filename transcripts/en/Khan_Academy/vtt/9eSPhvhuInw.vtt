00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.667
- We already know a good
bit about negative numbers.

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:04.000
And we know a good bit of fractions.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.567
So you can imagine we're
going to start seeing

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:09.100
negatives and fractions together a lot.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.067
What I want to do in this video

00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:11.566
is just make sure we have
a decent understanding

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.433
how to manipulate negative signs

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:15.267
when we see them in fractions.

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:19.866
For example, if I have
the fraction negative 1/2.

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.868
Here I have the negative out
in front of the entire 1/2.

00:00:22.868 --> 00:00:26.500
This is the same thing
as negative one over two.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.800
And it's going to be the same thing

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.200
as one over negative two.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.899
Now I could also think
about something like

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.566
negative one over negative two.

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.515
Now it's important to realize
one way to think about

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:40.933
this as a fraction is you could view this

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:44.233
as negative one divided by negative two.

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:45.801
And we already know, if
you divide a negative

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.734
by a negative it would be a positive.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:49.100
So this right over here is going to be

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.767
the same thing as 1/2.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:56.033
This is going to be the
same thing as positive 1/2.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.766
Now with that out of the way,
let's think a little bit.

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.068
Let's do some example
problems that might push

00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:03.533
our thinking on this a little bit more.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:06.866
So this first question.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.366
Which of the following expressions

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:12.533
are equivalent to negative g over h?

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.733
Negative G over H.

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.433
Select all that apply.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.500
All right, so this has all
sorts of negatives here.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.267
So at first it looks a little bit unusual.

00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:25.233
But then we need to just
realize that this part.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:27.766
Actually, let me just square this off in

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.266
blue right over here.

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.800
Negative g over negative h.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800
We've already figured that out.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.666
We actually looked at
that right over here.

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:36.667
If you have a negative
divided by a negative,

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.800
that's the same thing as a positive value

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.534
divided by the positive value.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.433
So negative g over negative h,

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:46.166
is the same thing as g over h.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:50.233
And then you still have
this negative out front.

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:52.400
You still have that negative out front.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.500
So this one right over here is actually

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.801
equal to negative g over h.

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.300
When we think about it,
negative divided by a negative

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.967
is a positive and you still
have this negative out here.

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:02.533
So that's the same thing.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:05.033
And this right over
here, negative in front.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.233
And then you have g over negative h.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:08.534
This is going to be the same thing.

00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:10.600
You could rewrite this, you
could put the negative on top

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.000
as negative g over negative h.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.100
And then this would be equal to g over h,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.968
which is different.

00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:19.100
This is positive g over h.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.366
This is negative g over h.

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:21.933
So we wouldn't select that.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.034
And of course we wouldn't
select "None of the above."

00:02:24.034 --> 00:02:26.133
Cause we found a choice that we liked.

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:27.400
All right.

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:30.000
Which of the following
expressions are equivalent

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.634
to five over b.

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:35.533
Select all that apply.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:36.933
All right, so this one over here.

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:40.068
Negative five over negative b.

00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:41.700
Well we could remember that this negative,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.433
we could write this is the
same thing as negative five

00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:46.033
over negative b.

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:47.933
And I just want to make it
clear we're that negative.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:49.234
So this is negative

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:50.433
Instead of writing it negative

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:51.334
in front of the entire fraction,

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:53.867
I could essentially
multiply the negative one

00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:55.233
times just the numerator.

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:58.333
So you could write this as
negative five over negative b.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:02:59.767
And negative divided by a negative

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:00.867
is going to be a positive.

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:02.966
So this actually is going to be equal to

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.734
positive five over b, which
is what we're looking for.

00:03:06.034 --> 00:03:07.900
So this is going to be right.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.133
Now this one, negative
divided by a negative,

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:11.434
well that's just going to be positive.

00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:13.668
So that's the same thing as five over b.

00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:16.100
One way to think about it
is that well the negatives

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.966
kind of cancel each other out.

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:20.967
So five over b, that looks good too.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.267
And of course I won't
select none of the above

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.400
because I found two choices that worked.

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:26.433
All right, let's do one more.

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:30.085
Which of the following expressions

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:33.733
are equal to negative e over negative f?

00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:35.666
And remember we just have to
take this step by step here.

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:37.400
Actually let's try to just
simplify this directly.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.922
So negative e

00:03:39.922 --> 00:03:42.933
over negative f.

00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:44.967
Well we just need to remind ourselves

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:46.566
that this part right over here.

00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:48.566
Negative e over negative f.

00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:50.333
Let me write an equal sign.

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:53.100
Negative e over, and I'm
gonna put this negative.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.366
Let me do this in a different color.

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:55.800
Let me do this in purple.

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:57.133
So we have this purple.

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:59.333
So we have that purple
negative right over there.

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:01.133
And negative e over negative f.

00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:02.833
We've already talked
about this multiple times.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.601
That's the same thing as negative's

00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.100
divided by a negative is a positive.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.400
That's the same thing as e over f,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.367
as positive e over f.

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:12.401
So this whole thing will simplify to

00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:16.034
negative e over f.

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:18.546
So let's see which of
these choices are that.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.267
Well this right here is positive e over f.

00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:23.100
So that's not the choice.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.667
This one over here.

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:27.200
This one we could write
it several ways actually.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.733
We could write it negative
negative e over f.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.100
Which of course is equal
to positive e over f.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.266
We could also write this.

00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:38.133
We could put the negative
in the denominator.

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:39.533
We could say that this thing.

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:40.567
Actually let me write it over here

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:44.300
as negative e over negative f.

00:04:44.533 --> 00:04:46.200
This is also a legitimate thing to do.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.400
You could take this negative

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.333
and multiply it times the denominator.

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:51.400
Right over here.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.966
But either way it's going to
be equal to positive e over f.

00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:58.766
These two are actually evaluate
to the same expression.

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.400
So here, I would select.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.900
Finally, I would select.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.868
I've been waiting to
select "None of the above."

00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:06.733
All right, hopefully that helps.
