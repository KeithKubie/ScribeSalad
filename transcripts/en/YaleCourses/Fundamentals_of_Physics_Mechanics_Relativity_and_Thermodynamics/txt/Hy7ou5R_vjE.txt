Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Everything I told you last time, you can summarize in these two equations.

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Do you remember what we did? We said, let's take for the simplest case that we can possibly imagine, namely a particle moving in one dimension along the x axis with a constant acceleration, a what is the fate of this particle? And the answer was at any time t the location of the particle is given by this formula.

Speaker 2:          00:00:38       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       you can easily check by taking two derivatives. This particle does have the acceleration a, so what are these two other numbers? X Zero and V zero x, not in Vienna. I think we know what they mean. They're tell you the initial location and initial velocity of the object. For example, suppose you use vertical motion and use y instead of x and a would be g r minus G. That's a particle falling down under the effect of gravity. If all you know is the particular is falling out of the effect of gravity, that's not enough to say where the particle is, right? Suppose we all go to a tall building, start throwing things at various times, various speeds. We're all throwing objects was acceleration is minus g, but the objects that are different locations at a given time, that's because they could have been released from different heights with different initial velocities.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       Therefore, it's not simply enough to say what the acceleration is. You have to give these two numbers. Then once you got those two numbers that no longer free parameters, they are concrete numbers, maybe five and nine, 10 foot. Anytime t you plug into at the time t and you will get the location. If you took the derivative of this, we'd get the velocity at time. T two B v not plus eight t again, you shouldn't memorize the formula. I hope you know why it makes sense, right? You want know how fast the guy is moving this, the starting speed, that's the rate that we did is gaining velocity and that's how long it's been gaining it. So you add the two. This also means the following. It is true that if you give me the time, I can tell you the velocity, but conversely, if I knew the velocity of this object, I also know what time it is probated. I knew the initial velocity. Therefore mathematically I'd they given time tea, we can trade t four V and put it into this formula, vanish tea everywhere by doing it. I got this formula.

Speaker 2:          00:02:58       Yeah

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       is a mattress, simple Algebra of taking this and putting it here. But I showed you in the end how you can use calculus to derive that. And I got the feeling when I was talking to some of you guys that maybe you should brush up on your calculus. You have done it before. But uh, when you say I know calculus, sometimes it means you know, it sometimes it means you know, some fellow who does or you met somebody who knows that's not good enough. You really have to know calculus and this is a constant problem. It's nothing to do with uh, you guys said. It's just that you have done it at various times. It's a problem we have dealt with in the physics department year after year. And one solution for that is to get a copy of the textbook I wrote called basic training in mathematics.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       It's about paper back or 30 bucks. And I will, I've given the name of the book in the classes website. If I hadn't written it I would prescribe it. But that is a little awkward moment. You don't want to sell your own book. On the other hand, you don't have to withhold information that may be useful to the class. So I think that book will give you all the basic principles you need in calculus one variable more variables, elementary, complex numbers, maybe solving some problems with vectors and so on, which are going to get into whether you're going to physics or not is irrelevant. If you're going to any science that uses mathematics, chemistry or engineering or even economics, you should find the contents of that useful. So I think, uh, it'll be in your interest to get that anywhere you like. You can go to Amazon or you can go to our bookstore bookstore has some copies, but they're really for another course. So you should look at it then order it on your own. Okay. So I will now proceed to the actual subject matter for today.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       So I told you, the way I'm going to teach any subject is going to start with the easiest example and lull you into some kind of security and then slowly increase the difficulty. So what's the next difficult thing? Next difficult thing is to consider a motion in higher dimensions. So how high do you want to go? Now for most of us, we can go up to three dimensions because we know we live in a three dimensional world. Everything moves around in three d that that'll be enough for this course. In fact, I'm going to use only two dimensions for most of the time because the difference between one dimension and two is very great between two and three and four and so on. It's not very different. There's only one occasion where it helps to go to three dimensions because at a certain things you can do in three d you cannot do in less than freely, but that's later.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       So we don't have to worry about that. So we'll stop it too. If you talk to the string theorists, they will tell you that are really, how many dimensions do you know that are actually 10 including space and times that are nine spatial dimensions. That's according string guys. So mathematicians are likely lead told us how to analyze a mathematics in any number of dimensions. We don't pay attention to them when they are going beyond three but now we know we need that. We're going to do too. So our picture now, it's going to be some particle that's traveling in the x y plane.

Speaker 1:          00:06:25       So the guy who's just moving around like this, this is not an experts as time plot at white versus time. This the actual motion of the particle and if you say where this time, but one way to mark climates, they imagined that it carries a clock as it moves and put markers every second that may be a t equal to zero t equals to one t equal the two and so on. So time is measured as a parameter along the motion of the particles. It is not explicitly shown, but you can sort of tell the particles moving slowly or rapidly by looking at the space in between these tick marks. For example here in one second it went from here to here, he hadn't one second. It seems to have gone much further so probably is traveling

Speaker 3:          00:07:12       faster.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       But if you want to describe this particle, what's the kinematics? You can pick a point and say I am at the point x y. So when you go to two dimensions, you need a pair of numbers instead of x you need x and y. But what we will find is this more convenience to lump these two numbers in the single entity, which is called a vector. So that's what we're going to talk about a little bit. Talk a little bit about vectors. Now you guys, I've also seen vectors, I'm pretty sure, but it is worth going over some properties and some may be new and some may be old. So the simplest context in which one can motivate a vector and also motivate the rules for dealing with vectors is when you look at a real space. I mean just caught and it's x and y and let's imagine that the, I went on a camping trip and on the first day here is where I was. Then I tell you, I went for five kilometers on the second day and another five kilometers in the third day. Then I asked you, where am I? How far am I from camp?

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       You realize that you cannot answer that. You cannot answer that. Even if I promise to move only along the x axis, because as I think, I don't want to post this as a question because I think the answer is fairly obvious to everybody. It's not enough to say, I went five kilometers. I got to tell you whether I went to the right or whether I went to the left, so I could be 10 kilometers from home. I could be zero kilometers from home, or I could be minus 10 if I had gone two steps to the left. But you can deal with this bike saying not just five kilometers, but plus or minus five kilometers. If you give a sign on top of the number that takes care of all ambiguity in one dimension. So assigned a number is adequate to keep track of my emotion. But you know in two d the options that are just left and right or north and south, but infinity of possible directions in which I could go. There's five kilometers. So what I could do on the first day is to come here on the second day could be to go there. These two guys are five kilometers long

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       for that purpose to describe that displacement, we use a vector, this is called a vector. Going to give it a name a, it starts from the origin and goes to this point. That is a description of what I did on the first day and the second day I did this and that is the description of what it did on the second day. But proper way to draw vector is to draw an arrow. It's got a beginning and it's got an ad.

Speaker 2:          00:10:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       So this is the reason behind seeing a vector as a magnitude and direction. Well magnitude is how long this guy isn't. That action is at what angle it is, so this is a, and this is B and now you realize that, oh by the way, when you draw a vector like a, you're supposed to put a little arrow on top. If you don't put an Arrow on top, it means you're talking about just a number a which could be positive or negative or complex, but it's just an ordinary number. If you want to talk about an Arrow of any kind, you got to put a little arrow on top of it. In a textbook, they use boldface letters and classroom. You use the symbol like this is a, this is B. It's a very natural quantity that you can call a plus B. If you want to call something as a plus B, it means that I did a and then I did B, but if I want to do it all in one shot, what is the equivalence step I should take? It's obvious that the bottom line of my two day trip is this object C and we will call that a plus B.

Speaker 1:          00:11:22       It does represent the sum in the sense that if I gave you four bucks and then gave you five bucks, I gave you effectively nine. Here we are not talking about a single number, but a displacement in the plane and see in d represents an effective displacement. This is the rule for adding vectors and it has an origin in the simple example. Okay, so rule for adding the two vectors is you draw the first one and at the end of that first one you begin the second one and the sun starts at the beginning of the and and said the end of the second.

Speaker 1:          00:11:58       Okay? So that tells you how to add two vectors and get a song. You can verify in this simple example that a plus B is the same as B plus a, B plus h would be first Robbie. And from there you draw a and you will end up with the same point. So you say this is a community of law. It doesn't matter the sequence in which you add the two vectors. We know that's true for ordinary numbers, right? Three plus four and four plus years. Same is also true for factors, but the off composition is not always commuted. That are certain occasions in which you first do a and then you do B. That's not the same as far as doing B and then doing a come to that later. Right now this is the simple law. All right? Next thing I want to do is to define a vector that plays the role of the number zero, the number zero as a property when you added to any number, it doesn't make a difference.

Speaker 1:          00:13:03       I want a vector that I want to call the zero vector and it should have the property that I added to anybody. I get the same vector so you can guess who the zero of activist zero vectors vector of no length. I cannot. If this is a, I'm going to drive back to here, I cannot show you the zero vac. The minute you can see it, I'm doing something wrong, right? If you can see it, it's wrong because it's not supposed to have any length, but it has a property that when you add it to anything, you get the same vector. So that vector is called the null vector. How about this guy? I draw a, then I draw another day.

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       This is a plus. A

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       No. You have to agree that there's any vector that deserved be called to a is this guy, right? This is a plus a, so we're going to call it to a, the beauty of that is now we have discovered a notion of what it means to multiply the vector by a number. If you multiply it by two you get a vector two times as long, but then you're able to generalize that and say if you're multiplied by 2.6 I mean a vector 2.6 hours long. I see. So multiplying vector by a number means stretch it by the factor. Then I want to think of a vector that I can call minus eight

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       what do I expect of minus EI? I expect that if it had minus a to a, I should get the guy who plays at all at zero in this world, which is the vector of no length is very clear that if you want to take a and ask what should the APP to a play get the nol vector, it's clear that you want to add a vector that looks like that because then if you go from the start of this to the finish of that, you end up at the same point and you get this invisible pseudo vector, so the minus vector is that the same vector flipped over to point the opposite way.

Speaker 1:          00:15:16       That's like minus one times the vector. Once you got that, you can do minus seven times of vector minus Pi Times the vector. Just take the vector multiplied by Pi and flip it over. That's minus Pi Times the vector. This sub, you get the rules for adding a vector to another vector than taking a vector and multiplying it by some constant. Then of course you can do more complicated things. You can take this vector multiplied by one number, take that vector, multiply in other number, add the two of them. We know what all does operations mean. No, but you don't have to memorize all this. There's only rulers. Do what comes naturally to what you would normally do with ordinating numbers in the seems to work for vectors. But you should know about multiplying vector by a number of means. All right, so this is the notion of what vectors are not. We are going to come to some important concept, which is the following. You go back to the same x white plane. Yeah. There's some vectors. A gonna introduce two very special vectors. They're called a unit vectors. And this guy I, that is Jay. If I had a third access, I would draw a k, but we don't need that. So I and J are vectors of length one pointing along x and Y. Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       The claim is I can write any vector. They give me us a rescale. I plus a rescale. Jay, there's nothing you can throw at me that I cannot handle with some multiple of ions, some multiple of Jay. No, it's intuitively clear, but I will just prove it beyond any doubt. Here's the vector. The A, it is clear that that vector is the sum of that vector and that vector by the rules of accurate dish. Right? Because that plus that is equal to the a but how about this part? This part being paralleled to, I has to be a multiple level high. We know that because you can stretch. I buy whatever factory life. So whatever number it takes a x times. I use this part, this part being paralleled to Jay has to be some multiple of jam going to call it a y. Therefore, the fact that aid that you gave me, I have managed to write as I times x let's j times a y. So you can ask yourself, if you gave me a particular vector, uh, what do I use for x and a y? [inaudible] you can see from trigonometry that this angle will stay there, here

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       and the, the length of the vector, I'm going to call by EI. Ei is the length of the, if you drop the Arrow, it's the usual convention. As you're talking about the length of the wreck today.

Speaker 2:          00:18:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:16       First of all, it's clear from the Pythagoras theorem that ey is square root of x squared plus eight wide square and the angle Taita that it makes with the x axis satisfies the condition time Tito a y over the air. So what this means now, here's the main point. If you give me a pair of numbers, a x and a y, that's as good as giving me this Arrow because I can find the length of the Arrow by Pythagoras theorem and I could find the orientation of the Arrow by saying the angle Taito satisfied. Stamped it is a boy over there.

Speaker 2:          00:19:02       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       So you have the option of either working with the two components of a odd with the Arrow? No, in practice, most of the time the work with these two numbers, a x and a y.

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       If you're describing a particle with location, are the vector be used typically to locate the particles are than r is just I times x plus j times. Why? Because you all know that's x and that's why no, I've not given you any other example besides the displacement vector, but at the moment we'll define a vector to be any object which looks like some multiple of Aipla, some multiple of Jay. So suppose I tell you to add two vectors a and B equal to c and I say, what's the result of adding a and B? You got two options. You can draw the Arrow corresponding to a, then you make an Arrow corresponding to be laid on the edge of this one that add them as shown here.

Speaker 2:          00:20:23       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:20:25       But you can also do something with a drawing. Any pictures that would come by saying, I'm taking I times x Plus j times a y plus I times dx. Let Dave Times be why and I'm trying to add all these guys, but then I combine it time say x was I times be x because that's the vector paddle to I the length, the x, that's the vector pilot. Do I with length be x? It's clear if I add them, I would get a vector parallel to eye for the links X. Plus bx. Then Jake will a wife. Let's be why. I have to be really careful when I said I had the lengths. I'm assuming all the components or positive x and a y. Some are positive, some are negative. This is the way by which we are. We have learned we should combine multiple supply. When I give you a multiple of iron and other multiple of either, some has got assets coefficient, the sum of the two coefficients. This is when you add two vectors. You just add the components so that if this vector is called I time see explicitly eight times. See why. Then it's worth knowing that CX is a explicit bx and see why is a why plus B y.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       So most of the time when we deal with vectors, we don't draw these arrows anymore. We just keep a pair of numbers and if you give me another vector that's another pair of numbers and if you say add the vectors, I will decide the x two, the x and the y to the y and I keeping track of what the summer is. A very important result is that if two vectors are equal, if a equals B, the only way it can happen is if separately x is equal to be x and a y is equal to B. Why? That's the very important difference. You cannot have two vectors equal with exactly the same x component. Exactly the same way component. That's pretty obvious. If two arrows are equal, you cannot be longer than the esthetician and correspondingly shorter the white election, everything has to completely match. So back to the equation, e equals B is actually a shorthand for two equations. They export some match in the white parts mass.

Speaker 1:          00:22:57       Okay. Now when you work with components x and a y, if I didn't mention it, the other components of the vector, so you can do all your bookkeeping in terms of aics anyway, but he got to be aware of one fact. If I just come and say to you here, here's the vector whose components three and five. Can you draw the vector for me? Can you draw it or not? Cause anybody have a view? Yes. No, yes, no. Pardon me. Yeah. If if you immediately said, well, if the vector is three, four then the vector looks like this. You're making the assumption that I am writing the vector in terms of I and G, I see I n g s but in natural direction. For most of us gravity acts this way, defines the vertical direction very naturally than the blackboard is oriented. This way.

Speaker 1:          00:23:55       It should be a natural to call that x and a call that y and lineup or axes. What do you agree that there is no reason why somebody else gonna come along and say, you know what? I want to use a different set of axes. Those directions are more natural for me. In fact, just because the world is around, you can already see this is the earth to somebody that's a natural direction. If you go to another neighboring country, that's what they think is naturally x and wife. There is no reason why x and y are nailed an absolute space. It's very important that x and y are human constructs and we're not wedded to any of them quite often as natural to pick x and Y in a certain way. If you're studying a predict child near the earth, it makes sense to pick the horizontal is x and vertical is y, but mathematically you don't have to. It's a very important point that comes up is the following. What if somebody comes along and has got a new access and here's a unit vector I prime, that's unit vector j prime and here's this vector a and the angle between my access let's say, and your access is some angle Phi.

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       The same vector at a can be written either in terms of I and J are in terms of I prime and j prime. So let's take a minute to just play this game of asking how were the compliments of a in the new rotated coordinate system related to the components, the old coordinate system. This is a simple problem but I just want to do it. So you get used to working with vectors. So the point is the ADOT a, somebody is chosen the right in terms of Ip crime and j prime as a prime and a white print. You guys follow that? I prime a j prime but now rotated unit vectors and somebody wants to think in terms of those. In other words, the person who wants to ask how much I've tried him, how my j prime need, do I need to build up the Vec today? That person would get a different answer. You're asking how much I and how much do I need to build the same object. So the same entity written in two different ways.

Speaker 2:          00:26:14       So

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       she's got a pair of numbers and you got a pair of numbers. The numbers are called the prime numbers and you want to write them in terms of yours. But for that, what do you need? You need to know what I primus in terms of ing. So let's draw a little picture on the side here. This is Ip crime. It's got a link to one. It's an angle Phi.

Speaker 2:          00:26:39       So

Speaker 1:          00:26:40       I'm going to write something and I'll wait till you guys tell me you are comfortable with this. I try miss I co signed fi plus j sine fine. There should not be anybody in this room is mystified by this statement. This vector I prime has got a horizontal part which is it's linked with just one time score signed Phi and the vertical part, which is one times signed Phi. This kind of trigonometry you should know all the time. Okay. It's not something you're going to go back and remember he said opposite side is that or do some site. You got to know that really well so you've got to be very used to the notion of taking it back it in some oblique. That action writing it in terms of ing, how bout j Prime Day prime is pointing in that direction. It's at an angle Phi

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       so j prime would be minus I signed fine. Plus j equals sign five if it's not obvious, I think this is the kind of thing you should fill in the blanks when you go home, leave aligned there and think about it and fill in the blanks later. Very important to know if these two axes at an angle Phi, those two axes are also wrangled. Fine. That's the design to use all the time and mechanics. So once you do that, I think it's fairly clear that it has got a weight component that's given by coast sign and x component that's given by sign fi but x component is negative. This vector as a little bit of negative ions. Here's what I say you should do and this is the kind of thing I don't want to do in classroom. It takes time and I'm probably going to screw up. So imagine taking I prime and j prime and stick them here and here do this in your head and ask what can I possibly get? I prime and j prime had been banished everywhere they replaced by I and J so you can now collect the whole expression as something something I plus something. Something Jay and what you will get four. I will be x course sign fi minus a y sign fi than here you will get a white Kosa in FY plus x sign five.

Speaker 3:          00:29:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       This is the only part I don't want to do explicitly. I'm just saying take this and put it there and combined Imj but this is the same vector. We are calling it a times x plus j times 81 and I've totally of two vectors that equal the components mismatch I made then. I'm sorry I'm making a mistake here. This should be primed.

Speaker 3:          00:29:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:38       By the way, when you guys do this, did anybody notice subprime? Yeah, so if you noticed it, you got to stop. You cannot let me write anything that's incorrect. So you've got to follow it in some detail. I know you couldn't do the details, but you should at least know that is I prime and j prime that have been replaced by I and j. But a experiment, a prime will continue to be the coefficients. So if I make the comparison, I find x is equal to x prime cosigned Phi minus a white prime signed Phi and a y is equal to minus x prime sign Fi. Let's say y prime cosigned Phi.

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       So what's the purpose of the exercise? Purpose of the exercise is to make the following precisely to remark. You can pick your unit vectors are what are called basis vectors anyway. You like pick any two perpendicular directions which may be related to the ones I picked by an angle. Phi. Then the same entity, the same Arrow we test an existence of its own independent of axes can be described by you and me using different numbers. That's the precise connection between the numbers you use the numbers. I use your numbers. The prime on it are related to mind by this relation. No. You can ask the opposite question. How do I get your numbers in terms of my numbers, so what should I do? They want inward. The relation. Anybody have an idea of what I should do now? No one has a clue on how. Why can go back from these to that. Let me take a second to ask. Do you have any idea what you should do? Okay. Maybe you are a yes.

Speaker 3:          00:31:58       Yep. Expressions are a prime x for every eight x and vice versa and then just using the negative

Speaker 1:          00:32:12       negative a fee. Yes. Okay. All right, so his idea was the formula written for the opposite one will have the opposite angle replaces five by minus of that. Now that turns out to be the correct answer, but I will. I want you to guys to think about why it was difficult to do it another way, which is more pedestrian. I mean if I told you a three x plus two is nine and four x plus six is six you certainly know how to solve for x and Y, right? This is something you've seen in your high school. You got to juggle the two equations, multiply that by four, multiply that by three and add and subtract and so on. Why is it when you saw this, you didn't realize it's the same problem, but it's the same problem. It's fine. You said angle sine and cosine.

Speaker 1:          00:33:05       Definitely numbers. If I pick an angle of 60 degrees, these are some numbers like half and root three over to that. I'm trying to write uh, these two unknowns in terms of these two loans and they can solve for them here though, what you will multiply by would be signed fines and costs and five, so you can eliminate, for example, if you multiply this by sign five and multiply this by course and fire an add them x prime will drop out. So that's the kind of thing you should do. Maybe you should, I will add this on as a problem. You should do it in the homework, but do you realize that this is pair of simultaneous equations in which you can solve for these two unknowns if you like, in terms of these two nodes and these coefficients, which are like these numbers three to four and six, you can do that.

Speaker 1:          00:33:58       But we like to get the answer the way this gentleman described it because we'd like to get an answer more readily than by doing the mundane work. And the idea that he had was, if you go from me to you with a clockwise rotation, you go from you to me by counterclockwise rotation. Therefore, if I, my angle, if I go by fi to you, then you must go by minus five to come to me. That's correct. So you will find them. The result is aix course and fine. Let's say sign fine. I'm using the fact that when you take a course sign and change the angle inside the code sign, it doesn't care. But if you go to the sign and change the angle inside, the sign becomes minus side. In other words, sign of minus theta is minus sine data and of course then of minus data, this goes same data. These by the way, is another property I expect people to know in this course. You cannot say, I've never heard of it, but I don't know where it came from. We should think about why that is true. Okay? So if you do that, it will find then this result.

Speaker 3:          00:35:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:21       Okay. So that is a way to go from the unprime coordinates the prime coordinate by rotating our axes and actually calculating the component. No, he is a very important message which is the following. When you go from one set of axes to another set of axes, the numbers change, the competence, the vector are not the same. You might think it's all along x and somebody can tell me it's all along my new y axis. So the carpenters, the vector or not invariant, the depending on who is looking at the vector, but there's one quantity that's going to come out the same no matter who is looking at the vector. Anybody have a guess on yes. The length of the vector is the length of the vector. Perhaps it's clear to you that no matter how your axis are oriented, when you ask how long is this Arrow, you're going to get the same answer and that means x squared plus a white square is a x prime square, just a white prime square and that's a property of this expression. You can square to this guy and I added to the square of this guy and you will find using the magics of trigonometry that this is true.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       Now I'm going over at point because they're very, very important. When we do relativity, we'll be dealing with vectors in space time and that we'll find that a different observers disagree on what is this and what does that, but they will agree on certain things. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:36:52       So is there a mindset that have both the a lot

Speaker 1:          00:36:58       here? Hold on a sec. Here.

Speaker 3:          00:37:01       Lights.

Speaker 1:          00:37:03       This is a minus and that doesn't have a minus on the other side over here. Yeah, no, he had bought her plus, but this one has in mind. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes, that is correct. Thank you. Yes, that's right. The minus is only at, they're very good. So certain things I'd call in variants. This is an example of an invariant.

Speaker 3:          00:37:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       By the way, I want to conclude with one important point. We learned that the vector is a quantity. That is a magnitude and the direction. But actually the view of vectors we take nowadays is that a vector is a pair of numbers are associated with a pair of numbers with under rotation of axes transform like this. Anything that transformed this way, it's called a vector.

Speaker 3:          00:37:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       All right, so now am I want to ask the following question? Can I manufacture new vectors? We got one vector, which is our whole board more vectors or position vectors. So I want to look at that. That turns out to be a very nice way to produce vectors given one vector, the position vector, and that's the following. Let's take a particle that is moving in the x, y plane, so that at one instant, sorry, let me change this graph you'd see here, oh, this is bad.

Speaker 3:          00:38:35       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       let's see. It was moving like this. So I'm here now a little later. I am there. That's what I meant. So this is called our, this is called Delta r. This is called our plus Delta R.

Speaker 2:          00:38:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:52       So the particles moving along this arc initially is location as a function of time is equal to I x of t plus j times YFT. If you wait the short amount of time it goes to the new location which I am. I'm going to call RF t plus Delta t. What can that be? It can be x of t plus some change in x plus j times y of t plus the change in y.

Speaker 2:          00:39:38       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       that'd be recognized to be art at time t plus everything else which is I times delta x let's date times delta. Why I'm going to call this guy at pioneer vector Delta R. Yeah. Other words if any more on the line you wait a small time. Delta t you move by an amount. Delta x when they move in the plane, your changes itself. A vector. You started the vector, you changed by this vector. Delta r it gives you the new location. Delta Art has got two components. It's garden changing. Accent has got to change and why.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       Therefore we will define what's called the velocity vector, which is a, if you want the limit as Delta t goes to zero of Delta r over Delta t and you can see that it's going to be, I times Dxdt let j times the windy city. So you can actually take derivatives of a vector with time and that's also a vector. Why is the database of a vector also vector? Because the difference in the vector between two times, this is vector dividing by Delta T. It's like multiplying by one over Delta t but I know when I multiply the vector by a number, I get a vector in the same direction. So what does really means is that if you take the limit as Delta t goes to zero, I cannot dry it that well, but imagine bringing the second point closer and closer to the first one, Delta. Ours getting very small, Delta t is very, very small, but by the miracle of calculus, the ratio will approach the definite limit. That limit will be some arrow. You can call the velocity at that time and an always be tangent to the curve because tangents pointing towards the direction you're headed at that instance.

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       So

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       if I gave

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       you the location of a particle is a function of time, you can find the velocity by taking databases. For example, if I say a particle's location is I times t square flooded times 90 cubed, but every value of time you can put the numbers in and you can find the velocity by just taking derivatives. Did a way to have this guy will be two times I plus what at 2017 square times Jay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       So rule for taking derivatives. If you want to do just mindless application of calculus, you can do it. I and J are constant. Ignore them and you take derivatives x and y depends on time. Just take the deliberative and that's the velocity vector and you can take an Dell it deliver to off the derivative and it can get the acceleration vector will be d two are over d t square and you can also write it as DVD t. Okay. Any, anybody have questions with what I've done now or what we're doing here? Let me summarize what I'm saying. Particles moving in a plane at every instant. It's got a location given by the vector are art itself is contained in a pair of numbers x and y and they vary with time. So when you very time a little bit and ask how does are changed and you take the caution of Delta Art, the Delta t you get the velocity vector mathematically is done by taking the expression for r and differentiating everything in sight that can be differentiated Spec to t. So even though we started with a single vector, which is the position vector, we are now finding out that is deliberative has to be a vector and the data to deliver it is also a vector. Again, when he learned a little nutty, you will find out there's one vector that staring at you. I'll come to what that is. That's the analog or the position vector. But more than more vectors can be manufactured by taking it.

Speaker 2:          00:43:37       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       Okay, so now I want to do one concrete problem where you will see how to use these a bit of bitters. I'm going to write the particular case of art of tea and take derivatives and we'll get a feeling for what's going on. The problem I have in mind looks like this RFT is going to be a fixed number of our I times square sine Omega t time. Sine Omega t does Omega as a new creature. You don't know what it is right now, but I'm going to just put that in and Omega time. Sti is some number and it's of course saint of the number of times I plus sign of the number of times j times are

Speaker 1:          00:44:27       so what is going on? That's a function of time. What's this particle doing? First thing you can tell is that if you find the length of this vector, you will find the square of the x and the square or the white, but it's in science squared plus [inaudible] squared is one. You'll find this back as a fixed length r that means it can only be rattling around in a circle of radius r and in fact, what the guy is doing looks like this at any given time. T drawn angle, Omega t and a radius r and that's very a particularist. You see that because the x component of this one in our course and Omega t and the white part is our sine Omega three s Omega is a fixed number. As t increases, this angle increases and the particle goes round and round. So we're describing the motion of a polygon. A circle.

Speaker 3:          00:45:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       Now let's understand what Omega is. Let's get a feeling for omega. As time increases, the angle increases and we can ask how long does it take for the particle to come back to the starting point up. The starting point was here. So as the increased little t omega t will increase and I want to come back to where I start. So you've got to ask yourself, let the time it takes to do a full circle. That's the time period. Do a full circle and what can you say? Abort Omega t what should it be? The valley of Omega t very good, so you can say it's three 60 degrees, that's fine, but we like to measure angle and Radians. Now how many people know about radiants? Okay. For those who have not seen a radiant it just another way to measure the angle with the understanding that if full circle, which we used to think of three 60 degrees is equal to two Pi Radians to pious, roughly six so radiant is roughly 60 degrees is 58 and fraction.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       Why do you like the measure of angle in the peculiar way? You will see the advantages of that later, but we'll adapt the convention that will measure the angle in the radio so that a half circle, instead of calling it one 80 degrees, you will call it as pie and a quarter circle instead of 90 we'll call it pi over two and 45 is by our Ford and so on, but it's good to know a certain famous angles. This is Pi over two. This is Pi is Pi over two and this is back to two Pi. Therefore Omega t equals two Pi tells you that Omega is two Pi divided by the time it takes to complete it. Evolution in one over the time period is what we call the frequency. You can write it as f is just the usual frequency. 60 Hertz means you'll do 60 revolutions per second. All right, so how fast is this particle moving? It's going to go around the circle. The angle is increasing at a steady rate, so we know it's going at a steady speed. I'm asking what's the tangential speed as it moves along the circle?

Speaker 2:          00:48:00       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:48:02       How do you reach that conclusion? I agree, but I want the speed in meters per second and Omega will be in radiance per second. Yes. And how did you get that?

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       Okay, but

Speaker 1:          00:48:27       that's correct. But let me did use that in another way. Your answers completely correct. It is Omega are, but I want to say how you get it. One way is to say, if I do a full revolution, I think of the speed as the distance. Over time I'm going to go one full revolution. This sensor travel is to PR but two Pi over t was identified as Omega. So the tangential velocity or at any point is equal to Omega Times are. That's a useful quantity to know. So now you can take this velocity and you can take this are the, let me find the Ft. The FT is obtained by taking deliberate to this expression and I think you guys know enough calculus for me to write is equal to my, it's equal to uh, our times. I times minus Omega Sine Omega t plus j times Omega Cosine Omega t.

Speaker 1:          00:49:38       That is the velocity of this guy. And I invite you to try this formula whenever you want. Pick a time. Let's say if I go a quarter of a circle, I expect to be moving to the left quarter of a circle means Omega t is Pi over two course and a Pi over two is zero because Casa 90 zero sign up by over two is one. And I get a speed of Omega art in the negative either direction, which is an Omega God wants the speed. That's indeed the correct. Dan said you can satisfy yourself at various times is going like this.

Speaker 2:          00:50:13       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       so let's sneak in one more bit of native here, which is to take the database to off the derivative and that's a very important result. If you do that, uh, let's take one more deliberative. Let's try to lose part it and the head so I can just write down the answer for take one more date of it to the sign is going to become a cost sign and yield and other Omega discourse and is going to become a minus sign and give me another omega. If you do that, you will find the whole answer as equal to minus Omega Square Times. Just the vector art itself.

Speaker 1:          00:50:50       That's a very interesting result. It tells you when a particle moves in a circle, it has an acceleration in the negative art direction, namely directed towards the center. What's the magnitude of that acceleration? I write it without an Arrow here. That's equaled Omega Square Times. The magnitude of this vector, which is just our, but now I can also write it as we squared over r. So here ready. This is a very important formula. I don't know how many kids generation after generation get in trouble because they do not remember the following fact. So I'm going to say it once more with feeling when a particle moves in a circle, it does an acceleration towards the center of this size B squared over r.

Speaker 3:          00:51:46       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       but it's simple. It comes from the fact that velocity is a vector. Then you can change your velocity vector by changing your direction. It's sparkle is constantly changing its direction, but it therefore has an acceleration. And the acceleration we have shown here is pointing toward the center. And the size of that is we squared over r. So for example, if a car is going on a racetrack and you seeing it from the top, if the gas pedal says 60 miles per hour speedometer, you might say it's not accelerating. But that's the lay person's view. But it was going in a circle. You will say from now on that Indian has an acceleration even though no one's stepping on the accelerator of Amount v squared over r.

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       So that's a very important thing. That's the part, uh, that's what you're learning in this course. The fact that when you step on your gas, you accelerate. Everybody knows the fact that when you go in a circle, you accelerate this. What we're learning here, and it's coming from the fact the end velocity is a vector and there's change can be due to change in the magnitude or change in direction. This is the problem with the magnitude of velocity was nailed down and fixed at Omega are the direction is constantly changing. Okay, so I'm going to now, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:53:04       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       do a second class of problems. We will return to this issue later. By the way, one thing I should mention to you, suppose the particle is not moving in a circle, but does this, let's take a circle and just keep a quarter of the circle. [inaudible] this part, when you're doing a of a circle, the supposed to be quarter of a circle, you have the same acceleration directed toward the center. In other words, you don't have to be moving actually in a circle to have the acceleration at any instant. Your motion, if it follows any curve locally can be approximated as being part of some circle, right? You can take circles at different size and place them against your trajectory and see which one fits. That's the are we squared over r is the acceleration directed toward the center of that circle?

Speaker 3:          00:53:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:00       One miscellaneous result, which we don't use very much now, but which I should mention to you is the following. Suppose this is the ground with some audit in here. That's a plane with some audits in here and in the plane. That is some other object. What's the location of the object? Let us say P for Plain d for ground o for object. I think it's clear the position of the object with respect to the ground. This vector is the same as the position of the object with respect to the plane. Let's position of the plane with respect to the ground.

Speaker 3:          00:54:43       You agree? Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       this is the pictured here. Maybe we can start taking dinner with this of this with respect to time and that will say the velocity of the object with respect to the ground. The last of the object with the SPEC that the plane by last year, the plane, it's a Spec to the ground. That means if you're going in a plan and you throw something up in the air, it seems to be going up and down to you, but if I see you through the glass, the object is going on some trajectory which has got both up and down and horizontal motion and this is the rule for adding velocities. So when you have a velocity in the moving plane frame and you want to find the velocity on the ground, you should add to every object in the plane, the velocity of the plane with a Spec to the ground. That's intuitively clear. You use it all the time, but maybe along one dimension, but this is the way to do it in two dimensions.

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       That may be some simple problem involving this in the problem with science, so I'm just going over this. Okay. The problem we wanted to do today, whole family of problems looks like this. I want to consider the particle which has definite acceleration, a constant one, but a is now a vector. The question I have is what does this location at all future times? I think you can tell by analogy with what I didn't want to mention that the position of that object or any time t is going to be the initial position plus Velocity Times d plus one half 80 square, everything is the same as in one d except everybody's a vector. No initial position is a pair of numbers. Initial velocity is a pair of numbers. Once you know those, you can find the position of the object at all future times. So let's take one simple example.

Speaker 3:          00:56:43       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:56:45       So that if somebody's in a car and decided to fly off and we want to know, as you can tell, our concern is where does the car hit the ground? When does the car hit the ground? That's the problem in two dimensions. So how do we solve this problem? We pick up origin to be this point here. Let the height of the building be h cod is traveling with some initial speed, be zero in a horizontal direction. This equation is a part of equation one along x and one along. Why? Right for the x part I'm going to write x is equal zero plus v Zero t and s zero I'm going to be Tuesday to zero by choice of my origin being here, they scored in the cart is the zero because this is my audition.

Speaker 3:          00:57:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       How about the white coordinate? The equation for the white cord in it is the height of the building. The velocity has no vertical component that is no v y but it has an acceleration of mine is g. So this is the fate of this person at any given time, t a t equals zero. You have him right on top of this edge that all foods at times excellent proceeds as if nothing happened and then why you're falling. And if you want to know something, like when do you hit the ground? I think it's fairly clear what you have to do. For example, if t star is the time you hit the ground, then t star satisfies the equation. H minus one half g do you start square to zero? You saw it for the t start from this one and you put it there and that tells you where you land. I don't think I have to actually do that step. I'm assuming you can fill in the blanks, right? Solve this equation for t star. Put it there and that's where you land. Okay, that's one class of problems. So here's the second class.

Speaker 1:          00:58:58       The second class is the most popular application of what I'm doing now, but I want you not to memorize every formula. The book gives you what this problem. That's the problem with predict tidal marsh predict tile motion. You start here and you find a predict tile with some velocity be not at some data and it's going to go up and it's going to come down. One question is where does it go into land? Other question is at what angle should you find your project child? So we'll go the furthest so you can find the equation, but you got to think a little bit before you solve everything. It's good to have an idea of what's coming. So you imagine you've got this monster cannon fire things. It's got a fixed speed being art and how do you want aim it so you can be most effective as far as you can. Well there are two schools of thought. Okay, one says aim at your enemy and fire like this. Then it lands on your foot because assuming the candidate has said zero height, the cannon balls certainly comes out towards the enemy but has no time of flight.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:00:11       other one says maximize the time of flight and you point, it can't end like this. So it goes up, stays in the ad for a very long time, but it falls on your head. So we know the truth is somewhere between zero and 90 a naive guests may be 45 but turns out naive is actually correct. So I just wanted to show you how that comes out, but I don't want you to cram this formula. This is the kind of thing you should be able to deduce. Let's go back to the same thing I wrote earlier. X equals zero plus. What's the hardest onto velocity? Horizontal Velocity is v zero cost science data. So x is v Zero Course [inaudible] times t and Y is v zero sine theta famous t minus one half g t square.

Speaker 1:          01:01:07       Okay, so now we know everything about this particular, I told you once, you know the three parameters are not in be knocked. You know everything about the future of the object. So let's ask what's the range ranges that distance. So what's the strategy for rain? You see how long you are in the air and the whole time you're in the air you're travelling horizontally at the speed. So again, let t star be the time when you hit the ground. So you said Zero Equals v zero scientists that minus one half g t star [inaudible] star. I just pulled out a common tea so I'd say so you on the ground on two occasions. One is initially we are not interested in that. Well if the time they are interested in is not zero yet allowed to cancel it and get the time from here and that time is t star equals to v zero scientists over g.

Speaker 1:          01:02:09       That's how long you had in the air. This says if you want to be in the air for a long time, maximize sine theta, so you may think it's 90 degrees is the best angle, but that's not the goal. Goal is to get the biggest rain to go back to x and put your family for t star, which is two v zero scientists over g and that becomes B Zero Square over g times to sign theotokos sine theta. If you go back to your trigonometry, you should find that is really the formula for sign to Tatum. That's another example of where knowing the true guidance is very helpful.

Speaker 1:          01:02:59       Okay, so this tells you exactly what you want. It says make sign to data as big as you want, and that tells you who theta is going to be. 90 and data's going to be 45 but it's not from a naive guests that it's halfway between zero and 90 turns out to be. This are the fairly complicated balance between the time of flight and the range. So some people memorize this. I would say don't do that because after a while you won't have room in your head for anything. Just go back as often as possible to this formula and work your way from there. No, there's more variations, but it's always the same thing. Here's another variation in my days. They will say, find out when you want an object to go through that point. And I tell you the muzzle Velocity v not what are our, I tell you at what angle I fired it. I want you to find the speed so it'll land here. So how would you do that problem? You do that problem by saying, suppose this actually happens at some time. T at that time, t the x coordinate must have a certain value. They go to the ECC creation and demand that this vehicle, the desired x value and find the time. I take the time and put it in the white equation and demand that the why I get agree with this. Why if you do that, you will find that it's one unknown, which is v. Dot. And they can consult for Bina.

Speaker 1:          01:04:36       This is the most general problems. You can have the textbook, of course people make them interesting. Suddenly there's a mountain and that's the physicist hiking on this mountain. See, you're already laughing. So it's not a very credible problem that we don't hike. And when we get stuck, we don't want food. We want our table of integral switch. What we want somebody to sent to us. So these problems are embellished in many ways, uh, to make you all feel involved. For example, instead of a stone dropping nowadays, there's a monkey that's falling down. So the people in life sciences field, hey we are, we are represented in this, but all those creatures with a very interesting, in the end you are told, you know that's a hard set inside a railway carriage and you cannot see the horse but the horse is moving. You can deduce it because the candidate is moving the other way.

Speaker 1:          01:05:31       Does it picked it up? A horse picture of a carriage, all the glossy stuff. Then it says treat the horses, appoint particle. See, that's what we learned in the old days. But nowadays it's a hardest. But in the end if you're going to treat this appoint particular seems to meet the real waste. If you're the Godfather, right? You want to get the contract for Johnny Fontane. You don't tell your constant Larry a Tom put a point particle on Jack's bed, right? When you want a horse, use ours. When you want to point particle, if you wake up and find a point particle on your bed, what's the reaction? So I think these extra pictures, sometimes they're helpful. Sometimes they just, the cost make the book costs a lot more. That are problems where the hearts must be treated. We will see when we study rigid bodies, even their horse is not really a rigid body unless it's been dead for a long time. At least there. The fact it's not a point particular is important. So I think reason books are bigger and bigger, but still do the same information to set examples are more than more interesting. Sometimes they serve a purpose, sometimes they're distracting, but I haven't written a book in this field, so I will not say anything more.
