[CLAPPING]

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:07.660
LASZLO SYROP: All right.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.090
Well thank you, Regina, for
having us and hosting us,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.960
and for the kind words.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.060
Before I get started, I'll
do a quick presentation.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.410
But just to give you a
sense of my background,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.700
I graduated in May
from the Wharton School

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.270
at the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.720
And before that, I worked
in management consulting

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.040
at BCG and in private equity.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.010
I graduated from
Brown University.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.180
I grew up in Los Angeles,
and I now live in New York.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.839
I'll try and take a
very short 10 minutes

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:37.630
to just give you a
little bit of background

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.540
on our organization,
the Wharton 22s.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.740
And hopefully that will lead to
a rich discussion between all

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.140
of us and all of you.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.110
So who are the Wharton 22s?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.300
As Regina mentioned, we
are a student-led group

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.930
of Wharton MBAs.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.930
Our membership is
all-male, and we

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.980
work in close concert
with the Wharton Women

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.040
in Business
Association, or WWIB,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.470
who are Wharton's premier
women's affinity group.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.380
Because it always comes up,
I'll tackle it early-- the name.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.300
Our name, the Wharton 22s, is
a tongue-in-cheek reference

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.960
to the current pay gap between
men and women in America.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.560
The average-- median woman makes
22% less than the median man.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.690
And yes, it is a little
bit of a weird name.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.780
I won't take credit
for it myself.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.990
And it's not the only issue
that we concern ourselves with.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.890
But it is a great
opportunity for us

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.690
to start a dialogue
about gender issues

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.790
when we introduce ourselves
to a new audience.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.710
We have 34 male officers
and 320 pledged supporters.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.750
And when we talk about
pledged supporters,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.070
this is the pledge that
we're referring to.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.630
I'll let you all
read it for yourself,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.160
but essentially it boils down
to three basic commitments

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.710
we ask of men at Wharton.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.130
And that's a commitment
to support gender equity

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.830
efforts around us, a
commitment to understand

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.300
our own role and
our own actions,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.290
and a commitment to connect
productively with others.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.830
And through our
efforts, to date,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.450
the 320 male pledgees of
the 22s represent about 1/3

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.690
of all men at Wharton.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.800
We the 22s hope to see a more
equitable world with respect

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.727
to gender issues.

00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:31.810
And we recognize that the
business community plays

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.090
a vital role in shaping that.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.710
Unfortunately, there's still a
lot of progress yet to be done.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.400
Recognizing both that
men are frequently

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.000
the sources of gender
inequity and that many parts

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.680
of the business world are
currently disproportionately

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.950
male, we feel that
male-led activism

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.070
can be an effective
complement to the efforts

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.460
of our female counterparts.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.570
And this is an idea, frankly,
that we can't take credit for.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.690
The Wharton 22s was
initially founded

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.960
with the support of WWIB,
who saw this as an area

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.970
for growth and
engagement, and sought out

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.500
a group of male
leaders on campus

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.450
to help foster these efforts.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.580
That said, our ethos is one of
recognizing that privilege--

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.490
and in our case,
male privilege--

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.630
imposes more obligations.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.630
As men, we inhabit
spheres where women may

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.256
be absent or underrepresented.

00:03:25.256 --> 00:03:26.630
And as men, we
have opportunities

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.000
to engage men who may be
resistant to women's voices.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.040
Lastly, as men, we often benefit
from an unequal status quo.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.210
And for those of us who
are involved in the 22s,

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.721
we recognize an obligation to
help change that status quo.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.220
So that's a very
high-level overview

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.830
of who we are as the 22s.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.092
But why are we relevant
for a company like Google?

00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:51.050
I would argue that the
challenges that we faced

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.130
in forming, organizing, and
sustaining our organization

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.080
are actually very similar
to the ones that you

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.650
would face at Google, or frankly
at any large organization.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.150
And because of that,
our experiences

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.275
can be valuable for the
community here as you think

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:05.550
through whether this is a
strategy you want to pursue

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.680
and, if so, how you
might go about doing it.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.330
There are five specific areas
that I would highlight quickly

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.560
which we've grappled
with in building the 22s.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.894
And I'm going to cover
them pretty quickly,

00:04:15.894 --> 00:04:17.810
but hopefully we can
continue to build on some

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.470
of these in our discussion.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.310
So first is the existential
question of representation.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.630
What does it mean to
be a male ally, what

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.300
does it mean to be
an ally, and what's

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.930
the role of men in a
conversation that primarily

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.950
affects women.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.240
How do we stand
up for the issues

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.750
that we believe need
change without drowning out

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.150
the voices of women who have
been active in the discussion

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.654
for so long.

00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:44.320
I think this is really
important for us.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.600
And for the men in
attendance, if you leave here

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.530
with one thing, I would
say remember this.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.290
Our view is that being an ally
requires humility, empathy,

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.060
and courage, but
humility first of all.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.070
And that's the
humility to understand

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.950
that you don't have the
same lived experience

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.350
of your female allies.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.200
And rather than viewing
yourself as a change agent who

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.100
has all the answers, instead
see your mission as one

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.010
to listen, to understand,
and to support.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.410
I think, you know, just
to reiterate one thing,

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.290
which is in the
business community,

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.500
and I think particularly
in technology,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.810
there's an attitude that
coming with a solution first,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.190
being willing to move
fast and break things,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.410
is the solution
to all situations.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.190
And I think that often we
forget that, in social issues,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.510
sometimes listening, taking
a step back, admitting what

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.690
we don't know, and being
willing to be wrong

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.180
and being willing
to be vulnerable

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.850
can be even more impactful.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.520
Second, and more practically,
the question of recruitment.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.920
How do you get men to care
about this issue who should

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.460
be part of a male ally group.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.280
We take a multi-pronged approach
here to the work that we do,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.650
and we try to appeal to
men on multiple levels,

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.980
ranging from the pure
ethical-- the purely ethical

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.320
to the more self-interested.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.270
Some of the things we
emphasize at Wharton

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.920
are the ability to be
an inclusive leader

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.290
and collaborator in teams.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.590
I think there was an era
where the idea of being

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.870
a global manager was new to
the business school curriculum.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.260
And where we are
today, I see the view

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.430
of being an inclusive leader at
the forefront of what it means

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.970
to be a successful manager.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.470
Additionally, we'd
like to emphasize

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.190
that these are not
purely women's issues

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.080
that we talk about.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.890
Family leave policies
can affect both men

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.210
and women in the workplace.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.420
And we also address questions
of work/life balance

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.519
for men, the
question of what does

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:39.810
it mean to be an active father.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.270
How do you address
issues of masculinity.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.800
And then lastly, it's obviously
the right thing to do.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.230
And I think most people's
hearts are in the right place,

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.160
and we hope to help equip
them with better tools

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.710
to be that change they
want to see in the world.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.700
Third, programming.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.390
What do we actually do
as a male ally group,

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.162
and what tangible
measures do we take.

00:07:03.162 --> 00:07:04.960
We have a basic
framework for how

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.100
we try to engage with
our audience at Wharton.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.100
And that includes awareness,
dialogue, and activism.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.430
For each of these, we try
to develop programming

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.060
relevant for folks at
Wharton to-- first, to build

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.730
their awareness that gender
inequities still exist,

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.270
and what those are;
to foster dialogue,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.150
to help them connect
with their peers,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.780
and to listen to the experiences
of their female counterparts;

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.370
and to empower them
to be effective

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.960
advocates for change in the
environments they go into.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.562
In terms of awareness,
we publish articles

00:07:38.562 --> 00:07:39.520
in The Wharton Journal.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.310
We invite speakers to campus.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.960
We employ social media
campaigns to raise awareness

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.320
of various gender issues.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.090
And we have Lunch
Lecture series so people

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.850
can feel educated about
the topics that we discuss.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.880
To foster dialogue, we host
Candid Dinner Discussion

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.119
series, where people
can have a safe space

00:07:58.119 --> 00:08:00.160
to engage on these topics
and feel that they have

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.076
a forum within the
business school community

00:08:02.076 --> 00:08:03.700
and within the
professional environment

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.570
to talk about these
types of issues.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.400
And we host workshops to
help people understand

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.890
the various ways that
intersectionality can play

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.980
into this mission, as well.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.600
And lastly, in terms of
activism, the first step

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.760
we have is having the existence
of the 22s and our officer

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.270
board so that men who are
interested in the subject

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.220
can get more involved,
and progressively

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.870
continue to get involved in
the issue of gender equity.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.180
And secondly, we have
intensive workshops

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.919
where we work on empowering
MBA candidates with the tools

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.570
to make change
and intervene when

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:40.020
they return to the real world
and their professional lives.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.179
Fourth, the topic of discomfort.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.940
How do you manage
the awkward and often

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.650
threatening feelings that
can come with engaging

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.000
on a touchy subject.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.160
All of our work hopes
to create a climate

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.080
where folks feel safe discussing
these issues, empowered

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.382
to ask questions, and
comfortable being vulnerable.

00:08:58.382 --> 00:09:00.090
But I think the biggest
impact that we've

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.680
had in creating this type
of an outcome at Wharton

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.510
is by existing as a group,
by setting an example

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.600
that this is an
appropriate conversation

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.180
topic, by acting as role models
for other men who might want

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.630
to engage on the topic, and
creating a critical mass that

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.790
shows the outside world that
this is a topic of interest

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.750
to young business leaders.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.740
And lastly, what's
the best structure

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.950
for a group like this.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.317
How do you continue to
sustain an organization

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.150
like this, particularly
in a business school

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.790
environment, where we
have 50% annual turnover.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.520
I think today these are
probably the areas where

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.800
we have the most to grow.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.700
But luckily, being
in business school,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.533
we have a lot of
opportunities to experiment

00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:42.916
and try to get the model right.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.839
I know 10 minutes probably isn't
enough time to familiarize you

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:48.130
with everything that we've
done and all of the thinking

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.420
that we've done about the issue
of being a male ally group,

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.150
but hopefully this
gives you a little bit

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.090
of a taste for our work, how
we think about our mission,

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.050
and leads to a
good conversation.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.234
So with that, I'll thank
you for hosting us today.

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:04.150
It's really a pleasure
to have the opportunity

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.680
to share our efforts with
such a large audience.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.950
And if I forget to make
the plug again later,

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.700
I'll direct you all
to learn more about us

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.340
at our website,
www.wharton22s.com.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.220
And just to build on
Regina's earlier story,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.510
we'd been saying for a long
time we needed a website.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.760
But when I got a Facebook
message from Regina

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.520
saying that she'd
heard us on the radio,

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.330
it dawned on me and
our head of marketing

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.746
that we really needed a little
bit more of an official way

00:10:29.746 --> 00:10:30.810
to get in touch with us.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:36.050
So we can credit Regina with
the creation of our website.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.550
All right.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.400
Thank you.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.683
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:43.028 --> 00:10:44.890
ASHLEY WELLS: My
name is Ashley Wells.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.240
I, like Laszlo, recently
graduated from Wharton in May.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.250
I was at Deloitte
Consulting in DC

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.560
for four years before school.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.850
And, fun fact, I did my
MBA internship at Google

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:55.710
last summer.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.440
So I had noogler
training in this room,

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.657
and it feels very familiar
and exciting to be back

00:10:59.657 --> 00:11:00.240
with you guys.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.220
So thanks so much for
having Wharton here

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.467
represented at Google.

00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:04.300
ERIC YOUNG: Awesome.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.592
Thank you for joining us.

00:11:05.592 --> 00:11:07.550
Kan, you want to introduce
yourself to the half

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.633
the room you may not know?

00:11:08.633 --> 00:11:10.870
[LAUGHING]

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.160
KAN KOTECHA: Kan Kotecha
I've been here now 18 months,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.000
and I'm responsible for a
group called Biz Apps that

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.770
does everything from
[INAUDIBLE] engineering

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.950
for GDC through to what
we do with [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:23.777
Great to be here.

00:11:23.777 --> 00:11:24.610
ERIC YOUNG: Perfect.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:25.526
My name is Eric Young.

00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:27.960
I joined Google six
months ago, so I

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.880
guess I'm no longer
a noogler, but super

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.262
excited to be here today.

00:11:31.262 --> 00:11:32.970
I run a team called
Supply Chain Systems.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.880
I'm one of Kan's peers.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.074
So perhaps I'll start
with the first question.

00:11:37.074 --> 00:11:39.490
One of the unique things you
did was forming a male allies

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:39.990
group.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.869
Can you tell us
more about why you

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:43.910
think it's so important
and critical to bring men

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.368
into the conversation,
and what you

00:11:45.368 --> 00:11:47.990
hope to gain by their
engagement and involvement?

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.980
LASZLO SYROP: Yeah.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.980
I think I touched on it
earlier, but for us, there's

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:58.170
a recognition that it's not
solely the role of those

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.590
who are disadvantaged by the
status quo to see change,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.880
that those in a
position of privilege

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.900
have an opportunity and
also a moral responsibility

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.250
to be a part of that change.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.249
And I think the practical
matter is in the business world,

00:12:11.249 --> 00:12:13.040
there are a lot of
environments where women

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.000
are absent or underrepresented.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.540
And so it's incumbent on
us to use our position

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.150
in those spheres to be an agent
of change, and frankly, as men,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.310
to also educate ourselves
about what issues are faced

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.170
by our peers and
to look internally

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.199
to see what part of the
situation we play a role in.

00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:33.240
ASHLEY WELLS: Definitely.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.170
And I agree with everything
that Laszlo just said.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.404
But to offer a
different perspective,

00:12:38.404 --> 00:12:40.070
I think it's important
for men and women

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:43.760
to be engaged in the
conversation on gender equality

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.940
and equity, because it's,
frankly, a business imperative.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.110
Just to give an
example, Google actually

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.440
led a very pioneering
study, Project Aristotle,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.440
on what makes teams effective.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.160
And what makes teams effective,
the number one factor

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.180
is psychological
safety in a team.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.060
And psychological safety
is built on empathy

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.670
and it's built on communication
and trust within a team.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.600
And it's where each team
member can come each day

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.680
and be their full,
authentic self.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.460
And how can we expect
our teams to show up

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.060
every day with their
full authentic selves

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.150
without the presence of
diversity among our teams,

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.310
as well as inclusive
practices within our teams?

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.660
KAN KOTECHA: And
interesting that you've

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.010
chosen Wharton 22's group.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:33.210
And how did you think about
perhaps augmenting or being

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:39.600
a joint force with Wharton
Women in Business group?

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.707
So [INAUDIBLE] then that's
inclusive, it's a joint force.

00:13:43.707 --> 00:13:45.790
So just us understand why
it was important to have

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.400
this parallel initiative there.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.150
LASZLO SYROP: I think
there's a few things

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.400
we took into consideration.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.490
I'd say first off, we worked
very closely in concert

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.922
with WIB, and so we don't
operate 100% independently.

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:00.880
I think we communicate.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.504
Ash and I certainly
communicated a lot,

00:14:02.504 --> 00:14:04.040
and with Ashley
as co-presidents,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.130
we communicate a lot
about what efforts

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.630
we're focusing on,
getting by and making sure

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.890
that we're on the right track.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.190
But in terms of how we
specifically target and engage

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.210
men, I think our
mission is slightly

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.490
different from that of WIB.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.780
And I'll let you talk about
what WIB does more broadly.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.170
But I think for
us, the question is

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.890
more squarely about
gender inequity,

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.790
and particularly about
what men can do about that.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:33.680
And so one, that's
looking at educating men

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.300
about things that
maybe haven't been

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.550
a part of their consciousness.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.640
It's creating content for that.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.911
That's a unique experience,
because I think for women,

00:14:40.911 --> 00:14:43.410
this is something that they've
faced every day of their life

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.276
and every day of their
professional career.

00:14:45.276 --> 00:14:46.650
For men, this may
be a new topic.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.290
And so that approach
is different.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.670
I think secondarily,
there are issues

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:57.440
that are specific to men that
are of interest to them around,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.186
what type of father do you
want to be, how are you going

00:15:00.186 --> 00:15:01.560
to balance that
with your career,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.840
how do family leave
policies affect you.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.040
And I think by having
an independent group,

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.150
we're able to focus on curating
content for that audience

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.620
directly.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.060
ASHLEY WELLS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.720
And I think that
one thing that's

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.990
really important-- and
I'll speak directly

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.564
to the men in the
group, is something that

00:15:20.564 --> 00:15:22.230
was really special
about the Wharton 22s

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.470
is that it is really a male
initiative that's run by men.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.620
It is not Wharton
Women in Business

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.219
telling the men what to do or
how to run their organization.

00:15:32.219 --> 00:15:34.510
And that was really important
to us from the beginning,

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.760
was that this is something that
men took initiative on and led

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.327
in partnership with one another.

00:15:41.327 --> 00:15:42.910
The only other thing
I'll say in terms

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.510
of Wharton Women in Business
specific programming,

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.270
I think that there will always
be a very important space

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.100
for organizations that-- you're
a part of days like today,

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.560
where women have
time with just women

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.720
to connect on a lot
of the issues that

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.730
are important to us.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.930
And we need that safe
space among women.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.350
At the same time, I think there
are so many men that say, tell

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.570
me what to do, or how do
I get involved with this,

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.560
or this is a conversation that
I want to be a part of as well.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.070
And so having an
organization or a male allies

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.834
group such as the 22s is
that forum for so many men

00:16:15.834 --> 00:16:17.625
that want to be a part
of the conversation.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.992
ERIC YOUNG: Perfect.

00:16:20.992 --> 00:16:22.950
So gender diversity, as
you kind of touched on,

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.520
can be a tough topic for many.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.090
People often don't know how
to engage in the conversation.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.510
I think some of us may have
seen Grace Hopper's conference

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.396
that had a male allies
panel that went sideways.

00:16:32.396 --> 00:16:34.020
Others of us may have
saw it firsthand.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.119
Some read about it.

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:36.660
What advice would
you give to the men

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.097
in the room who are looking
to get involved in terms

00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:40.930
of overcoming some of
the fears and the ways

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.324
to engage effectively
with the group?

00:16:44.324 --> 00:16:45.740
LASZLO SYROP: I
think it goes back

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.630
to really thinking about
what the role of an ally is,

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.240
and being willing to listen.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.990
I'd say the first thing is to
recognize that you don't have

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.490
all the answers,
that you don't have

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.210
the same shared experience.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:03.830
And so if gender is an issue
you want to engage with,

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.839
ask questions of the
women in your lives

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.400
and when you're close to.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.849
Be open to hear the
feedback that they give you,

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.260
and consider how you can
make positive change.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.329
But look for that direction.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:18.320
Be willing to be vulnerable
about what you don't know.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.640
Be willing to ask questions.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.998
I think be willing
to fail, also.

00:17:21.998 --> 00:17:24.089
Be open to being called out.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:25.369
Be open to being wrong.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.130
Be open to putting your foot
your mouth and making sure

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.137
that you clearly communicate
this is something

00:17:30.137 --> 00:17:32.220
that you're interested in,
that you're engaged in,

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.580
that you're trying
to be better about.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.205
And you'll find
partners along the way.

00:17:35.205 --> 00:17:38.210
I think if we look at the
membership, the officers

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.670
of the 22s, we
certainly have folks

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.050
who have been involved in
gender issues and social justice

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.010
issues before.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.334
We also have folks who
have come to us and said,

00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:49.000
this is something I
want to learn about.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.790
This is a weakness of mine,
and that's why I'm joining.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.780
I think of one
particular member of ours

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.450
who comes from a background in
the military and special ops.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.019
He had never worked with a
woman before in his entire life.

00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:02.310
He's coming to business school.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:03.587
He has two young daughters.

00:18:03.587 --> 00:18:05.670
And he said, listen, I
recognize that I don't even

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.070
know what I don't know.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.680
I want to be a part of this.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.020
And this is going to be an
initiative for me to grow.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.660
And so I think about
that example as someone

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.150
raising their hand and
saying, I'm willing to fail,

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.910
but I'm willing
to-- but I'm also

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.150
ready to listen rather
than proffer a solution.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.400
ERIC YOUNG: I think one of
the great things you shared

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.150
with me just last week
in our conversation

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.922
was the advice to speak
with and not speak for.

00:18:27.922 --> 00:18:29.630
I thought that was
particularly powerful.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.840
And I thought it was a
good takeaway overall,

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.440
and the willingness as you say,
to make yourself vulnerable,

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.440
be willing to make mistakes.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.380
People are there to be
supportive and work through it.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.421
KAN KOTECHA: I would add
my own comments to that.

00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:45.100
As we talk about gender
inequality or diversity,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.794
this is something that I think
is important to all of you.

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:49.710
Ashley, I'll echo what
you said as well, which

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:56.360
is if you look at how technology
specifically is shaping

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.930
everything that we
do, and as females

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:04.960
as 51% of the population,
20% representation in tech,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.650
it represents such
a huge opportunity

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:14.550
to influence every aspect of
our society and the economy.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:20.560
And I think not
addressing it, I think

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.530
it's catastrophic in many ways.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.760
But it is uncomfortable.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.410
So I know when I'm writing
an email, whether it's

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.860
about gender inequality or
about diversity in the workplace

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.200
or civility in the workplace,
I have a lot of help,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.089
but I spend a lot of time
almost dissecting every word,

00:19:39.089 --> 00:19:41.630
because I'm really worried that
I'm going to offend somebody.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:48.770
Do I use the black community,
or how do I describe people?

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:53.160
And it's interesting for you
to say, be prepared to fail.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.780
That's very hard to do,
because you're actually

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.691
worried that, OK, did I
inadvertently offend somebody?

00:19:58.691 --> 00:20:00.940
And then how do you even--
I don't know whether you've

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.648
had the experience
of, how do you recover

00:20:02.648 --> 00:20:05.860
from something like that?

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.840
It's hard.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.590
That's very hard.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.930
ASHLEY WELLS: So going
back to the presence

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.840
of psychological safety
in the workplace,

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.090
it also needs to be a
safe space for managers

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.330
to sometimes make mistakes.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.100
And as a manager
or a leader, it's

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.530
your responsibility
to communicate

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.564
to your teams, look,
I'm open to feedback,

00:20:21.564 --> 00:20:23.230
all kinds of feedback,
and that feedback

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.780
can include difficult topics.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.180
And I want you to come
to me if there is ever

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.204
a time when you've experienced
discomfort or a time

00:20:30.204 --> 00:20:32.370
when maybe it could have
been more sensitive or more

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:33.369
inclusive.

00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:34.660
I want you to bring that to me.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.720
And I think that speaks so
much to just your confidence

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.880
as a leader, and also
your competence, frankly,

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.710
in leading an inclusive team.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.390
LASZLO SYROP: I
think also empathy

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.000
plays a large role,
because yes, it's

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.030
always going to be difficult
to put yourself at risk.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.470
It's always going
to be a question

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.460
about what's expected of me
and what's the right action.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.850
But if you start with
empathy and thinking

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.690
about, OK, let me put myself
in someone else's shoes,

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:09.520
I think that often
helps to clarify things.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.490
It's not a cure all.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.900
It certainly doesn't
work in every situation,

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.250
and sometimes it's difficult
to adequately imagine

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.280
what someone else feels.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.600
But starting from
that perspective,

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.400
I think, can help
you understand what

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.710
you should be watching
for, and look in the mirror

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:25.752
from outside of yourself.

00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:27.459
ERIC YOUNG: Obviously
personal discomfort

00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:29.570
is one of the key reasons
that perhaps men don't

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:30.580
engage in the conversation.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.600
What are the other
hurdles you see

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.010
about getting more engagement
in the conversation

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.980
and in the dialogue?

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.150
LASZLO SYROP: I think the
biggest one we face is apathy.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.030
I think at Wharton, and I
imagine at a place like Google,

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.240
you encounter very few people
who are actively antagonistic,

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.870
who say, I don't like this,
I don't want gender equality,

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.990
I don't want gender equity.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:55.220
I think the question is more,
why does this affect me?

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.750
Why is this my problem?

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:57.970
Why do I care?

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:03.400
And so I think that is one of
the main reasons as 22s, it's

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.610
important for us, I
think, as men to model

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.582
the behavior of being
engaged, of caring,

00:22:09.582 --> 00:22:12.040
and of being comfortable talking
about some of these issues

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.500
and how it affects us.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:18.320
And so that's-- how do you get
people in the door is a sort

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.650
of tactical challenge--
what type of programming is

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.050
interesting, how do
you market events,

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.050
how do you invite people to
be part of the discussion.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.740
And there's a lot
of ways to do that.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.650
But I think the core
challenge is just,

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.290
how do you engage people?

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:37.380
And I think often, that's
bringing it home for them.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.250
Sometimes we talk about no
matter who you are as a man,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.540
there are women in your
life who you care about.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.850
And if you are open to listening
to what they experience,

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.620
it's hard not to have empathy.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.650
And whether that's a female
colleague, a female manager

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.720
or a mentor, a family
member, a daughter,

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.390
that's often a starting point
for, I think, a lot of men

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.310
to recognize that they
care in some respect.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.620
Let me go a little bit deeper
and ask questions and listen.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.220
And I think that's
a snowball effect.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.190
As you start to become
more open to engaging,

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.350
you find more reasons
why it's important to you

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.940
for your personal ethics,
for how it affects you

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.344
and your family structure,
whatever that may be.

00:23:16.344 --> 00:23:19.010
ERIC YOUNG: I think it's a great
point you hit on, both in terms

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.820
of awareness-- unconscious
bias is something we offer here

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.350
at Google to teach
all nooglers as part

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.784
of their onboarding, the reality
that unconscious bias exists.

00:23:27.784 --> 00:23:29.950
I personally remember taking
that for the first time

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.770
before joining Google at Grace
Hopper's conference last year.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.830
And I remember thinking in the
room, I can outsmart the test.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.400
I can do well.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.580
I'm sure that this is not
going to surface anything.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.442
But it was super real
to watch the room

00:23:41.442 --> 00:23:42.900
go through this
kind of experience,

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.220
and see just how much and
how reality this really

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.322
is a situation and
opportunity to address.

00:23:48.322 --> 00:23:49.780
I think a lot of
people walked away

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.550
from that with a
new appreciation

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:55.718
about the importance, to
make a focused effort here.

00:23:55.718 --> 00:23:59.585
KAN KOTECHA: I've got one
other question, if I may.

00:23:59.585 --> 00:24:04.190
Laszlo, you touched upon
not having all the answers,

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.820
and the importance of
listening, which I think nobody

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.520
would disagree with.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.850
Lately, in some of
the conversations

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:18.700
I'm having, I think people
want a sense of actions.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.820
Let's do something about it.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.930
If we don't do
something about it,

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.640
this industry in
20 years' time is

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.100
going to look very much
like it does today.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.100
And in fact, if you look
over the last 20 years,

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.689
very unfortunately,
very little has changed.

00:24:31.689 --> 00:24:33.355
We were just talking
about this earlier,

00:24:33.355 --> 00:24:36.840
that there seems to be
this magic 20% number-- 20%

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:43.190
of females in Congress, roughly
20% of females in technology,

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.010
that we seem to be stuck here.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.690
So in your experience
in this journey,

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.670
when is the transition
point from going from,

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.500
hey, I'm listening,
I kind of get it,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.930
I'm addressing my own biases, to
some of the actions that you've

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.950
seen be successful around
changing the narrative

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.450
and really making
the kind of impact

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.240
that we'd all like to
see with gender equality,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.952
and I think other
issues of diversity.

00:25:10.952 --> 00:25:13.160
LASZLO SYROP: I think that's
certainly the challenge.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.780
It's how to get over that
hump, and we probably

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.140
don't have the answer for that.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.880
I think our
perspective is the best

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.420
way to get there, to whatever
the specific situation is,

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.020
the best way to get
to effective action

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.020
only comes once you've
had real discourse

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.780
and an inclusive
discourse, and one where

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.850
people are willing to
go beyond putting a put

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.270
a bright face on things.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.350
And so where we focus is
getting men into that discussion

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.390
and opening their minds
and opening their ears

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.340
to hearing a
different perspective.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.010
So I think that's where
we've traditionally focused.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.060
But unless you have that raw,
honest discourse and inclusive

00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:00.257
discourse, it's hard to have a
sustainable solution, I think.

00:26:00.257 --> 00:26:01.840
ASHLEY WELLS: So if
I could just build

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.760
on that-- just want to answer
the question in two ways.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.080
One, at Google, you guys
are really fortunate.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.766
You have the foremost innovative
people operations practice

00:26:12.766 --> 00:26:14.390
basically in the
world that are looking

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.140
at hard problems on
diversity and inclusion,

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.990
on things like hiring and
retention and big systemic

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.490
problems.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.364
So you guys are fortunate
that you have that.

00:26:23.364 --> 00:26:26.050
I think when it comes to play
in terms of action oriented

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.790
for the people in
this room is really

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:33.290
about small day-to-day actions
that each of us can take.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.950
So it could be as
simple as calling out--

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:40.370
being, let's say, a male
manager and calling out

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:44.380
other people on the team who may
interrupt women on your team.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.670
It could be looking at who are
you recommending for promotion

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.429
each year, and is there
gender representativeness

00:26:51.429 --> 00:26:53.220
amongst those you're
thinking of promoting?

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.070
And if not, asking yourself
the hard questions around why.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.271
And I really like the
unconscious bias trainings.

00:26:59.271 --> 00:27:01.270
We're looking to bring
those to Wharton as well.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.080
What I think is great about
those is the actual trial

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.320
and error of people
practicing out,

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.472
what does it mean to me
to take a small action,

00:27:08.472 --> 00:27:10.680
and then actually implementing
that in the workforce?

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.375
They need the practice.

00:27:11.375 --> 00:27:12.749
KAN KOTECHA: That's
great advice.

00:27:12.749 --> 00:27:15.990
I really like the way that
you-- you say it well.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.500
We can all make a difference,
and it doesn't have

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.020
to be these gigantic leaps.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.910
But the little things--
making this environment

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:28.220
the best environment that we
can make it for everybody,

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.074
is just so important.

00:27:30.074 --> 00:27:32.740
And one of the things that I was
thinking about this conference,

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.590
that I hope you guys have
all got out of it today--

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:40.350
and by the way, I use guys in
a gender-neutral way, which--

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.590
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.060
I probably got myself
into trouble just there.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.643
ERIC YOUNG: We'll
edit the video clip.

00:27:45.643 --> 00:27:46.476
KAN KOTECHA: Whoops.

00:27:46.476 --> 00:27:49.010
Talk about mistakes.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.626
People-- and I forgot
my train of thought.

00:27:52.626 --> 00:27:53.777
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:53.777 --> 00:27:55.360
ERIC YOUNG: I can
complete it for you.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:55.890
KAN KOTECHA: Small things.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:56.050
Thank you.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:56.700
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.060
ERIC YOUNG: I think there
was a great quote that

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.540
was shared with me
that kind of summarizes

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.986
both the points, which is the
standard that you walk past

00:28:01.986 --> 00:28:03.110
is the standard you accept.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.900
And I think that was a
very powerful quote to me.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.441
I think there's a
lot of small things

00:28:06.441 --> 00:28:08.830
that we can each do in
our everyday interactions.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.570
And it's those small things,
it's the cumulative efforts

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:14.240
of many people engaging
and actually speaking up,

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.680
recognizing both the supportive
work that's being done

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.140
as well as providing feedback,
assuming best intent,

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.290
but providing feedback
so that we can all

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.240
kind of hone our communication
or perform better.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.470
So I certainly want
to recognize that.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.216
If you see something, definitely
take a moment to recognize it.

00:28:29.216 --> 00:28:31.340
I want to thank our panelists
for their time today.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.080
I really appreciate all
the time and discussion.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:33.740
Thanks so much.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.500
