00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:03.971
- HELLO, I'M DREW DROEGE.

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:06.473
I'VE BEEN DRINKING HEAVILY,

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:10.110
AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU
ALL ABOUT THE REAGANS.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.282
RONALD, NANCY, AND OTHERS.
GET READY.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.684
HU--OH, HI.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.753
SO, IT'S 1949.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.222
A YOUNG ACTRESS NAMED
NANCY DAVIS

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.559
SOMEHOW GETS ON
A COMMUNIST BLACK LIST.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.261
SHE KNOWS I GOT--I GOT
TO TALK

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.062
TO THE PRESIDENT OF
THE SCREEN ACTORS' GUILD,

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.831
RONALD REAGAN,
BECAUSE HE'S GONNA HELP ME.

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.399
HE WAS IN A MOVIE CALLED
 KNUTE ROCKNE,

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.402
AND HE WAS IN
 BEDTIME FOR BONZO.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.372
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER
RONALD REAGAN WAS VERY LIBERAL.

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:40.807
THIS IS A GUY WHO'S LIKE,
HEY, I'M AN ACTOR,

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.911
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE--OF
THE SCREEN ACTORS' GUILD,

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:46.847
I LOVE MY LIFE, I'M HOT,

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:49.316
AND PRO-UNION
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.651
THEN SOMEBODY SAID TO RONNIE,

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:54.187
LIKE, THIS ACTRESS, NANCY DAVIS,
WANTS TO MEET WITH YOU.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.689
RONNIE SAW NANCY AND WAS LIKE,

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.392
SHE'S HOT, I'LL MEET HER.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.560
SO THEY MET
FOR DINNER AFTERWARDS,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.630
AND NANCY WALKS IN,
AND SHE IS BANGIN'.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.601
SHE'S LIKE
GOT IT ALL HAPPENING.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:11.705
SPILT--I SPILT ON MYSELF.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.106
DO YOU HAVE ANY DRINKS--

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:16.243
DO YOU HAVE ANY GLASSES THAT ARE
ANY SMALLER--SMALLER LIPPED?

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.946
- WE BROKE INTO THIS PLACE,
I DON'T KNOW WHOSE IT IS.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.247
- WHERE ARE WE?

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:23.884
- [laughs]

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:26.053
- DURING DINNER, AND YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS LIKE,

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:29.456
I'M ON A BLACK LIST
OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY,

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.326
AND HE'S LIKE--HE WAS LIKE,
WHAT?

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.529
AND SHE WAS LIKE, YES.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.431
AND HE WAS LIKE, I CAN'T.

00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:39.733
YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE
A COMMUNIST TO ME,

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.301
AND SHE'S LIKE, I'M NOT.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.869
THERE WAS NOTHING COMMUNIST
ABOUT HER,

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.207
SHE WAS ALWAYS
RABIDLY CONSERVATIVE.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.276
HE GOT TO THE BOTTOM
OF THINGS

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.044
AND REALIZED IT WAS
A CLERICAL ERROR,

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:53.380
SO HE GOT HER OFF THAT LIST.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.817
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
LET'S FALL IN LOVE.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.086
BOOM.

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:01.088
HOLLYWOOD.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.025
- YEAH, SO JUST--
PRETEND YOU'RE NANCY--

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:06.593
- I'M BEYOND WASTED.
- PRETEND YOU'RE--

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.229
- I'VE HAD A BOTTLE--
I'VE HAD A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.231
SO TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME
TO DO.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:12.799
- JUST PRETEND--
- LIKE I'LL DO WHATEVER

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:13.967
THE [bleep] YOU WANT ME TO DO,

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.236
BUT I--I WANT--I WANT
TO MAKE A GOOD SHOW.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.338
- [laughs]

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.273
- OKAY, YEAH. OKAY.

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:22.609
THE REAGANS WERE MARRIED
IN 1952.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.645
NANCY, YOU KNOW,
DEFINITELY CONVINCED RONNIE,

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.981
WE'RE--WE ARE HAS-BEENS.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.050
LIKE WE--WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT
IN HOLLYWOOD.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.587
YOU NEED TO BE
MORE CONSERVATIVE.

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:36.289
OW. OH, [bleep].

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.492
- YOU OKAY?
WHAT'D YOU DO?

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.227
- I'M FINE.

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:45.265
I STABBED MY OWN EYE OUT.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.700
- I DIDN'T LE--
- WHAT?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.201
- HOW DID YOU STAB
YOUR EYE OUT?

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:52.272
- LET'S BE FAMOUS,
YOU KNOW, POLITICALLY,

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:55.575
AND BECOME THE--THE FACES
OF CONSERVATISM?

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.310
SHE WAS BASICALLY LIKE
HIS MANAGER.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.348
YOU NEED TO BE THE MOVIE STAR
THAT YOU ARE, ALWAYS SMILE,

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:06.286
AND HOLD YOUR HEAD TO A HALF,
45 DEGREE RIGHT ANGLE.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.855
I THINK SHE, IN HER MIND,
RAN HER OWN STUDIO,

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.558
AND--AND--AND SHE HAD
ONE--ONE PLAYER,

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.060
AND THAT WAS RONALD REAGAN.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.732
REMEMBER, BUSINETH--BUSINESS.

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:20.734
SO IT WAS 1964.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:23.737
BARRY GOLDWATER WAS RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT,

00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:27.074
A HYPER-CONSERVATIVE,
A BORING HUMAN BEING.

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:28.875
THEY EMPLOYED RONALD REAGAN,

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.979
WHO WAS THIS FAMOUS, GREAT ACTOR
TO GIVE THE SPEECH.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:37.250
IN THE SPEECH HE SAID YOU CAN
EITHER GO RIGHT OR LEFT.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.720
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS,
IT'S EITHER UP OR DOWN.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.059
AND UP, YOU CA--YOU CAN CHOOSE
TO BE UP

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.197
TOWARDS INDIVIDUALISM,
OR DOWN

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:54.468
IN THE DEPTHS
OF TOTALITARIANISM.

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:58.004
PEOPLE WERE LIKE,
WOW, I NEED TO WATCH THIS.

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:02.209
HE HAS A CHISELED JAW,
I TRUST HIM.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.544
I LIKE THIS GUY.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.847
AND SO LIKE, THEN HE GOT VERY
POPULAR WITH THE REPUBLICANS.

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:09.149
SO THEY WERE NOT
SUCCESSFUL ACTORS AS ACTORS,

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:11.651
BUT THEY WERE INCREDIBLY
SUCCESSFUL ACTORS

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.153
AS POLITICIANS.

00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:15.255
AND RONNIE BECAME
THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:18.525
NANCY WAS ALWAYS
ABOUT BEING FAMOUS ON ANY LEVEL.

00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:20.127
LIKE, IF I'M NOT GOING
TO BE A MOVIE STAR,

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:24.397
I'M GONNA BE, YOU KNOW,
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:26.900
ALL OF SUDDEN, IT'S THE '80s.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.568
HE STARTED TO RUN
FOR PRESIDENT.

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:30.370
HE MADE EVERYONE
FEEL GOOD ABOUT--

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.072
ABOUT BEING AMERICAN AGAIN.

00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:33.206
NANCY COACHED HIM.

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:37.210
NANCY WAS LIKE,
TALK ABOUT THE CHILDREN,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.816
TALK ABOUT, UM, HOLIDAYS,

00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:47.154
TALK ABOUT BOOZE,

00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:49.089
TALK ABOUT ALL OF IT.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:51.158
- [laughs]

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:56.163
- LANDSLIDE WON,
BECAUSE THEY WANTED A HERO.

00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:57.497
SHE WAS IN CHARGE.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:01.434
SHE DID IT, AND IT WAS--IT WAS
ONE GRAND PERFORMANCE,

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.837
UNTIL THE END.

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:07.240
PFFT, WHAT ARE WE--WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.975
- JUST, WELL--

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:13.046
- [burps]

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:16.750
- THE END--THIS IS BAD.
- HI, EVERYBODY--

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.685
- I JUST BURPED
ON COMEDY CENTRAL.
