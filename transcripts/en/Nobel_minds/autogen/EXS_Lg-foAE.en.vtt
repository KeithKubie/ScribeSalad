this very very intense spot that
immediately told me that there was a

immediately told me that there was a
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.270
immediately told me that there was a
particular sequence it so right away I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
particular sequence it so right away I
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.730
particular sequence it so right away I
got a lot of information and I knew

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
got a lot of information and I knew

right away there was something really
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.120
right away there was something really
worth looking at and you know little did

discovery showed that the telomere

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290
discovery showed that the telomere
 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.860
discovery showed that the telomere
sequence didn't contain DNA that was

sequence didn't contain DNA that was
 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.230
sequence didn't contain DNA that was
crucial to the cell therefore no

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240
crucial to the cell therefore no

during the process the telomere sequence
 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.910
during the process the telomere sequence
is simply to protect the chromosomes

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920
is simply to protect the chromosomes
 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.190
is simply to protect the chromosomes
from damage and is otherwise redundant

kid I read about Marie Curie and read

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100
kid I read about Marie Curie and read
 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.920
kid I read about Marie Curie and read
the biographies about the daughter and

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930
the biographies about the daughter and
 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.750
the biographies about the daughter and
Tobias is very sort of evocative place

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760
Tobias is very sort of evocative place
 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.700
Tobias is very sort of evocative place
because well you know this is Marie

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710
because well you know this is Marie
 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.770
because well you know this is Marie
Curie's place and I know it's very

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
Curie's place and I know it's very
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.780
Curie's place and I know it's very
affected by reading all about her and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790
affected by reading all about her and
 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.420
affected by reading all about her and
and it really grabbed me as an idea of

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430
and it really grabbed me as an idea of
 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.470
and it really grabbed me as an idea of
why why you'd want to be a scientist
