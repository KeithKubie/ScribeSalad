00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.029
Anyone looking at a bubble--
it seems to make them happy.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.350
They offer such amazing
potential for engineering.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.390
They're part gas.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.560
They're part liquid.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.410
They float.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.485
And yet they're
solid enough that you

00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:16.860
can manipulate
them to do things.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.640
 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.315
Our main focus is
finding better ways

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:27.440
to deliver drugs to the
body, though at the moment,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.920
for the vast majority of
diseases, if you're given

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.420
a drug, you're given it
as a pill or an injection.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.840
And it goes throughout
your bloodstream.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.520
Every cell in your body, pretty
much, is exposed to that drug.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:53.350
 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.364
If I say that the
complexity of what we do

00:00:55.364 --> 00:00:57.780
is the same as the complexity
if you were designing a car,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.015
I wouldn't be exaggerating.

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:02.210
 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.710
I love London.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.740
It's always fun to wander around
and find quirky bits of London,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.020
and just shoot for myself.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:19.060
 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.940
I didn't really know
anything about chemotherapy.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.960
I had no idea that it's so
toxic that the nurses have

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.536
to wear protective clothing
while they're injecting you.

00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:32.288
 

00:01:32.288 --> 00:01:33.412
You are poisoning the body.

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:36.875
You're being systematically,
seriously poisoned.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.045
What we're trying
to do is create

00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:42.100
a means of delivering
those drugs just where they

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.520
need to go.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.086
For example, in
the case of cancer,

00:01:45.086 --> 00:01:47.710
we need to get those drugs just
to the cells within the tumour.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.630
We don't want them
going everywhere else.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.670
You're so badly poisoned that
your immune system doesn't

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.330
work.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.950
Even a cold can kill you.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.810
And in fact, the
chemotherapy scared me

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.704
more than the idea
of having cancer.

00:02:03.704 --> 00:02:05.120
The bubbles do a
number of things.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.720
Firstly, they act
as a great vehicle

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.780
for putting the drugs in.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.361
The drug stays within the
bubble until we release it,

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:11.860
and so it avoids
it going everywhere

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.730
else around the body.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.770
Some of our bubbles that
we make are magnetic,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.230
so we can actually drag them
into a location using a magnet.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.880
We then use ultrasound to get
the bubbles to start vibrating.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.460
The vibration of
the bubble actually

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.445
helps to pump the drug
further into the tissue

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:28.570
than it would otherwise go.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.090
We get a much more effective
distribution of the drug

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.140
throughout the tumour.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.260
The first time that
worked in an experiment,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.920
and we got this huge increase
in the amount of drug delivered,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.635
that was tremendously exciting.

00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:43.030
 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.780
I have chronic fatigue,
because my body was so badly

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.110
hurt by the chemotherapy.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.880
If there was a way of
doing this differently,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.170
then I could have
had my life back.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.290
It makes me jealous to
think other people might

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.390
be able to be treated for the
same kind of cancer as I had,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.000
and they wouldn't
have to contend

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.010
with what I have to
contend with now.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.916
It's hard.

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:16.820
 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.430
We've got lots of talented
people doing maths and physics,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.310
doing brilliantly, and not
realising that they can have

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.840
such an exciting career
applying that in engineering,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.150
and somehow we've
got to change that.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.074
It does allow you to
change people's lives

00:03:31.074 --> 00:03:32.240
and the way the world works.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.810
And there are so
many huge problems

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.825
that need addressing
in the world.

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:37.950
Engineering has got a
massive role to play in that,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.430
and the more people
that realise that,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.888
and that we can encourage to
come and solve these problems,

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.745
the better.

00:03:43.745 --> 00:04:07.040
