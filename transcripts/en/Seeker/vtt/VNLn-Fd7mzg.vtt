00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.010
Gossip can ruin lives!

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.390
But could it also improve them?

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.440
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if sites
like Facebook and Twitter have taught us anything

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.809
- it’s that people love to gossip.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:15.809
It’s human nature!

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.860
And we’ve always been taught that it’s
a bad thing, and that we shouldn’t do it.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.940
But new research shows that may not be the
case.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.140
A study published this week in Personality
and Social Psychology Bulletin, finds that

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.941
hearing gossip, may actually help us adapt
to our social environments, allowing us the

00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:33.690
opportunity to self-improve and expose potential
threats.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.010
For their study, a team of researchers from
the Netherlands asked a group of participants

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.739
to recall an incident where they had received
either positive or negative gossip about someone

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:43.739
else.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.129
Then, they were asked to measure how that
gossip had affected their levels of self-improvement,

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.309
self-promotion, and self-protection.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.719
What they discovered, is that hearing positive
gossip tends to lead to self-improvement.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.519
In the sense that when we hear something great
about someone else, it indirectly suggests

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.820
ways that we can improve upon ourselves.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.820
Makes sense.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.019
But what about negative gossip?

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.140
How does that affect us?

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.970
Well, according to their findings, negative
gossip produces a two-fold reaction.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.970
On the one hand, it increases our self-promotion
- because in a weird Schadenfreude kind of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.410
way, it can be flattering to know that we’re
doing better than other people.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.000
At the same time, though, it also increases
our self-protection concerns - because it

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.040
signifies that we could also potentially be
affected by whatever negative treatments befell

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.810
the person we’re gossiping about.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.860
Obviously, these aren’t hard-and-fast guidelines
- and people react differently to gossip,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.360
depending on their personality.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.970
Which is why researchers conducted another
part to this study, where they assigned participants

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.840
one of two different personalities: a sales
agent who uses their knowledge and skills

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.860
to get ahead, or a sales agent who tramples
over others to demonstrate their superiority.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.230
In this example, they found that the people
who really cared about improving their job

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.210
performance through knowledge and skills,
were more likely to LEARN from positive gossip.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.130
Whereas those who trampled over others to
get ahead, typically felt threatened when

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.280
hearing good news about someone else.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.200
So how good of a person you are, is clearly
a factor.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.319
But there are also differences among genders.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.099
Women, for example, tend to be more fearful
when they hear negative gossip about someone,

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.129
because they’re afraid that it could happen
to them, too.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.519
Men, not so much.

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.900
In fact, men tended to be more fearful of
positive gossip, because it was seen as a

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.239
potential threat.

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.540
No matter how you react, it seems at least
one thing is clear: gossip causes everyone

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.510
to self-reflect - and in some cases, that
reflection can and does lead to self-improvement.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.799
Speaking of things to be fearful of, recently
we did a Test Tube episode on cyberbullying

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.090
- and whether or not it’s actually illegal.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.510
This has been a huge hot-button topic lately,
so if you’re interested in knowing more

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.709
about it, I implore you to check out that
episode at youtube.com/testtubenetwork.
