00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.270
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Are we on?

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.830
Hi, welcome to another
Google Maps API

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.690
Developer Office Hours.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.730
Today we'll actually be talking
about the Places API.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.500
And I'm joined by, to my
right, Andrew Bennetts.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.430
ANDREW BENNETTS: Hi.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.266
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Software
engineer.

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.550
And Marcelo Camelo.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.250
MARCELO CAMELO: Hello.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.890
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Who is the tech
lead for the Places API.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.870
So you may have seen, this
morning we launched Place

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.560
Photos and Radar Search.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.370
If you haven't seen that, go
and check out the Google

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.320
Developers blog.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.240
And I'll show you that
in a moment.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.840
But first, we have some news on
the Places API challenge.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.830
All the entries are in.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.960
Thank you for submitting
your apps.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.120
We've had some great apps.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.110
I just had a quick look before
I came down here.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.170
And we'll be displaying those
for public voting on the 12th

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.720
of December.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.490
So next week you'll be able to
vote on all the apps that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.800
people have submitted.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.945
And I think early next year
we announce the winners.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.540
So, without further ado, let's
talk Radar Search and Photos.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.780
So--

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.030
MARCELO CAMELO: You
want me to--

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.090
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Tell
me a little bit

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.950
about photos, maybe.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.800
MARCELO CAMELO: Let me answer
with Radar Search.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.270
I'll let Andrew talk about
Photos, because he worked

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.540
directly on that.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.720
So the idea with Radar Search
was to be able to return more

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.076
than just the 60 results that
we commonly return.

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:47.780
A lot of developers ask for the
ability to do stuff like a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.190
heat map, with being able to
show which areas the greatest

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.630
concentration of a certain
type of business.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.780
Or simply doing a real estate
website, and you're showing a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.530
specific property, and you want
to be able to show every

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.640
single grocery shop, or every
single school around the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.060
specific location with a much
broader viewport than just the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.170
one you usually are able to
show with 20 results.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.070
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So we actually
do have pagination as

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.260
well, right?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.155
MARCELO CAMELO: Not on--

00:02:22.155 --> 00:02:23.140
CHRIS BROADFOOT: On the
regular search.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.440
MARCELO CAMELO: On the
regular search, yes.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.610
So the pagination on regular
search is more aimed towards

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.795
you having a scrollable
list, ideally an

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:36.230
infinite scrollable list.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.120
But it only linked to 60
results in page of 20s.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.910
And the idea is that Radar
Search is initially we offer

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.630
200 results.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.080
And, depending on how it goes,
it can even offer more.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.320
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So if I want
more detailed results, I use

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.520
pagination for search.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.520
But if I want a huge amount--

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.845
and I think it's just the
location and a place reference

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:02.470
that comes--

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.730
MARCELO CAMELO: You get just a
location, so they can show a

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.800
point where the place is.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.350
And you get a reference,
so you can--

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.160
maybe on the user click---

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.740
display more details
about the place.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.690
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Cool, great.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.640
I can see some great
walk score sorts of

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.420
applications for that.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.120
So definitely some
cool things.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.810
And so all the filters
are available

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.420
for the Radar Search?

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.900
MARCELO CAMELO: Yes.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.310
You can search by keyword,
which is really nice

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.560
differentiator of
the Place API.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.580
So you can do search like we did
on the demos, just saying,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.250
nice views.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.490
It's not really a categorical
search.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.200
But it will return you places
that either advertise

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.820
themselves as having nice views,
or people have written

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.330
reviews saying that
it has nice views.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.110
You can also use type search.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.110
So you can search for bars or
restaurants, or any of the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.030
types that we support.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.280
You can also--

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.620
what other features
do we have?

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.410
ANDREW BENNETTS: It's all the
usual types and keywords and

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.440
categories.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.030
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, I think
one of the features that

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.130
people don't use enough
is the keyword search.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.785
I think that's a really
awesome feature

00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:17.300
of the Places API.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.269
So if you haven't used it
before, it searches over of

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.830
all of the data that Google
has about a place--

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.500
so reviews, the categories
and the tags that

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.930
are provided by place.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.450
MARCELO CAMELO: Even sometimes
the actual content on the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.610
place's official web page.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.000
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Oh, wow.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.130
OK.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.220
So it searches over things that
you can't even get back

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.440
on the Places API.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.170
We wouldn't be able
to do that.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:50.380
OK, so let's go over to a
demo of Radar Search.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.335
So this is on our Google
Geodevelopers blog.

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:57.390
So this was posted
up earlier today.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.550
So you can see here we're using
the heat map feature of

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.980
the JavaScript API to show the
nicest views in Sydney.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.210
So if I zoom in--

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.010
I can't zoom in.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.670
So you can see they're are all
situated around the harbor,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.830
lots around Darling Harbour.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.955
So this is quite an accurate
look at the best views in

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:19.205
Sydney, really.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.990
This is another one
of my favorites.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.820
So essentially you can look
for Chinese restaurants

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.610
anywhere, in any city, and
you can figure out

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.330
where Chinatown is.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.130
So you can see this quite
accurately locates Chinatown

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.670
in San Francisco,
which is great.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.400
ATMs in Manhattan.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.340
So I'm not sure exactly what
this one is indicating.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.180
MARCELO CAMELO: This pretty much
indicates that you have

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.120
ATMs all over the place.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.332
There isn't a ATM suburb
in Manhattan.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.110
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And
clothing stores in

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.360
Paris, this one's great.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.970
So you can see here, also, that
the search is limited by

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.830
the bounds.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.760
So it's actually the bounds
of the initial search.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.840
You can see you don't
get back any

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.760
results outside the bounds.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.453
So you can quite nicely limit
the results to just the area

00:06:21.453 --> 00:06:24.850
that you're interested about.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.720
MARCELO CAMELO: On this specific
demo, we've chosen to

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.050
display the results as a heat
map, but you're not actually

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.700
limited to it.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.040
You can use whatever you want.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.370
The other option just
to show results of

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.340
points or even markers.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.050
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Another
thing-- are the results

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.300
returned in any sort of order?

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.290
MARCELO CAMELO: Just
from the 20.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.540
CHRIS BROADFOOT: OK.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.870
So we're joined by Justin,
down in the Hangout.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.570
So Justin is joining us
from Mountain View.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.055
He's the product manager
for Places.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.100
Hi, Justin.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.050
JUSTIN CHU: Hello, how
are you guys doing?

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.990
CHRIS BROADFOOT: We
can't hear you.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.865
Are you?

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:15.130
JUSTIN CHU: I'm not muted.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.630
CHRIS BROADFOOT: We have the
local sound turned off.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.030
OK, so how excited are you
about these launches?

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.280
JUSTIN CHU: So excited.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.845
No, we've been working really
hard on these things.

00:07:31.845 --> 00:07:33.095
MARCELO CAMELO: Stop jumping
up and down, man.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:36.910
JUSTIN CHU: We've been working
really hard on these things

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.600
for a while now.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.950
And we're super pumped to get
these apps to developers, so

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.890
they can make their
applications even

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.720
prettier and better.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.600
So yeah, props to you guys.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.056
Obviously Andrew and Marcelo
sitting there, have been

00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:49.980
working so hard on
these things.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.880
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I believe
these are two of the most

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.830
requested features
at the moment.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.600
ANDREW BENNETTS: More results
and photos, yeah.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.200
JUSTIN CHU: Absolutely, yeah.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.490
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So on that
note, if you're interested in

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.940
having a new feature in the API,
we definitely listen to

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.640
that feedback.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.750
So go and file your feature
request on the issue tracker.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.000
There's links from the
documentation.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.315
The most popular ones definitely
catch our interest,

00:08:21.315 --> 00:08:26.230
and we try to work on those
as much as possible.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.410
So let's talk about Photos.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.900
ANDREW BENNETTS: Let's.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.539
So we now return photos as part
of our results in the

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.120
Places API.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.210
So on searches you just
get a single photo.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.952
And when you look up
the details for a

00:08:41.952 --> 00:08:43.419
place, you get 10 photos.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.420
They give them back
as [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.520
like place references.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.530
And you can fire off a request
to actually get the

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.780
pixels of the photo.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:02.610
So it gives you photos of the
place taken by Google users

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.870
pictures that you would find
on Google+ Local, and that

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.850
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.214
Places API.

00:09:11.214 --> 00:09:12.150
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Great.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:17.330
ANDREW BENNETTS: Make it much
more visually appealing

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.980
summary of the place in your
application, because you can

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.010
show a picture of it.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.960
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So who would
use this kind of feature?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.560
Is it the searching kind of app
so that they can display

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.110
some photos?

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.855
Or as a business owner, would
I use this to display photos

00:09:33.855 --> 00:09:35.105
of my store?

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.100
ANDREW BENNETTS: I would think
it's more the former.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.370
If you're a business owner,
you probably already have

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.640
photos of your own.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.020
You don't need to
ask us for them.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.540
Although, you might want to see
the user generated photos

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.810
that have been provided
to Google.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.120
So a bit of that.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.590
But mainly I think it's--

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.010
we'll see what people
do with it.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.560
But I would expect that it'll
be people wanting to show it

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.150
in their search results, and
show a little teaser photo.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.180
And then you can click
through and find out

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.230
more about the place.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.800
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So it's
probably worth noting that

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.700
both of these features are
available through the web

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.970
service and the JavaScript
API.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.110
So obviously, the demos in the
blog post are using the

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.865
JavaScript API.

00:10:17.865 --> 00:10:20.160
But you can do all of that
with the web service.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.580
So it's great for mobile
application.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.620
For example, you can still show
the photos quite easily.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:31.450
So if we switch over to the
demo, let's have a look at

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:32.700
some photos.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.460
So here we're using the
Places autocomplete.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.240
This is actually the search
box, which lets you do

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.410
unstructured queries
like, pizza.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.520
Or if I said P-I-Z-Z, it's going
to suggest to me, pizza.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.895
So I can say pizza-- any--

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.460
It's going to suggest
me something.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.540
So I can look for pizza near
Sydney, for example.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.580
So we're actually just getting
the photos and putting them

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.650
straight onto the map as
markers, which is quite cool.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.090
So you can get a quick view
at all of these results.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.400
ANDREW BENNETTS: Yes.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.810
At this point, the demo has
just done a search.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.570
And so it's just got
the one photo.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.930
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So what's
another good one?

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:19.195
Maybe--

00:11:19.195 --> 00:11:20.566
ANDREW BENNETTS: I
like meat pie.

00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:23.500
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Meat pie, OK.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.700
So meat pies.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.390
Let's have a look up here.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:31.820
This is my favorite
pie shop, up here.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.910
ANDREW BENNETTS: Does your
favorite pie shop

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.800
not have any photos?

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.850
You should upload some.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.310
CHRIS BROADFOOT: That's
quite sad.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.000
Pie in the Sky in Berowra,
by the way, awesome pies.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.140
ANDREW BENNETTS: There's always
good old Harry's Cafe

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.120
de Wheels in Potts Point.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.970
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Great.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.520
So we've got this little light
box that's popped up.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.250
It's just pulling
down the photos.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.960
Really straightforward
to implement.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.510
So you can add some great
variety into your apps using

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.370
this feature.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.440
So any other details on this?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.730
ANDREW BENNETTS: So you can
request the photo in any size,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.680
up to the size of the
photo we provide.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.460
You can say, actually I
only want that maximum

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:22.820
400 width or height.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.950
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So I think
we're actually doing that

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.690
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.822
ANDREW BENNETTS: We're getting
the photo and saying that we

00:12:27.822 --> 00:12:29.870
just want the little
thumbnail.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.840
And then we want it to fit
within the fixed size of the

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.090
light box there.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.990
MARCELO CAMELO: I think they
were talking about either max

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.850
height or max width.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.656
So it's really easy to make it
fit into a pre-defined grid or

00:12:48.656 --> 00:12:52.260
a pre-defined box.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.150
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And I believe
there's some attributions that

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.070
need to be shown as well?

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.570
That's the only limitation
on this setup?

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.463
ANDREW BENNETTS: Just like on
Place responses in general has

00:13:04.463 --> 00:13:07.150
an HTML attributions field,
this also has HTML

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.080
attributions as a field
on the web service.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.392
And so you just have to show
a little bit of HTML, so it

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:15.660
credits back.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.000
Basically, which user uploaded
the photo, or which

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.480
source it came from.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.455
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So if you'd
like to find more about these

00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:27.750
two features, definitely go and
checkout our Places API

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.450
documentation.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.950
You can get to that through
the blog post that's on

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.200
googlegeodevelop
ers.blogspot.com.

00:13:35.165 --> 00:13:36.145
So check that out.

00:13:36.145 --> 00:13:39.130
Or you can look at the Google+
post that was posted earlier

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.070
this morning.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:46.970
So that's an overview of Place
Photos and Radar Search, two

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.910
of my favorite features.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:49.120
JUSTIN CHU: Mine too.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.850
MARCELO CAMELO: I bet you
say that to everyone.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.250
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I do.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.310
I say that about all the APIs.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.380
ANDREW BENNETTS: You just
love APIs so much.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.630
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
I do love APIs.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.840
So anything else happening in
Places land, other than the

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.150
Places challenge?

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.000
MARCELO CAMELO: Heaps
of stuff.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.451
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Any cool apps
that you've seen recently?

00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:12.701
MARCELO CAMELO: Cool apps.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.900
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Justin,
do you have any input?

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.710
JUSTIN CHU: There was a recent
blog post on, I think,

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.850
Geodevelopers blog about QS,
a quick street view, which

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.950
essentially uses both the Street
View API as well as the

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.200
Place API autocomplete.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:38.360
And essentially it was a super
awesome demo of how--

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.860
virtually moving through the
world at a fast pace.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.630
As you can see in this demo,
it's just so much fun.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.060
Knowing that I can go to any
place in the world at any

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.770
moment in time, with the Places
API service the Street

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.250
View service is super
powerful.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.345
And I definitely wasted way too
much time on this, maybe

00:14:54.345 --> 00:14:55.280
even at work, too.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.801
But don't tell Andrew
or Marcelo that.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.410
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Let's
have a look at that.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:05.290
So this is, indeed, on the
Geodeveloper blog.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.540
So this is qsview.com.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.260
Start typing an address.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.180
Where do you live?

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:16.489
ANDREW BENNETTS: Funny.

00:15:16.489 --> 00:15:17.739
Funny.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:20.530
MARCELO CAMELO: Try Newport.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.270
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Newport.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.790
MARCELO CAMELO: Somewhere
else.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.800
CHRIS BROADFOOT: How about
NSW, because--

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.210
JUSTIN CHU: Type slower so that
people can see that it's

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.730
actually doing Street
View queries as

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.800
you're typing, as well.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.420
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Sorry,
my internet is

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.500
slow, for some reason.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.830
So if I just type N.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:39.860
JUSTIN CHU: That's
not going work.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.780
So keep going.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.030
CHRIS BROADFOOT: N-E-W-T--

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:50.800
oh, that looked like
an indoor inside

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.130
the New Orleans airport.

00:15:55.108 --> 00:15:56.358
How do I get into that?

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.650
P.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.135
OK, so this is some
guy's house.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.050
Newport Road in [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.150
That's an awesome name for
a town, by the way.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.400
So Newport Beach.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.730
Is that getting into
Street View?

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.890
What am I doing?

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.672
That's picturesque.

00:16:36.672 --> 00:16:37.690
JUSTIN CHU: It's very nice.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.430
Yeah.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:40.390
ANDREW BENNETTS: That's
pretty cool.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.280
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So now
we're finally at

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.960
Newport, New South Wales.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.850
Yeah, that's indeed Newport.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.090
But we want the beach,
don't we?

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.340
ANDREW BENNETTS: Always.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:07.710
CHRIS BROADFOOT: That's
not the beach, is it?

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.960
MARCELO CAMELO: Well, that
would be as good--

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.210
that's just down the street.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.910
CHRIS BROADFOOT: What
else would be cool?

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.160
Let's see if there's Mrs.
Macquarie's Chair.

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.660
Look at that.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.940
ANDREW BENNETTS: Such
a nice spot, there.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.910
Awesome.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.760
Anything else?

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.370
MARCELO CAMELO: Not that
I'm allowed to

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.060
disclose at this moment.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.150
ANDREW BENNETTS: I'd expect
eventually when the Grand

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.730
Canyon will be in
there somewhere.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:54.100
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So yes, next
mashup, QS view with Places

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.370
Radar Search, so you get all the
markers inside the thing.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.380
That would be awesome.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:17:59.506
JUSTIN CHU: Wow.

00:17:59.506 --> 00:18:00.790
Yeah, I agree.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:01.390
CHRIS BROADFOOT: A
challenge to you.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.640
ANDREW BENNETTS: Challenge
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:06.442
CHRIS BROADFOOT: OK.

00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:07.950
Well, that's it for this week.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.981
Stay tuned.

00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:13.540
Go to
developers.google.com/live/maps

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.260
for upcoming GDL events.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.350
And we'll see you next time.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.100
ANDREW BENNETTS: Thank
you, Chris.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:21.660
JUSTIN CHU: Thanks, Chris.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.100
Thanks, guys.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.350
ANDREW BENNETTS: See
you, Justin.
