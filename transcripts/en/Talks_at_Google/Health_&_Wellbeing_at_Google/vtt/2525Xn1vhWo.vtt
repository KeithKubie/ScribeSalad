[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.630
SPEAKER: All right, so
hi and welcome everybody.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.620
So today, we're here to
welcome Kerstin O'Shields who's

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.800
going to talk to us about
body language in business

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.960
and how to create
impact with it.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.870
So she has 25 years of
training in performing

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.484
in theater and opera.

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:22.650
Kerstin O'Shields has
acquired an in-depth knowledge

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.460
of all levels of medication.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.930
When she realized that the same
nuanced gestures, postures,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.425
and expressions impacted every
one of her contacts offstage,

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:33.300
she set about developing
the type of training

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.250
she experienced for
her stage career

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.800
and adapting to
the communications

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.290
of everyday life.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.532
Let's please welcome Kirsten.

00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:45.390
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS: Thank you.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.970
Thank you so much for
having me here today.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.710
It is a pleasure to speak
to you about body language

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.360
and how that can influence
your job here at Google.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.210
And I had the pleasure
of coming here early.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.234
I had a lovely tour of walking
around a few of the buildings

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:05.400
and really being able to
take in some of the culture

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.460
that you have here, and
I want to say I really

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.270
enjoyed how positive
it is here because you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.280
don't see that in every
single organization's culture.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.290
So I just want to
say from the get go,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.490
you guys have a really
enjoyable place to start.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.940
Now, how can we add very
specific body language

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.910
to your part of Google?

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.790
What you bring to what you
do here every single day.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.350
Now as mentioned, my
background is opera,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.290
and I've been
teaching and singing

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.530
opera since I was 20 years old.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.070
So I have a long
history with what

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.610
it is to perform
and engage people

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.280
for a very specific
amount of time

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.590
and how to bring
excitement to what

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.650
we're talking about or
singing, as I have done.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.720
And the way I got into helping
business people with this

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.020
is in my studio where
I teach students--

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.560
and my students range from
anywhere from fourth grade

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.850
to right now, currently
one of my students is 75.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.420
So I have a really fun
group that I'm working with,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.850
and I work with those
students for a long time.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.350
They stay in the
studio for a while.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.500
I get to know them.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.740
I get to know the families.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.690
And they'll graduate
from high school.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.620
They go off to college.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.860
They come back for
their vacation,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.180
and I want to get
together-- visit with them,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.326
see how they're doing.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.200
So we'll go out to coffee
because that's what

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.240
we do here in Seattle, right?

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.680
So we go out to coffee and I'm
going, OK, how's college going?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.020
And I had a few of my
students say to me,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.070
you know, I've been
performing with you for years.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.320
I'm comfortable onstage
when I'm singing,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.692
but I go to give a presentation,
and I feel awkward.

00:03:01.692 --> 00:03:03.650
And I'm freaking out
because now, all I'm doing

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.430
is focusing on my information.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.740
And so we started
talking about, well,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.840
why are you having a
hard time with that?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.270
And I invited a
few of my students

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.790
to come back to the studio
just to help them out.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.055
That was my purpose.

00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:20.430
I said, let's bring you back
to where you're comfortable.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.580
Let's take a couple of the
performance aspects that

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.290
just make you feel
good, and let's

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.390
put those in your presentation.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.010
And it worked beautifully.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.880
All of a sudden, their
presentations came to life.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.160
So we put that together,
they went back to college,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.620
they did their presentations,
they got a great grade,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.510
they're happy.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.218
Mommy and Daddy are
happy because they're

00:03:42.218 --> 00:03:46.750
the ones paying for college,
so everybody's happy.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.210
Now after doing
this a few times,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.430
I would go to
presentations like this

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.220
for my own personal
benefit, but now I'm

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.470
watching it through
a different lens.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.330
And as I'm sitting there
watching these presentations,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.360
I'm thinking to myself,
wow, these guys really suck.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.710
They are doing a terrible job
of presenting their information.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.529
They're so stuck on
their information,

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:21.079
they are not doing anything
to engage their audience.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.954
So their attention is 100% here.

00:04:22.954 --> 00:04:25.370
They have no idea how many
people are out in the audience,

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.640
or they have become
their own audience member

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.260
to their PowerPoint.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.360
So you're staring at their
back the entire time.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.540
How many times
have you seen that?

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.400
A few hundred times, exactly.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.220
So there's no
engagement happening

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.360
and we start to get bored.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.670
Now, here's the thing
about information,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.950
and this is tricky
in a group like this

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.120
because a good portion of
your job is about information.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.560
Would you agree?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.850
Yes.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.470
Here's the trick
about information,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.390
and you're smack in
the middle of it.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.810
Information is not
special anymore.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.230
Information is available
to everyone 24/7

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.390
at our fingertips, and
guess who made that easy.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.650
You.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.080
Guess who's
responsible for that.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.170
Google, because what do you do
if you want to find something?

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.350
Oh, I'll just Google it.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.560
You've made that job
press very, very easy.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.640
I can sit in my comfy
chair with my Doritos

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.220
and my dog at 3
o'clock in the morning,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.180
and I can find out information
about anything on the planet

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.480
because I'm going to Google it.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:52.550
So what that means now
is information is easy.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.080
We can get the information
without you being there

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.940
because you all do an
amazing job at your job.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.500
However, we as humans,
we're pack animals.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.660
We are built to
respond to one another.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.250
So yes, it's great
to get information,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.070
but when it comes to creating
the business relationship,

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.940
to working within
your teams, how

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.140
you interact with information
is now what's important.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.080
That's now what makes
the team successful.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.460
Everybody can bring
information, but what

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.000
are you contributing as a
team member to the culture

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.660
that you're in?

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.730
So that begs the question,
how are you showing up?

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.570
Your information is
there, it's available,

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.730
but how are you showing
up with your information?

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.580
How are you engaging
the people that you're

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.930
talking to with that information
to get them excited about it,

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.120
to understand it's
important, and it's

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.920
an integral part
of what needs to be

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.887
built into the system
you're working on?

00:07:07.887 --> 00:07:08.970
So how are you showing up?

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.430
That business relationship,
whether it's on,

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.950
you know, she and I are
just working together

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.600
on a quick little
project, or you

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.330
have to get together with
your team to build something,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.440
or even more importantly,
you have to present something

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.375
to your higher-ups.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.660
Not, what are you
showing up with?

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.970
How are you showing
up with that?

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.860
Do you see that distinction?

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.490
And it's such a
primal part of who

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.970
we are as humans because
again, we're pack animals.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.230
This is not as much of
the conscious brain,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.550
it is the subconscious
brain that reacts to this.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.480
And this is, in
business relationships,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.910
what makes some people seem, oh,
I just love working with Joe.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.980
He's so easy to work with.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.430
I always feel like he receives
my information very easily,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.460
and we can get a
lot done together.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.280
Or, working with Jack--

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.280
I always feel resistance
there, you know,

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.159
I really have to prove myself on
a regular basis with this guy.

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:18.450
I'm a little concerned about
talking to him about that.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.730
How you show up is how
you're letting people know

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.430
you want to be interacted with.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:35.500
It is your job to train people
in how to interact with you.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.990
And I tell my clients
on a regular basis,

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.715
if you're waiting for a
response, you're too late.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.970
What we reflect out is what
is reflected back to us,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:56.880
so it's about, how are
you presenting yourself?

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.590
What are you showing up with?

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.540
What are you contributing
to that particular business

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.380
environment?

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.450
Not just, what's
your information?

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.940
You have to make that
information important.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.940
You have to make yourself
important as a part

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:19.010
of that sphere of the
information and the team.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.860
Now, I already said, this is
a primal part of the brain.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.340
We have what are
called mirror neurons,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.320
and mirror neurons are what
start snapping and going

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.520
when we feel like we
connect with someone.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.710
And what happens is we start
to mirror what they're doing.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.030
Now, you see this all
the time at malls.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.160
You see little groups of
people, and they're all

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.270
walking around together.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.290
They have the same hairstyle,
they wear the same clothes,

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.770
they keep the same facial
expressions on their face.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.820
They now mirror in groups
because now, I feel

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.170
like I'm a part of that tribe.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:06.000
I am mirroring to
stay connected.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.050
Now, Hollywood has built a
multi-billion dollar business

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.060
off of this.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.810
You'll go to the movies.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.200
How many people have been
to the movies recently

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.160
or watch Netflix?

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.900
I mean, we can do
this at home too.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.220
But when you go to
the movies, you go

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.760
and you get your favorite
candy, you get your popcorn,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.930
you get your pop, you now
sit in a comfy little seat,

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.640
and the movie starts.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.580
And halfway through
the movie, the couple

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:43.190
breaks up, the dog dies, or
the car goes off the cliff,

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.725
and what are you doing
out in the movie theater?

00:10:47.725 --> 00:10:48.530
You're sobbing.

00:10:51.615 --> 00:10:56.640
You're just crying
responding to what you see.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.610
Why are you crying?

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.020
You have chocolate,
you have popcorn,

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.930
you have your favorite pop,
you are physically very

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.690
comfortable.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.106
Why are you crying?

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:12.740
You're crying
because those mirror

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.090
neurons have caused you to
emotionally connect to what

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.430
you're seeing in front of you.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:24.680
So now, you are the one
reacting as if your life has

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.360
become a personal train wreck.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.940
And those people aren't
even in the room with you.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.140
That's how strong those
mirror neurons connect.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.730
Now, think of how much higher
that level of connection

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.720
is going to go when
you're physically

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.490
in the same room as people--

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.420
it's even stronger.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.520
So we can't help but to
connect with each other

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.760
on that level on a
very regular basis.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.840
So what you reflect out is
what is reflected back to you.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.890
If you're waiting
for a reaction,

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.460
you're just reflecting
out what another person

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.230
has reflected to you.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.556
Are you going to wait
to get what you want,

00:12:17.556 --> 00:12:19.780
or are you going
to reflect it out?

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.610
And start to use that to create
the culture of connectivity

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.890
within your team.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.300
So taking this aspect
really goes back, again,

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.160
what are you reflecting out?

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.650
How are you showing up?

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.520
Because what we
physically see is

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.240
what we mentally respond to
and assume and what we also--

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.270
I just showed--
emotionally respond to.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.670
Let me say that one more time.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:58.090
What we physically see is
what we mentally assume,

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.560
and what we
emotionally respond to,

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.060
and again, this is
on a primal level

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.120
this is on a pack animal level.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:13.270
This is not on a "blue is my
favorite color" kind of level.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.410
OK, not on our conscious choice
aspect, on our subconscious

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.080
choice aspect.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.930
And that's why you'll have
one person walk into the room

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.990
and everybody goes,
oh, they're here.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.890
And all of a sudden, they have
this huge effect on the room

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.720
because they have
come in reflecting out

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:36.190
a very specific attitude and
very specific body language

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.110
that creates attention.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.130
Or, another person will walk
into the room and nobody

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.290
knows because they
are starting to use

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.382
body language to be hidden--

00:13:49.382 --> 00:13:52.450
to not be seen

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.450
And as pack animals and as
humans, we yearn to be seen.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.660
We want to feel included
because that's what we do.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.000
We're part of a tribe.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.720
And it was really interesting
and exciting for me

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.750
to sit in the cafeteria today
before this presentation

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.830
and watched the culture, and we
had a conversation about that--

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.890
of what's happening
here at Google.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.120
I would say one of the tribe
identifiers was actually

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.700
smiling.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.120
I don't always see that.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.680
So again, you're starting
at a very good point here,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.760
but are you walking in the
room to create culture or just

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.740
respond to it?

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.160
Now, I'm going to go into
very specific aspects of what

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.990
this looks like.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:47.960
What is very specific body
language that shows leadership?

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.950
That shows connectivity?

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.640
How do you create that
just by moving your body

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.560
very specific ways?

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.230
Now, I'm going to give
you two examples of what

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.700
this looks like.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.880
And I'm going to go back to
my opera days for a second.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.720
One of the characters
I played was Contessa.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.070
Now, this is countess in
"The Marriage of Figaro".

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:15.150
Now Contessa, she's very
regal because she's countess,

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.530
and she has a very
major role of being

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:25.370
distraught because you find out
at the beginning of the opera--

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.710
and she finds out
as the character--

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:33.350
that her husband, the count,
has cheated on her again.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.670
So for three hours
every night, I

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.330
had to keep my face like this--

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.980
my eyebrows really condensed.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.870
My forehead would
ache every night.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.670
I would have to rub my forehead,
loosen up those muscles,

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.410
and then I'm back again
with a very distraught face.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:58.070
But as Contessa, because she's
a countess and she's regal,

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.410
I had to keep my
posture very tall.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:03.050
I kept my body
very open this way.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.690
I never put my hands
below my weight

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.350
because that showed communality,
and she was of high status.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:15.410
However, I always kept my
palms open to the audience

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.040
because I wanted to show that
she wanted to be loved again--

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.660
she was open to
being loved again.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.150
So as Contessa,
you see her first

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.250
at the beginning
of the second act,

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.910
and she's sitting
on the bed and she

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:37.430
comes to the front of
the stage and sings

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.895
[OPERA SINGING]

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:11.599
Now in that moment,
she is begging for God

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:17.109
to bring back his love,
and if she can't have it,

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:18.200
she would just rather die.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.119
Obviously, she could
use some counseling.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:28.814
That's a given-- therapy
would help her, yes.

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:30.480
Unfortunately, Mozart
did not write that

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.760
into the rest of the opera.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.350
It had to come through
in a different way.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:38.400
However, it ended
with a happy ending.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.620
So if I were to grab this
glass of water as Contessa,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.370
I would walk coming this way.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.970
I would never put
my hands down again.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.300
I would still keep my face
very distressed and distraught,

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.630
take it back this
way, and walk off.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:05.670
Now, I played another
character called Anina.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.480
Anina was the servant
to the main character,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.300
Violetta in La Traviata.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.700
Now, you find out at the
beginning of the opera

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.790
that Violetta is
dying of consumption,

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.870
but she's a party girl.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.720
And she's not about to give
up that lifestyle, which

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.120
unfortunately, is killing
her faster and faster.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.050
Anina is the mother
figure to Violetta

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.450
but, because of her
status as a servant,

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.280
she has zero power to
do anything about this.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.730
So all she could do
is sit back and watch

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.640
this woman she considers
her daughter kill

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.390
herself faster and faster.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.310
So she's distraught
the entire opera,

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.080
and there I am for another
three hours every night--

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.690
forehead aching-- with
my face like this.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.410
So both of these
characters were coming

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:06.090
from the exact same emotional
status of distraught,

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.830
so my face was the same
for the two of them.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:13.230
However, as Anina, because I
wanted to show of lower status,

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:18.640
I wanted to show hard
work, and she was older,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.100
I wanted to show a
little bit smaller.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.490
Now, I can't slouch because
that's not good for singing,

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:28.170
so what I did is
I bent my knees,

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.390
and I kept my arms
very close to my side.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:35.750
And I never showed my
palms to the audience.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:42.650
So as Anina, I would go get
this glass of water this way,

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.740
and keep everything
very, very closed

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.360
and move very, very tight.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.550
Now, this is the
exact same body,

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:57.510
but you see how you perceive
me as two completely different

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.945
women with how I'm holding my
body and the body language.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:09.740
So how you walk into
a room is how people

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.960
are going to perceive you.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.480
Therefore, that's how they're
going to react to you,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.900
and that's what I'm referring to
in creating the culture of how

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.730
you want to be responded to--

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:27.820
how you actually train
people to interact with you.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.870
You're the one who decides
how you walk into that room.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:36.750
You're the one who decides
how you're perceived.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:42.100
And the question with that
is, how are you showing up?

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.686
So the first part of
that is, do you know?

00:20:44.686 --> 00:20:47.870
Do you actually know
how you're showing up?

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:50.120
Because awareness is everything.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.040
If you're not aware of
how you're showing up,

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.060
you're not aware of what you're
telling people about you,

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.800
and how you want
them to talk to you,

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.230
how you want them to
take you seriously.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.620
Do you want them to perceive
you as just someone who's

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.670
going to be off to the side,
and tight, and just upset,

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:12.050
difficult to work
with, or are you

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.540
going to be that
positive person who's

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.240
ready to do work
as a team member,

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.810
lift up others, and get
in there and get it done?

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.970
What do those things look like?

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.310
What's the physicality of that?

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:31.200
So that's the physicality
of leadership and presence,

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.570
creating that on purpose.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.226
So there's four pillars
I'm going to talk about,

00:21:36.226 --> 00:21:38.100
and I'm going to give
you very specific tools

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.500
today that you can start
putting to work now.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.820
And I'm here to tell you
as soon as you get these

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.580
and you walk out--

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.592
at first, I see, like, OK--

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:54.700
to this kind of thing.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.866
And then the next thing I
see is people, like, ugh,

00:21:58.866 --> 00:21:59.720
that posture.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.620
Ugh.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.870
And then you start seeing
it on everybody else,

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.890
but the beauty of that is
your awareness now picks up.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.760
Therefore, your presence now
starts becoming on purpose.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:16.800
The reactions to you are
now what you're cultivating.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.690
So let's talk about the
first aspect of presence,

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.257
and that is posture.

00:22:25.257 --> 00:22:27.090
When we're talking about
building a business

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.390
and creating it-- yes, and I
get the best view in the house

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.060
as soon as this light
goes up because well, I

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.092
see everybody go, ooh OK.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:42.580
So yes, you get to watch me
but, this goes both ways.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.450
So posture-- when we're talking
about building a business

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.320
and creating a location,
this is a great location.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.040
Location, location,
location, correct?

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.450
When we're talking about
you showing up in business,

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.710
it is posture, posture, posture.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:11.790
Posture is everything because
it is the pillar for confidence

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.730
and competence.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.340
You could be doing
everything else correct, OK?

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.650
All right body
language, all the right

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.430
words, but if your posture is
not showing up with leadership,

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:28.044
you have dumbed down
everything you just did.

00:23:28.044 --> 00:23:29.710
And that's an "it"
factor for the person

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.060
who walks in the room--

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.670
is posture.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:39.460
Now today, societal
posture is horrific

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.190
because guess what
we're all doing?

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.925
Right, exactly.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.560
Especially here, right?

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.710
Because we're sitting in
traffic for how many hours?

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.460
So I said, because
there were landslides ,

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.043
I sat in traffic for an hour and
a half what should have taken

00:23:55.043 --> 00:23:56.150
me 20 minutes.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.340
Yes, so I got a very
deep understanding

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.020
of that yesterday.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:04.190
Now, how do you actually
correctly make posture happen?

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.170
What does that look like?

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.020
Posture is supposed to be
built off of your spine,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.370
so when we lift,
you want to lift

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.500
from the center of the body.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.216
And a lot of times when I say
posture, what I see is this.

00:24:20.216 --> 00:24:24.120
All of a sudden, everything
becomes tight and up, OK?

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.280
That's not what we're looking
for because what we physically

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.260
see is what we mentally
assume is what we emotionally

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.190
respond to.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.149
So even if you're
tall but you're tight,

00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:38.690
you're going to be
a person who comes

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.410
across very tense and a
little iffy to work with.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.430
Yeah, I got tall posture, but
dang girl, bring it down, OK?

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:51.320
So it's learning, what does that
actually physically feel like?

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.600
What does that look like?

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.080
How do I bring
that to the table?

00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:00.330
It's always off your
spine and making

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:06.690
sure you're coming up from the
skull directly behind the ear

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.550
right here.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.980
Now, you'll notice--
see this spot

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.990
I'm talking about right here?

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.590
That's in line.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.700
We have this as normal
societal posture.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.154
This spot is way in
front of that line.

00:25:23.154 --> 00:25:25.070
Now, if I were to walk
in the room like this--

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.444
this is normal
societal posture--

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.120
would you buy into me being a
really successful body language

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.640
stategist if I
walked in like this?

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.210
No.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.530
I don't look professional,
I look disengaged,

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.570
and I look 10 pounds heavier.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.630
I'm not cool with that.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.140
I want to look fully
present, fully engaged,

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.420
and the leader in my
industry, the second I

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.860
walk into the room.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.100
Now, here's why
this is a big deal.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:04.170
It takes a half a second to
create a first impression.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.050
I decide if you're
a family person,

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.210
if you live by yourself.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.980
Do you have kids?

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.390
Are you a dog person?

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.360
Are you a cat person?

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.350
I make all these assumptions
within a half a second, done.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:25.790
I can be completely wrong,
but to me, that's who you are.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:30.800
It takes a 10 full
one-on-one hours

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.070
to completely erase
a first impression.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:42.270
That's a 40 hour workweek to
change four people's minds.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.280
Do you guys have time to do
that in your work schedule?

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.530
No, no one has time to do
that in their work schedule.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.570
We're already working
past 40 hours a week,

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.300
you don't have another 40
hours to stick in there

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.160
to change someone's
mind just because you

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.660
want a better
relationship with them

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.430
on a business relationship.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.640
So creating that first
impression right from the

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.090
get go is very important.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.410
Now, you can change
it as you go, OK?

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.680
Every hour you spend with that
person, we're slowly adjusting,

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.010
but that also comes
with consistency.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.325
Are you consistently
showing up one way,

00:27:14.325 --> 00:27:16.460
or are you flip flopping
where you show up?

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.376
You were really great
and happy the other day,

00:27:18.376 --> 00:27:22.690
and then ugh the next day.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:27.910
So consistency is what creates
a lasting, consistent impression

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:31.120
of who you are to work with,
of how people refer you

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.560
to other people, of how
they refer you to your boss.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.850
That makes a big difference.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.500
So what does good
posture look like?

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.180
When we take the example--

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.500
AUDIENCE: I would like to pass.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.875
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS:
You will pass?

00:27:45.875 --> 00:27:47.500
OK.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:52.240
All right, OK.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.430
So good posture looks balanced.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.640
Now, let me ask you a
question real quick,

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.864
did I ask you to come up here?

00:28:01.864 --> 00:28:02.770
AUDIENCE: No.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:03.860
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS: No.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.516
AUDIENCE: I wanted to, actually.

00:28:07.516 --> 00:28:09.276
I thought, why him and not me?

00:28:09.276 --> 00:28:10.650
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS:
I know, right?

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.650
It's free.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:16.510
So I didn't say a single word
asking him to come up here.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:21.280
However, I led him
to an opportunity

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.450
with my clear intent
of my presence.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.030
You can create
greatness in a room

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.220
strictly off of your presence.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.380
OK, so what we're
going to do is,

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.284
you want to balance your body
with one foot just a little bit

00:28:36.284 --> 00:28:37.200
in front of the other.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.800
Now what this does is--

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.800
think about buildings, you have
to balance on a foundation.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.900
So you want to put
your body in a position

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.430
where it's easily balanced.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:50.000
When you see a person
who does this a lot,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
it's usually because their
feet are too far out or they're

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.400
too close together
because the body's always

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.500
working to be in harmony.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:03.320
So if you're a fidgeter,
mover like this,

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.310
it's because you're not
balanced on your feet correctly.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.300
And having one foot
in front of the other

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.420
allows your knees to be
just a little bit soft.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.850
It allows better blood
flow through the body.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:15.560
You're more physically
comfortable.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.160
You're also getting more
oxygen to your brain.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.660
That's putting you
on your a-game,

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.180
and that's making you
a better team member.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.292
So your feet are actually
really important in business.

00:29:26.292 --> 00:29:28.180
Who knew?

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.817
OK, so we're going to
balance there, good.

00:29:30.817 --> 00:29:32.150
And you're doing a good job of--

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.850
just let your arms
hang and relax.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.420
Now right now, if I were to
put my finger here and right

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.510
at the middle of his
ear, this is about--

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.930
that's the angle
we're looking at.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.525
Do you see how that's
similar to that there?

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.635
OK, so now, you're going to
be my Ken doll for a second.

00:29:53.635 --> 00:29:55.510
OK, we're going to Barbie
doll you into place

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.810
here-- just relax.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.594
OK, and then I
want you to go up.

00:29:58.594 --> 00:29:59.410
Good.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.560
Now, relax this way.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.790
Now, this is a really
common problem,

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:09.200
especially in the tech
industry because we're

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.910
used to physically holding
our bodies forward this way.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:18.040
So what happens is
I'll go to open here,

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.214
and now the muscle
has to over stretch.

00:30:21.214 --> 00:30:22.380
So he has to really hold it.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.320
Do you see how he
looks a little tense?

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.994
OK, relax.

00:30:25.994 --> 00:30:26.660
Oh, my goodness.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.920
Did you see that
come down two inches?

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.420
Now, do you see how
all of a sudden,

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:34.280
he seems like a person
who's easier to work with?

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.885
AUDIENCE: I must be.

00:30:36.885 --> 00:30:38.510
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS:
Compared to, hi, I'm

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.550
here to do my presentation.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.040
So relax into that, good.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.260
And then what I
want you to do is--

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.770
we have a muscle association
here that we create

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.840
that tends to be like this.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.770
So as I brought him up,
this muscle association

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:58.310
stayed the same, and now
he's looking at the ceiling.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.890
So we're going to open here.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.425
Good, relax into my hands.

00:31:02.425 --> 00:31:04.685
Now, stay there,
and we're going to--

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.020
there, yeah.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.850
So now what's happening--

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:11.920
good.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.190
So it's learning to rotate the
body into the correct position,

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:19.280
and you do have to stretch these
muscles if they're too tight.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.560
You need to condition
them to open more,

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.600
so you don't feel like
you have to hold it there

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.370
the entire time
because again, that's

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.410
producing an image of
you're a very tense person.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.430
So this is the aspect that I
work on with my clients of, OK,

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:33.680
what are the stretches
we need to do

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.440
to get it to feel
comfortable for you

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.080
to physically be in
the correct position,

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.400
so then it's comfortable to
walk, and move, and converse

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.967
like that on a regular basis.

00:31:44.967 --> 00:31:46.800
So right now, it's a
little more difficult--

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.120
I keep having to
open his torso here

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.560
to get the ribcage in
the right position.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.610
Good, there we go.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:55.490
Go a little taller.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.150
There we go, good.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.280
OK good, now, do you see
he smiled all of a sudden?

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.770
That's actually a
really common response

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:07.220
I get because all of a
sudden, the body went, ooh,

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.450
I'm in a good spot.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.670
And it's interesting to watch.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.360
As soon as people get into
a correct, comfortable

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.640
physical position, they open.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.270
Now all of a sudden, you're
the easier person to work with,

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:25.100
and also when the
chin comes down,

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.880
your eyes physically open.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.340
Now, you have
better eye contact.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.940
You look like you're
engaging people

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:39.380
instead of, well, I'm here, but
I'm a little bit closed off.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.411
Even if you did mean to be that
way, it looks that way, OK?

00:32:44.411 --> 00:32:45.410
Now, what was your name?

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:46.141
AUDIENCE: Chen.

00:32:46.141 --> 00:32:48.390
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS: Thank you
so much, I appreciate it.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:49.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.120
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS: Thank you.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.585
OK, so now as you see him
walking down the hall--

00:32:58.282 --> 00:33:03.665
but encourage each other to-- if
you see someone slumping down,

00:33:03.665 --> 00:33:04.850
be like, hey, you know what?

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.860
When Kerstin was here, remember?

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.200
And you'll be that way
from across the room.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.010
I've done that.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.570
You know, of course,
I'm the coach,

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.230
and I'll see people and go.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:17.900
And all of a sudden, everybody
in the room goes ooh.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.590
But it elevates the
level of the room.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.450
Now, you see what a
difference it made for him

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.270
when the shoulders came down.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.870
All of a sudden, he
looks more relaxed.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:31.700
He looks like he's an
easier person to deal with.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:36.410
So when you walk in with
those very specific aspects,

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.720
now you're letting
someone know this is

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.374
how you can interact with me.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.360
So instead of being the tense
person walking in the room,

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:53.940
now you're the ready,
competent, confident person

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.170
ready to do some work.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.810
Does this make sense?

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.950
OK, good.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:04.620
So now we're going to go
to the next aspect of how

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:11.109
to create trust, and that
is the magic of your elbows.

00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:14.966
Did you know elbows are
really important in business?

00:34:14.966 --> 00:34:16.590
Everybody's going,
where are these body

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.840
parts coming from in business?

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.290
I thought that it was
all about my brains.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:24.929
So when it comes elbows,
what we're referring to

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:29.130
is opening the torso
from the bottom

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:33.060
of your chin down to your
hips-- down to the pelvic bone.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:37.440
In the front, we have the
least amount of bone coverage

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.690
to protect our
most vital organs.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:45.860
So when we open ourselves
to another person

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:51.030
and actually expose that area
without trying to cover it,

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:55.080
we are now saying, I trust you.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:58.110
Now remember, what
we physically see

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.890
is what we mentally assume
and emotionally respond to.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:07.650
So if you're reflecting
out, I trust you,

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:11.700
now what you're saying and
letting other people know is,

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.660
I'm trustworthy.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.110
So that's what's reflected
out and then is reflected back

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:21.550
to you, so that's another
part of the posture

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:24.850
and being very specific
with your arm gestures

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:29.620
in the front creating leadership
in a very specific presence

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:34.330
to create an elevated
environment of competence,

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.740
confidence, and trust.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.120
How big are those three
things in your business?

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.470
They're huge.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:44.210
They're everything.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.090
If you don't have those
three things on your team,

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.400
you're in trouble.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.060
And with how fast the tech
industry works and moves,

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.980
if you don't have
those three things,

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.510
you're really in trouble.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.580
This is the fastest
industry in the world.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:07.460
You have to have those things
to have successful product.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.480
So when it comes
to elbows, you want

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.430
to make sure you're not holding
them in tight to your body.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.260
Now here in the
Pacific Northwest,

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:25.430
you see a lot of this because
it's damp, and it's cold,

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.300
and we're trying to
stay warm, honestly,

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.270
but when you have people coming
from other parts of the country

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.060
here, we have what's
called the Seattle freeze.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:39.200
We look offish, and we have a
very big reputation for that.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.740
And it's true.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.620
This is something very
normally seen in this area.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.947
Yes, it comes, honestly,
from our weather conditions,

00:36:47.947 --> 00:36:49.780
but that's not going
to change how someone's

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.610
going to respond to you.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.440
They're still going
to see you as offish.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.480
You're in a protective stance.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.360
Yes, I'm listening.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.990
I'm smart, I'm listening
to what you're saying,

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.080
not sure if I'm buying in.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.942
Can you see that
my body language?

00:37:04.942 --> 00:37:07.400
You're going to have to work
a little harder to convince me

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:14.020
of what you're saying compared
to, I'm smart, I'm here,

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.660
I'm listening, and I'm
collaborative to work

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:21.220
with you and your information.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.590
And all I did was move my arms--

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.850
that was it.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:27.700
So when you're
talking with people

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.940
about very specific
concepts, it's

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.640
a very big deal in
how much trust you

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.750
show in that person's ability.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:39.690
Making that eye contact
first, showing them

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.210
you're engaging them, and
then allowing your body

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:48.110
to be open and show the
trust, show your confidence,

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.320
and that you're
willing to work them.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.770
So you want to have a little
space between your elbows,

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:57.190
which putting your posture
in the correct place

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.630
naturally does.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.630
If my shoulders roll forward,
all of a sudden, that space

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.060
disappears.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.250
So your posture and
the trust aspect

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.710
are a big component together.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:12.750
Now, you can move your
arms-- we want movement.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:16.950
We want that kind aspect because
we find movement exciting.

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:19.500
We pay billions and billions
of dollars every year

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.370
to watch people run around,
and we get excited about it.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:26.840
And we buy their shirts,
and we yell at the TV

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.137
because we want our to win.

00:38:30.137 --> 00:38:32.100
Because they're running around.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.330
That's all they're
doing, and we're paying

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.790
huge amounts of money for it.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.760
That's how exciting
we find movement,

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:48.170
but we find fluid, well-done
movement the most exciting.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:49.770
So it's getting
that body language

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:56.660
to work together to make you
look at the top of your game.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:00.530
Now, there's one more aspect
of really creating engagement

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.590
and that's approachability.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.320
Now, a big part
of approachability

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.740
is creating interest.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:15.530
Your eyebrows are magic
when it comes to this.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:20.960
A light lift in your eyebrows
is a show of interest,

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.820
so what you're
reflecting out is what's

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.262
being reflected back to you

00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:26.720
Now, here's an
example of where you

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.060
see this on a regular basis.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.675
When someone walks into the
room that you find attractive,

00:39:31.675 --> 00:39:32.300
what do you do?

00:39:36.275 --> 00:39:39.230
All of a sudden, those
eyebrows shoot up.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.690
Or, something exciting
happens or someone

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:46.330
that you really like you haven't
seen for a long time, oh, hi!

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.250
We're showing interest.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:53.810
Now, if you want someone to
be interested in your product,

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:59.000
in your project but
you're coming in, OK,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.090
so I have something that
I want to present to you.

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:07.150
What are you asking for?

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.800
You're not showing
a lot of competence.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.660
You're showing a
little insecurity.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.000
You're not totally open that
they're going to like it,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.980
and you're really not
interested in what

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.970
they have to say because
you're protecting yourself

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.160
against rejection.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:28.550
What you reflect out is
reflected back to you.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:35.210
Non-verbal communication is now
considered 80% of what we say.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:38.030
So when you walk in
the room like that,

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:40.610
you have just now
asked for them to not

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:44.390
like 80% of what you just said.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.260
Is that a good idea?

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.580
No, that's not a good idea.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.850
So when you want
to present an idea

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.360
or ask someone to do
something for you,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.510
come into the room on purpose.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:04.150
Come in with your confidence,
with your competence

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.240
in your posture.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:10.550
Come into the room
open, trusting

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:14.010
there are going to
like what you have.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:21.290
And then show interest not
only in them but in yourself

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:25.600
by keeping your eyebrows
slightly lifted.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:29.870
Those particular
concepts working together

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:36.270
raise your chances 80% of
getting the response you want.

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.130
Those are really good numbers.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.750
Those are really good numbers.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:46.070
If you can guarantee 80% of
everything you wanted in life,

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.780
would you do it?

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.250
If you knew walking
into any situation I

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:53.544
got an 80% chance of
getting exactly what I want,

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:54.210
would you do it?

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.490
Now, you have the
tools to do it.

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:02.230
Now, it's learning to get
those things to work together,

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.230
and so that's what I
work on with my clients

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:06.960
because we now
have to figure out

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.150
how all three of those
things physically

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.010
feel together because
we're not used

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.650
to doing those necessarily.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.470
And so I work with my
clients on creating

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:22.470
very specific visuals, presence
when they walk into a room.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.670
We go through
their presentation.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:26.220
OK, so you were
doing really good,

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.386
and then all of a sudden
when you got to the concept

00:42:28.386 --> 00:42:33.270
that you feel is the ice breaker
or is the one that is really

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:35.250
the game-changer
but it's something

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:40.830
different than everybody's
used to, do you close down?

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.132
Which I see a lot, by the way,
because also they're concerned

00:42:44.132 --> 00:42:45.340
they're going to be rejected.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.100
No.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.670
So we work to keep that
engagement very specific

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:50.480
the entire time.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:57.720
This is a way to get
to your projects,

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.830
through your projects, and
create success in your team

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:02.680
every single day.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:08.110
Is that the culture
that Google wants?

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:11.620
Yes, it is-- very much so.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.230
So this is something that
you can, number one, start

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:17.670
with yourself and then
bring to your team,

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:22.570
bring to your manager,
bring to the entire company

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:26.770
to elevate not only
what you do but what

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:30.650
is happening here at
Google every single day

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:35.230
and honestly affecting
everybody in the world

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:39.130
every single day because
Google is everywhere.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:44.260
Google has, honestly, pretty
much taken over the world

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.960
because it doesn't matter
where you're at in the world,

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.000
it's present.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.420
So this is not something that
just affects you here today.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:58.280
This is something that
affects the entire planet.

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.030
Be a part of that.

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:04.190
Show up on purpose every single
day and make a difference.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:11.980
So at this point, I would love
to open this up to questions,

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.260
and I'm here to serve you.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.350
So please, feel free
to ask any questions.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.010
If you want to be Barbie
dolled, we can do that.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:24.880
Yes, go ahead.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.296
SPEAKER: We have
a mic right here.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.020
AUDIENCE: Do you think tall
people have any advantages?

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.080
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS:
So what it's about--

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.320
that's a very good
question because I

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.010
get a lot of questions
about aesthetics,

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:46.970
tall, short, male, female, how
that makes a difference, right?

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:48.620
But remember, this
is the primal part

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:50.360
of the brain that
we're dealing with,

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.190
and that's just dealing with
each other as pack animals.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.390
Now, it's not so much
about the aesthetics.

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:59.870
It's about symmetry.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:04.250
When you show up with
your upmost symmetry,

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:09.260
you are now making yourself
more visually attractive

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.280
because as humans, we find
symmetry very attractive.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.480
Buildings are built in symmetry,
art is built in symmetry,

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.227
nature is built in symmetry.

00:45:19.227 --> 00:45:21.560
That's why we love going out
and hiking here, especially

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.060
in Northwest, because
it's gorgeous.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.730
We have nature everywhere.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:30.410
So when you align your body,
you are now putting yourself

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:36.032
in your upmost symmetry, which
now naturally draws us to you.

00:45:36.032 --> 00:45:39.320
Not so much your aesthetics.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.840
OK now, I'm going to say--

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.480
so for males, it's just--

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.330
work with your actual
symmetry because then we

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:52.740
look at as a whole person not
specific length, body parts.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:53.570
So for men--

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:56.470
I see tall men,
they'll do this a lot--

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:59.330
they bring themselves
down to make themselves

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:03.440
smaller because they don't want
to come across as overbearing.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:08.940
However, you just lost your
confidence and your competence.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.510
Sure, he can be a
game-player, but you may not

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:17.420
be the person who is my
go-to, does that make sense?

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:20.400
Now for women, the
other part is symmetry

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.170
which I get a lot is the fact
that we have extra real estate.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.620
And what you'll see is--

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.080
I'll try to put women in
their actual symmetry,

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.440
and I don't want to look
inappropriate, right?

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.200
I get that, too.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:42.060
And it's inappropriate as long
as your body's in symmetry.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.060
When you take it
out of symmetry,

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.650
that's when it
becomes inappropriate

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:50.040
because now we're drawing
the eye to different parts--

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.760
specific parts-- of the body.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.580
I call this the Friday night.

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.280
This is not appropriate
for your board meetings.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.400
So for both men and women--

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.820
and they're coming from
two different mentalities.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.990
Men don't want to
feel overbearing,

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.480
and women don't want
to feel inappropriate.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.620
It is not about the aesthetics,
but it's about the symmetry.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.590
When we see the
upmost symmetry, we

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:18.530
look at you as a whole person.

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:22.070
What we see physically is
what we assume mentally,

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:25.550
so we'll see you
assessing your body

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:26.874
and being very aware of it.

00:47:26.874 --> 00:47:28.790
So if you're physically
aware, well obviously,

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:31.020
they're mentally with it.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.090
You see that correlation?

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:37.100
So it's a big part of
leadership and really

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.680
allowing yourself to
advance in your business

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.710
without having to work
extra hard for it.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.676
It's a given.

00:47:42.676 --> 00:47:44.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for your answer.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.210
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:48.027
Yeah?

00:47:48.027 --> 00:47:49.402
AUDIENCE: What's
your perspective

00:47:49.402 --> 00:47:52.330
on the differences between
an in-person presence

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:53.794
and a video call presence?

00:47:58.552 --> 00:48:00.760
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS: Yeah,
that's a very good question.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:06.750
So I actually do 90% of
my coaching virtually,

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:07.860
and I love it.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:12.150
And I was real hesitant about
switching from in-person

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:13.260
to virtual.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.700
However, two things happened.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:20.280
Number one, my business boomed
because I now speak nationally.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.410
I work with international
speakers and best selling

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:23.280
authors.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.950
Currently, I have
clients that I'm

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:29.940
working with on a weekly basis
in three different states.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:33.650
So what that's
allowed me to do is

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:39.810
be just as specific on video,
and it's even more important

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:44.170
that you keep it in mind because
you have programmed yourself

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.800
to, as soon as you come up
to a desk, what do you do?

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:52.890
It's just become a
mental habit, so now you

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:58.330
have to reprogram
yourself to be here and do

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:03.190
everything exactly the same even
when you're not at your desk.

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:06.880
So from the hips up, whether
you're sitting or standing,

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.250
everything should
be exactly the same.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:13.330
Now, I love coaching in video
because what I get to do

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:16.870
is, we'll go through something
and I'm like, oh, watch,

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:18.070
rewind.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:20.050
Look what just happened.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:23.660
So for me, as a coach and as
a trainer, it's phenomenal,

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:28.210
and I love doing video
because if you can do it

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:32.170
in front of that little
red dot that's going on,

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:36.980
that just freaks people out
because it can be reseen.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:39.610
So once you have mastered
it in front of that,

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:42.110
you're golden in
front of people.

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.070
So I do have my clients
do video homework,

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:46.060
and they send it to me.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.860
We critique it together.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.400
We do video work
together, but really, it's

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:56.590
what we physically see is
what we mentally respond to.

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:59.386
So it's, how are you showing up?

00:49:59.386 --> 00:50:00.760
If you want them
to assume you're

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.740
going to be a specific
way in person,

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:06.365
you have to be
that way on video.

00:50:06.365 --> 00:50:06.865
Yes?

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:13.630
AUDIENCE: So do I just do this
when I show up in the team area

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.310
and then when I'm coding I
can just go back to my slouch

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:18.272
and "do not disturb" posted?

00:50:18.272 --> 00:50:20.230
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS: That's
an excellent question

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:24.410
because we have what I like
to call muscle default.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:28.450
Another name we know for
that is muscle memory.

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:33.250
So if you're like this for,
let's say, eight hours a day--

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:35.110
it's usually more, right?

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:36.820
Doing this but then
all of a sudden,

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:40.210
you expect your body
to be comfortable

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:42.200
walking in this way.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.960
That is not going to happen.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.170
You can make it
happen, but as we saw,

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:50.140
it's going to come across stiff
because now your muscles have

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:52.660
actually physically
been shortened

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.550
to a different length.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.580
So now you have
to overstretch it,

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.250
and now it's going to be
a little uncomfortable.

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.610
So that's why I work with
stretches with my clients

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:05.590
making sure they're
actually physically

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:09.850
putting their bodies in a way
that is going to be comfortable

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:12.250
all the time.

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:14.430
So it's just creating
that muscle default

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:19.609
that will work with
you all the time, yes.

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:21.400
I think we have time
for one more question.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.297
AUDIENCE: So I've heard
that to show interest

00:51:27.297 --> 00:51:29.630
when somebody else is talking,
you want to lean forward.

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:33.180
And so if I'm doing
this kind of, you know--

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.890
I'm showing
confidence, and I also

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:36.870
want to show interest
by leaning forward.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.360
I sort of go
against that, so how

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.004
do I show interest and yet show
confidence at the same time?

00:51:42.004 --> 00:51:43.920
KERSTIN O'SHIELDS: It
depends on the situation

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.520
you want to create.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:52.020
So if you want to be, you
know, girl, I'm coming to you.

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.160
We're just going
to have this talk.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.350
I'm so at your level.

00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:59.850
that's showing
interest that way,

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:04.760
but you are not coming to
the situation as a leader.

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.575
You have now brought
yourself down to,

00:52:07.575 --> 00:52:10.740
I am here at your level,
which is an option if that's

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.030
what that situation asks for.

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:15.835
However, you are not a
thought leader in that moment.

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:22.340
You're just a wall
that's listening.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.010
You really don't have presence.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.020
You have interest because
your eyebrows are up,

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.310
you got your head
side a little bit.

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:29.976
You're showing caring
because now you've

00:52:29.976 --> 00:52:32.384
exposed this part
of your neck, so we

00:52:32.384 --> 00:52:33.800
got a little bit
of this going on,

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.990
but you're not there
to be the leader.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.410
You're there just to be an ear.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:42.950
If you want to really show
interest as a person who's

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.500
in a leadership role or who
wants to be in a leadership

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.270
role, then you come to that.

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:51.170
Yes, I hear what you're saying,
but you see, from here up--

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:54.180
from the hips up-- it
always stays the same.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.630
So that means if you're
sitting at a desk,

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:58.790
you still want to make
sure you can lean forward--

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:00.755
that's fine, but you
don't want to collapse.

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:07.100
So thank you so much for
having me here today.

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.890
I would like to extend
to you the ability

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:12.650
to find out what this is like.

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:16.460
What is it like to actually
go through and really assess

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:18.350
how you're showing up?

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:23.060
And I do introductory sessions,
so we could meet virtually--

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:23.690
online--

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:26.148
and the nice thing about that
is you guys do a lot of that.

00:53:26.148 --> 00:53:27.920
So you'll get the
feel of what it's

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.860
like to really create
the culture of what's

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.350
coming through that screen.

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:36.630
And we'll discuss,
what are your goals?

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:39.140
Where do you want to take
where you're at right now

00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:40.710
and take it to the next level?

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:44.960
And then I can show you very
specific body language and how

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:50.600
to create that for yourself
because you have the ability

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.230
to show up on purpose
every single day,

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:57.120
and I would love to
help you with that.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.850
So thank you so much,
and I appreciate

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.110
the pleasure of being here.

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:03.860
[APPLAUSE]
