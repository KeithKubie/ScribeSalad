00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:07.430
Hello, and welcome back.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.240
So in this chapter,
we're going to talk

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.550
about how to add
leaderboards to your game.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.990
A lot of what
you're going to see

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.150
is actually fairly
similar to the process

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.990
for adding achievements
to your game.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.290
So hopefully we'll be able to go
a little faster in this lesson

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.330
and get some leaderboards
added pretty quickly.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.260
We're going to follow
the same format

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.670
as we did last time,
by adding in a button

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.430
to view all of our leaderboards
before we actually go

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.470
and create any.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.020
So let's do that by
going into our game

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.369
view controller dot nib
file, and-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.660
Not our game view controller,
our intro view controller

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.140
dot nib file.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.440
And there we can see our button
to view our achievements.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.370
Let's go in and let's
add another button

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.910
over on this side.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.790
And we'll call this
one leaderboards.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.190
Fix our auto sizing in the
bottom here, and then over we

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.430
go.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.019
All right, wow, perfect.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.110
That is a beautiful button.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.540
And just like with our
achievements, let's hook

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.470
it up to dot
[INAUDIBLE] file here,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.930
so we're going to
move over here.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.830
Let's hide this,
get some room here.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.120
Oh my gosh, squeak this over.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.240
Right.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.020
So first thing we want to
do is control drag, up here.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.870
So we have our IB outlet.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.245
Call it view
leaderboards button.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.390
And so we can disable
this as needed.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.005
And let's say, how about
above our achievement stuff,

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:55.680
we're going to add a [INAUDIBLE]
mark, view achievements.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.590
And we can add another
one as view leaderboards.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.729
And we will add an
action here, which

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.645
will be leaderboards
button was pressed.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.780
And let's just take this
full screen, here we go.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.300
And now in this
method, basically we're

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.100
just going to create a
leaderboards controller,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.140
and set the delegate to
ourselves, and present it.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.130
This should look very
similar to the methods

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.375
we have right above.

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:47.437
Now, I'm going to call GPG
leaderboards controller.

00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:49.770
Notice by the way, we have
both a leaderboard controller

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.360
and a leaderboards
controller with an s.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.620
The leaderboard controller,
this thing here,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.780
is what you would use if
you wanted to bring up

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.030
the scores for an individual
leaderboard The leaderboards

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.890
controller starts
by showing you all

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.210
the possible leaderboards
for this game.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.340
I'm going to start by adding
an A leaderboards controller,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.560
and we'll get to that one
later on in the chapter.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.790
But we'll just say
leads controller

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.820
equals GPG leaderboards
controller alloc in it.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.420
We will set our
delegate to self.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.760
And now we can present
view controller,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.400
leads controller animated
yes, completion handler no.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.810
Great, we're getting a warning
that we're setting our delegate

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.460
to self, without
declaring that we

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.830
are a leaderboards
controller delegate.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.070
So we can do that right here.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.575
Leaderboards controller
delegate, there we go.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.510
And now we get a warning
that we haven't implemented

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.260
the required method, the
leaderboard's view controller

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.290
didn't finish.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.650
So let's add that.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.200
We'll do it right under here.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.650
There we go, leaderboard's
view controller didn't finish.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.660
And basically we'll just
dismiss view controller

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.320
animated yes, completion no.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.810
Perfect.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.630
Oh, wait.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.900
Maybe not so perfect.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.110
I see I made a mistake here,
I declared a delegate to self,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.580
and what I really want
is leaderboards delegate.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.780
Sorry about that.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.100
All right, there we go.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.454
Now that warning's gone away.

00:04:38.454 --> 00:04:40.120
All right, let's do
one more thing here.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.310
Let's go down, and
we'll also set ourself

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.850
dot view leaderboards
button, dot hidden also

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.330
as not signed in.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.220
And, all right.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.550
And gosh, I think that's
all we need to do.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.750
So let's run this.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.420
All right, welcome back.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.010
We're signed in.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.990
Let's view our leaderboard's
bring up our leaderboard's

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.520
controller that is totally
empty, because we don't

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.080
have any leaderboards
in our game.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.400
Well, that's boring.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.100
So we'll say we're
done, that goes away.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.660
And congratulations, we've
put a blank view controller

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.620
on our screen.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.040
So next step, let's
create a few leaderboards.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.940
And we will do that
in the next lesson.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.790
See you soon.
