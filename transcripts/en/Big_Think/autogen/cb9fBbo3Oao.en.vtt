and to start to sink and to solve the
 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.960
and to start to sink and to solve the
problems you have to develop this so I

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970
problems you have to develop this so I
 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.110
problems you have to develop this so I
don't think it comes from from your
