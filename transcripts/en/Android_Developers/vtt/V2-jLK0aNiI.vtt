Sharkey: Hi.
My name is Jeff Sharkey.

00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:04.467
And I'm a student
from Montana State University.

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:06.934
I wrote an Android application
called CompareEverywhere.

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:09.100
And I'd like to show it to you
on my phone today.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.634
Let's go ahead and get it
started up.

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:12.667
And when we open it,
we have three different options.

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.801
We could scan a barcode,
run a full text search,

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:16.033
or look at lists of items

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:17.701
that we might have stored
before in the past.

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.300
In this case, I found a CD
that I'm interested in.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.234
We can tap and scan
the barcode with our phone.

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:28.534
So in this case,

00:00:28.534 --> 00:00:29.801
we found
several different options

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:31.167
for going out and buying
this item.

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:32.334
We can look through
that list.

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:34.234
We see there's several
online stores,

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:36.167
and also some local stores
in our neighborhood,

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:37.767
as well as a local library

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:39.701
that we could go
and borrow the item.

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:41.934
In this case, we can also map
those local stores

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:43.434
to look at all
of the different options.

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:45.667
If I know I'm going down
to a neighborhood later today,

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.067
I could zoom in to see what
stores are available in the area

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:49.334
and what prices they have.

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:51.267
In this case, I'm interested
in this store.

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:52.934
I can tap on that
and I can look at

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:55.067
see driving directions
to the store location

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:56.234
or I could call them
to make sure

00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:58.067
that they actually have it
in stock.

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:00.133
I can also look at lists
of items.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.501
So let's say
like a shopping list

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:02.868
as I walk through
the store.

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:05.567
If I know I need to pick up
a certain number of items.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:08.667
I can easily cross those items
off my list as I buy them

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.334
as I walk through the store.

00:01:11.868 --> 00:01:13.801
So I got the idea
for this application

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.501
a couple years ago
as I was watching a documentary.

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:18.767
I saw an employee in a store
scan a barcode

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:20.467
and be able to check
the inventory that they had

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:22.467
in the back room as well as
the pricing they'd had

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:24.334
over the past couple years.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.367
I thought to myself,
why couldn't people everywhere

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:28.501
have that kind of functionality
on their phones

00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:30.434
as they walk through stores?

00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:31.868
So to build
this application,

00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:35.033
I used several different
APIs pieced together.

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:36.834
I used the camera
that's built into the phone

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:39.601
along with the ZXing library,
which is an Open Source library

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:41.601
written by several people
at Google, uh,

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.901
to decode the barcodes.

00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:45.133
I also used
the Google Maps API

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.968
to be able to show the local
stores in a person's area.

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:49.834
And finally, I used
the location manager

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:52.267
to make sure that we
always select local stores

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:53.601
that are around the user.

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:55.300
In all, using those APIs,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.567
it only took me
about two white--

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:57.901
two weeks to write.
