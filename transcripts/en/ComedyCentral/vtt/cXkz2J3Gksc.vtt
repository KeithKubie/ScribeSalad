[cheers and applause]

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:24.950
- So I'm gonna
tell you about

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.686
my first job
that I ever had,

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:31.490
and this is when I knew
I wanted to do stand-up comedy,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.261
and I--you know,
like, my daughter's 16 now,

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.996
and she's not really sure
what she wants.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:40.166
I knew
from the time I was 16

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:44.671
I wanted to act, be funny,
and do stand-up.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.272
And so I got a job.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.606
My friend hooked me up,

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:51.010
and I worked
in a Sears paint department

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.311
in Long Island.

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:56.549
And I ruined a lot homes.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.285
[laughter]

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:04.123
Just destroyed homes
from 1985 to '88.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.292
If you go to Long Island now,

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:10.162
you just see just
crap jobs of house--

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:11.631
"Why'd you stain your bathroom?"

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.133
"This guy told me.
He worked at..."

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.202
[chuckles]

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:19.371
I really--I mean,
it was a joke to me.

00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:21.340
There was two of us
that worked in paint,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.976
and it was attached to a mall,

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:28.314
so literally we'd take
one-hour tag team breaks.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.316
So I would get paid
for four hours,

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.151
work two hours,
and tell everyone,

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.185
"No, you won't like it here.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:34.486
"Go to Benjamin Moore.

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:36.255
Trust me. The paint's better."

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:38.824
So it was a great gig.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:41.260
Now, when I was there,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.830
the one thing I used
to love doing was,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.932
I would call
all the other departments,

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:48.667
just drive them nuts,

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:51.437
because two things when you work
at a department store:

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.040
A, you have to pick up
the phone.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.508
They tell you that.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.342
Like, "No matter how many
customers you have,

00:02:57.342 --> 00:02:58.678
"you have to pick up the phone.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:02:59.779
It's policy."

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.346
So as soon as I heard that,
I was like,

00:03:01.346 --> 00:03:02.615
"Oh, this is gonna be great."

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.552
[laughter]

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.288
So I would start with the--

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:11.957
and the only--
the only people that work

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.592
at a department store

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:16.128
are people that are retired

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:18.063
or--or teenagers.

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:20.566
And if it's in between,
then you got someone pregnant

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:22.034
or you're going through
a bad divorce.

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:25.104
There's no reason why
you should be 35, like,

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:27.440
"Hi, welcome
to Sears hardware today.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.308
Can I help you out
with some drill bits?"

00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:30.810
You're just--you're done.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.378
You're living
in your mother's basement.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.713
You're a zero.

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:37.716
So I'd call up old people in,
like, linens, you know?

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:41.587
Like,
"Hi, this is Carol in linens."

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:44.156
Like, "How you doing today,
Carol?

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:47.593
Tell me about your linens."

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:49.061
Um...

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.729
And that's--that's--honestly,

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.431
where I would do--
I would do impressions.

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.400
There was this fat kid
named Scott,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.102
and he worked
in the toy department.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.571
Now, this was in the '80s,
so every couple years,

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.306
a new toy comes out
and people, like,

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.575
kill each other
to get the toys.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.844
And back then, it was
the Cabbage Patch doll.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.579
So people are lined up,

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.614
and we were near
Jamaica, Queens,

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:10.182
so this is a big black area.

00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:11.584
Sort of big black Jamaican like:

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.285
[with Jamaican accent]
"I'm gonna get me

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:14.920
"the Cabbage Patch doll.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.356
"I know they only make
three black ones,

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:20.292
so I want the one."

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:23.796
So Scott was petrified.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:26.932
You have 40 black women
running into his department

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:28.167
at 8:00 in the morning,

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:29.435
and that's when
I would call him.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.437
And he'd be like, "Hello,

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.806
this is Sears toy department,
Valley Stream--"

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:35.274
I'm like, "Hey,
this is Joe Pesci,

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:36.609
"I want to come in there.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.512
"I need a black
Cabbage Patch doll.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.614
"And don't give me
no rain check,

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.549
"or I'm gonna come down there
and bust your balls.

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:46.285
You hear me? I'm gonna be there
in 20 minutes."

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.687
He comes--
"Hey, guys, is that you?"

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:50.323
I'm like, "What--me, what?"

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.690
"Joe Pesci's coming here!"

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.692
Like, "I--don't give him
a rain check, man.

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:55.361
I don't know what to tell you."

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.629
[laughter]

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.133
So we're in
the paint department one day,

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:04.369
and this new guy comes in
from hardware, all right?

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:06.372
And I'm staring at this banana,

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:08.473
and he's very serious.

00:05:08.473 --> 00:05:10.676
He's, like, fixing the stock.

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:13.746
And he's like,
"This wrench goes over here.

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.747
"And I think these hammers
go over here.

00:05:15.747 --> 00:05:17.383
"They're not where
the Craftsmen are.

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.817
"And I just--understand--

00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:20.686
I really have
to fix this department up."

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:23.656
And I went, "I got
to break this dummy in."

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.991
So I...

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.992
[laughter]

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:29.495
I go--I go walking up to him,
and I go,

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.029
"Hey, man, my name's Jim.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.531
"I work in the paint department.

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.434
If you need anything,
just let me know."

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:37.336
He gets--he's snippy with me.

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:39.271
And he's, like, in his 40s.

00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:41.574
So he goes,
"You know what I need?

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:45.177
"I need you to stay
in the paint department, okay?

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:47.513
"Because you're young.
You look like you're wasted.

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:48.948
Do you come
to this job wasted?"

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.883
I'm like,
"No, I look like this."

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:51.884
"Oh, okay, right."

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:54.854
[laughter]

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.359
He goes, "I hear
the way you talk to the people

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.693
"in the paint department.

00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:03.529
"It's a joke--
people want your help,

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.097
"and you don't help them.

00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:07.099
"I'm here to explain to them

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.368
"what's the difference
between a crafting tool,

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:10.769
"what drill bits are for,

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:12.037
"and all the different hammers.

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:13.372
"You know how
you can do me a favor?

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:14.806
"Stay out of my department.

00:06:14.806 --> 00:06:16.375
"I'm here, and I take this
seriously.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:17.777
"I want to help people.

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:19.211
Stay in paint."

00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:20.712
I was like, "Uh-oh, all right."

00:06:20.712 --> 00:06:22.981
And I took his--
I took his newspaper.

00:06:22.981 --> 00:06:24.716
There was a newspaper
on his little desk.

00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:26.118
So I'm like, "Yeah, all right."

00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:28.086
I took his newspaper and--
"I'll show him."

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:31.224
Now, a little part of history.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.559
At that time,

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:37.262
America was in a serious
situation with Libya.

00:06:37.262 --> 00:06:38.463
Huge!

00:06:38.463 --> 00:06:40.633
Before bin Laden,

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:43.569
there was Muammar Gaddafi,

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.907
and he was huge in news,

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:54.447
because he shot
six missiles at a U.S. plane.

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:56.082
He missed.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:59.418
[laughter]

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:03.322
And then the next day,
we bombed his tent.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:05.090
That's what happened.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.859
And it was huge news.

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:08.927
It was right on--
if you--when you went home,

00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:10.996
you only had four channels
to watch on TV.

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:12.598
It was before
there was even remotes.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.199
It would just--
your father would go,

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.834
"Hey, turn on channel four."

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:17.202
And you'd have to get up like...

00:07:17.202 --> 00:07:18.203
[bangs microphone]

00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:21.340
[grumbling]
"Okay."

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.543
And so everything was,

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:25.611
"Next on the news,
Muammar Gaddafi.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.546
Is America"--
"Muammar Gaddafi"--

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:29.615
"Muammar Gaddafi
shoots six missiles"--

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.150
"Muammar Gaddafi."

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.886
And the newspaper
that I'm looking at,

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:36.822
the headline has a picture
of Muammar Gaddafi

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:38.958
with missiles going behind him.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.526
So I'm sitting there,
and I went,

00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:45.698
"All right,
I'm gonna break this dummy in,

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:48.801
and I'm gonna call
as Muammar Gaddafi."

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.303
[laughter]

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.539
'Cause I'm just gonna bust
his balls relentlessly.

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:56.308
So I swear on my kids
this is a true story.

00:07:56.308 --> 00:07:58.010
Now...

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.814
So I'm a--my--my--where my
register is, I can see him.

00:08:02.814 --> 00:08:06.986
He's--he's maybe 75 feet away,

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.487
and that--maybe!

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:10.756
And I'm looking right at him,

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:12.358
so I got the phone,

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:15.194
