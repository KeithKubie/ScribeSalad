00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.405
Here's a list of some algorithms,

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:07.344
and you need to identify which of these is a bulk parallel algorithm.

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:13.883
So finding the largest value in a set as if I have a collection of numbers, and I want to find which one is biggest.

00:00:13.883 --> 00:00:17.387
Summing elements of an array as if I have an array of values,

00:00:17.387 --> 00:00:21.012
adding them all together to get a final total sum.

00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:26.971
Adding 2 strings together as if I have a string, for example, hello everybody.

00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:34.037
Another string, how are you today? Combining them to make a single string of hello everybody, how are you today?

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:41.245
So identify in these boxes which of these algorithms would be a bulk parallel algorithm.
