00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.670
So let's talk a little bit
about rational numbers.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.490
And the simple way to think
about it is any number that

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.670
can be represented as
the ratio of two integers

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.030
is a rational number.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.190
So for example, any integer
is a rational number.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:32.009
1 can be represented as 1/1 or
as negative 2 over negative 2

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.790
or as 10,000/10,000.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.790
In all of these cases, these are
all different representations

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.260
of the number 1,
ratio of two integers.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.180
And I obviously can
have an infinite number

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.170
of representations
of 1 in this way,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.760
the same number over
the same number.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.350
The number negative 7 could be
represented as negative 7/1,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.050
or 7 over negative 1, or
negative 14 over positive 2.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.180
And I could go on, and
on, and on, and on.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.060
So negative 7 is definitely
a rational number.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.440
It can be represented as
the ratio of two integers.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.100
But what about things
that are not integers?

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:21.770
For example, let us imagine--
oh, I don't know-- 3.75.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.240
How can we represent that as
the ratio of two integers?

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.190
Well, 3.75, you
could rewrite that

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:41.800
as 375/100, which is the
same thing as 750/200.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.900
Or you could say, hey,
3.75 is the same thing as 3

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.020
and 3/4-- so let
me write it here--

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.265
which is the same
thing as-- that's 15/4.

00:01:56.265 --> 00:02:00.920
4 times 3 is 12, plus 3 is
15, so you could write this.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.190
This is the same thing as 15/4.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.175
Or we could write this as
negative 30 over negative 8.

00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:11.300
I just multiplied the
numerator and the denominator

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.970
here by negative 2.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.956
But just to be clear,
this is clearly rational.

00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:16.580
I'm giving you multiple
examples of how

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.930
this can be represented as
the ratio of two integers.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.730
Now, what about
repeating decimals?

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.790
Well, let's take
maybe the most famous

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.940
of the repeating decimals.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.100
Let's say you have 0.333, just
keeps going on and on forever,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.830
which we can denote by
putting that little bar on top

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.330
of the 3.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.150
This is 0.3 repeating.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.950
And we've seen--
and later we'll show

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.900
how you can convert
any repeating decimal

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.850
as the ratio of two integers--
this is clearly 1/3.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.050
Or maybe you've seen things like
0.6 repeating, which is 2/3.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.410
And there's many, many,
many other examples of this.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.650
And we'll see any
repeating decimal, not just

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.080
one digit repeating.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.940
Even if it has a million
digits repeating,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.400
as long as the pattern
starts to repeat itself

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.820
over and over and
over again, you

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.354
can always represent that as
the ratio of two integers.

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:15.020
So I know what you're
probably thinking.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.120
Hey, Sal, you've
just included a lot.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.770
You've included all
of the integers.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:27.470
You've included all of finite
non-repeating decimals,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.380
and you've also included
repeating decimals.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.220
What is left?

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.927
Are there any numbers
that are not rational?

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:35.760
And you're probably
guessing that there are,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.260
otherwise people
wouldn't have taken

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.430
the trouble of trying to
label these as rational.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.940
And it turns out-- as you
can imagine-- that actually

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.850
some of the most famous
numbers in all of mathematics

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.350
are not rational.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.790
And we call these numbers
irrational numbers.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.640
And I've listed there
just a few of the most

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.180
noteworthy examples.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.355
Pi-- the ratio of
the circumference

00:04:07.355 --> 00:04:12.100
to the diameter of a circle--
is an irrational number.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.030
It never terminates.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.760
It goes on and on and on
forever, and it never repeats.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.300
e, same thing-- never
terminates, never repeats.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.020
It comes out of continuously
compounding interest.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.640
It comes out of
complex analysis.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.270
e shows up all over the place.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.640
Square root of 2,
irrational number.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.164
Phi, the golden ratio,
irrational number.

00:04:31.164 --> 00:04:32.830
So these things that
really just pop out

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.640
of nature, many of these
numbers are irrational.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.080
Now, you might say, OK,
are these irrational?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.870
These are just these
special kind of numbers.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.620
But maybe most
numbers are rational,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.910
and Sal's just picked out
some special cases here.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.590
But the important thing to
realize is they do seem exotic,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.730
and they are exotic
in certain ways.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.460
But they aren't uncommon.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.220
It actually turns out
that there is always

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.284
an irrational number between
any two rational numbers.

00:05:01.284 --> 00:05:02.450
Well, we could go on and on.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.970
There's actually
an infinite number.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.850
But there's at least one,
so that gives you an idea

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.570
that you can't
really say that there

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.814
are fewer irrational numbers
than rational numbers.

00:05:10.814 --> 00:05:12.230
And in a future
video, we'll prove

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.340
that you give me two rational
numbers-- rational 1,

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.640
rational 2-- there's going to be
at least one irrational number

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.810
between those, which
is a neat result,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.810
because irrational
numbers seem to be exotic.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.310
Another way to think about it--
I took the square root of 2,

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.150
but you take the square root
of any non-perfect square,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.620
you're going to end up
with an irrational number.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.354
You take the sum
of an irrational

00:05:36.354 --> 00:05:38.520
and a rational number-- and
we'll see this later on.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.686
We'll prove it to ourselves.

00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:42.610
The sum of an irrational
and a rational

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.310
is going to be irrational.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.200
The product of an
irrational and a rational

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.020
is going to be irrational.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.520
So there's a lot, a lot, a
lot of irrational numbers

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.290
out there.
