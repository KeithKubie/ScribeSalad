00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.000
In a world that seems busier by the day,
productivity is on the 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.149
minds of many. But instead of downloading
the latest time management app or forcing

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.600
yourself to stay at work for hours on
end how can we use science to crack open

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.610
the potential of our minds?  Is their a 
secret to being productive?  The first

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.690
thing to come to terms with is that your
willpower is simply not enough. In fact

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.330
some studies suggest that will power is
an exhaustable source, that can be

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.740
entirely used up.  This is a concept known
as the ego depletion, so instead of

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.420
convincing yourself to simply try harder
a more methodical approach is suggested.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.400
The first step,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.280
get started, it may seem obvious but
studies have shown starting a project to be the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.440
biggest barrier to productivity. Before starting our brain visualizes

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.650
the hardest parts to come and instead
tries to simulate real work by focusing

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.450
on small mindless tasks. Luckily there's
a construct of the mind known as the Zeigarnik

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.540
effect which compels humans to
finish a task that they've already

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.579
started.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.619
The Zeigarnik effect shows that when we don't
finish a task we experience discomfort

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.030
and intrusive thoughts about it, so
get started, now.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.820
What about time management? Shockingly
when we look at some of the most of the elite

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.770
musicians in the world we find that they
aren't necessarily practicing more but

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.810
instead more deliberately. This is
because they spend more time focused on

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.950
the hardest task and focus their
energy in packets.  Instead of diluting

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.790
their effort over the entire day they
have periods of intense work followed by

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.700
breaks.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
Not relying on willpower they rely on a
habit and disciplined scheduling. Studies

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.880
have found that the most elite violinists
in the world generally follow a ninety

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.560
minute work regime with a fifteen
to twenty minute break afterwards.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.079
Instead of trying to maintain energy
throughout the entire day, breaking it

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.980
down into sessions with planned
relaxation is most effective.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.950
But how can you develop the discipline
to follow this routine?

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.729
One key component is giving yourself a
deadline.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.720
Write it down, mark it in your calendar
and you'll be much more likely to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.900
complete your task.  On top of this, create
something called an accountability

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.440
chart to document your progress. In one
column write the time span and in the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.650
other the activities you accomplished
during this time.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.300
Similar to those on a diet who document
their food intake writing down your

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.010
progress allows you to realistically evaluate your work as opposed to

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.419
inaccurately assuming what you've done.

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:18.089
Furthermore tracking your progress helps
to avoid small mindless work.  And finally,

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.999
stop multitasking, well it may feel like
you're accomplishing more, studies show

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.290
that multitaskers are much less
productive. Instead

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.569
try and make a list at night of what you
want to accomplish tomorrow, this way you hit

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.989
the ground running with your action plan
and avoid trying to complete multiple

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.639
activities at once.  While you're at it
split up your large tasks into smaller

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.819
bite sized ones.  Your brain will find
these less daunting and it will make the starting

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.900
process easier.  With a clear goal and
action plan in mind, your productivity

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.559
levels can soar to new heights.
