&gt;&gt; Hey, YouTube.
Umm, how you doing?

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.569
My name's Rich Gelfond.
I'm co-CEO of Imax Corporation, those big

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.360
screens and kinda cool
movies all over the world and I'm here in

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.320
Davos, umm, trying figure
out different ways to make it a better place

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.999
and if I had to what's
the one thing I wish would happen in 2008

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.560
is increased awareness about
the urgency of the environmental problem.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.630
I'm one of those guys that never gets that
worked up in the present

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.640
and I always think there's lots of time to
deal with something but I

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.690
have been to Greenland I have seen some of
the melting of the polar

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.840
icecaps.
Uh, the story yesterday in the whole Tribune

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.920
and mercury poisoning and
its effect on people, uh, food stocks and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.929
what's happening and I think
everybody -- it's just human nature -- kinda

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.829
has a tendency to say,
oh, we'll get to it tomorrow.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.329
Don't worry about it but I think the kinda
thing Al Gore's been

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.739
talking about is putting it on the agenda
and making sure that people

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.079
understand that the environment isn't something
 -- it's just gonna be

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.640
worse tomorrow, it's not gonna be better,
and we all need to focus on

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.940
it and we need to come together as a world
and solve the problem

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.100
otherwise, you know, our legacy is gonna be
a barren place.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.640
Thanks, YouTube.
