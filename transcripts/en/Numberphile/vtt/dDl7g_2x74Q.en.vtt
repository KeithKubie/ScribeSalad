00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.030
MARK JAGO: We're going to talk
about four paradoxes that

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.710
touch on the topic
of infinity.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.080
First one, we've got
the Hilbert Hotel.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.770
This is a hotel with infinitely
many rooms.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.910
And at the moment, there's
somebody in every single room.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.930
So it's a full hotel, and then a
new customer rolls up at the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.840
reception desk.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.520
Now, you might think they're
going to turn him away because

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.850
the hotel's full.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.750
But the manager's clever.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.040
And here's what he does.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.134
He shifts the person in room 1
to room 2, and the person in

00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:34.860
room 2 to room 3, and the
person in room 3 to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.330
room 4, and so on.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.550
Everyone gets shifted
forward one room.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.525
And because there's infinitely
many rooms, you never run out

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:43.070
of rooms to put people in.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.450
And when you've done all
of this, room 1's free.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.020
So the new guest gets put
in room number 1.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.090
So you can fit in a new guest.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.770
You can fit in two new guests.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.780
You could fit in
10 new guests.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.760
And even if an infinite bus of
new customers rolls up, you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.780
can fit them all in.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.970
I guess it's that when I first
heard the description, I

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.530
thought, well, that
hotel's full.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.660
You can't fit anybody in it.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.050
That's how full hotels work.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.110
But then once you're shown that
you can fit as many new

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.990
people in the hotel as you like,
you learn something new

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.450
about infinity.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.740
So your intuitions change.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.920
And the trick is because it's an
infinite hotel, there is no

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.720
final room.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.450
If there were a final room, you
could count all the rooms,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.030
and there wouldn't be infinitely
many of them.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.480
I think he's using the idea to
say, infinity is interesting,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.130
it's philosophically interesting
because you might

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.960
have thought things
went like this.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.330
But they don't, and we can show

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.640
mathematically that they don't.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.710
Paradox number two--
this is the paradox

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.330
of Gabriel's trumpet.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.260
So the idea is we have this
mathematical shape, this

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.760
mathematical object.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.170
And it's shaped like
a trumpet.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.310
It'll start off here, and it'll
taper and get thinner

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.500
and thinner and thinner and
thinner and thinner.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.150
And it tends off to infinity,
getting thinner and thinner

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.100
all the way.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.530
So that mathematical object has
an infinite surface area.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.970
But the volume it encloses, the
air in the center of the

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.479
trumpet, is only a
finite volume.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.290
Suppose you were told
you had to paint the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.140
inside of that trumpet.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.490
Well, on the one hand, you've
got to paint an

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.260
infinitely big surface.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.370
So you're going to need an
infinite bucket of paint.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.390
But on the other hand, you could
just take a finite, big

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.660
enough can of paint, tip it into
the trumpet, and let it

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.550
filter its way down.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.220
So it looks like you only need
a finite amount of paint to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.280
paint an infinite
surface area.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.470
That's really, really strange.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.350
If we're thinking about real
physical paint, you just can't

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.650
paint the whole surface.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.120
Because it gets so thin at one
end that you're just not going

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.440
to fit the paint down there.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.200
So I guess the clash arises
when we think about the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.460
difference between the
mathematical idea of a surface

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.630
and the physical idea
of paint, which

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.230
is real thick stuff.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.940
If we had mathematical paint
where the molecules had no

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.760
size whatsoever, looks like
you'd need an infinite amount

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.590
of that to cover that infinite
surface area.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.050
He thought there was something
really strange going on here.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.820
He gave lots of proofs of this
idea because I think at first,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.440
he thought he'd made
a mistake.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.680
And lots of mathematicians
thought that there was

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.890
something wrong with the idea
of infinity, that maybe

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.950
somehow we should
banish infinity.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.710
Because puzzles like
this clash.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.670
They show there's something
wrong with the idea, so we

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.440
should somehow ban it from
our mathematics.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.550
But in fact, infinity works
just fine in mathematics.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.370
But we have to sometimes change
our ideas about how the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.600
world works to fit it in.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.760
Number three-- so this is the
puzzle of the dartboard.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.870
So we suppose we've
got a dartboard,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.070
and we've got a dart.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.180
And we're going to throw the
dart at the dartboard.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.980
And let's just suppose we're
guaranteed 100% chance to hit

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.270
the dartboard.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.000
And then we ask the question,
think about the exact center

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.720
point of the dart.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.450
And we think about an exact
point, a mathematical point on

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.180
the dartboard.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.880
And we ask the question, what's
the chance our dart is

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.720
going to hit that exact point?

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.980
And it turns out we can't
give a sensible answer.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.790
So suppose on the one hand that
we say, it's got a chance

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.930
greater than 0 of hitting
that point.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.620
Well, there's a problem
with that.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.270
If it's got a greater than 0
chance of hitting that point,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.350
the same goes for every other
point on the dartboard.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.930
And there's infinitely
many of them.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.580
In fact, there's a big
infinity of those

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.390
mathematical points.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.360
When we add all those chances
together to give us the chance

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.640
that the dart's going to hit the
dartboard at all, we end

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.930
up with an infinite
probability.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.100
But we can't have an infinite
probability.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.140
You can't get a probability
bigger than 1 that something

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.630
will happen.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.250
OK, so we've got a problem with
the idea that the chance

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.670
of the dart hitting that
point is bigger than 0.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.240
So on the other hand, what
happened to the chance of 0?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.410
Well, that's also strange.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.870
Because if the chance of hitting
that point is 0, we

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.590
could say the same
for every point.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.510
So the chance of hitting any
point on the dart board is 0.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.020
It's not going to happen.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.723
But that's really strange
because we're sure the dart's

00:05:08.723 --> 00:05:10.430
going to hit the dartboard
somewhere.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.120
Again, one thing philosophers
say about this is the idea of

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.760
banning infinity.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.880
So we say, don't think about the
exact mathematical point

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.390
of the dart.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.870
We think about an area--

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.100
any real physical dart has
an area at its center.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.270
And we think about what's the
chance that it hits an area on

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.660
the dartboard.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.945
And then we divide these
up in a finite way.

00:05:31.945 --> 00:05:33.610
And the problem goes away.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.060
As the area gets bigger, the
probability that the dart hits

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.810
there is bigger.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.130
As it gets smaller, the
probability the dart hits

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.140
there gets smaller.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.280
BRADY HARAN: So it's this kind
of granular nature of our

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.590
existence that gets
us out of trouble?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.510
MARK JAGO: Yeah, that's right.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.440
So if everything that we think
about is an area rather than

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.940
an exact point, the
problem goes away.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.760
But that's not completely
satisfying.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.470
After all, we can think of an
area getting smaller and

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.600
smaller and smaller and
tending to infinity.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.530
Shouldn't we have a decent
answer to this problem when we

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.170
get to the infinite case?

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.520
And maybe we don't have a
very good answer to it.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.110
OK, so here's the
fourth paradox.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.010
This is perhaps the most
interesting one of them all

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.980
because it relates to what
rational humans should do in

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.555
betting games.

00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:20.740
You go to a casino, and they
put a pound in the pot.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.390
And they say, we're going
to flip a fair coin.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.280
And when it lands on a tail, you
get whatever's in the pot.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.290
If we flip a head, the casino
doubles what's in the pot, and

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.640
we play again.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.700
If it gets a tail, you get
what's in the pot.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.290
If it's a head, they
double the pot,

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.770
and we carry on playing.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.060
But then they ask you the
question, how much would you

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.580
pay to get into this game?

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.640
Name your price.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.600
You've got to pay something
to play.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.080
What would you pay?

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.930
And I think most people think
about this a bit and say

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.830
something like, maybe
a few pounds?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.480
Maybe if you're rich,
you'd say 20 pounds.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.580
The mathematical theory, on the
other hand, tells you, bet

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.800
whatever you've got.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.480
Stake any amount of money you
can get your hands on on this

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.170
game, because the expected
winnings is infinite.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.790
Your expected take home is
infinite if you play the game.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.360
So the way we work out the
expected take-home winnings is

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.520
we look at each case.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.435
If you flip a tail on
the first go, how

00:07:23.435 --> 00:07:24.580
much would you win?

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.212
Add it to if you flip a tail
on the second go, how much

00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:28.110
would you win?

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.615
Add it to if you flip a tail
on the third go, how much

00:07:30.615 --> 00:07:30.930
would you win?

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:31.650
And we sum all of these.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.050
But because the game hasn't got
a fixed end point, we sum

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.360
infinitely many of these.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.290
And in fact, the expected
value of each play

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.760
of the game is 1/2.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.010
So we're adding 1/2 to
1/2 to 1/2 to 1/2

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.760
infinitely many times.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.110
That's why the expected value of
what you will take home is

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.680
infinitely big.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.975
BRADY HARAN: But we wouldn't
bet our house, would we?

00:07:53.975 --> 00:07:55.180
We wouldn't bet everything.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:55.590
MARK JAGO: I wouldn't.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.420
And I don't think you would.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.553
And--

00:07:58.553 --> 00:08:00.150
BRADY HARAN: What
does that say?

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.490
MARK JAGO: I think it says
something interesting

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.450
perhaps about us.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.570
Perhaps it says that we're
more risk averse than the

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.670
mathematical theory would
have us believe.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.360
Perhaps it says that the
value of money changes

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.270
the more you accrue.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.640
Perhaps it says something else
that we haven't quite worked

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.020
yet, that we should figure in
to what makes us rational

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.380
reasoners that we haven't yet
taken account of in the maths.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.740
BRADY HARAN: You're sort of
saying that as if humans are

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.980
wrong to not bet everything
on it.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.350
But surely if humans did that,
casinos would set that game up

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.025
and own all our houses by now.

00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:38.860
MARK JAGO: Well, good point.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.490
To make the maths come out, the
casino has to guarantee,

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.160
so you have to know in advance
that they will bet as

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.550
much as they need.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.200
So there would have to be a
casino with an infinite amount

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.470
of money, potentially, to
put into this game.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.620
So one way out of it is to say,
look, there's no casino

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.830
with that amount of money.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.760
And if we say after x amount of
money has been put in the

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.390
pot, that's it, that's all
the casino can do.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.830
Then the numbers change, and
it turns out you would be

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.110
irrational to put lots
of money into it.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.580
We have this mathematical
theory of

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.820
rational decision making.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.850
Most mathematical theories don't
crumble when you put

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.570
infinity in.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.100
They work just fine.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.830
So why is it that theories about
us, how we should or

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.750
shouldn't behave, go really
weird when you

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.560
put infinity in?

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.930
So suppose we take all the
natural numbers together.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.380
None of those are
infinitely big.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.650
Each one is a finite number.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.150
But there's infinitely
many of them.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.240
So if we were asked to count
them, we'd say there's an

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.490
infinite connection.
