00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.947
&gt;&gt; 
Sir, could you start by introducing your company

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:12.200
and the (inaudible) your application?
&gt;&gt; Sure, so I’m with the Nextstop.com which

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.400
is a new community site for exchanging, interesting
things to do anywhere in the world. I’ve

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.310
really grew up of some frustrations that we
have when traveling about how hard it was

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.180
to find authentic things that gave you a rest
sense of a place that got beyond sort of the

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.590
top ten things to do in every place you go.
And really realized that if people who live

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.469
there are locals who knew the place well could
share recommendations for the things that

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.400
really got them excited about the place. You
haven’t got on much different experience

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.680
when you’re in a place you don’t know
that well.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.440
&gt;&gt; So, how did you (inaudible) to decide to
use (inaudible) products?

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.879
&gt;&gt; Because one of the things we really focused
on a lot on their early days was the process

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.210
of adding a recommendation to the system.
We want them to make it really, really simple

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.109
for people to share the places that they loved
most. And to do that, we looked at a number

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.789
of different tools the sort of integrate existing
information about those places on the Web.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.409
Local type results name and address, photos,
websites. And with those bunch of different

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.880
approaches for how we could sort of help put
that information together, but really found

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.250
that AJAX APIs had pretty fantastic global
coverage of almost anything that we found

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.070
people recommending between the sort of official
local search results and they came all results

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.331
almost anything that people recommended. We
could get a point on a map for. We could do

00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:35.100
an image search tab bring in some related
images. We actually use the translation APIs

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.140
to do language deception on what people rate,
so we can properly categorize it and (inaudible)

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.780
it. And it really also became together in
the way that makes a process in making a recommendation

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.540
super, super easy.
&gt;&gt; So, from the note process, any worst stories?

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, we’ve gone through all
sort of different ways of doing these. And

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.740
one of the things that – we thought was
really important from our early day was to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.190
connect the recommendations people are making
with each other. So that, as a browser of

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.210
the site, I could go see – would you recommend,
but also the other things that people upset

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.610
about that place. And given the breath of
content that we have on the system, everything

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.770
from, you know, restaurants to hikes to biking
trails, figuring out how to merge that information

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.670
together is always a bit a challenging. You
know, if you have a phone number for everything,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.800
it’s pretty easy, but when you’re trying
to sort of determine whether these two things

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.121
are close enough in space to be the same thing
or to be different things, there are a lot

00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:34.640
of sort of (inaudible) situations. But, we’ve
learned through the, you know, (inaudible)

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.880
coding API and the local search results’
ways of sort of trying to make those make

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.060
those decisions.
&gt;&gt; Sir, when we’re trying to (inaudible),

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.910
but functionality be AJAX APIs really helped
to bring back (inaudible)?

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.190
&gt;&gt; Well, I think, you know, a lot of it was
just making the data about these places accessible

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.930
and the way that we could manipulate and process
it, so that we could kind of decide whether

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.450
these two things were the same or different.
The fact that you got a lot of information

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.230
back from the local search API, you know,
with the phone number, with the address, search

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.660
the, you know, applies a lot of the data necessarily
into that.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.160
&gt;&gt; So, it’s really which APIs that you use
again?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.820
&gt;&gt; So, we’re using the AJAX Local Search
API, the Image Search API. We’re using the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.350
Translation API. But actually, using the,
I guess that’s called the GU Location API

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.440
part of the downloader.
&gt;&gt; So, what are some of the features you’re

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.430
finally implement, (inaudible) gives you to
the future?

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.380
&gt;&gt; Well, we think of one of the things that
we could a lot more with is a Translation

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.560
API. You know, we’re global community of
people sharing recommendations all over the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.780
place. And right now, most of that is an English,
but we think with some well applied machine

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.349
translation. We can actually make that content
accessible to a much greater variety of people.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.629
So that’s something we’re really excited
about as we’re experimenting more.

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.349
&gt;&gt; That’s great. So, how (inaudible) I open,
have you really – what do you going to take

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.540
way from the conference do you think?
&gt;&gt; It’s been a lot of fun. I’ve met a

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.239
lot of interesting people who’ve come buy
our developed pad and you know (inaudible)

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.890
of this morning for Google Wave was great,
one of the best times as I’ve seen in a

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.950
long time.
&gt;&gt; Cool. I thank you so much and being part

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.790
of this.
&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot.
