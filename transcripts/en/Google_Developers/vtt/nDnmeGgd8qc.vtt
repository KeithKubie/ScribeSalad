[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.430
MALE SPEAKER: Next,
we have Ibrahim,

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.570
who is going to be talking
to us about YouTube.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.695
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: So who
wants their games go viral?

00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:16.550
Anyone?

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.650
Who doesn't want their
games to go viral anyways?

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.820
So today, I'll talk about
how you can actually

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.920
get your games viral with
YouTube and with YouTube APIs.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.630
And then I will dive into
all the specific developer

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.130
ideas we have that you can
actually achieve that goal.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.290
And first, let's
talk about YouTube.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.820
Besides being the most public
video-sharing platform,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.620
it's the second-biggest
search engine on the web.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.550
And today, we see 1
billion unique users

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.040
visit YouTube every day.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.910
And they watch 6 billion
hours of video every month.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.810
Could they be all
watching cat videos?

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.820
Maybe.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.240
What if I say 25%
percent of them

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.285
are actually coming from mobile?

00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:04.120
Oh you know what-- I
find the suspect for you.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.849
Here it is.

00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:09.819
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:13.290
You know.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.980
Cats are everywhere.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.945
So from a survey, we found
that people who play videos--

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:21.712
[LAUGHING]

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.000
So people who play
video games, 95% of them

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.280
say that they're actually
watching the gameplay videos,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.490
as well as the trailers.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.960
So do you see the
opportunity here,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.520
like how you can
actually get to them?

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.950
And if you use the
YouTube APIs, you actually

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.900
get to all the
YouTube services-- all

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.240
these amazing services you
already have and from your app.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.490
And then your game integrates
with YouTube APIs, what

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.530
do you think it would create?

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.962
It would only
create awesomeness.

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:55.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.310
And to actually see all
the different services,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.250
I create the
[INAUDIBLE] into four.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.250
And we'll see all these
different four verticals.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.870
First, Google, through the
creation side, where you're

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.500
actually uploading the videos.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.000
Second side will
be discovery, where

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.708
you'll find other
interesting videos that

00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:16.420
show inside your games.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.030
In the third part
with Analytics,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.790
you will see some
[INAUDIBLE] of those videos.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.590
And finally, we'll talk
about the content management.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.360
Let's start with the upload.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.590
As like "FIFA," like all
the other games right now,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.870
actually helping you
get the instant replays.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.870
So you can easily upload
games from inside your game

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.570
without ever leaving it.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.750
Isn't really cool to
show it to your friends

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.420
and brag about all
these nice moves you do?

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.236
And they use Data API for it.

00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:43.610
We have the
[? resume ?] uploads,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.180
where you can upload all
this game content easily

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.320
without ever leaving your app.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.650
And besides the games
and consoles already

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.640
implementing it, there are
even platforms like Everyplay,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.850
[INAUDIBLE], who are
letting other developers use

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.490
the APIs right away, which
is like grabbing frames

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.550
and using YouTube APIs and
sending them to YouTube.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.450
For this, they most of the
times use like [? unity ?]

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.155
[? to add ?] the [? frames. ?]
And then they encode with

00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:13.980
the WebM.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.110
They use the YouTube APIs to
send videos to the YouTube.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.360
And besides the video
on demand, today, we

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.160
are also seeing
the live streaming

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.960
getting hugely popular.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.050
One of them is the people like
streaming their own games.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.985
And further than that, there
are even these sports, actually

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:36.060
even more popular than the
music festivals nowadays.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.980
Besides all the
games and consoles

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.455
are enabling YouTube
Live Streaming API,

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:42.330
they are even in like
the secondary products.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.530
Like Elgato has a
hardware encoder.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.110
Like XSplit is a
software encoder,

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.160
which will let you stream your
games while you are playing.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.050
And they're all using
the Live Streaming API,

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.900
which you can easily
plug in yourself, as

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.350
well into your games and
let your people game-play

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.530
and stream it.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.140
And Direct Lite has also
helped you get all these videos

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.580
into your own playlist, which
you can administer and show

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.110
them later on.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.780
And this was a lot
like the uploads.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.850
I want also talking
about the discovery,

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.960
where you would find
interesting videos

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.780
and show them inside your games.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.670
Like using the search
inside our Data API,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.637
you can find all
different videos,

00:04:19.637 --> 00:04:21.470
even the power of the
Google Knowledge Graph

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.100
using Topic APIs.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.970
And from there, once you find
those different videos, maybe

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.860
like other little videos, you
can show them inside your game,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.430
like using the Android Player
API, as well as the iFrame API.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.610
For iOS and all the
others resources,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.860
you can easily play
video inside your app.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.090
And you get the video.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.800
Then you want to also see
how your videos are doing.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.190
Maybe that will predict
about your game result.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.790
You can use
Analytics API for it.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.410
This has already happened
in the music business, where

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.590
our next big song was predicting
record sales out of the YouTube

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.584
videos-- the popular videos
were in the YouTube already.

00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:05.500
And if you want do it as well,
you can use Analytics API.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.660
And the last part is the Content
ID API, which you can actually

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.755
claim the videos and monetize
them, either monetize

00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:15.500
for extra revenue or change
it with other advertisements.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.050
Or you can get
free advertisement

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.110
for your own portfolio.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.780
And for that, we've seen
ZEFR making an easy platform

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.390
for people who like to claim
videos and monetize them

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.086
right over from that.

00:05:27.086 --> 00:05:28.710
So today, I just like
in a brief thing,

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.043
I've talked about the creation
to upload live-streaming,

00:05:31.043 --> 00:05:35.450
in discovery, find videos
and just re-stream them,

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.190
and the analytics
side, which you

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.501
can get insights, and finally,
the content management,

00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:42.250
where you can actually
even monetize them.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.980
And if you want more resources,
we have the YouTube developer

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.160
website, youtube.com/dev,
which you can find all the API

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.462
resources and even interact
with them [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:50.462 --> 00:05:51.170
Thanks, everyone.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.922
[APPLAUSE]
