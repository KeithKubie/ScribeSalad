00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
the floorboards that means that they're

that that might be a problem to her a

that that might be a problem to her a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.220 align:start position:0%
hood popped up it bent and popped up
spontaneously<00:03:04.280><c> and</c><00:03:05.090><c> so</c><00:03:05.630><c> she</c><00:03:05.720><c> was</c><00:03:05.959><c> pretty</c>

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 align:start position:0%
spontaneously and so she was pretty
 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.290 align:start position:0%

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 align:start position:0%
curious about that and so she was with
 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.449 align:start position:0%
curious about that and so she was with
this<00:03:08.930><c> friend</c><00:03:09.410><c> of</c><00:03:09.530><c> hers</c><00:03:09.650><c> who</c><00:03:09.800><c> was</c><00:03:09.830><c> just</c><00:03:10.310><c> as</c>

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 align:start position:0%
this friend of hers who was just as

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
clueless mechanically as she was which
 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
clueless mechanically as she was which

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 align:start position:0%
is really quite remarkably clueless and
 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
is really quite remarkably clueless and
so<00:03:15.290><c> they</c><00:03:15.470><c> pulled</c><00:03:16.160><c> off</c><00:03:16.340><c> into</c><00:03:16.580><c> a</c><00:03:16.670><c> service</c>

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 align:start position:0%
so they pulled off into a service
 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.729 align:start position:0%
so they pulled off into a service
station<00:03:17.239><c> and</c><00:03:17.570><c> had</c><00:03:17.810><c> the</c><00:03:17.930><c> guy</c><00:03:18.050><c> come</c><00:03:18.230><c> out</c><00:03:18.320><c> look</c><00:03:18.590><c> at</c>

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 align:start position:0%
station and had the guy come out look at
 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.100 align:start position:0%

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 align:start position:0%
it and well he he opened the hood
 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.630 align:start position:0%
it and well he he opened the hood
obviously<00:03:21.769><c> and</c><00:03:21.890><c> what</c><00:03:22.010><c> had</c><00:03:22.100><c> happened</c><00:03:22.130><c> was</c><00:03:22.610><c> the</c>

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 align:start position:0%
body had fallen off the frame so and
 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.030 align:start position:0%
body had fallen off the frame so and

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
what had could happen was the shock
 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.740 align:start position:0%
what had could happen was the shock

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 align:start position:0%
