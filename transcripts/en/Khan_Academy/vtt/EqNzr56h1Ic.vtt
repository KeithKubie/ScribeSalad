00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.300
So in this problem
here, we're told

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.350
that the triangle
ACE is isosceles.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.340
So that's this big
triangle right here.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.660
It's isosceles, which means
it has two equal sides,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.590
and we also know from
isosceles triangles

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.250
that the base angles
must be equal.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.590
So these two base angles
are going to be equal.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.740
And this side right over here
is going to be equal in length

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.920
to this side over here.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.790
We could say AC is
going to be equal to CE,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.590
so we get all of that
from this first statement

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.090
right over there.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.400
Then they give us some
more clues, or some more

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.030
information.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.120
They say CG is equal to 24.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.960
So this is CG right over here.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.020
It has length 24.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.410
They tell us BH is equal
to DF, so those two things

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.010
are going to be congruent.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.640
They're going to
be the same length.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.700
Then they tell us that
GF is equal to 12.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.610
So this is GF right over here.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.210
So GF is equal to 12.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.360
That's that distance
right over there.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.910
And then finally, they tell
us that FE is equal to 6.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.330
So this is FE, and
then finally, they

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.706
ask us, what is
the area of CBHFD?

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.130
They're asking us for the area
of this part right over here.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.770
That part and that
part right over there.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.465
That is CBHFD.

00:01:23.604 --> 00:01:25.270
So let's think about
how we can do this.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.870
So we could figure out the
area of the larger triangle,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.410
and then from that
we could subtract

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.900
the areas of these
little pieces at the end.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.510
Then, we'll be able to figure
out this middle area, this area

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.260
that I've shaded.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.830
And we don't have all the
information yet to solve that.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.880
We know what the height, or the
altitude, of this triangle is,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.005
but we don't know its base.

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:44.671
If we knew its base,
then we'd say, hey,

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:45.612
1/2 base times height.

00:01:45.612 --> 00:01:47.070
We'd get the area
of this triangle,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.060
and then we'd have to
subtract out these areas.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.934
We don't have full
information there, either.

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:52.260
We don't know this height.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.290
Once we know that
height, then we

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.730
could figure out this height,
but we also don't quite yet

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.220
know what this length
right over here is.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.590
So let's just take
it piece by piece.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.310
So the first thing we might
want to do, and you might guess,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.393
because we've been talking
a lot about similarity,

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:07.760
is making some type of
argument about similarity

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.169
here, because there's a
bunch of similar triangles.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:17.810
For example, triangle CGE shares
this angle with triangle DFE.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.510
They both share this
orange angle right here,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.960
and they both have this
right angle right over here.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.600
So they have two
angles in common.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.840
They're going to be
similar by angle-angle.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.700
And you can actually
show that there's

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.200
going to be a third
angle in common,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.260
because these two
are parallel lines.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:47.150
So we can write that triangle
CGE is similar to triangle DFE,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.510
and we know that by angle-angle.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.290
We have one set of
corresponding angles congruent,

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.710
and then this angle
is in both triangles,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.380
so it is a set of
corresponding congruent angles

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.750
right over there.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.750
And so then, once we know
that they are similar,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.660
we can set up the
ratio between sides,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.300
because we have some information
about some of the sides.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.524
So we know that the ratio
between DF and this side

00:03:09.524 --> 00:03:11.940
right over here, which is a
corresponding side-- the ratio

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.110
between DF and CG,
which is 24, is

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.030
going to be the same thing as
the ratio between FE, which

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.210
is 6, and GE, which is not 12.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.600
It's 12 plus 6.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.437
It is 18.

00:03:31.437 --> 00:03:32.270
And then, let's see.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.940
6 over 18, this
is just 1 over 3.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.620
You get 3DF is equal to 24.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.620
I just cross-multiplied, or
you could multiply both sides

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.089
by 24, multiply both sides by 3.

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.880
You would get this.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.130
Actually, you could just
multiply both sides times 24,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.550
and you'll get 24 times 1/3.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.030
But we'll just do it this way.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.240
Divide both sides by 3.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.300
You get DF is equal to 8.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.760
So we found out that DF is
equal to 8, that length right

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.720
over there.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.450
And that's useful
for us because we

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.140
know that this length right
over here is also equal to 8.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.760
And now what can we do?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.290
Well, it seems like we could
make another similarity

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.800
argument, because we have
this angle right over here.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.860
It is congruent to that
angle right over there,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.940
and we also have
this angle, which

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.140
is going to be 90 degrees.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.870
We have a 90-degree angle there.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.920
And actually, that
by itself is actually

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.350
enough to say that we have
two similar triangles.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.850
We don't even have
to show that they

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.190
have a congruent side here.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.565
And actually, we're going to
show that these are actually

00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:41.220
congruent triangles that we're
dealing with right over here.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.299
So we have two angles,
and actually, we

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:44.590
could just go straight to that.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.620
Because when we talk
about congruency,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.071
if you have an angle that's
congruent to another angle,

00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:51.070
another angle that's
congruent to another angle,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.370
and then a side that's
congruent to another side,

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.810
you are dealing with
two congruent triangles.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.140
So we can write-- let
me write it over here.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.700
I'll write it in pink.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.400
Triangle AHB is
congruent to-- you

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.220
want to get the
corresponding vertices

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.302
right-- is congruent
to triangle EFD.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.710
And we know that, because we
have angle-angle-side postulate

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.320
for congruency.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.102
And if the two
triangles are congruent,

00:05:27.102 --> 00:05:28.310
that makes things convenient.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.736
That means if this side
is 8, that side is 8.

00:05:30.736 --> 00:05:31.610
We already knew that.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.318
That's how we established
our congruency.

00:05:33.318 --> 00:05:35.497
But that means if this
side has length 6,

00:05:35.497 --> 00:05:37.330
then the corresponding
side of this triangle

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.060
is also going to have length 6.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.080
So we can write this
length right over here

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.480
is also going to be 6.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.510
I can imagine you can imagine
where all this is going to go,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.090
but we want to
prove to ourselves.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.294
We want to know for
sure what the area is.

00:05:52.294 --> 00:05:54.960
We don't want to say, hey, maybe
this is the same thing as that.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.735
Let's just actually
prove it to ourselves.

00:05:56.735 --> 00:05:57.860
So how do we figure it out?

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.276
We've almost figured out the
entire base of this triangle,

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.020
but we still haven't figured
out the length of HG.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.300
Well, now we can use a
similarity argument again,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.470
because we can see that
triangle ABH is actually

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.440
similar to triangle ACG.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.630
They both have this
angle here, and then

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.300
they both have a right angle.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.230
ABH has a right angle there.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.130
ACG has a right angle
right over there.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.260
So you have two angles.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.470
Two corresponding angles
are equal to each other.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.730
You're now dealing
with similar triangles.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:33.770
So we know that triangle
ABH-- I'll just write it

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.790
as AHB, since I already
wrote it this way.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:41.111
AHB is similar to triangle AGC.

00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:42.860
You want to make sure
you get the vertices

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.651
in the right order.

00:06:43.651 --> 00:06:44.700
A is the orange angle.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.140
G is the right angle, and
then C is the unlabeled angle.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.613
This is similar to triangle AGC.

00:06:55.502 --> 00:06:56.960
And what that does
for us is now we

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.910
can use the ratios to figure
out what HG is equal to.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.640
So what could we say over here?

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.850
Well, we could say
that 8 over 24--

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.950
BH over its corresponding
side of the larger triangle--

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:17.856
so we say 8 over 24 is equal to
6 over not HG, but over a AG.

00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:21.700
6 over AG, and I think you
can see where this is going.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.410
You have 1/3.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.280
1/3 is equal to 6 over AG, or
we can cross-multiply here,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.450
and we can get AG
is equal to 18.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.150
So this entire length
right over here is 18.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.224
If AG is 18 and AH
is 6, then HG is 12.

00:07:41.224 --> 00:07:43.390
This is what you might have
guessed if you were just

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.181
trying to guess the
answer right over here.

00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:47.100
But now we have
proven to ourselves

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.180
that this base has length
of-- well, we have 18 here,

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.910
and then we have
another 18 here.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.890
So it has a length of 36.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.410
So the entire base here is 36.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.099
So that is 36.

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:02.640
And so now we can
figure out the area

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.080
of the entire
isosceles triangle.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.590
So the area of
ACE is going to be

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:18.010
equal to 1/2 times the
base, which is 36, times 24.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:23.780
And so this is going to be
the same thing as 1/2 times 36

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.566
is 18.

00:08:25.566 --> 00:08:27.440
18 times 24.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.660
I'll just do that
over here on the top.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.360
So 18 times 24.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.950
8 times 4 is 32.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.564
1 times 4 is 4, plus 3 is 7.

00:08:39.564 --> 00:08:41.230
Then we put as 0 here,
because we're now

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.309
dealing not with 2, but 20.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.860
You have 2 times 8 is 16.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.400
2 times 1 is 2, plus 1.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:54.060
So it's 360, and then you
have a 2, 7 plus 6 is 13.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.270
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.480
So the area of ACE
is equal to 432.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.840
But we're not done yet.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.730
This area that we
care about is the area

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.040
of the entire triangle
minus this area

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.950
and minus this area
right over here.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.390
So what is the area of
each of these little wedges

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.140
right over here?

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.210
So it's going to be
1/2 times 8 times 6.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.000
So 1/2 times 8 is 4 times 6.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.900
So this is going to be
24 right over there,

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.570
and this is going to be
another 24 right over there.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.250
So this is going to be equal
to 432 minus 24 minus 24,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.985
or minus 48, which
is equal to-- and we

00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:37.360
could try to do
this in our head.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.740
If we subtract 32, we're
going to get to 400.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.230
And then we're going to
have to subtract another 16.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.790
So if you subtract
10 from 400, you

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:51.802
get to 390, so that you get to
384-- whatever the units were.

00:09:51.802 --> 00:09:54.260
If these were in meters, then
this would be meters squared.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.790
If this was centimeters, this
would be centimeters squared.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.750
Did I do that right?

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.720
Let me go the other way.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.320
If I add 40 to this, 24 plus
another 8 gets me to 432.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.259
Yup, we're done.
