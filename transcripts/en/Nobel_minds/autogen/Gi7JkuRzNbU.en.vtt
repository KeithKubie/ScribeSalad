tournament would they be able to use

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440
tournament would they be able to use
 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.220
tournament would they be able to use
buckyballs to play or would it end up

but I haven't been able to do that well

I think they would I think c60 does roll

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
I think they would I think c60 does roll
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.840
I think they would I think c60 does roll
around and it should be possible to play

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850
around and it should be possible to play
 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.400
around and it should be possible to play
some form of game with c60 on a surface

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
some form of game with c60 on a surface
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.299
some form of game with c60 on a surface
and it would be interesting because it

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
and it would be interesting because it
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.720
and it would be interesting because it
will happen is sufficiently small that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
will happen is sufficiently small that
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.110
will happen is sufficiently small that
it might have quantum behavior and it

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
it might have quantum behavior and it
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.000
it might have quantum behavior and it
would be quite interesting to to see

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
would be quite interesting to to see
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.189
would be quite interesting to to see
where the one could play quantum

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
where the one could play quantum
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.900
where the one could play quantum
football or quantum American football or

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
football or quantum American football or
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.200
football or quantum American football or
in fact baseball or cricket whether it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
in fact baseball or cricket whether it
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.820
in fact baseball or cricket whether it
would spin and what the spin might be

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830
would spin and what the spin might be
 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.410

and basketball with with a c16 molecule

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420
and basketball with with a c16 molecule
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.929

and I think it could be possible in the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
and I think it could be possible in the
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.980
and I think it could be possible in the
future I mean we'd have to have improve

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
future I mean we'd have to have improve
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.510
future I mean we'd have to have improve
our scanning tunneling microscopy you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
our scanning tunneling microscopy you
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.319
our scanning tunneling microscopy you
know atomic force microscopy techniques

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
know atomic force microscopy techniques
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.310
know atomic force microscopy techniques
but I think that's all the cars
