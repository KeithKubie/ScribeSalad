00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.110
In your mathematical
careers you might

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.890
encounter people who
say it is wrong to say

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.510
that i is equal to the principal
square root of negative 1.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.950
And if you ask them
why is this wrong,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.550
they'll show up with this
kind of line of logic

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.900
that actually seems
pretty reasonable.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.800
They will tell
you that, OK, well

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.320
let's just start
with negative 1.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.630
We know from definition
that negative 1

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.050
is equal to i times i.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.520
Everything seems pretty
straightforward right now.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.270
And then they'll say,
well look, if you

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.604
take this, if you assume
this part right here,

00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:36.020
then we can replace each of
these i's with the square root

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.860
of negative 1.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.770
And they'd be right.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.270
So then this would
be the same thing

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.530
as the square root of negative
1 times the square root

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.940
of negative 1.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.450
And then they would
tell you that,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.030
hey, look just from
straight up properties

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.190
of the principal
square root function,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.700
they'll tell you that the
square root of a times b

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.840
is the same thing as the
principal square root

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.969
of a times the principal
square root of b.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.260
And so if you have the
principal square root of a times

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.470
the principal square
root of b, that's

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.470
the same thing as the
square root of a times b.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.520
So based on this property of the
radical of the principal root,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.150
they'll say that
this over here is

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.600
the same thing as
the square root

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.130
of negative 1 times negative 1.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.481
If I have the principal root
of the product of two things,

00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:24.980
that's the same
thing as the product

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.600
of each of their
principal roots.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.380
I'm doing this in
the other order here.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.730
Here I have the principal
root of the products,

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.730
over here I have
this on the right.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.370
And then from that we all
know that negative 1 times

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.470
negative 1 is 1.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.450
So this should be equal to the
principal square root of 1.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.050
And then the principal
square root of 1-- Remember,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.830
this radical means
principal square root,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.410
positive square root, that is
just going to be positive 1.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.860
And they'll say, this is wrong.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.160
Clearly, negative 1 and positive
1 are not the same thing.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.040
And they'll argue therefore,
you can't make this substitution

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.510
that we did in this step.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.080
And what you should
then point out

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.199
is that this was not
the incorrect step.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.340
That it is true negative
1 is not equal to 1,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.610
but the faulty line
of reasoning here

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.220
was in using this property
when both a and b are negative.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.660
If both a and b are negative,
this will never be true.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:36.317
So a and b both
cannot be negative.

00:02:36.317 --> 00:02:38.650
In fact normally when this
property is given-- sometimes

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.120
it's given a little
bit in the footnotes

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.110
or you might not even notice
it because it's not relevant

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.680
when you're learning
it the first time--

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.470
but they'll usually give a
little bit of a constraint

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.970
there.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.300
They'll usually say for a and
b greater than or equal to 0.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.990
So that's where they
list this property.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.070
This is true for a and b
greater than or equal 0.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.930
And in particular, it's false
if both a and b are both,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.460
if they are both negative.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.310
Now, I've just spent
the last three minutes

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.260
saying that people who tell you
that this is wrong are wrong.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.940
But with that said,
I will say that you

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.780
have to be a little
bit careful about it.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.390
When we take traditional
principal square roots.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.070
So when you take the
principle square root of 4.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.490
We know that this is
positive 2, that 4 actually

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.100
has two square roots.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:34.860
There's negative 2 also
is a square root of 4.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.500
If you have negative
2 times negative 2

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.000
it's also equal to 4.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.470
This radical symbol here
means principal square root.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.770
Or when we're just dealing
with real numbers, non

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.459
imaginary, non
complex numbers, you

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.500
could really view it as
the positive square root.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.820
This has two square roots,
positive and negative 2.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.570
If you have this radical
symbol right here

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.750
principal square roots, it means
the positive square root of 2.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.604
So when you start
thinking about taking

00:03:59.604 --> 00:04:01.020
square roots of
negative numbers--

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.510
or even in the future
we'll do imaginary numbers

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.500
and complex numbers
and all the rest--

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.120
you have to expand
the definition

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.930
of what this radical means.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.670
So when you are taking
the square root of really

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.240
of any negative
number, you're really

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.170
saying that this is no longer
the traditional principal

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.420
square root function.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.080
You're now talking that this
is the principal complex square

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.720
root function, or
this is now defined

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.120
for complex inputs
or the domain,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.590
it can also generate
imaginary or complex outputs,

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.005
or I guess you could
call that the range.

00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:36.770
And if you assume that,
then really straight

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.120
from this you get that negative,
the square root of negative x

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.020
is going to be equal to i
times the square root of x.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.202
And this is only-- and I'm
going to make this clear

00:04:49.202 --> 00:04:51.160
because I just told you
that this will be false

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.980
if both a and b are negative.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.610
So this is only
true-- So we could

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:06.540
apply this when x is
greater than or equal to 0.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.210
So if x is greater
than or equal to 0,

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.720
then negative x is
clearly a negative number,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.370
or I guess it could also be 0.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.620
It's a negative number.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.300
And then we can apply
this right over here.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.230
If x was less than
0, then we would

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.250
be doing all of this
nonsense up here.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.052
And we start to get
nonsensical answers.

00:05:23.052 --> 00:05:25.010
And if you look at it
this way and you say hey,

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.740
look, i can be the square
root of negative one,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.220
if it's the principal branch
of the complex square root

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.180
function.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.240
Then you could rewrite
this right over here

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.040
as the square root of negative
1 times the square root of x.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.790
And so really the real fault
in this logic when people

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.130
say, hey, negative 1
can't be equal to 1,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.860
the real fault is
using this property

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.230
when both a and b, where both
of these are negative numbers.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.460
That will come up with something
that is unambiguously false.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.320
If you expand your
definition of the complex

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.810
or expand your definition
of the principal root

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.790
to include negative
numbers in the domain

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.260
and to include imaginary
numbers, then you can do this.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.280
You can say the square
root of negative x

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.010
is the square root
of negative 1 times--

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.370
Or you should say the principal
square root of negative x--

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.900
I should be
particular my words--

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.010
is the same thing as the
principal square root

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.120
of negative 1 times the
principal square root of x when

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.110
x is greater than or equal to 0.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.240
And I don't want to
confuse you, if x

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.020
is greater than or equal
to 0, this negative x, that

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.080
is clearly a
negative, or I guess

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.370
you should say a
non positive number.
