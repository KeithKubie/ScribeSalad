LENNIE MARTINEZ:
I'm Lennie Martinez.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.535
I'm a sophomore in
AeroAstro, actually.

00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:12.620
I'm part of the Saving
Gora Gora group.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.290
Our game is called
Saving Gora Gora.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.120
It's a game about-- well it has
to do with tropical cholera.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.930
And our goal was
to teach children

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.850
how to prevent cholera, because
our target audience were

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.380
Gonian children ages 8
to 13, approximately.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.960
And pretty much our
main goal was just

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.940
to educate them in a
fun way that wouldn't

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.231
seem like we're educating them.

00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:41.760
Oh, OK.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.670
So our design brief
was pretty general.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.580
It said, look at the cholera
tool kit that's online,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.580
that you find online,
and try to create a game

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.580
to teach kids about cholera.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.220
So they gave us our
target audience,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.680
which was Gonian
children ages 8 to 13.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.170
And we we're thinking,
originally-- well, it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.649
was an idea that we had based
off Animal Crossing, where

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.190
it's a bunch of
different mini games.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.490
So each mini game would
include a small lesson.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.920
And then, they would
all come together

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.190
to become one large MEDI PUZZLE.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.080
And in solving the MEDI
PUZZLE, the players

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.390
would learn how to, I guess,
prevent cholera or counter

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.275
cholera, and that was what led
most of our design process.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.152
The visual style came about-
well, we had a very-- well,

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:38.610
we had an original
visual silo that

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.193
was very different from what you
guys saw in the presentation.

00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:47.940
We had to research-- we had
done research on children,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.070
but we had to take a look
back and redo everything

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.070
because it wasn't as--
once we compared it,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.500
once we had a finished
build, we compared it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.941
to-- we had to do research
on what cartoons would better

00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:03.440
look like.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.934
And we found that it was very
different and very clashing.

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:10.100
So we did some research
some more on Gonian culture,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.730
and we tried to find,
make it fit better.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.440
And so we went for
more artsy, woodsy,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.940
cartoonish little
people, very little kid,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.460
but it's still not too
childish for other people.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.950
I originally, really, was
interested in the class

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.140
because one of the textbooks
was Design of Everyday Things.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.860
It's a book I find
really interesting.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.770
I've been trying to
read it, but it's

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.292
hard with the curriculum,
the overall MIT curriculum.

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:40.000
So, I really came into
the class thinking

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.740
that I really wanted to work
on the design aspect of things.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.220
But as we started
working on projects,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.882
the match win side became a bit
more interesting, a bit more,

00:02:48.882 --> 00:02:51.090
something I started working
a bit more because it was

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.930
more accessible for
me with my not so

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.830
robust knowledge of coding.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.790
But then, later on for
this project particular,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.119
I took the role of the writer.

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.244
So I was in charge of
writing most of the dialogue,

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:03.220
and that was also
very interesting.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.050
So I feel like I gained
a lot more skills

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.308
than I thought I would have.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.750
I think a really big
part of the process

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.850
is to start writing
really early.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.940
The writing, we
left it off a bit

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.492
until we had the
general mini games

00:03:18.492 --> 00:03:20.700
and used the writing to tie
everything back together.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.464
But I think it would have been
a much more smoother process

00:03:23.464 --> 00:03:24.880
or a much more
interesting process

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.129
if we had started the writing,
had we used the writing

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.260
to lead the design process.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.565
But it wasn't, I
mean, it would have

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:32.940
been better had
we started early,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.400
but it wasn't too bad or
too much of a difference

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.440
between the work we have now
and the work we had before.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.740
But aside from that, I
think it's really important

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.550
to start and meet
early and sort of come

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.890
to a consensus on
what you want to do.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.470
We had a lot of
mini-- the reason we--

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.070
we had a lot more mini games to
begin with than when we ended,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.790
and it was good that we met
early and decided what to cut

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.390
and what to include.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.620
And that helped us work
towards one common path.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.760
Working with the client
was very interesting.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.640
We met him two, three, four, or
five maybe, almost five times,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.800
I think it was.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.949
We've met him a
lot and interacting

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:19.990
with him was interesting.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.880
The first time we
met him was where

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.410
he did a lot of demonstrations
was, sort of, I guess,

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.570
showed us more what we were
supposed to be aiming for,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.330
because it was a very
social interaction,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.882
very deep interaction.

00:04:32.882 --> 00:04:35.340
And that I think the goal of
our games is to be a bit more,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.100
is to be really deep
while also appearing

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.750
to be very just playful.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.119
And he also helped us when we
were going on our art reworks,

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.660
that he was suggesting, like,
maybe you should look at these.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.070
You should look more
at towards this type

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.570
of the culture, this part
of the culture or this part.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.750
And that was very nice.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.415
That's the sort of interacting.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.940
The class has been
actually really fun.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.740
It's a lot of work.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.210
But it's a lot of
interesting work,

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.960
because once you see
the game-- I actually

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.600
hadn't seen the final
builds we had until today,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.310
and it was like, this
actually is really--

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.060
I had written the dialogue
separately, so I was just

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.790
looking at the art assets.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.080
And it was very nice to see
everything come together

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.970
in one nice build of, here's
the game you helped make.
