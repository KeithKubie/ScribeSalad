00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In order to get credit for this problem, all you have to do is hit the ship using that interphase

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I just described before, but here are a few bonus questions if you're feeling adventurous.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now, I warn you that these are pretty challenging so give them a try and feel free to discuss them

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
in the forums but you won't be graded on whether or not you can answer these questions.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The first bonus question is--what is the smallest angle α where

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the cannonball still makes it over the iceberg?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now you can imagine that at some point the angle α is going to be so small

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
if we keep decreasing it that no matter how hard we fire the cannon

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it won't be able to reach over the iceberg.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I want you to tell me what's the smallest angle is where I'm still guaranteed to be able to

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
make it over the iceberg if I fire, however, with as much power as I want.
