00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:14.415
In 1985, Robert Sternberg

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:17.575
presented a theory that has piqued the interest of various people

00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:20.235
A theory concretising something that has baffled the minds

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:23.065
and wrenched the hearts of many - Love

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:24.705
He called it the "Triangular Theory of Love"

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:27.445
As it's best explained in the form of a triangle

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:30.635
but it's more commonly known as "Sternberg's Theory of Love"

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:33.265
In the context of interpersonal relationships

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:35.965
there are three components of love

00:00:35.965 --> 00:00:37.875
intimacy, passion and commitment

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:40.975
According to the theory, intimacy

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:42.495
is the feeling of attachment

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:44.685
closeness, and connectedness

00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:46.280
Passion, on the other hand, is

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.255
the fiery depth and intenseness you experience when you like someone

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.420
encompassing the drive connected to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600
both romantic and sexual attraction

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.495
The third component, commitment, ties the other two together

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:58.515
as it encompasses short-term and

00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:01.715
long-term decisions to remain with one another and plan for the future

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:04.075
According to Sternberg's Theory of Love

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:05.755
there are six forms of love which are

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:09.145
combinations of the three components previously described

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.080
One, Nonlove

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.980
Nonlove is merely the absence

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.680
of all three components

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.515
This basically characterises the majority of our personal relationships which consists of simple

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.200
casual interactions

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.900
It could apply to your acquaintances, or to people who you're not particularly attached to

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:29.645
Two, Friendship

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:32.565
Friendship exists when only intimacy is present

00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:34.020
This is the set of feelings you experience

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.520
without the intense passion or commitment of romance

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.735
It can however be a root for other forms of love to manifest from

00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:40.985
 

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:44.755
Three, Infatuated Love

00:01:44.775 --> 00:01:47.405
Infatuation occurs when passion is present

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:49.715
and both intimacy and commitment is absent

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:52.835
Crushes fall under this category

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:55.435
Solely sexual relationships are also included

00:01:55.435 --> 00:01:58.005
as they are only bounded by carnal desires and nothing more

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.845
This is the most common root of romantic love as it's believed that

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:03.315
intimacy develops over time

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.180
But if neither intimacy nor commitment develops, this type of love

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.640
can fizzle over time

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.635
Four, Empty Love

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:13.735
An example of empty love is an unhappy marriage

00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:16.955
where intimacy and the flames of passion for your partner is gone

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:19.705
As a strong love deteriorates into empty love

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:22.565
nothing is left but the contract of marriage itself

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:25.495
It's characterised by the absence of intimacy and passion

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:28.395
despite the presence of commitment

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.040
Arranged marriages, on the other hand, can start out as empty loves

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.660
but can develop into other forms of love over time

00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:36.965
Five, Romantic Love

00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:39.955
Romantic love is a combination of intimacy and passion

00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:42.915
Relationships under this category

00:02:42.915 --> 00:02:45.805
not only involve physical bonds, but emotional bonds as well

00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:48.815
This is one of the most common stepping stones to married life

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:51.345
However, it lacks commitment

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:53.945
This type of relationship is easier to dissolve, with

00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:56.925
no legal issues, if you and your partner have had enough of it

00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:00.745
Six, Companionate Love

00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:03.455
Companionate Love is characterised by a combination of

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:06.465
intimacy and commitment, and the absence of passion

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:09.945
It's stronger than Friendship Love because of the addition of commitment

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:12.415
It's observed in long-term marriages where

00:03:12.415 --> 00:03:15.715
you don't necessarily need passion in order to stay in love with your partner

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.200
because affection still remains

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.380
Companionate Love can also be found among family members and close

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:23.655
friends who have strong platonic friendships

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:26.645
Seven, Fatuous Love

00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:30.395
A good example of a Fatuous Love is when Kim Kardashian

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:33.715
married Kris Humphries, only to divorce him 72 days later

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:36.895
It's a whirlwind of romance we usually see on television

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:40.025
Fatuous Love is the combination of commitment and passion

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:41.255
without intimacy

00:03:42.675 --> 00:03:45.085
Eight, Consummate Love

00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:47.365
Consummate Love sits at the very centre of the triangle

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:50.465
as it's said to be the perfect ideal type of love

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:53.200
All three components are present in this type of love

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.340
and it's the goal for people in relationships

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.880
According to Sternberg, couples experiencing

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.300
Consummate Love would continue to be sexually intimate years into the relationship

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.180
and they can't imagine themselves being happier with other partners

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.660
They work through their difficulties and

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.640
find a light in their relationships

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.500
However, Sternberg cautions that maintaining this relationship is harder than

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.480
achieving it and it's not a permanent form of love

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.600
With that, do you agree with the types of love that

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.120
Sternberg proposes?

00:04:20.305 --> 00:04:23.095
What other factors do you think affect a relationship?

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:25.355
Do you think the six forms of love are global?

00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:27.885
Or is there a subjective perspective for every couple?

00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:30.935
