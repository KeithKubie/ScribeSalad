Now, the language of war
is not only confusing--

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.972
the non-war war itself
is confusing.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.473
So here's what I'm gonna do,
guys. I'm gonna

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:09.308
break it down for you
in a new segment we're calling

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:11.310
Explaining Complex Stuff

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.188
Okay. That was pretty good.

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.524
Okay, tonight, we're using
<i> Game of Thrones</i>

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.692
<i> and Beyoncé's</i> Lemonade,
<i> all right?</i>

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:28.895
-Okay. Very good.
-(whooping)

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.631
Okay, so here's the thing,
Syria is a Westeros,

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.500
a war-torn country ruled
by rich assholes

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.302
who murder their own people,
okay?

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:37.970
That's Assad. Right?

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.139
Now, there are two main groups
who want regime change.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:41.941
Let's call the first one
angry rebels,

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:43.543
represented by Beyoncé.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.678
And, boy, let me tell you, man.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:49.615
Those are some angry ground
forces rebelling right there.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.417
All right?

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.885
Yeah.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:55.755
Okay, now, the other main group
who wants regime change is ISIS,

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:57.757
i.e., the White Walkers.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.559
Right? Yeah.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.360
Because they're scary
as (bleep),

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:03.763
and at some point, everyone's
gonna have to deal with them,

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:06.365
right? Now,
Assad is bolstered by Putin,

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:09.635
obviously represented here
by Jay Z.

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.637
Right? Right? Yes, yes, yes!

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.308
Because he-he and Beyoncé seem
to be in an open war

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.244
against each other, and that's
making everyone uncomfortable.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.847
And, of course, Beyoncé
is in her black power phase,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.049
so, of course, she's also at war
with the White Walkers.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.984
You know what I'm saying.
Right? Okay.

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:26.819
Now, the United States
is Khaleesi,

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:28.488
because she's across the ocean

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.959
and has superior air power she's
been unwilling to use so far.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.428
But Khaleesi is funding Beyoncé

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:39.165
by subscribing to Tidal
to listen to her<i> Lemonade</i> album.

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:41.167
Exactly, exactly.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.236
Also, we're not getting
into a war with Jay Z,

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.238
because that's a war
we probably can't win.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.973
We're not stupid.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.509
Now, the United Nations
is Hodor.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.377
Big presence

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.713
but nothing to say, really.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.781
And Solange Knowles is inva...

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:58.050
is involved in this mess
somehow, but it's not clear how.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:00.186
Uh, she may have killed Jon Snow
for breaking his vows.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.121
Nobody really knows.

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:03.789
And Rachael Ray is Turkey.

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.458
She got pulled into a flame war

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.460
that has nothing to do with her

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.328
except proximity.

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:10.730
Why is she in this?!

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:11.998
It doesn't make sense!

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.467
She just wants this to end!

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.003
Okay. So there you have it,
Syria perfectly explained

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.838
through the power
of pop culture.

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:27.647
Okay. Uh, look, the fact is,
if we're gonna defeat ISIS,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.316
we need all hands on deck,
and it's okay to say that!

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.952
Coded language is...
coded language is keeping it 55,

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.785
and this nation needs Obama
to keep it 100.
