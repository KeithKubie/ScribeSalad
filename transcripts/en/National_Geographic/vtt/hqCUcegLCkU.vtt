00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
where do you see things now that we're

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.799
about a month i would actually

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.290
distinguish between what we actually see

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.540
in the markets and the story that wall

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.090
street is telling the story that wall

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.290
street is telling is all optimistic

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.570
we're going to have all this boost

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.119
economic growth a lot of that seems to

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.350
me to be based upon wishful thinking if

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.720
you look at a chart that the stock

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.000
market over the past 10 years you see

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.099
this big dip with the economic crisis

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.019
and this huge rise and then there's

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.029
little further legal at the top which is

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.980
what's happened since this election that

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.870
the markets are not in fact building a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.880
huge optimism about chop

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.160
I think they are probably under waiting

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.379
the chance of catastrophe breaks it was

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.489
another recent world event where a lot

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.260
of people in the immediate aftermath

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.840
said this is going to be an economic

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.730
catastrophe running that hasn't quite

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.980
happened yet but it sounds like maybe

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.480
what you're saying is be careful about

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.340
getting too comfortable

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.789
well actually it Rex it was a huge shock

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.680
to the European project it's the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.199
consequences five years ten years down

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.739
the pike could be very severe it did not

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.330
put people with zero experience in

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.920
charge of running the British government

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.530
its people with long experience

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.900
competent they talk to people who are

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.520
are reasonable but it's nothing at all

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.159
like what happened here there's this

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.500
global moment that populism is having

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.450
right we're hearing that certainly here

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.939
but but in Europe as well that rise of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.759
populist leaders you wrote recently that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.579
that term is is somewhat miss attributed

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.880
to Donald Trump in the sense then in his

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.890
first few weeks he has pretty much been

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.350
citing economically with big business

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.710
versus the individuals the populace we

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.960
can meet a bunch of things and normally

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.450
when you say populism you have in mind

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.220
someone who is is a fact on it soak the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.240
rich and do all kinds of stuff for the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.810
populace and is doesn't care about the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.810
elite
