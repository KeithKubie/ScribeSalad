[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:08.119
SPEAKER: Levi
William EagleFeather,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.790
the founder of the
IronEagleFeather Project,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.140
is a Sicangu Lakota from the
Rosebud Sioux Reservation

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.860
in Rosebud, South Dakota.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.000
At age four, Levi was forcibly
removed from his family

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.820
and adopted to a Nebraska
farming family, a practice

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.130
quite common at that time.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.640
No longer having access to
his community or his culture,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.890
he ran away at age 15.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.980
By age 17, he had joined
the US Marine Corps, where

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.940
he served from 1974 to 1978.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.420
Experiencing a cultural
reawakening in his 20s,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.370
he returned to his
Lakota roots and began

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.610
relearning the history,
ceremony, and tradition that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.300
is the bedrock of
the Lakota lifestyle.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.680
During this time, he worked
as a union carpenter, then

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.220
an electrician,
raised five children,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.120
and was foster parent
to many at-risk youth.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.790
In the '90s, he made
it his life work

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.630
to reintroduce the Lakota
way by utilizing the emerging

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.480
cultural revitalization
movement.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.880
He used the tools he learned
from studying psychology

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.420
in college and his time
spent in the Western world

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.260
in combination with the ceremony
and tradition of his people

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.420
to work with at-risk
youth and adults

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.730
on and off the reservation.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.840
He has worked in crisis centers,
group homes, and foster care

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.040
settings, developing programs
for more than 20 years.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.910
He has conducted spiritual
camps and developed workshops

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.320
using cultural
activities for decades.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.400
It's now my pleasure
to introduce you

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.221
to Levi EagleFeather.

00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:45.720
Levi.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.570
All of you know that
climate change is real.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.470
I also know from my
visit here at your campus

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.700
that you hold many of
the same values and ideas

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.010
that a lot of us Lakotas hold.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.270
And it shows in the way
that you treat your people

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.450
and how supportive
you are of all

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.340
the people within your group,
your culture, your business.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.670
All of these core principles
and understandings

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.190
come from our shared
need of each other.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.510
And you found that.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.250
And it's a shared need that
we need to interact and find

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.770
our optimum selves.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.950
As a son, a father,
and a grandfather,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.830
like you, I know we all care
for our parents, our children,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.130
our partners, and much more.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.790
We share those same feelings.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.460
I'm here to share with you my
understanding, some of which

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.970
is shared by other grassroots
Lakotas, where I'm from,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.780
of how Lakota thought and life
practices direct our thinking

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.390
and reasoning where I'm from.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.540
One of the things that directs
our thoughts and our reasoning

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.530
is prayer.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.485
In Lakota, we look at songs
as holding these prayers.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.480
I'm going to start
my presentation

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.280
with one of those prayers.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.010
And I'll explain to you
a little bit about it.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.960
The words are very simple.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.530
It is, "Grandfather"-- as
some of you might think,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.300
it might be God--

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.190
"I'm having a hard time.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.420
Help me."

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.500
Very simple.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.220
Most of our prayers in
Lakota are very simple.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.500
I have divided my
presentation into four parts.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.310
Each part I will be introducing
with one of those prayers.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.246
And each song I will be
explaining when I sing it.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.090
When we think about who
we are and what we are,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.140
in Lakota there's a
common-held belief--

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.960
we may not state it
this way all the time,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.670
but it's a common-held
belief that all of us,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.640
everything, is made of
the metals, minerals,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.950
and liquids of the
Earth, and that we

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.930
get our energy from the sun.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.220
When we think of
it this way, it's

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.120
inescapable to recognize that
the Earth would be our mother.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.740
We're made at our
DNA level, our forms,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.370
of the metals, minerals,
and liquids, of the Earth.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.600
In the same token, when we
get our energy from the sun,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.970
we would think of the sun as
being male, or Father Sky.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.220
And those things are natural
and very easy to understand.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.100
The ceremonies and rituals
passed down by my relatives

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.390
not only helped me
understand my responsibility

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.240
to include the Earth when
I think about my health

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.240
and welfare.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.910
It's like thinking
of your mother.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.340
It's a natural process.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.760
And as an adult, as a
son and as a father,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.320
it's my responsibility to learn
as much about these things

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.180
as I can, simply so that I can
pass them on to my children

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.260
and to my grandchildren.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.920
OK?

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.170
But let me remind
you, before I get

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.660
started, that I was raised
away from my people.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.770
I was taken from my people.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.600
So I grew up in Western society
without any of these ceremonies

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.830
and rituals.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.340
I think what's important
to non-Lakota to people

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.440
to understand when I bring
this message that I bring

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.170
is that as a human being, not
as anything else, but as a human

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.710
being, I am the same
as you in the fact

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.390
that I was able to learn
this culture, Lakota culture.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.890
OK?

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.800
A lot of times, people,
we get into these talks

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.010
about who we are and
what we are and DNA.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.720
And somehow, it happens that
from DNA, we become Lakota.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.610
But actually being
a Lakota in our way

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:47.660
is about being good allies,
good relatives, good parents,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.510
all of the same
things that you hold.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.381
But that is our focus.

00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:52.880
OK?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.510
It's not to go out and
be the best at everything

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.560
else other than just being
who we are as human beings.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.910
But these ceremonies and
rituals as we get into them

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.280
and we began to
teach them and we

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.050
began to model them
for our children

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.020
because children oftentimes
follow what we model better

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:23.680
than what we try to teach
verbally, they become you.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.570
You become them.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.357
And every time that you think,
that is what you think first.

00:07:29.357 --> 00:07:31.690
And that is why I said these
ceremonies and rituals help

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.910
us to think of Mother
Earth before we

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:39.278
make bigger decisions about
our own health and welfare.

00:07:39.278 --> 00:07:44.740
OK, now, when we think of being
made of the metals, minerals,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.440
and liquids of Earth, we
tend to think that that

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.340
is what makes us human beings.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:52.840
OK?

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.790
But that's just our human form.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.750
It's actually the energy
that we get from the sun

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.460
that our ceremonies and
rituals are trying to direct.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.220
OK?

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:10.420
And in Lakota, we believe
that that energy, that life,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:17.800
that energy that is our
life force, our being,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.910
if you can catch that--
it's what we are being--

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.320
is what that energy directs.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.830
And in Lakota, we have our
own ways of looking at things.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.980
That actual energy force
that is our being we think

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.539
is divided into four parts.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.400
And in Lakota, this
would be like a map.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.300
To the West, we consider
that part of our

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.490
being as spiritually based.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.310
Another part to that
being is the emotion.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:01.070
Another part is
intelligence, information.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.840
The last part is physical.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.430
Our being is connected
to all those four parts.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:12.050
That energy, in our belief,
it is our environment

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.100
and how we model
our social awareness

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:22.740
and our personal awareness that
allows people to learn faster.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.470
And if we sit them
in the classroom

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:30.020
and try to teach them the morals
and the values in a normal way

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:30.890
that we do this.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:41.660
Throughout my relearning
Lakota ways of life--

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:51.570
and I spent a lot of time in
an environment where most of us

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.430
young Indian people
were doing this.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.960
We were also involved in places
like going to the university,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.480
having jobs in Western society.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.240
And oftentimes, we
don't often think

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.710
of how those things influence
the way that we think,

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.470
reason, and behave.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:18.660
And one of the things that I
discovered during that time

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.830
is that almost all
of this information

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.500
that Lakota people talk about
and other people talk about,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.350
about spirituality, is known.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.550
It's been reported on.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.660
It's been documented.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.450
It's been written.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.000
But somehow, we've
been separated

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.550
from a lot of that information.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.330
And even in Lakota,
we're finding

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.590
that a lot of information
that we use today, a lot of us

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.710
find that information
from reading.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.530
A lot of us find
that information

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:57.920
from watching like this,
in different settings,

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.550
where somebody comes and they
teach us about certain things.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.970
This is something
that is modern.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.280
And in doing this
discovery, you find out

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.100
that there's a lot of
people along the way that

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.370
have had associations with
Indian people that have done

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:17.270
incredible studies and left
big bodies of information

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.230
behind them.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:23.900
And while I was in college,
I studied psychology,

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.530
and I ran across a lot
of people that pointed me

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.440
in directions that
helped me learn how

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.520
to apply a lot of the cultural
activities and programs

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.220
that I do so that they were
more cultural in the design

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.280
and in the implementation,
the methodology.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.790
One of these gentlemen
that I talk about,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.350
or that I utilize some of his
theories, is Erik Erikson.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.260
How many of you have heard
of him in psychology?

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.800
Erik Erikson, OK?

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.360
A few of you have.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.610
Well, Erik Erikson was
of German heritage.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.170
And he was a psychologist.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.700
He came to America.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.030
But one of the
things that he did

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.420
was that he studied in
Pine Ridge, South Dakota

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.960
on the Oglala
Lakota reservation.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.590
He worked in an elders home.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.520
And he did, of course, study
them as he was working there.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.980
He's written several books
about those relationships.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.490
One of the things
that he came up with

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:32.230
and that he is famous for is his
design of developmental stages

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.790
for human beings.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.170
And he has eight of them that
he developed, all the way

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.140
from childhood to death.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.950
That's all good.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:47.090
In Lakota, we have four
basic developmental stages.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:54.860
That's childhood, of course,
youth or young adult, adult,

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.430
and elders.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:03.470
And like this, we believe that
there are, of course, birth,

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.790
all of those things are
covered on this medicine wheel

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.975
as well, the four different
developmental stages.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:21.480
Along with learning and
studying Erik Erikson's work,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.130
I also ran across a guy by
the name of Howard Gardner.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.470
How many of you have
ever heard that name?

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.430
OK.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.830
Now Howard Gardner
proposed the theory

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.410
of multiple intelligences.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.960
And as Erik Erikson's
work kind of

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.880
aligned with the way
the Lakota believe

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.050
in developmental stages,
we, as Lakota people,

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.200
also realize, whether we call
them intelligences or not.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.490
Sometimes we call them gifts.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.860
Sometimes we call
them strong points.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.960
But these intelligences,
we believe

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.600
that there are more than one
way of seeing and doing things,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.250
understanding things.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:05.520
The intelligences that
Howard Gardner came up with,

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.040
as we look at them across
developmental stages

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:13.170
from childhood to adulthood,
we start with interpersonal,

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.800
learning that relationship
between a mother and a baby.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.030
That's very inter.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.130
And about
intrapersonal, we learn

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:24.710
that as a very young child,
how we should behave.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.580
Then we go into
bodily kinesthetics.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.070
We all are familiar
with how kids learn how

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.770
to put things in their mouth.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.660
Bodily kinesthetics,
how to do the things

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.370
that we do in a normal day.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.630
Logical mathematical, that's
another type of intelligence

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:45.780
that Howard Gardner talked
about or believed in.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.780
Then there was
linguistic intelligence.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.180
And linguistic intelligence,
the Lakota people kind

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.010
of part a little bit
from this because we

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.410
believe that communication,
a lot of communication,

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.940
is nonverbal.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.500
And we have
communication between

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.140
many, many different things
around us in our environment.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.277
And I think you're aware
of some of those things.

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:05.610
I hope you are, and I'll talk
about a little bit of them

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.710
later on.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.680
Another intelligence is musical.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.410
We believe that there is
a musical intelligence,

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.170
a musical component.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.730
And the last one is spatial.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:21.390
And this is one that we get
to as adults, as elders.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.020
And that's how things
actually fit together.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.750
That's having a good idea of
what the macrocosm is about.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.370
That's how we view spatial.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:36.810
And one thing that we discover
also when we study psychology

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.440
is about behavior
management, or modification.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.290
We all understand
what that is, right?

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.030
You got up this morning.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.000
You came to work.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.130
The first stop
sign you ran into,

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.990
that's behavior modification.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.820
And I think a lot
of psychologists

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.180
spend a lot of hours
figuring out how to do that.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.470
But that's what external
behavior modification is about.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.390
Lakota culture,
as we look at it,

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.930
is a way of imparting
or instilling

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.680
internal behavior modification.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.330
I would like to
explain a little bit

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.250
about how this is happening.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:15.090
I'm going to use the example
of a stove, a hot stove, a wood

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.740
stove.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.910
And you have a baby.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.050
And the baby is
sitting on the floor.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.352
The baby starts to
walk to the stove.

00:16:22.352 --> 00:16:24.060
And the first thing,
the adult sees that.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:24.893
He goes over there--

00:16:24.893 --> 00:16:26.700
no, no, no, no,
no, no, it's hot.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.150
And you bring him back.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.730
You set him down.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.570
Two seconds later, he
thinks it's a game.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.360
He goes, ha, ha!

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.110
Parent-- no, no,
no, no, no, hot.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.400
And we bring him back.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.260
The example for the
Lakota lifestyle

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.290
is where he comes up there
and he touches the stove.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.950
And as he touches the
stove, you say, no, no, hot.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.870
That information has been
transferred to internal now.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.760
And this is the kind of
practical application

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.760
of these cultural ways that
I am trying to talk about.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.880
Now I'm ready to
sing the second song.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.599
Lakota ceremony
and ritual is a way

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.300
that shows us how to fit
into this big macrocosm,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.060
natural macrocosm.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.124
So our prayer songs also
guide us along that way.

00:17:19.124 --> 00:17:21.540
The song that I'm about to
sing is called the Mother Earth

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.010
Song.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:29.010
And the gist of this song is
"Grandfather, the Creator,

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:29.940
I'm standing here.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.710
Life is hard.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.220
Help me.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.520
Help me with my energy.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.470
It is my purpose to
live with Mother Earth."

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.430
And as I told you before, it's
the ceremonies and rituals

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:48.680
of Lakota lifestyle
that from birth to life,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.260
they control the way we learn
and the kind of information

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.459
we get through the
developmental stages.

00:17:54.459 --> 00:17:56.000
But what they're
actually controlling

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.140
is those intelligences
that we have.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.210
And when you think of
ceremonies and rituals,

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.000
they're not the actual
conditioning elements

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.950
that instill the behavior.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.260
The actual rites that
I'm talking about,

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.300
the rites that
I'm talking about,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.830
are what guide the whole nation.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.340
There are many, many more
ceremonies and rituals

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:24.310
that are independent of the
small groups and the families

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.540
and individuals.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.280
But there are seven
over-arcing ones

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.190
that have a goal and
that help us to be

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.400
who we are as Lakota people.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.220
Of course, one of the
first ones would be Making

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.750
of Relatives, or a Hunkapi.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:47.740
And that could be considered
as part of a naming ceremony

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.560
and an adoption
type of ceremony.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.420
It's a making of relatives.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.610
You have a new child come in.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.960
Of course, you want to name it.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.950
That's a part of what one of
these ceremonies is about.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.450
And every developmental
stage that we enter into,

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:11.620
I would say the ages would
be 0 to 13, 13 into our 20s.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.260
Then we become an adult,
20s into the whatever.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.020
And then the
eldership at the end.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.660
OK?

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.940
And that's kind of
how you look at it.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.890
Next rites that we would
be involved in probably

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.250
on a communal level
as young people

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.030
would probably be the Inipi,
or purification ceremony,

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.680
especially for boys.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.600
A long time ago, it used
to be a men-only ceremony.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.680
And I think it's
changed in large part

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.630
over the years because of
not only indoctrination,

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.290
but assimilation to a
patriarchal society.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.820
And a long time ago, women,
because of their moon,

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:56.530
the menstrual cycle, had a
way of purifying themselves.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.930
At least, this is culturally
how we look at it.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.250
And men did not.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.720
And men needed one.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.480
We needed a way to
make life as well.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.300
This ceremony is also
considered at times

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.710
to be a way that we go.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:09.730
We pray.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.080
We re-energize ourselves.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.700
We make life.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.500
Women don't need that.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:19.375
They're the only
part of our society,

00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:21.880
the only ones within our
society, that can actually

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.800
create life.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.950
Then you enter into that next--

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.125
we would call it
teens, young adults.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:37.240
And those ceremonies that
impact us at that time for girls

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.340
would be Preparing a
Girl for Womanhood.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:49.320
And that happens at their
first menstrual time.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.570
The Throwing the Ball is
also associated with women.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:58.800
But it's also more
of a social event

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.910
involving the whole community.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.800
Hanblecheya used to be
a male-only ceremony.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.040
It more involves both
women and men nowadays.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.430
And it is what they say, like,
they are crying for a vision,

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.870
trying to figure out what our
purpose is spiritually in life.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:17.370
OK?

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:23.000
And then we go to Wiwanyag
Wachipi, which is a sun dance.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.510
It used to also be
a men-only ceremony.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.320
And it's a
regeneration ceremony.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.160
Think of the sun.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.230
Our energy comes from the sun.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:36.490
This is a specific ceremony
that is to regenerate us.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.650
Now, all of these
seven ceremonies,

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.030
as you can see, just
as they describe,

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.850
they are about
giving us direction.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:47.080
They are about
helping, guiding us

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:51.230
through our lives from
childhood up through adulthood.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:22:01.880
And we believe that every one
of these sacred ceremonies

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:09.110
holds values and a morality
that is expected of a Lakota.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.730
We do believe that.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:15.650
And there is a specific
protocol and conduct involved

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.980
in each ceremony and each rite.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.850
And of course, as children, in
participation in these things,

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.030
we learn that as we
go so that by the time

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:30.850
it comes to our time, it's
just elders instructing us.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:36.410
And it's more of a rite.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.290
We know what that
knowledge means now.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.350
And in each one of these,
that's how that follows through.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.410
We believe that the continued
usage of these ceremonies

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:55.430
and rites ensures not only
our commitment as individuals,

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.280
but our whole
society's commitment

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.360
to peaceful relationships
and being good relatives.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.280
And that's very, very
important to Lakota people.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.820
Kabilesi, our commitment,
is not what we talk about.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.790
And it's not what we say.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.880
But it's what we do in Lakota.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.600
And to see our commitment
to this philosophy,

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.274
to this way of life, you can
see these types of commitments

00:23:28.274 --> 00:23:29.940
through the preservation
of Earth, which

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.630
for us includes almost every
environmental issue that you

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:38.820
can think of, but
most recently, issues

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:44.400
over clean water, and for us,
food sovereignty, conservation,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.540
appropriate farming, and
animal husbandry practices.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:55.630
And this type of commitment,
it extends into everything

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.720
that we do, whether we're
putting in a water filtration

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.010
plant, or whether we're
manning and maintaining

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.200
a protest in Standing Rock.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.220
That fundamental
values and stuff

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.310
is what drives all
of those things.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.550
I'm going to sing
the third song now.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:20.140
And it's a healing song.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.500
And think about all the
things I've been telling you.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.586
As Lakota people, this
song is very simple.

00:24:26.586 --> 00:24:30.930
It says, "Grandfather"--
or God, as you would say--

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.060
"help me with my energy.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.100
I'm doing this so I can live."

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.730
And I don't know how many of
you have followed Standing Rock.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.550
But that's the core
of that message.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.590
We're not doing
this for notoriety.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.930
We're not doing
this for extra cash.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.900
Man, made of the metals,
minerals, and liquids

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.740
of Earth-- we need that liquid.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.610
We need that clean water.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.230
And I won't go any
more into that.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.050
I think you guys get it.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.080
So as I think this
third song afterwards,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.960
I'm going to go into a little
bit about how that commitment

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.320
looks in Rosebud.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.520
Now, the commitments
that we have in

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.460
Rosebud towards
these things that I

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:27.000
was talking to you about--
clean water, food sovereignty,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.550
conservation.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.590
There's so many words
we can use to describe

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:34.080
that, appropriate
farming techniques, all

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.190
of those things--

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:40.710
are primarily missed
by my generation.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:41.490
And I'll tell you.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:41.700
OK?

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.750
I'm going explain
to you a little bit

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.666
how that could happen.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:52.350
My generation, there was more of
an impetus by the governments,

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:57.540
by everybody, powers that
be, to still separate us

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:05.100
from our roots, which is,
of course, the reservation.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.430
Part of that process
was to come out here,

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:14.850
out into Western society,
and to develop a career,

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.924
to learn a trade, to do
those kind of things.

00:26:17.924 --> 00:26:19.590
Now, there's one way
of looking at this.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.950
Historically, we can say, that
was just such a terrible thing

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.980
for those white people to do.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.730
And I would say, yes,
it was something that

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.490
should have never happened.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.140
But it did happen.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.580
And we can't take it back.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.860
We can't change it.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.570
And it goes back to that same
old thing that a lot of people

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:44.120
say-- when life gives you
lemons, what do you do?

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.040
Well, what did I do?

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.270
I fell in love
with a nice woman.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:50.490
We had children. .

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.790
And I realized that in
order to make lemons,

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.600
I had to go to school.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.220
And it's those kind
of things that I

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:03.500
came to believe in in myself
that I began to pursue,

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.330
knowing full well that I
didn't fit, blah, blah, blah.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.566
I wasn't a part of,
blah, blah, blah.

00:27:11.566 --> 00:27:13.190
But the big thing
about it is, I didn't

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.010
realize until much later,
is that I picked up

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.230
a lot of good skills.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:22.010
And I picked up part of this
what I'm talking to you about--

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.370
innovation and
scientific thinking.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.770
I'm saying that's a part
of Lakota thinking too.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.100
But it's more refined out here.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.350
And those things
really helped me.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.660
Because if you think about
this culture and rituals,

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.800
before colonization,
there was no need

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.910
to teach this like this.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.800
We just did it as a
part of the natural way

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.960
of getting up every day
and going through life.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.950
The skills and the things
that I picked up out

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.570
in Western society are
appropriate for this time.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.600
There's no way we can go back
and have the pristine natural

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.880
and live that way.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.950
We're going to have to
deconstruct, re-engineer.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:08.360
There's a lot of
things like that

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.330
that we're going to have to do.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:14.060
And they're like, you
need the innovation

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.310
and the scientific thinking.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.610
And if you think
about your history,

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.340
I'm sure that it's
very similar to mine

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.160
if you go back far enough.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.160
And I'm saying we're
all re-engineering

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.930
and deconstructing
at this point.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.540
We feel that?

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.030
We're all in this together.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.200
Now a couple of the things--

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.030
I'm not going to cover a
lot of different projects

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.480
that we're doing.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.630
But I'm going to try
to stay in and show you

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:50.840
how who we are as human beings,
the culture and the traditions,

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:56.360
actually looks like on
the far end, on the end we

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.415
want to be in.

00:28:57.415 --> 00:28:58.620
[LAUGHS]

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.360
And I'm going to use Three
Sisters Gardening, one

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.110
of the techniques.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.568
How many of you
have heard of that?

00:29:03.568 --> 00:29:06.340
If you grew up in New
York, you've heard of that.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.970
And the other one, I'm going
to use an example, somewhat

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:11.630
of an example.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:17.810
I'm going to compare
cows and buffalo.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.330
Buffalo are traditional
animals where I come from.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.110
We can't own Three Sisters
Gardening because we learned

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:28.940
that from somewhere else.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.300
But we have other plants.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.350
If you look at Three
Sisters Gardening in a way

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:40.070
as being a way of
companion planting,

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.160
plants that help
each other to grow--

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.350
and I'll explain
that a little bit.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.260
We use three sisters as
corn, beans, and squash.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:52.190
Corn grows up.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.360
There's a stalk.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.320
You plant the beans.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.750
The beans crawl the stalk.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.230
And the squash,
the large plants,

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.150
cover a large area of ground.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.340
At least, this is theory.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.923
Unless you've actually
done it, you'll

00:30:04.923 --> 00:30:08.210
find there's a lot of other
things involved in that.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:12.110
But the big leaves of the
squash keep the moisture

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.780
in the ground, as well as
keeping the other plants

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.490
from growing too fast.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:24.100
Now, there are a lot
of nuances to this.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:24.600
OK?

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.370
And it's those
things, we just don't

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.340
want to look at it as
companion planting.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:34.240
When we look at that, we
have to see as we're doing,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.790
how it's putting something
back into the Earth.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.961
Because we're giving
back to Mother Earth.

00:30:41.961 --> 00:30:43.710
We're brothers and
sisters with the plant.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.780
We got our metals,
minerals, and liquids.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:52.155
All forms are from the metals,
minerals, liquids of the Earth.

00:30:52.155 --> 00:30:55.320
And everything gets its
energy from the sun.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.490
So we basically follow
the same patterns of life.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.810
We take from the Earth.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.480
And then somehow we
give back to the Earth.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.090
In respect to the Three
Sisters Gardening,

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:10.920
beans return nitrogen
to the Earth.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:18.530
And one thing that
I know at home,

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.230
with the introduction
of cattle, cattle

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:26.060
are not traditional to
the land where I'm from.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.830
And they go out
there a lot of times,

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:32.700
and they eat the wrong plants.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.780
And they die.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.910
Cattle can do that.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:39.150
And buffalo from where I'm
from, they go out there

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.500
and they know how to eat.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.150
They know the difference.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.790
And they're also not as
invasive to the land.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.810
It has to do with the way
that their hooves are made

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.070
and how they go through.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.760
They eat.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.900
When they eat, buffaloes will
eat from the top of the grass.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.670
Cows will go all the
way down to the roots

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:58.410
and pull the roots out.

00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.462
That's just a difference.

00:31:59.462 --> 00:32:00.420
It's just a difference.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.675
OK?

00:32:02.675 --> 00:32:04.050
And buffalo, the
way that they're

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:08.060
made, if you look at them,
they're natural seeders.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.810
Man, they take the
seed off the grass,

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.690
and they can take it
for miles and miles.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.480
There's just a lot of different
things, as you study them,

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.610
that you can see that
they're more indigenous.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:18.930
They fit in with the land.

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.106
That commitment that
I was talking about,

00:32:24.106 --> 00:32:25.980
that comes from these
ceremonies and rituals,

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.590
were missed in my generation.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:32.700
But now, the next generation
is coming through,

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.620
and they're picking it up.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.740
It's very important
to them right now.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.320
Standing Rock, the
issues at Standing Rock,

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.570
were first confronted
by women and by youth.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.230
And that's a shift that
we're going through now.

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:50.010
OK?

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.110
And that's all the more
I have to say about that.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:01.260
The other part to the Three
Sisters Gardening I want to say

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.260
is that each part
of the plant is

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.570
assigned a specific
role from the root,

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.080
stems, leaves, et cetera.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.760
And we believe that it is
imbued with deep cultural--

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:21.039
it is understanding and
meaning and plays a big role

00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:23.080
in our ceremonies and
rituals, especially when it

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.090
comes to healing.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:29.110
I've got a couple of examples to
help people to understand that.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:35.610
And I'm going to use the example
of honey and anti-histamines

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:37.570
and allergies.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:42.350
And Lakota people, we believe
that spirit comes from place.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:47.680
And what that means is if you
have allergies, the bees that

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.960
go all around the area
that you're living,

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.820
they collect all
of this nice stuff

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.670
that they put into this
thing they call honey.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.640
But everything that they
go around and gather,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.810
all of that nice stuff that
they put into that honey,

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:05.720
is the very stuff that you need
to build up your immune system.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.310
Everybody get the gist of that?

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.800
And that's not trying
to be over vague.

00:34:14.776 --> 00:34:21.900
But some of this stuff is better
when you think it out yourself.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.400
Everybody understand that?

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.520
I'm just kind of dropping
a little seed in there.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.629
OK?

00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:27.920
As long as you understand that.

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:37.250
Now, why would I come here?

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.860
And why would I
talk to all of you?

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.530
I recognize that a lot of
this cultural knowledge,

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.090
like I said, it's printed.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:50.620
We've documented it.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.330
It's out there.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:55.810
But we're the same
way as you in the fact

00:34:55.810 --> 00:35:01.220
that a lot of that
information gets put somewhere

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.960
in our busy lives.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.260
We don't have the
time, energy maybe.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:10.670
There's a lot of things involved
to really pursue and to upgrade

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.950
and to update to
that information.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.360
It's common.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.340
It happens all the time.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:25.550
But like, you we Lakotas have
realized that we either do this

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.677
or we die.

00:35:27.677 --> 00:35:29.260
We're kind of at a
tipping point where

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.310
we can't let it go any longer.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:39.260
And I'm not really good at
being scary because I'm always

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.220
trying to help people
from being scared.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.770
So I'm not-- but I don't
know how many of you

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:48.945
feel real tense at this
time, not really knowing

00:35:48.945 --> 00:35:49.820
how it's going to go.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.162
You feel like some bad
things could happen,

00:35:52.162 --> 00:35:53.120
but you're not really--

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.080
do we have time?

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.090
Can we really save ourselves?

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.220
I think we're all at that way.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.210
The only answer
to that in Lakota

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.800
is that would become
connected again,

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.530
not only to Mother
Earth, but to each other.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.740
How do we do that?

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.980
In Lakota, if we would have
done this really ceremonial when

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.820
I came in here, I would have
shook each one of your hands.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.830
We would have shook
each other's hands.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.194
That's a physical connection.

00:36:19.194 --> 00:36:21.610
We would have looked each other
in the eye and said hello.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.280
Who are you?

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.040
I'm so-and-so.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.870
That's how you connect.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.460
And this is what I'm
trying to do out here.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.360
I'm trying to bring that
understanding that I have.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.270
And it's my commitment
to these things.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:37.240
I'm trying to encourage.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.730
I know there's a lot of people
doing a lot of good things.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.026
I found that out since I
came here to Santa Cruz.

00:36:42.026 --> 00:36:44.650
And there's a lot of people that
really got their heads screwed

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.690
on pretty good.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:49.510
When you're in my bubble in
Rosebud, we don't know that.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.630
Now you see why I'm trying
to make connections.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.830
And I'm hoping--

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.900
I know that I come out
here and talk to people.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.420
And people say, oh, what's
going on in Standing Rock?

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.795
What's going on
in Standing Rock?

00:37:02.795 --> 00:37:04.814
I said, do you even
know who we are?

00:37:04.814 --> 00:37:06.480
Do you even know why
we're doing things?

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.020
And I said, I'm thinking
that because I'm

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.174
coming from a lot of years
of conditioned understanding

00:37:12.174 --> 00:37:14.090
of how we get treated
and how we get talked to

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.709
and how we get talked about.

00:37:15.709 --> 00:37:17.500
So the first thing I
want to do is come out

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.610
and say, this so we are.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:23.820
This is a little bit more about
who we are and how it works.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.190
And it's not like it's so great
and so hard to understand,

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.080
because it isn't.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.710
It's very simple.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.100
How many of you agree
with me that with me?

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.150
It is.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:42.830
And so from the very
beginning, shake your hand.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:43.950
This is connection.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.500
Looking at each other,
that's connection.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.300
I know how many of
you walk around,

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.790
you don't want to connect.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.920
That's our society
that does that.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.986
That's not us.

00:37:53.986 --> 00:37:55.370
We're social.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:58.690
Get around animals, horses.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.750
They'll show you
how social happens.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.610
That's why we say,
to be out with nature

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:07.080
and to be around nature
shows us so much.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.650
OK, I'm going to
sing the last song.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:15.370
And then we will have a
question and answer, I guess.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:19.290
This last song is something
that we also teach ourselves

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.380
that we have to be, thankful.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.830
This song is thanking
you, thanking everything.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:30.050
"Thank you for the
life you have given me"

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:34.400
is basically the words
that are being said.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.920
How many there heard of
Wounded Knee, the first one?

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.610
It was a bad day, right?

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:47.500
That happened in
December of 1890.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.110
That happened in
December of 1890.

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:54.190
In November of 1890,
Ohio State University

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:57.430
played its first football game.

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.690
That kind of puts
in time perspective.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:06.210
So 127 years ago, that's
what we looked like.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.330
That's how we dressed.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.020
That's how we
conducted ourselves.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.730
127 years ago,
believe it or not,

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.750
we were on horseback,
living in teepees,

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.810
chasing buffalo
across the prairie.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:15.810
That was the last of it.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:17.960
That was when it ended.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.610
AUDIENCE: Two
questions actually.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:24.860
First one is when you were taken
from your biological parents,

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.690
did they ever visit you?

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.860
Could they visit you?

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.500
Or did you go back to see them?

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.760
LEVI EAGLEFEATHER: I
reunited with my family,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:40.200
a part of my family, in 1976.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.250
It was like 12, 13
years afterwards.

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:47.510
So for me, my being
separated from my family

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.670
was not as long as some people.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.430
Now, when you go through
the adoption process

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:53.960
as an American Indian--

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.700
and I think this is
nationwide to everybody-- they

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.880
seal your court records, all.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:06.564
So that cuts you off effectively
from being able to get back.

00:40:06.564 --> 00:40:07.355
And this is where--

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.250
not to be political, or
not to get out of bounds,

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.290
but so that we understand.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:18.110
This is where a lot of
American Indian people

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.450
look at the adoption
process and say

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:23.560
that it was an act of genocide.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.830
They moved us from our people
to a totally different culture,

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:31.730
cut off all connections back.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.300
And some people like
to say it's cultural.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.760
We say, well, what about all
those people that got out here

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.760
and they couldn't live
because they had nobody there

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.010
to help them?

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.710
AUDIENCE: You talked
about the whole focus is

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:48.350
on teaching people to be good--

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:53.330
good allies, good
friends, and good family.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.670
What do you do to
make things just?

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:59.270
When somebody veers off
or things don't go well,

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.700
how do you make things just?

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.230
How do you do justice?

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:06.020
LEVI EAGLEFEATHER:
Well, first of all,

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.290
our system works differently.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:09.790
Rather than having
a group of people

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.748
where you have a few
people on the outside that

00:41:11.748 --> 00:41:16.750
are exerting external control,
justice doesn't really

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.670
happen the same way.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.550
When you have a group of people
where everything is internally

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:25.726
built on the same principles,
the same values, those type

00:41:25.726 --> 00:41:27.100
of things, over
a period of time,

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.730
and you always have
mentors, you always

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:32.650
have people that are
coaching, always having

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.250
people that are helping--

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:38.320
because that's the whole
purpose of the community.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.650
Then you have less problems
of lack of justice.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:45.052
We work on the same things
that everybody else works on--

00:41:45.052 --> 00:41:49.290
jealousies, low self-esteem.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:56.350
But our culture, our
rites, our ways of life

00:41:56.350 --> 00:42:02.300
are directed to
building relationships

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.420
that that's minimized.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:04.920
OK?

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.200
That's a part of the
plan, so to speak.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:07.980
OK?

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.800
And whether those things
were handed down from God,

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.860
or whether over hundreds
and hundreds of years,

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:18.570
we just realized, don't
touch that hot stove,

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.050
those things came to be.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:24.840
And as they exist today,
because it's only 127 years ago,

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:31.260
we still have memories, and we
still have ties to those ways.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.260
AUDIENCE: How long ago was
it that the law changed

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:38.400
that they can no longer adopt
children who are Indian?

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.310
I've forgotten the name of
the law, Indian Welfare Act?

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:42.390
LEVI EAGLEFEATHER:
Indian Child Welfare Act.

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:43.848
AUDIENCE: Indian
Child Welfare Act.

00:42:43.848 --> 00:42:46.799
LEVI EAGLEFEATHER: I believe
it happened in the '80s.

00:42:46.799 --> 00:42:48.840
I know that the American
Indian Religious Freedom

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.840
Act happened in 1978,
the ability to practice

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.750
our religions again.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.200
And I'm not really positive.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.570
I'm just taking a guess that
it happened in the '80s.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:00.302
AUDIENCE: The important thing
is not when, but it did happen.

00:43:00.302 --> 00:43:01.260
LEVI EAGLEFEATHER: Yes.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.060
AUDIENCE: So now that
doesn't continue.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:03.600
LEVI EAGLEFEATHER: It happened.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.430
And it's like so
many laws that they

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.050
passed for the majority of us.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.420
It has no teeth.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.880
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell us, when we

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.560
you were repatriated
to the Lakota at what

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.630
seemed like around 19
or 20 years of age,

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:21.330
how difficult was it for you
to relearn all of the history

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:22.170
and tradition?

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:25.109
How much had you remembered
from your childhood?

00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:27.150
LEVI EAGLEFEATHER: I was
taken at four years old.

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:30.990
I was able to speak
as a four-year-old.

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:35.360
You're going to have to
all decide what that was.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.740
Why IronEagleFeather
Project exists today

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:46.080
is because that journey home
is particularly arduous.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.480
And there is no help.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.980
And when you think about you're
to support yourself and live

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:52.396
your life, that
oppression, you're

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:56.650
having to hold it up when you're
building something down here,

00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:59.100
everything gets twisted.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:03.780
So what we're trying to
do is to create a way

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:08.010
to make that journey
back because when

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.890
this stuff happened to create
the world we have right now,

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:13.292
nobody had any idea that
it was going to happen

00:44:13.292 --> 00:44:15.750
and that we were going to need
to have these kind of things

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:17.751
in the future.

00:44:17.751 --> 00:44:20.250
I think people actually thought
they were building something

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.080
better.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.730
Unfortunately, as we know now,
they were a little misguided.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.170
And we're going to
have to redo it.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:33.280
And that's what IronEagleFeather
is already assuming

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:38.790
is that there won't be anybody
there to give us a hand.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:41.880
This is a on-your-own
kind of thing.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.860
Does that makes sense?

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.980
Because it is our culture.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:45.980
I don't mind it.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.980
I'm willing to do double
time, overtime for this.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.720
Anyway, does that kind
of answer your question?

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:57.190
IronEagleFeather exists because
that is particularly hard.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.830
AUDIENCE: That point
you made around the need

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:03.016
to connect and connect
authentically, person

00:45:03.016 --> 00:45:04.390
to person, really
struck a chord.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.022
I was just curious.

00:45:06.022 --> 00:45:07.480
In your own journey,
what would you

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.860
say is one of the most powerful
or meaningful connections

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.990
you've made with someone
that you wouldn't maybe

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:17.110
have otherwise come to know,
or a connection that you've

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:20.140
seen made between two people
that wouldn't have necessarily

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.510
happened without a lot
of intentional effort?

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:27.490
LEVI EAGLEFEATHER: For me, the
best tools, the best ceremony

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:31.790
and rites that I went through
were the sweat lodge and sun

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:32.820
dance.

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.840
They did the most for me.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.350
But actually, the most
gut-wrenching mind-bending,

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:42.170
freeing experience
that I went through

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.070
was when I reunited with my mom.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.880
And I can't--

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:52.000
I mean it, would
take me forever.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.820
And the relationship, it's
not like everybody else has

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.310
a relationship with their mom.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.350
In fact, there was
those years where

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:04.740
we didn't know who we were.

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:09.960
So we didn't develop that
bonding kind of a thing

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.100
beyond the age of
four years old.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:17.640
But when I reconnected to that,
something about the energy.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.200
That's as far as I
can go with that.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.630
I can't really explain it.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.490
But those other
ceremonies and rituals

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:26.520
helped me to deal with that,
helped me to understand.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.350
It helped me to direct
that energy back

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:33.350
into things that were
productive other than my hurt,

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.450
my low self-esteems,
all the things

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:39.850
that I went through while
I was away from my mother.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:43.930
So in a way, just that meeting
her with those other ceremonies

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.600
helped me to bring
me back into balance.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.030
AUDIENCE: I've heard a little
bit about the communication

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:53.880
style between the Western
culture and the Indian culture

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:59.200
and how it's like a 180 flip
of way of thinking about it.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.227
And I just wonder what
your take was on that.

00:47:01.227 --> 00:47:02.560
LEVI EAGLEFEATHER: You're right.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.459
In a lot of
instances, it doesn't

00:47:05.459 --> 00:47:07.000
matter what we're
talking about, when

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.670
Lakota people talk about it
and non-Lakota people hear it,

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.910
oftentimes, they assume
that we mean a lot of things

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:21.030
that we don't with what we say.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:26.510
And the big thing is, as
I told you, in Lakota,

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.880
somehow we get the
idea that there

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.010
are four parts to our energy.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:33.170
And the spiritual
part is a big part

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:36.520
that isn't included out here.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:41.590
And we always speak
with that part in mind.

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:43.400
So the miscommunication
could happen

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.490
from a society that doesn't
involve that in the way

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:49.450
that they speak and
the way that they hear.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:50.870
Does that make sense?

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:52.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's good.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.858
LEVI EAGLEFEATHER:
And this is what

00:47:53.858 --> 00:47:58.660
I'm assuming because I can't
draw any direct correlation

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:01.070
of how that actually unfolds.

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:08.450
I'm more involved in catching
people who are really hurting

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:10.475
or who really need help
and trying to redirect.

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:15.070
I hope you're following me.

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:17.320
Rather than trying to correct
that thing that we think

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.060
differently, I'm
trying to work with it,

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.112
if that makes any sense.

00:48:22.112 --> 00:48:23.460
I thank all of you.

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.610
[APPLAUSE]
