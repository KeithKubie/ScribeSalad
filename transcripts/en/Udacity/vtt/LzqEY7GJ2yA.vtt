00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.730
So, to quickly summarize this lecture, I basically used image smoothing as

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.320
an example to teach you about how we can actually do neighborhood-based.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.700
Ways of actually taking information from the pixel neighborhoods to be able to

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.840
impart smoothing functions or

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.150
filtering functions at a new point in the pixel to create new images.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.870
Use that as a format to kind of introduce a concept of kernel and

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.020
smoothing over an image using a kernel, and, basically,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.630
show how we can do averaging and median filtering.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.910
The intention, of course, was to, to show you how we can actually do

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.570
neighborhood types of processing, beyond simple pixel processing,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.470
to be able to achieve simple filtering approaches on images.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.990
Now, what we will do is I did introduce the concept of cross-correlation.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.280
We will now start looking at cross-correlation and

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.330
another method called convolution.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.260
To help us understand more how we can do simple image processing.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.280
Again, the goal has been for us to look at intuitively, how this all works.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.270
Because as we go towards and try to start doing higher levels of efforts and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.470
computational photography.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.550
These will be the foundational blocks we will be picking up on

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.400
to learn about how we can do image processing and computer vision applications.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.030
Just again want to thank people that I've borrowed information from.
