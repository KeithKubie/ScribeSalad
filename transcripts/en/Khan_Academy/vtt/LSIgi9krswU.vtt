00:00:00.784 --> 00:00:02.200
So what we want
to think about is,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.500
at what x values does our
function here in orange--

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.510
let me make this clear.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.070
This is the graph of
y is equal to f of x.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.440
At what x values, and we
have some choices here,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.530
which of these x values
I should say, does f of x

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.550
hit relative maximum values
or relative minimum values?

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.925
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:24.500
and classify whether we hit
a relative maximum value

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.820
or a relative minimum
value at each of these x's.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.516
So let's first
look at x equals a.

00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:33.550
f of a is right over here.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.820
This is f of a.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.740
And I can pretty easily
construct an open interval

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.580
around a so that f of x, if
x is in this open interval,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.520
is going to be, is definitely
going to be less than

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.010
or equal to f of a. f of x in
that interval is definitely,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.514
they're all lower
values of f of a.

00:00:53.514 --> 00:00:55.930
So this right over here, and
you can even see it visually,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.760
this is kind of the classic
relative maximum value

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.440
that we've gotten to.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.630
Now what about this?

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.130
If this was filled in, if
we were continuous here,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.840
this would be pretty obviously
a relative minimum point.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.380
But this does something
interesting, it jumps up.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.860
And so this right
over here, let's

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.170
see, this is the
value of f of b.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.587
That is f of b right over here.

00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:22.170
This is a little bit
counterintuitive.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.340
But I actually can construct
an open interval around b.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.160
I can actually construct
an open interval

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.530
around b where the value of f
of x, if it's in that interval,

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.820
is a less than or
equal to f of b.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.990
So f of b right over here is
also a relative maximum value.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.159
Now what about c
right over here?

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.200
Well if this was just at
the bottom of a kind of,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.350
if it would look like e, e is
your classic relative minimum

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.850
point.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.090
But c, look at
this discontinuity.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.309
What's going on here?

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:55.850
But we just have to
think about, well

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.800
can we construct an open
interval around c where f of c

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800
is-- this is f of c right
over here-- where f of c

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.810
is less than or equal to
the x's in, is less than

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.210
or equal to f of x for the
x's in that open interval.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.710
Well let's see, in this open
interval the way I've drawn it,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.090
the f of x's are here
and they are over here.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.710
So it looks like
f of x is always

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.420
greater than or equal to f of c.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.260
So that by that definition,
by the definition

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.960
of a relative
minimum point, this

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.640
makes it, or relative
minimum value.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.190
So that actually is a
relative minimum value.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.315
Now we get over here to d.

00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:38.040
And really, by the
same argument that we

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.810
used for b, that is
also at d our function

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.010
takes on another
relative maximum point.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.054
And then e, when
x is equal to e,

00:02:48.054 --> 00:02:49.970
this is the function
hitting what could really

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.040
be considered a classic
relative minimum point.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.780
We can easily
construct an interval

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.940
where you take any x
in that interval, f

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.000
of x is going to be greater
than or equal to f of e.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.650
So this is a relative
minimum value as well.
