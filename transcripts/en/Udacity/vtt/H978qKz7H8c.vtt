00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.560
Oftentimes in research, we're interested
in making a change in the world and

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.030
then measuring the effect
that that change had.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.530
For example,

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.920
we might want to give students a tool
that we believe will help them learn,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.050
and then measure how well that
tool actually helped them learn.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.170
But sometimes we're not ready to
actually make a change in the world yet.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.820
Sometimes we just want to understand
the world a little bit better.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.150
We just want to understand
the nature of reality, and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.980
that can then inform some
tools we design later on.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.610
Survey research is one
way of doing this.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.090
In survey research we're not actually
making a change to our participants.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.159
We're just asking them to report on
their opinions, their perspectives,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.600
their experiences.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.520
And using the results of those surveys,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.420
we then construct an understanding of
whatever population we're investigating.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.960
Survey research can be
very complicated though.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.000
It's very difficult to
design a good survey.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.136
It's difficult to know how to draw
a representative sample out of

00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:47.340
a population of people.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340
You might not even know
what those words mean yet.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.030
So in this lesson we're going
to talk about these things.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.550
We'll talk about designing good surveys,
and making sure that the results you get

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.840
from those surveys are actually valid
and generalizable to that population.
