00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.500
So now that we've done the define stage,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.550
we're moving on to the diverge stage,
right?

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.470
&gt;&gt; The diverge stage is the next one.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.400
The diverge stage is a chance for
everyone to be thinking with their own

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.340
creativity and imagination,
how should this problem be solved?

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.830
&gt;&gt; You said solutions, so
you mean more than one, right?

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
we're starting to think about solutions.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.260
Not just one.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.360
Everybody's thinking
about many solutions.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.340
And then the team as a whole is thinking
about whole list of solutions, and

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.120
that makes the team powerful.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.390
Everyone has time individually
to work on some solutions, and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.840
as they are ready with this, then they
share it with the team, and suddenly,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.670
they're looking a whole dessert tray of
options for what the product could be.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.200
It is so exciting.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.160
One thing that's really exciting about
this stage is how quickly it can happen.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.490
We do an exercise that's familiar
to some people from Gamestorming.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.010
It is called the Crazy 8's.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.120
&gt;&gt; Okay, how does that go?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.230
&gt;&gt; The Crazy 8's?

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.160
You want to know?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.760
Well, here goes.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.090
The Crazy 8's gives everyone
a little piece of paper.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.310
And they ask the team to sketch
eight ideas in five minutes.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.780
Usually, the first reaction that people
have when you ask them to sketch

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.170
eight ideas in five minutes,
is they think you're crazy.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.686
And that's why we call it the Crazy 8's.

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:18.951
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:22.510
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] As soon as they
answer this question,

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.150
they look at the face of the leader,
and when they see that the leader is

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.180
actually serious, then they return to
the writing and they start sketching.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.970
In five minutes, people are able to do
five, six, seven, sometimes eight ideas.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.740
That allows them to warm up their mind,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.900
their creative muscles
are starting to flex.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.730
It's kind of like a warmup for
a workout.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.250
After that, we give the team
another piece of paper and

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.280
another five minutes and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.590
we say from the ideas that you already
have can you give me one big sketch?

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.810
Label it clearly and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.880
explain what are the pieces of
this layout that you're creating.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.940
Some people might be intimidated
by the sketching process.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.060
This is when we remind them that we're
asking them to sketch simple things.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.540
A grid that's based of rectangles,
syntax labels,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.000
some placeholders for
a pictures and icons should be.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.510
With that reminder, most people
are ready to re-imagine themselves

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.400
as the creative child
that they once were.
