1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,860
Oh my God, you guys, I have to
tell you this story. So I'm flying.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,400
So I do an episode of Kroll show. Um,

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,500
and always working with necro.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,900
You're guaranteed you're gonna laugh
your ass off. I'll fucking bet.

5
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,630
Can I kiss the kid's ass any? I
fucking love him. I think he's,

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,370
I think he's a fucking
genius. So anyways, um,

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,390
I go, I go to the airport
and I'm taking the red eye,

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,380
taking this 10 55 flight, nine fucking
stop. Cause that's how I do it.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,440
All right. I'm on a good plane.

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,160
Why would I want to get off it and switch
and roll the dice and get on another

11
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:40,520
one? You know, let's
just fucking get there.

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,060
When I drive up to San Francisco,

13
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:47,970
I don't pull over and fucking Burbank
and then get hit. No another car.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,960
We get it built. All right? So I
get on the fucking plane, right?

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,400
I use my miles, bumped myself up
like a fancy person. You know, maybe,

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,260
maybe I invented the cheesecake factory.

17
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:01,870
People are thinking and then they
see how I'm dressed and I go, oh no,

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,650
he didn't vent the cheesecake factory. Um,

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,790
and I go to go to sit down on my
seat and I go to set my bag down.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,210
I was going to set it
down right in front of me.

21
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:13,620
And the nice fellow sit
next to me. He goes,

22
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:14,910
why don't you stick it in
the middle of this room?

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,890
And he moved his bag out of
the way. I'm like, all right,

24
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:18,390
this guy's a solid dude or whatever.

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,290
And then all of a sudden the waitress
comes by as stewardess, whatever.

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,280
She comes by, a flight attendant, whatever
the fuck you supposed to call them.

27
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:30,510
She comes up and she's, uh, can I get
you jealous with Drake? And I was like,

28
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,740
yeah, can I get out? Let me get a
water please. I sir. No ice. What?

29
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:36,240
However you make it.

30
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,560
Stop acting like it's a fucking
Martini. It's war, right?

31
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:44,310
Just give me a water
with ice. Thank you. Um,

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,940
and the, the guy next to me, he orders
it. Doers. Neat. No ice, no nothing.

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,060
Just put it in there so they
bring our drinks, all right.

34
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,620
And I'm really thirsty.

35
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,800
So I start sucking mine down
and he just throws his back.

36
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,630
Like it's nothing like fucking John Wayne
right before he's going to turn around

37
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,220
and beat up three guys, three
moustachioed guys in the 1930s. Right?

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,740
So, um, I'm just sitting
there and everybody's getting
on the flight, you know,

39
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,070
when I'm looking around at
the passengers, you know,

40
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,370
fucking doing whatever I'm doing and
all of a sudden the guy next to me,

41
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,700
Mr Doers goes to me, uh, he
goes, excuse me? He goes,

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,760
are you afraid to fly? And I
looked at and I was like, what?

43
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,830
He goes, are you afraid
to fly? And I go, no,

44
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,930
no, I'm not. And he goes, he goes, all
right, but you know, it's [inaudible].

45
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:42,830
He goes, it's okay. You know, it's okay
to tell me if you're afraid to fly.

46
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,573
Okay.

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,770
And it's immediately getting weird. And
I'm like, no, I'm not afraid to fly.

48
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,070
And, and I'm thinking in my
head, wait, is he afraid to fly?

49
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,130
And that's why he's drinking
the way he just drank.

50
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,770
And now he's hoping that I'm going
to be afraid to fly. So, you know,

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,070
he just wants to open up. That's what
I'm thinking. And I got, I'm like, yeah,

52
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:09,920
no, I'm not afraid to fly and he
won't leave it alone. He goes,

53
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:13,250
all right, cause you know,
you're, you're, you're fidgeting,

54
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:15,350
you're looking around at other passengers.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,450
And I'm just sitting there looking at
it like, is this guy fucking serious?

56
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,150
And I go, no. I go, I'm not afraid to
fly. So now I'm like, fuck this guy.

57
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:28,450
I'm not talking scaffold rest
of the flight. This guy's
weird man. It's like 30,

58
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:33,430
just get painted pictures like
32 year old wirey in shape,

59
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,020
but like, why are we white dude?

60
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,940
He's got a skully cap on
with fucking glasses. Um,

61
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,560
[inaudible] you know, and uh,

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,390
he goes, uh,

63
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,900
like there's like a minute of silence
and people still getting on the plane and

64
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:53,540
then he goes, hey, sorry
about that. So we, we just,

65
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:57,710
we just got off on the wrong foot. He's
like, my name is so and so. He goes,

66
00:03:57,711 --> 00:04:02,450
what's your name? And then I'm thinking
in my head like, what's my name?

67
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,530
My name is frank.

68
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,340
I wanted to give him like a f by just
some reason I just wanted it's bill.

69
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,680
And he goes, Oh hey bill. And
he goes, nice to meet you.

70
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:14,300
So we shake hands and I'm just looking
at, I don't have any poker face.

71
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,460
I'm looking at the guy like,
what the fuck is your problem?

72
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:19,460
I'm not even trying to not,
I'm not trying to be pleasant.

73
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:23,690
I'm already done with this guy. So then
the guy goes, oh hey bill. He goes,

74
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,300
why are you going to
Indianapolis Bill? Right?

75
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:30,200
Like he's fucking interrogating
me and I, I'm like,

76
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:34,390
is this guy fucking serious? And I
start doing the math in my head going,

77
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,280
when is this guy like an Air Marshall or
something? And I'm like, no, he's not.

78
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:40,610
He's fucking slamming Bose
over here. Fuck this guy.

79
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,730
So I just go, I go, look, I don't, I
don't have to answer your questions.

80
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,140
That's it. And I just looked straight
forward [inaudible] he goes, okay,

81
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:58,460
now I'm concerned. Okay. I am
concerned and I'm looking at,

82
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,650
I'm like concerned about what he
goes, you're fidgeting your, you, you,

83
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:05,540
you have issues with other
passengers and blah blah blah blah.

84
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,310
He's such a Peyton like,
like this. Like he's been,

85
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,290
I don't know what the
fuck like psychologically
breaking me down. All right,

86
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:17,291
so now just by this point they've closed
the fucking the door to the fuselage

87
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,060
and we're starting to taxi

88
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,190
and I just finally looked
at the guy and I go,

89
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,610
I go, you know I came up
with the fight one point.

90
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:34,420
I literally stick my hand out cause he
kept saying I was nervous and I stick my

91
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,850
hand right in front of his
face and I hold it level.

92
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,960
Oh that's what I did the first
time. Yeah. I hold that level. I go,

93
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:43,600
I'm not nervous. Then he goes,
well not anybody can do that.

94
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,540
And that's when I was like, fuck this
guy. I'm not talking to the guy. Sorry.

95
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,590
Fuck this story up. Then Denny Denny
came back, got my name. Now he's going,

96
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:54,400
why are you going to Indianapolis? And
I find, look at them. I say, listen pal,

97
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,730
I'm drinking waters. You're
drinking doers. Okay,

98
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,120
there's no issue over here. And
then he goes, it wasn't doers.

99
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,660
What she gave me wasn't doers really.
What was it? Some sort of spy juice.

100
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,180
You fucking jerk off this point.

101
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:13,040
I want to punch him right through his
fucking stupid wirey glasses, right?

102
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,780
So he's going like, you
look around hostels.

103
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:20,180
And I said something that just ticked
him off. I was like, yeah, dude. I go,

104
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,340
I don't have to answer your
questions. All right, leave me alone.

105
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,910
And then he goes, uh, he goes to
egos. He starts going like, okay,

106
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:29,660
now I am really concerned right now. He
goes, why are you going to Indianapolis?

107
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,250
And I just look at him, you
know, when I start doing,

108
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,270
I start doing like this Ryan
Gosling, you know that little Smirk,

109
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,400
that fucking Mano Lisa Smile. He has his,

110
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:39,700
he smirks his way through all
his fucking movies. I do go,

111
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:41,810
I go full on Ryan Gosling.

112
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,950
Now I'm not talking to this guy and I
just keep looking at him and I gave him

113
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,670
that little half of smirk and I
just shake my head. That's my game.

114
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:52,100
Now that's, this is my gets like,

115
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,850
if you're going to be a Dick Right now
with your fucking delusional authority,

116
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:56,721
right?

117
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:59,440
That you're going to see like we're in
fucking Guantanamo and you're going to

118
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:04,040
waterboard me. Huh? There's no water,
there's no board. Go Fuck Yourself.

119
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,430
Here's my smart and I'm just going to
shake my head at you like you're a fucking

120
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:10,130
pathetic human being. This
is what I'm doing. Alright?

121
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,520
And this is the funny thing. I'm such
a Dick. All I have to say to the guys,

122
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,354
I'm a comedian,

123
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,810
I'm going to do a sold out show there
and that would make them back off,

124
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,620
but I'm a dick. I'm like, fuck this
guy. I want to see where this is going.

125
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,340
So now he's all fucking amped
up and he starts droppingF ,

126
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,910
you know he's saying the
f word. He sitting there
going, if you don't, he goes,

127
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,030

fucking now I'm going to hit that call

128
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,670
button. We're sitting there taxiing
down and fucking getting in line.

129
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,850
I'm going to fucking hit this fucking
button if you blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,090
a fucking retard, right?

133
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,340
So now he sees saying the efforts so
much the way who sitting in front of me

134
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,930
diagonally in front,
right in front of him,

135
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:54,890
turns around and looks at us and
now my heart's racing. I'm like,

136
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:59,390
where's this going? This is going to
be great. I am 100% fucking innocent.

137
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,340
This guy's drunk and I think he's
going to hit that button. Oh,

138
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,800
I've got a feeling he's going to hit that
button. What's going to happen? Right?

139
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,460
I want to see what the pilot looks like.
Let's see where the fuck this is going.

140
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:13,030
Right? So he goes, you don't
fuck you. He starts eating.

141
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,750
He starts bringing his hand
up to the button going,

142
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,180
I'm going to hit that button. You
don't have to go fucking do it.

143
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,030
I'll hit that button and I'm sitting there
smirking and I'm thinking in my head,

144
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:22,490
go ahead and hit the fucking
button. Let's see what happens.

145
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,810
Let's see what happens. Right.

146
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,010
So filing now he wants to hit the button
and he can't fucking find it and it's

147
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,100
an in defense of him. I couldn't find
it either. I was looking up there,

148
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,560
I half wanted to hit it
myself. Then he finally,

149
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:38,240
he finally finds it and he hits
it right? And now I'm just like,

150
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:42,440
Holy Shit, what's going to happen?
And he sitting there going, yeah, Huh,

151
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,080
you want to fucking play this game and
you want to fucking play this game.

152
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,640
And I was surprised.

153
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:50,630
I mean it took like fucking like 30
seconds before a flight attendant,

154
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,830
the one who gave him the booze, which
evidently wasn't booze comes over.

155
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,500
And at this point we're like doing
that shit where we're behind a plane,

156
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,910
we're almost ready to take off,

157
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,650
like we're pulling up and
then stop and pull it up,

158
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:05,430
then stop in as planes take taken off.
So she goes, yeah, what's the problem?

159
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:09,000
Over here. And he goes, ah,
I'm not comfortable to fly
with this guy. This guy,

160
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,000
he's fidgeting, he's looking around at
other fucking people, but blah, blah,

161
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,290
blah, blah. He's doing
all this thing, right.

162
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,740
And then the stewardess looks at me and
I'm just sitting there fucking my little

163
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,090
smart, just shaking my head.

164
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,550
And I just looking at this
dude just shaking my head like,

165
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,880
this guy's out of his fucking
mind. I don't say a word.

166
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,600
And this guy goes on and on and
on about his fucking psychobabble,

167
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,190
about how I'm the security risk.

168
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,160
So she goes to the, so she goes, okay. Um,

169
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,030
any other passengers?
Have you noticed anything?

170
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:41,180
She talked to anybody
first-class at this point.

171
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,710
Does anybody noticed
anything odd about this guy?

172
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,090
And The lady who was sitting right in
front of the dude diagonally from me turns

173
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:56,210
around. She goes, yeah, I've been
listening to this guy brew right,

174
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:57,980
Berating this other passenger.

175
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,750
She's on my side and I haven't
said a fucking word. This is great.

176
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,870
And I'm just sitting there smirking.

177
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,910
Then the let students looks at me
and I shrugged my shoulders like,

178
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,700
I don't know what to tell
you. So finally she said, sir,

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,480
do you have anything to add to
this? And I just said, I look,

180
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,430
I'm just a guy trying to go to
Indianapolis. This guy over here,

181
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:22,580
he starts slamming his doors. I kind
of felt like a rat when I said that.

182
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
He goes, he's slamming his
doors. Next thing you know,

183
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:28,670
he's dropping the F bomb to me. Then
I'm thinking, oh fuck. I just said bomb,

184
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,170
right. Fortunately nothing
happens. So now another fucking,

185
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,860
the male stewardess comes over right
now. He's going like, what's going on?

186
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,530
And the captain of the
fucking now at this point,

187
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:41,690
we pulled over and the plane has stopped.

188
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,860
250 people trying to get to
Indianapolis and jerk off over here.

189
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:51,690
Can't hold his fucking alcohol. Who
just watched a person of interest every,

190
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,040
every, I guess, evidently I have no
fucking idea. Now the plane is stopped.

191
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,440
His fucking jerk off his,

192
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:02,460
stopped the plane interrogating
a Goddamn comedian.

193
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,480
Like I'm in the fucking Taliban and
like he works for the CIA, right?

194
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,140
So now we're just sitting there,

195
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,843
okay.

196
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,300
And the captain is up front in the plane,

197
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,350
like saying to the stewards
is going basically relaying,

198
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:20,240
do I really have to
fucking come back there?

199
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,600
This is the last flight in the night.
Is there really a God damn problem?

200
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,950
And that was the vibe. And they finally
said to the [inaudible], sit next to me,

201
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,960
are you going to be okay to fly with him?

202
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,260
And at that point it appeased his fucking
ego that he was somehow in control.

203
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:40,250
And he goes like, you know what? Okay,
it's fine. It's fine. It'll be fine.

204
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,770
It'll be fun. So they go, okay.

205
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,050
So now the plane's going again and now
we're now we fucking come around and he's

206
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:52,810
sitting there fucking, he's in my
ear. And at this point I am laugh,

207
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,690
like to fucking laugh. You hear me doing
the podcast? That's what I'm doing.

208
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,610
And he's sitting there going, I, he
goes, you don't, I'm glad. I'm glad you,

209
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,260
I hope he fucking do. I hope
you fucking try something.

210
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,130
I'll be fucking try something
when we're up there.

211
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:07,940
I really hope you fucking try something.
And I'm just fucking like God,

212
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,240
Boston laughing. Shake him at like,
what are you gonna fucking do to me?

213
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,170
What are you gonna do to me? How are
you going to punch me in the face?

214
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:19,520
You fucking wirey jacket
with your fucking glasses on.

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,160
You know, that's a federal offense.

216
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,040
You're going to go to jail if you do
that or something. I don't know what.

217
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:29,150
Right. So I'm just in a fucking
laughing at the guy going, I actually,

218
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:33,570
at one point I put my fucking little
eye pillow thing on, you know,

219
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:37,110
like I'm going to sleep. I had
that out too when the store,

220
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,410
this was talking to me, I was like
putting it on is this total mind fuck.

221
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,430
Like I don't know what this guy is. I'm
just trying to go on to Indianapolis.

222
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,980
I'm going to sleep. And um, so I got,

223
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,480
I got my fucking eye thing on right as
he sitting there threatening me, just,

224
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:53,640
I was going with total passive
aggressive. It's like, dude,

225
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:57,900
I'm so not concerned with you. I'm
literally putting a blindfold on. Alright,

226
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,980
so this fucking guy, like
he starts going, he goes,

227
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:06,650
yeah. He goes, you think you fucking
won this, you fucking won this. He goes,

228
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,110
Mike, you know my dad is my dad.

229
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,210
He started saying his dad's
some major CEO in Indianapolis.

230
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,880
Does it sound like a fucking made up
story? I swear to God, this is all true.

231
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,580
He Goes, Mike, my dad is a
major CEO in Indianapolis in La.

232
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,200
Have you fucking arrested? And
The lady turns around again,

233
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,930
how have you fucking arrested
the second weekend on the ground?

234
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm thinking like, for what?
For what? Sitting here,

235
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,140
you fucking lose her. Learn how
to hold your alcohol. Right?

236
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,100
And he starts describing the view that
I'm going to have when I go to jail,

237
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:39,250
like some fucking law and order
episode. Oh, you're gonna love it.

238
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,220
You'll be able to see Lucas oil field
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

239
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:46,420
And I'm just sitting here cracking up
laughing and then there's this pause,

240
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:51,180
right? And I'm thinking finally he finally
shut the fuck up. It's like a three,

241
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,250
four minute pause. He finally just gave
up because I wasn't giving him anything.

242
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:57,940
I was just laughing and shaking my
head. I was being a dick to him.

243
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:01,600
I was cause I was enjoying it and then
there was like a three minute pause and

244
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:06,000
then all of a sudden he just goes, why
are you going to Indianapolis Bill?

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,833
Okay

246
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,770
so we're like 20 minutes into the flight
and am I going to be honest, he was,

247
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:19,270
my adrenaline was so
going during all of that

248
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,810
because I knew I didn't do anything wrong,

249
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:26,590
but I thought we were literally going to
go back and it was going to be fucking

250
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,390
cops there. And they like if, if, if,

251
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,870
if the fucking stewardess or the pilot
asked me who I am and where I'm going,

252
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,460
I'm going to tell him I respect your
authority. You're just some, Gee I don't,

253
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,870
you don't have any fucking authority.
I don't have to answer your questions.

254
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,330
It was pro was one of the most

255
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,950
fun experiences I've ever
had with another human.

256
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,880
Like when somebody thinks that they have
power and you know they don't and all

257
00:14:55,881 --> 00:15:00,881
they can do is try just keep bluffing
and raising their voice and start cursing

258
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:03,500
at you. And if you just
start laughing at them,

259
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,440
the look on their face
is fucking priceless.

260
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,443
So

261
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,340
the last thing he said, he said, why are
you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right.

262
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:17,450
And I fucking started howling.
Just fucking holding my stomach,

263
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,530
shaking my head.

264
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,260
Yeah.

265
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,960
And with my fucking eye
pillow thing on right.

266
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,220
And I know I'm going to get a ton
of shit that I wear one of those,

267
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:31,330
I fucking underrated. Get the one at
Brookstone where it's literally a pillow.

268
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,530
I'm telling you, you could fall asleep
12 noon facing the sun. It's awesome.

269
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,050
So anyways, like after he, he asked me
what, what, you know where you're going,

270
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:43,090
Bill, you like there was like a 10 minute,

271
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,920
like probably 10 minutes had gone by and
I can't fucking sleep because it's so

272
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,190
fun and in me, I can't wait to tell
the story to every comic. I know.

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,490
I can't wait to try it on stage to
see if it's funny or whatever. Uh,

274
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,080
so finally I just like got fuck it.
Maybe I'll just get on my computer and I

275
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,330
bring up my eye pillow and I like,

276
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,480
I got to look at the guy cause I know
he's fucking staring at me waiting for me

277
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:09,240
to do something right. So I lift it up,

278
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,650
I get my fucking Monalisa smiled going
and I look over at the guy and dude,

279
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,570
he is fucking passed out.

280
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,453
Okay.

281
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,210
He looked like he got shot.

282
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,510
He was sitting there like his head was
just hanging straight down and anytime

283
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,500
the plane move like his
head was, I mean he,

284
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,520
the way you got knocked out and for the
rest of the fucking flight all fucking

285
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,580
uh oh what's Matt Damon's
character? Jack Ryan.

286
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,470
Whole fucking Jack Ryan over here
is just, you know the sky marshal,

287
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,040
the fucking Bose bag and God
knows what else he was on.

288
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:51,660
He was just completely out passed out
for the rest of the fucking flight.

289
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,310
And this is why I'm on to Dick. I am,
I was having so much fun with this guy.

290
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:57,780
I start, I can't sleep,

291
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:03,770
so I start slamming waters because I want
to have to get up and take a piss just

292
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:07,860
to see if this guy's going to freak out
because this security risks is getting

293
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:11,940
up. And this, the joke was on me,
he never regained consciousness.

294
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,330
And then I really had to take a
pest, but I'm such a stubborn fuck.

295
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,290
I was holding it because I wanted to
make sure he was awake when I got up,

296
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,740
cause that was going to give him a little
smirk and then I was going to get up

297
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,560
CV at the call button
again. Um, but he didn't,

298
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:31,470
he didn't wake up til we
hit the ground. And um,

299
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,130
and then it's funny. Then he woke
up and it was like four hours later,

300
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:38,190
so now he'd kind of slept off
whatever the fuck this guy was on.

301
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:39,800
Yeah.

302
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,670
And I'm sitting there smart and waiting
for the guy to start talking to me.

303
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,970
He won't look at me and I,

304
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,440
and I think at that point
he kind of fucking realized
that maybe he got a little

305
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,420
, uh, a little extra little too patriotic.

306
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,690
So we stop,

307
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,670
we stopped with the gate and
everything and we're going to get up.

308
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:58,990
So I grabbed my shit.

309
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,980
I get up and I'm just kinda looking
at him and he won't look at me.

310
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,480
And then the lady who was sitting in front
of me had this big smile on her face.

311
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:10,300
She goes, hi. She goes, I don't,
I don't want good. I go that I go,

312
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:13,240
that was an interesting one. And I
said it really loud. So the guy heard,

313
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,370
and he didn't say anything, and t this
is what he did to try to save face.

314
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,860
His pillow was kinda stuck behind,

315
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,440
was kind of stuck behind his
shoulder and like a weird place.

316
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,780
So he was frustrated with it.

317
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:29,440
So he ripped it out from behind him
and kind of threw it down on the floor,

318
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:34,441
went [inaudible] like tried to do some
caveman grunt to try to still have some

319
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:39,030
sort of, I don't know what. So,

320
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,280
so that was my flight to
Indianapolis people. Um,

321
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,660
how far into the fucking
podcast are we? That was a long,

322
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,130
that was a long fucking story.
