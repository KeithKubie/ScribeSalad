00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:04.567
Raman: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you for coming
to this track

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.300
on Android Accessibility.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.534
Let's introduce
ourselves first.

00:00:10.534 --> 00:00:11.834
I'm T.V. Raman.

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:14.567
I lead the Eyes-Free project
which basically does

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:17.200
a lot of the accessibility work
for Android.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.300
This is both
framework level work

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.033
as well as user space
applications

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:22.334
that we dial up.

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:23.834
It's an open source project,

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:25.834
and you can see the URL
to our project

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.033
right on the speaker slide.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.534
With me today I have
my colleague Charles Chen

00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:32.334
and Tim Credo.

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:34.667
And during this conference
you can meet the rest of us

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.133
from the Eyes-Free project.

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.434
Some of us will be
staffing the sandbox.

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:40.767
We have a whole bunch of
exciting stuff to show you

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:42.334
during the next two days.

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.701
So let's kick this off
with the next slide

00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.100
which is the overview
of this talk.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.868
So I'll expl--briefly
at the beginning of this talk

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:55.801
outline what I mean
by accessibility

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.834
and motivate why this is
actually fun to work on

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:00.400
in mobile space.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.467
It's not just about, you know,
oh, there are blind users

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:05.067
who need to use the phone.

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:06.701
Let's do some
accessibility work.

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:08.400
Accessibility on Android
is actually

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.868
an extremely exciting media
to be working on,

00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:13.634
and it's one very easy way

00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:16.801
for you to increase
the reach of your applications

00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:19.968
in terms of users as well as
how much usage you get.

00:01:19.968 --> 00:01:22.667
We'll talk briefly about
what the Android platform

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:26.167
has built-in to make your life
easy as a developer

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:28.367
in terms of making your
applications usable

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:30.467
by the largest number
of users.

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:32.334
We'll then talk about

00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:34.767
applications
that work out of the box

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:36.901
and then talk about
how you can go further

00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:39.434
if you are doing your own
custom fancy UIs

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:41.701
to add a little bit
of UI magic

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.868
that actually then makes
your application

00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:45.501
equally accessible

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.334
to somebody who's not
looking at the screen

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:49.067
or somebody
whose eyes are busy

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.734
and wants to use
spoken output.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:53.067
And then finally be able
to talk about

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:55.601
what I call
going the next mile

00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:58.200
with respect to building
Eyes-Free applications...

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.634
which is really about
moving from the domain

00:02:01.634 --> 00:02:02.868
of accessibility

00:02:02.868 --> 00:02:05.033
as thinking of users
with special needs

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:08.234
to moving to the domain
of usability...

00:02:08.234 --> 00:02:10.834
because really building
an application

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:14.934
that works in a large number
of user situations.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.200
During the keynote,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.534
you heard a bunch of
thoughts about

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:22.834
Google's overall vision
for what Android can do

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:25.167
in the home, in the office,
at work, at play.

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:26.834
And as you sort of
think of those scenarios

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:28.367
you'll begin to realize

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:32.434
that building user interfaces
that are maximally redundant,

00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:34.000
that are truly accessible,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.167
will really make a difference
in terms of

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:39.300
how your users use
and leverage your work.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.501
Let's flip to the first section
of this talk

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:43.167
which is motivation.

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:47.834
So why is doing accessibility,
or the way I look at it,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.634
building innovative
user interfaces

00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:53.634
on mobile platforms
like Android exciting?

00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:56.701
All of you know why Android
is exciting

00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:58.634
in terms of it being
an open platform

00:02:58.634 --> 00:03:00.968
and allowing
a lot of innovation.

00:03:00.968 --> 00:03:04.334
But let's just hold one of
those devices up in our hand

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:06.868
and see what all they enable

00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:10.367
in terms of sensors
that are capable

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:12.167
of sensing the user's
environment

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:14.634
and consequently
the user's attention

00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:16.801
and radius output mechanisms

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:19.734
that are capable of capturing
the user's attention.

00:03:19.734 --> 00:03:22.400
And at the end of the day,
that's what is user interface.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.968
User interface is about
capturing the user's attention,

00:03:25.968 --> 00:03:27.701
performing some computes,

00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:29.501
and capturing
the user's attention

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.267
who can read those results.

00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:33.734
And your Android phones
are amazing

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:35.400
in terms of what
they can do, right?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.133
You have GPS, you have cameras
so your phone can see.

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.133
You have a microphone
so your phone can hear.

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:41.400
It has an accelerometer

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.267
so your phone can sense
where you're going.

00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:44.701
And with the stuff
that you saw

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:47.901
that's coming down the pipe,
the sky is the limit

00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:49.467
because you can basically
connect any access to the app

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:51.234
to the phone.

00:03:51.234 --> 00:03:54.734
So when you do that,
the whole user interface

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.934
sort of starts disappearing
in the background.

00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:58.934
And that's really where
accessibility kicks in

00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:02.734
because now you can actually
do more for the user

00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:04.834
by the user
actually doing less.

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:07.567
User interaction
is an interesting term, right?

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:10.033
When UI is really successful,

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:11.467
you actually
don't spend your time

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:13.100
interacting with your device.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.434
You use your device
for whatever it was meant for.

00:04:15.434 --> 00:04:17.067
And flip to the next slide.

00:04:17.067 --> 00:04:20.100
There is a whole other
half of this

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.467
in terms of why
accessibility is interesting

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:25.400
which is it can really
change people's lives.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.667
Mobile devices--the kinds
of things we want to do

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.701
with Android platform
can change all our lives.

00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:32.567
It's not special to somebody
who cannot see

00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:34.300
or somebody who cannot hear.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.634
Basically, think of home
at automation and Android.

00:04:38.634 --> 00:04:40.734
It completely changes
how you live.

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:43.534
And then ask the question
what does that mean

00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:46.701
to users who are typically
early adopters of technology.

00:04:46.701 --> 00:04:49.367
And if you look at the history,
people with special needs

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:52.167
usually are earlier
adopters of technology

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.934
because something that
you can do without technology,

00:04:54.934 --> 00:04:56.467
a person who has
a special need

00:04:56.467 --> 00:05:00.167
like blindness or deafness
actually can do it, you know,

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.200
with technology,
whereas without technology

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.767
it's a lot harder.

00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:05.267
So in that context, right,

00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:07.334
accessibility
on mobile platforms

00:05:07.334 --> 00:05:08.634
is truly life-changing.

00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:10.167
And we'll show you
some of these things

00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:12.200
that we've built in the last
couple of years.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.334
There's more, obviously,
coming down the pipe.

00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:18.934
So that's really what motivates
me and a lot of our team

00:05:18.934 --> 00:05:20.968
with respect
to doing accessibility.

00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:22.968
And as developers,
as you think about

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:24.367
Android in the home

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:26.501
don't just think
of the blind user.

00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:28.033
Think of your grandparents.

00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:30.534
How are your grandparents
going to use

00:05:30.534 --> 00:05:32.667
these cool things
that we all build?

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:33.868
And guess what.

00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:38.601
If the interface you build
doesn't work for

00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:40.834
a senior citizen
or your grandmother

00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:43.501
because the font you used
was too small,

00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:45.167
they're not going
to stand up and say,

00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:47.133
"I'm blind.
I'm not able to use this."

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:48.934
They're going to say,
"I can see perfectly well.

00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:51.067
It's just the silly font
that I can't see," right?

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:53.968
And so building user interfaces
that work well

00:05:53.968 --> 00:05:55.968
is a huge win
in terms of your search.

00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:58.234
Flip to the next section
of the talk.

00:05:58.234 --> 00:06:01.200
So let's quickly sketch out
what's in the Android framework.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.434
During the keynote,
you saw the Android timeline.

00:06:04.434 --> 00:06:08.200
It's amazing how far we've come
with Android as a platform.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.567
And that's true
about accessibility too.

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:13.601
We started working
on Android accessibility

00:06:13.601 --> 00:06:16.667
sometime in 2008 and, um,

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.901
launched our
Text-to-Speech player

00:06:18.901 --> 00:06:22.334
as part of the platform
at Google I/O two years ago.

00:06:22.334 --> 00:06:26.567
And shortly after,
we built an accessibility API

00:06:26.567 --> 00:06:28.234
right into
the Android framework.

00:06:28.234 --> 00:06:30.067
What goes that give you?

00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:34.000
So the Android framework
basically isolates you

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.767
as a developer
from all the details

00:06:36.767 --> 00:06:38.767
of different types of hardware

00:06:38.767 --> 00:06:41.567
and lets you focus on building
really cool applications.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:45.067
The accessibility API
in the Android framework

00:06:45.067 --> 00:06:47.501
does exactly that from
an accessibility perspective,

00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:49.701
which is where you might
typically think

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:52.000
of accessibility as this
scary, hard problem

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.501
that you have to think about--

00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:55.000
the blind user,
the low vision user,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.467
the user may be using
a special pedal,

00:06:56.467 --> 00:06:58.968
you don't know how
those work, whatever--

00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:00.634
it's actually
very, very easy,

00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:02.000
and that's the reason why

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.734
we put accessibility
into the framework.

00:07:03.734 --> 00:07:05.167
It's there on every phone.

00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:08.868
It's there on every
shipping form since Android 1.6.

00:07:08.868 --> 00:07:10.934
And what the API does for you

00:07:10.934 --> 00:07:14.067
is that if you code
your application

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:17.133
using standard Android
view elements,

00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:21.000
your application will work
pretty much out of the box

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.634
for a blind user.

00:07:22.634 --> 00:07:24.634
You have to do a few things

00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:26.234
to pay a little bit more
attention,

00:07:26.234 --> 00:07:27.968
which is what
this talk is about.

00:07:27.968 --> 00:07:30.367
And as you do that,

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:32.367
you can sort of see
what else we've built

00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:34.467
in the last couple of years.

00:07:34.467 --> 00:07:36.467
The big change last year
in Android

00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:38.100
from an accessibility
perspective

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.734
was pluggable
Text-to-Speech engines

00:07:39.734 --> 00:07:41.634
which, again, is in the spirit

00:07:41.634 --> 00:07:43.801
of the openness
of the Android platform.

00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:45.634
But what that gives you

00:07:45.634 --> 00:07:47.834
is that you called up
an application.

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:50.234
You used the Text-to-Speech
that's on the platform,

00:07:50.234 --> 00:07:52.400
and it sounds okay.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.300
Instead, they've added
[indistinct].

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.367
But your users can then
go to Android Market

00:07:56.367 --> 00:08:00.367
and build--buy better voices
for a few dollars.

00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:02.534
And they buy that voice,
they install it,

00:08:02.534 --> 00:08:03.701
and guess what.

00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:05.467
Suddenly your application
starts sounding

00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:07.300
really, really nice.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.300
And it's win-win
for everybody

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.634
because all the applications
that talk sound better.

00:08:12.634 --> 00:08:14.534
This means people
buy more engines,

00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:16.534
and the more text-to-voices
there are

00:08:16.534 --> 00:08:19.968
obviously there's more incentive
to write talking applications.

00:08:19.968 --> 00:08:21.667
Flip to the next line.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.501
So accessibility,
as I said,

00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:25.901
is built into the platform.

00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:27.200
And as a developer,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.434
you're probably
asking yourself at this point,

00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:30.901
"So what's the hit,"
right?

00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:32.367
Every one of us,

00:08:32.367 --> 00:08:34.734
we are building applications
on mobile devices,

00:08:34.734 --> 00:08:36.767
that's the first thing
we ask--

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:38.634
what's the hit
in terms of performance?

00:08:38.634 --> 00:08:40.167
And the answer is zero.

00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:42.234
The reason the answer is zero

00:08:42.234 --> 00:08:44.133
is because
of how it's designed.

00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:47.434
The way we surface
accessibility and user

00:08:47.434 --> 00:08:49.000
is via the settings menu

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.434
where there is
an accessibility option.

00:08:51.434 --> 00:08:54.667
And even though accessibility
is bundled on every phone,

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:57.267
nothing happens
until you check that.

00:08:57.267 --> 00:08:59.534
So you have a user
who needs that service.

00:08:59.534 --> 00:09:01.200
He checks accessibility,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.067
and he activates one or more

00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:05.133
what we call
accessibility services,

00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:06.634
which we'll talk about.

00:09:06.634 --> 00:09:08.267
So an example of an
accessibility service

00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:10.467
might be TalkBack which is
an open source screen reader

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:11.934
that my team wrote.

00:09:11.934 --> 00:09:15.767
Now, what happens when a user
checks the accessibility option

00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:18.400
and activates
an accessibility service

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.634
is that the platform
then starts raising

00:09:22.634 --> 00:09:24.801
what we call
accessibility events

00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:27.834
as the user interacts
with an application.

00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:29.534
So you're a user now.

00:09:29.534 --> 00:09:32.801
You're moving through the radius
controls in your application.

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:35.567
Magically,
your application starts raising

00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:37.400
accessibility events.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.167
And the payload of that event

00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:41.434
tells the accessibility service
what's going on.

00:09:41.434 --> 00:09:43.868
So then the accessibility
service then stops speaking.

00:09:43.868 --> 00:09:47.200
And because of this,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.133
you actually work very cleanly

00:09:49.133 --> 00:09:51.734
in the Android multiprocess
architecture

00:09:51.734 --> 00:09:54.067
So your application
runs on its own process,

00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:56.868
there is an accessibility
manager that sits between you

00:09:56.868 --> 00:09:59.200
and the accessibility
services that are listening.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.267
Application raises the
appropriate accessibility events

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:05.801
through the platform API,

00:10:05.801 --> 00:10:07.901
goes across
the accessibility manager,

00:10:07.901 --> 00:10:09.300
lands in the accessibility
service

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.167
which then does
the speaking or talking

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:14.267
or vibrating or in the future,
Braille or whatever else.

00:10:14.267 --> 00:10:16.367
So that's sort of
the overall architecture,

00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:18.634
so the main takeaway here

00:10:18.634 --> 00:10:21.200
is that it's zero impact
in terms of performance.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.734
Uh, flip to the next slide.

00:10:22.734 --> 00:10:25.467
As I said,
the way a blind user

00:10:25.467 --> 00:10:28.300
would use your application,
for instance,

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.968
is by sort of
linearly moving

00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:32.968
through the radius controls
in your application.

00:10:32.968 --> 00:10:35.601
The way you move through
the controls in your application

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:38.667
are because Android phones
come in many shapes and sizes,

00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:41.434
with the trackball,
with the keypad,

00:10:41.434 --> 00:10:43.267
with the D-pad,

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:46.501
and increasingly with
swipe gestures on the screen.

00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:49.234
So one of the first things
you need to pay attention to

00:10:49.234 --> 00:10:51.601
is that the traversal order
in your application

00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:52.968
is sort of sensible

00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:56.100
when you're sort of moving
through it linearly.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.834
However you do it, right,
whether you do it

00:10:57.834 --> 00:10:59.868
through the touch-screen
or whatever else,

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:02.234
a user who cannot see
has to sort of

00:11:02.234 --> 00:11:04.868
go through all of your controls
at least once

00:11:04.868 --> 00:11:06.701
in order to get
to where he wants.

00:11:06.701 --> 00:11:07.901
So making that traversal clean

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:09.868
and making sure that
everything

00:11:09.868 --> 00:11:12.534
that needs to be
interacted with is focusable

00:11:12.534 --> 00:11:14.400
is one of the first things
you need to do.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.601
And the other very small
thing you need to do

00:11:16.601 --> 00:11:20.400
is make sure that your controls
are correctly labeled,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.834
especially if you're making up
your own controls.

00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:24.767
With that, let me hand over
to Charles

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:27.067
who can sort of start diving
into more details

00:11:27.067 --> 00:11:29.400
on some of what
I just covered.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.000
Chen: Thank you, Raman.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.033
So I'm going to talk to you
about TalkBack.

00:11:35.033 --> 00:11:37.501
Raman: We're not letting you
off that quickly.

00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:39.801
Chen: Well, we're not
done yet, so...

00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:42.968
Okay so I'm gonna talk
to you about TalkBack.

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:45.067
And TalkBack
is a concrete example

00:11:45.067 --> 00:11:47.000
of an accessibility service.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.467
As the name implies,
TalkBack talks back to the user

00:11:50.467 --> 00:11:53.000
and lets the user know
what's on the screen.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.434
So it's our built-in open source
screen reader for Android.

00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:58.267
It ships standard
as part of Android,

00:11:58.267 --> 00:12:01.067
and it's open source,
so people can learn form it

00:12:01.067 --> 00:12:03.033
and extend it.

00:12:03.033 --> 00:12:05.534
And so TalkBack,
the way it works is,

00:12:05.534 --> 00:12:07.467
as Raman mentioned before,

00:12:07.467 --> 00:12:10.234
a traversal through the controls
is very important

00:12:10.234 --> 00:12:12.100
because there are
no special commands

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.968
that the user
has to learn.

00:12:13.968 --> 00:12:16.701
All users simply just navigate
through the interface

00:12:16.701 --> 00:12:18.067
and use the interface

00:12:18.067 --> 00:12:20.534
just directly by scrolling
through it,

00:12:20.534 --> 00:12:23.467
clicking on things
with the trackball and D-pad.

00:12:23.467 --> 00:12:25.300
And as the user
moves through things

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.534
and generates system events

00:12:26.534 --> 00:12:29.601
such as selecting events,
clicking events,

00:12:29.601 --> 00:12:30.934
so on and so forth,

00:12:30.934 --> 00:12:34.300
these events get raised
at the platform level

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.067
and TalkBack
receives these events,

00:12:37.067 --> 00:12:38.434
processes them,

00:12:38.434 --> 00:12:41.067
and then speaks the answer
to the user.

00:12:41.067 --> 00:12:44.400
So the user knows that, hey,
I now selected this list item

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.334
or now I've clicked this button
and activated something.

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:48.667
or I've checked
this check box.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.501
So it's very easy to use,

00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:52.601
very simple,
very straightforward.

00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:55.400
But it's very important
that the user can get to the
controls

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.300
so that they can navigate
and hear what's going on.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.601
Now, the other thing is
this model is really nice,

00:13:02.601 --> 00:13:04.400
but there are some times
when you don't want to

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.067
just speak whatever
is happening on the screen.

00:13:08.067 --> 00:13:10.701
So a very good case of this

00:13:10.701 --> 00:13:13.801
is how many of you here
have used Voice Search

00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:15.467
in a search with Google?

00:13:15.467 --> 00:13:16.701
Cool.

00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:18.267
That's a lot.

00:13:18.267 --> 00:13:21.634
So as you know,
it's almost magical, right?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.968
You take out the phone
and you speak a query

00:13:23.968 --> 00:13:25.634
and there you have it,
you know.

00:13:25.634 --> 00:13:26.801
Google does a search.

00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:28.033
It recognizes
what you're saying,

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:30.000
and it gives you
the results.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.267
Now, the problem is
if you're running TalkBack

00:13:32.267 --> 00:13:34.167
and if TalkBack
just announced everything,

00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:35.934
you would hear
something like...

00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:37.367
"voice search started"

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:39.467
and then you would be doing
a voice search

00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:40.968
on voice search started,

00:13:40.968 --> 00:13:43.234
which is probably not
what you were aiming to do.

00:13:43.234 --> 00:13:46.000
So instead,
in special cases like this,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.667
we can actually filter
on the package name on the event

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:51.167
and we can say, hey, well, maybe
instead of speaking it

00:13:51.167 --> 00:13:52.734
we should just play
on intercom

00:13:52.734 --> 00:13:54.434
and let the user know
when they can speak

00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:57.701
rather than, you know,
get into a recursive loop

00:13:57.701 --> 00:13:59.534
where we try to
recognize ourselves.

00:13:59.534 --> 00:14:02.334
Raman: And this feature
in the Accessibility API

00:14:02.334 --> 00:14:04.334
where you can filter
by package name

00:14:04.334 --> 00:14:06.734
is actually a very
interesting hook

00:14:06.734 --> 00:14:09.367
for those of you who are
developers in the audience.

00:14:09.367 --> 00:14:12.234
Because let's say
you sort of try

00:14:12.234 --> 00:14:15.901
a very popular application
with TalkBack.

00:14:15.901 --> 00:14:19.534
And you decide, okay, TalkBack
works with that application.

00:14:19.534 --> 00:14:22.334
But I think I could do better

00:14:22.334 --> 00:14:24.901
by making this application
talk really intelligently.

00:14:24.901 --> 00:14:27.467
And you decide to
develop such an application.

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:29.734
So you take
the full application,

00:14:29.734 --> 00:14:32.367
and you develop
a Full Talk application.

00:14:32.367 --> 00:14:37.300
You can actually have full talk
filter events by package name

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.267
or respond to full events

00:14:39.267 --> 00:14:40.934
and then pass the rest on
to whatever other

00:14:40.934 --> 00:14:44.534
accessibility service
the user is using.

00:14:44.534 --> 00:14:46.234
And what you will get is

00:14:46.234 --> 00:14:48.567
a market application
called Full Talk

00:14:48.567 --> 00:14:50.400
that your user can pull down

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.701
and use it with this really
popular application Full

00:14:53.701 --> 00:14:56.601
and get really intelligent
feedback from that application

00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:57.934
and still enjoy the benefits

00:14:57.934 --> 00:15:01.100
of the platform access
that TalkBack provides.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.234
So it's a very,
very useful feature.

00:15:03.234 --> 00:15:06.000
It's something that
I believe we need to

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.067
document better and evangelize
better with developers,

00:15:09.067 --> 00:15:11.334
because I personally
would like to see

00:15:11.334 --> 00:15:12.934
those of you who are developers

00:15:12.934 --> 00:15:14.501
start writing
those type of apps.

00:15:14.501 --> 00:15:16.033
Because they are
really easy to write,

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:18.501
and you can provide
real value out on the platform.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.133
Chen: Absolutely.

00:15:20.133 --> 00:15:23.133
And the other thing
is that we very recently

00:15:23.133 --> 00:15:26.534
added a new feature,
and this new feature is

00:15:26.534 --> 00:15:29.000
support
for a talking keyboard.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.834
So this means that
from now on

00:15:30.834 --> 00:15:32.934
when you use the latest
version of TalkBack,

00:15:32.934 --> 00:15:34.634
if you upgrade for Market,

00:15:34.634 --> 00:15:37.834
you'll get a version
that comes with a soft IME,

00:15:37.834 --> 00:15:39.534
and you can use that IME,

00:15:39.534 --> 00:15:41.501
and it'll actually
speak back to you.

00:15:41.501 --> 00:15:43.601
So you can type
just on a touch-screen.

00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:45.133
In addition to that feature,

00:15:45.133 --> 00:15:47.000
it also comes with
a virtual D-pad,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.801
so for devices which don't
have a physical D-pad,

00:15:49.801 --> 00:15:51.300
you do have a virtual one

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.234
that works
in pretty much the same way.

00:15:53.234 --> 00:15:54.834
And I'll actually
be demonstrating that

00:15:54.834 --> 00:15:56.200
a little bit later.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.000
Finally, we realize that,
you know,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.534
it's very important
to have access

00:15:59.534 --> 00:16:00.968
to all the controls
on the screen,

00:16:00.968 --> 00:16:02.801
whether or not
they're focusable,

00:16:02.801 --> 00:16:04.567
and we are working
towards that.

00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:06.334
But in the meantime,
it is very important

00:16:06.334 --> 00:16:08.400
that you can
traverse and navigate

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.734
through all the controls.

00:16:11.734 --> 00:16:14.801
So I've talked a good amount
about accessibility service,

00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:17.133
a concrete example
in TalkBack.

00:16:17.133 --> 00:16:21.567
I'd like to focus on what
makes a view accessible.

00:16:21.567 --> 00:16:23.167
So as Android developers,
what can you do

00:16:23.167 --> 00:16:25.133
in your applications

00:16:25.133 --> 00:16:28.000
so that all the views
that you present to the user

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
are easily navigable,
easily understandable,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.300
easily usable.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.400
So Raman actually spoke to

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.334
a good amount of this stuff
already

00:16:35.334 --> 00:16:37.601
in his earlier statements about

00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:40.033
how it's very important that
we have focus on everything,

00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:43.400
that you have a, you know,
have a good traversal order

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.400
and also the importance of
labeling all of your controls,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.367
especially things like
image buttons, right?

00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:49.968
Because if you have
an image button

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:51.367
and it's just
this image button,

00:16:51.367 --> 00:16:53.267
well, that doesn't
really tell you too much.

00:16:53.267 --> 00:16:55.834
Five image buttons, right?
Which one does what?

00:16:55.834 --> 00:16:58.934
So it's very important that
you clearly label your controls,

00:16:58.934 --> 00:17:01.601
make sure everything
can traverse well.

00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:04.667
And finally, Raman also
mentioned this a little bit.

00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:06.234
He talked about how you can
extend things

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:09.100
through the accessibility
service.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.801
But you can also extend
the views themselves directly.

00:17:11.801 --> 00:17:13.601
And the way you extend
the views directly

00:17:13.601 --> 00:17:14.868
is to simply override

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.200
the dispatchPopulate
AccessibilityEvent.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.701
So this is the event

00:17:18.701 --> 00:17:22.133
that gathers the accessibility
events from its children.

00:17:22.133 --> 00:17:25.400
It will go through
all of its children nodes,

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.067
asks its children nodes
when it should speak,

00:17:28.067 --> 00:17:29.534
and it combines this.

00:17:29.534 --> 00:17:31.234
So if you're making
a complex widget,

00:17:31.234 --> 00:17:33.968
you can override this method

00:17:33.968 --> 00:17:36.534
and then you can provide
your own way of speaking.

00:17:36.534 --> 00:17:40.734
And I'll go into more detail
on that a little bit later.

00:17:40.734 --> 00:17:44.901
So let's look at how you can
create really accessible UIs.

00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:49.634
So if you came to this talk

00:17:49.634 --> 00:17:52.968
hoping to see how difficult
it was to create something.

00:17:52.968 --> 00:17:54.400
You were expecting, you know,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.868
oh, wow, now I get to solve
a really hard problem.

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:58.767
I'm sorry you're gonna
walk away disappointed,

00:17:58.767 --> 00:18:01.200
because most of the hard work
has already been done for you

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.767
in the framework.

00:18:02.767 --> 00:18:05.067
So if you just stick
to standard views

00:18:05.067 --> 00:18:06.534
that are
part of the Android SDK,

00:18:06.534 --> 00:18:09.667
you'll see that most of
the heavy lifting is done.

00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:11.567
If you use a text view,
if you use a list view,

00:18:11.567 --> 00:18:13.567
things like that,
they just work out of the box.

00:18:13.567 --> 00:18:15.200
And there's really
nothing special

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.801
that you need to do there.

00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:19.734
If you do want to do something
interesting visually,

00:18:19.734 --> 00:18:21.634
such as, you know,
restyling a button

00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:23.367
or restyling your list views,

00:18:23.367 --> 00:18:25.400
those are really just
style attribute changes,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.434
and they won't have any adverse
effects on accessibility.

00:18:29.434 --> 00:18:31.467
The thing to be really
careful about here

00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:33.033
is just to make sure that,
again,

00:18:33.033 --> 00:18:34.767
that you're labeling things
correctly

00:18:34.767 --> 00:18:37.567
and that, you know, especially
things like image buttons

00:18:37.567 --> 00:18:39.100
and other controls.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.567
Raman: And this is the thing
important to carry over

00:18:41.567 --> 00:18:43.200
when you build
your own custom views.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.934
Because one of the things
that Android does

00:18:44.934 --> 00:18:46.901
really cleanly
in the view layer

00:18:46.901 --> 00:18:49.467
is the separation of layout

00:18:49.467 --> 00:18:51.801
from like the logic
of your controls.

00:18:51.801 --> 00:18:54.000
So the radius layout
.XML files

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.934
that you are used to writing

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:57.934
won't help you
quickly move your UI

00:18:57.934 --> 00:18:59.601
among different devices.

00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:02.300
So then you do a custom
control of your own.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.067
Make sure
that you design it

00:19:04.067 --> 00:19:06.834
where all the layout stuff
is abstracted out

00:19:06.834 --> 00:19:08.200
into the command file

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.334
because they will both
help you take your application

00:19:10.334 --> 00:19:12.834
to multiple phone factors

00:19:12.834 --> 00:19:14.934
and also make the accessibility
part really easy.

00:19:14.934 --> 00:19:16.868
Chen: Thanks, Raman.

00:19:16.868 --> 00:19:19.167
So, uh...now...

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:20.968
if you wanna do something
a little bit fancier,

00:19:20.968 --> 00:19:23.100
if you're trying to modify
an existing view

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.767
and perhaps make
a composite view,

00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:30.067
then in such cases
what you can do is...

00:19:30.067 --> 00:19:32.267
again, most of the work
is done for you.

00:19:32.267 --> 00:19:33.901
You may want to do
a little bit of touch-up

00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:37.100
to make the spoken feedback
better and more intelligible.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.934
But generally,
it just works.

00:19:38.934 --> 00:19:41.334
So as I mentioned earlier,

00:19:41.334 --> 00:19:43.567
the Android framework
will go to a view

00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:45.968
and then go
throw off its children.

00:19:45.968 --> 00:19:47.434
So if you just have
a composite view,

00:19:47.434 --> 00:19:49.534
it's just going to take off
its child views

00:19:49.534 --> 00:19:52.834
and then composite the result
and speak it back to the user.

00:19:52.834 --> 00:19:54.801
Now, sometimes that's not
necessarily

00:19:54.801 --> 00:19:56.367
the best speaking order,

00:19:56.367 --> 00:19:57.767
and I have an example
later on

00:19:57.767 --> 00:19:59.901
that shows how you can
correct for that.

00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:01.033
But if you do want to
correct for that

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.901
or enhance
the spoken feedback,

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.467
then what you need to do
is just override

00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:07.133
the dispatchPopulate
AccessibilityEvent

00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:11.367
and reorder things.

00:20:11.367 --> 00:20:13.934
Finally,
in a most extreme case,

00:20:13.934 --> 00:20:16.567
if you wanted to create
your own view from scratch.

00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:19.033
So this is--if you just
took the base view class

00:20:19.033 --> 00:20:21.367
and you said, you know, I'm
going to do everything myself,

00:20:21.367 --> 00:20:23.067
if you go that route,

00:20:23.067 --> 00:20:25.367
that's really the only route
where you have to do

00:20:25.367 --> 00:20:27.000
some serious work
for accessibility.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.100
Because if you go that route,
then you do have to write

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.968
your own dispatchPopulate
AccessibilityEvent

00:20:32.968 --> 00:20:35.801
and figure out
what you need to fill there.

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:38.501
Also in both cases
of composite views

00:20:38.501 --> 00:20:40.467
and, you know,
complete custom views,

00:20:40.467 --> 00:20:42.400
you'd need to make sure
that your traversal order

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.701
still makes sense

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:45.767
and that you don't end up
trapping the user

00:20:45.767 --> 00:20:48.000
inside a control
such that they can't get out

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.567
and get to the rest
of the application.

00:20:51.567 --> 00:20:54.501
So let's look at an example
of how we can make

00:20:54.501 --> 00:20:58.501
a custom view
more accessible.

00:20:58.501 --> 00:20:59.934
So for this example,

00:20:59.934 --> 00:21:02.400
I'm going to use
an actual product that we have.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.567
This product is called
Google Authenticator.

00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:06.834
It's an open source
application.

00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:09.634
It's designed to generate
one-time passwords.

00:21:09.634 --> 00:21:12.200
So this is for
users who are interested

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.834
in doing a two-step
authentication process

00:21:14.834 --> 00:21:17.133
where their first step
they type their password,

00:21:17.133 --> 00:21:18.901
and for a second step,

00:21:18.901 --> 00:21:21.000
there's an application
that they run on their phone.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.334
And they click on "get code."

00:21:22.334 --> 00:21:25.634
It gives them a number,
and they type it in.

00:21:25.634 --> 00:21:28.334
And that's an additional
physical token

00:21:28.334 --> 00:21:31.000
to ensure that the user
is who they say they are.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.834
So we have this open source
application,

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:34.133
Google Authenticator.

00:21:34.133 --> 00:21:35.534
It's on Google code.

00:21:35.534 --> 00:21:37.868
And all of the code
that I'm showing here

00:21:37.868 --> 00:21:40.868
is actually liked
to that code repository,

00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:42.567
so you can look at it
afterwards

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:44.467
if you're interested
in seeing the details.

00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:47.100
What makes this really
interesting

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.701
is that there's a view here
called a UserRowView.

00:21:49.701 --> 00:21:51.067
And this UserRowView

00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:53.400
is a great example
of a composite view.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.067
It's a composite view
that contains the user name,

00:21:56.067 --> 00:21:57.901
the generated passcode,

00:21:57.901 --> 00:22:00.133
and an interactive control,
a button,

00:22:00.133 --> 00:22:04.200
that the user can click on
to generate a new passcode.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.534
So let's look at what
the default behavior is like.

00:22:07.534 --> 00:22:10.634
So I'm actually going to go
to a demo here.

00:22:10.634 --> 00:22:13.467
Let me just get to
the right screen.

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:18.133
It works better
if I plug in the audio.

00:22:22.334 --> 00:22:24.734
Okay. So I am going to show

00:22:24.734 --> 00:22:27.000
two versions of Google
Authenticator.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.334
First I'm going to show
the unoptimized one,

00:22:29.334 --> 00:22:31.300
and then I'll show
the optimized version.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.000
Are we good to go on the demo?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.634
Cool?
Okay.

00:22:36.634 --> 00:22:38.734
So I'm going to start
the unoptimized version first,

00:22:38.734 --> 00:22:40.334
and you'll hear
how it sounds.

00:22:40.334 --> 00:22:42.701
I may bring up
the virtual D-pad

00:22:42.701 --> 00:22:44.868
so I can navigate
through that.

00:22:46.968 --> 00:22:49.734
voice: Navigating.

00:22:49.734 --> 00:22:52.167
Clicked.
Clicked.

00:22:54.567 --> 00:22:56.968
charles@charlesisawesome.net
underscore, underscore

00:22:56.968 --> 00:23:01.868
underscore, underscore,
underscore, underscore get code.

00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:04.934
charles@charlesisawesome.net.

00:23:04.934 --> 00:23:08.901
937,49 get code.

00:23:08.901 --> 00:23:11.200
Launch your
Google Authenticator.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.701
Chen: Okay. So let's go
back to slides.

00:23:13.701 --> 00:23:15.734
So if you look at this,
right,

00:23:15.734 --> 00:23:17.300
that kind of works.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.267
But it was kind of
a clunky experience.

00:23:19.267 --> 00:23:21.033
It wasn't very pleasant,
right?

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:24.200
You ended up hearing
my username first,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.334
which is, you know,
if there's only one user,

00:23:26.334 --> 00:23:28.567
why would you want
to keep hearing that, right?

00:23:28.567 --> 00:23:31.334
And, uh...and then
you hear the number.

00:23:31.334 --> 00:23:34.567
But the number was spoken as
one really, really big number.

00:23:34.567 --> 00:23:37.534
So imagine you were trying
to type this into a form field.

00:23:37.534 --> 00:23:38.968
It's going to be
pretty difficult.

00:23:38.968 --> 00:23:41.501
So can we do something better?

00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:42.801
The answer is yes.

00:23:42.801 --> 00:23:44.934
And the way we do something
better is we override

00:23:44.934 --> 00:23:47.367
the dispatchPopulate
AccessibilityEvent,

00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:50.000
and we do it in such a way
that we take advantage

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.934
of the semantic meaning
behind that control.

00:23:52.934 --> 00:23:56.901
So we present it
in a better way.

00:23:56.901 --> 00:23:58.501
So here's how you can do it.

00:23:58.501 --> 00:23:59.934
So as I said,
what you need to do

00:23:59.934 --> 00:24:02.067
is you need to override
this event,

00:24:02.067 --> 00:24:03.868
and then you reorder things.

00:24:03.868 --> 00:24:06.634
So the most important thing
here is actually the passcode

00:24:06.634 --> 00:24:08.534
that you're trying
to let the user hear.

00:24:08.534 --> 00:24:10.033
So you should
speak that first.

00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:12.667
You should also break it up
so it gets spoken as digits

00:24:12.667 --> 00:24:14.667
instead of asked
one huge number.

00:24:14.667 --> 00:24:17.000
And then in case the user
has multiple user names,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.701
you can put the user name
at the end

00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:20.801
so they hear it
as a confirmation that

00:24:20.801 --> 00:24:24.434
it is for the account that
they think they're listening to.

00:24:24.434 --> 00:24:25.801
So let--

00:24:25.801 --> 00:24:27.901
Raman: In terms of extrapolating
what Charles showed there,

00:24:27.901 --> 00:24:31.167
this is something that I
personally describe as

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:34.000
leveraging the semantics
of your application

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.033
to produce
good spoken feedback.

00:24:36.033 --> 00:24:38.801
So you're taken back into
your own development mode.

00:24:38.801 --> 00:24:41.434
for instance, if you're writing
a shopping application.

00:24:41.434 --> 00:24:43.767
Visibly on the visual screen,

00:24:43.767 --> 00:24:45.801
it might make a lot more
sense for you

00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:48.067
to show the product name,

00:24:48.067 --> 00:24:50.300
some other description of it,

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.701
and then the price
over on the right inside,

00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:55.767
because the eye can quickly
scan to the right inside.

00:24:55.767 --> 00:24:57.167
You'll probably discover

00:24:57.167 --> 00:24:59.300
that if you're doing
a good spoken interface,

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.100
speaking the price
and the product name first

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.734
is probably more important
than a long description

00:25:06.734 --> 00:25:08.734
or, you know, the bunch
of reviews there are for it.

00:25:08.734 --> 00:25:11.434
So this technique
that he showed you

00:25:11.434 --> 00:25:14.033
is going to be applicable
in a lot of places.

00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:16.000
And just because
you need to do that

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.601
doesn't mean
that you have to do

00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:19.501
all of the work needed
for accessibility.

00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:22.901
You just need to populate
that one event correctly,

00:25:22.901 --> 00:25:26.400
and you're good to go
with the rest of the framework.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.734
Chen: Thanks, Raman.
And, in fact, it's so easy

00:25:28.734 --> 00:25:30.434
that we can fit the code
for doing this

00:25:30.434 --> 00:25:31.601
in just one slide.

00:25:31.601 --> 00:25:33.634
And the cool thing about
fitting it in one slide

00:25:33.634 --> 00:25:34.834
is afterwards,

00:25:34.834 --> 00:25:37.234
it's actually
still readable code.

00:25:37.234 --> 00:25:38.801
So let me go to that.

00:25:38.801 --> 00:25:40.534
So first off,
you just start off

00:25:40.534 --> 00:25:43.601
with the standard boiler plate
that you're going to override

00:25:43.601 --> 00:25:46.100
dispatchPopulate
AccessibilityEvent.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.000
Nothing fancy there.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.567
And then here you see that--
well, I'm looking at this,

00:25:50.567 --> 00:25:52.167
I'm looking at the pin text.

00:25:52.167 --> 00:25:54.767
That's the code that gets
spoken to the user.

00:25:54.767 --> 00:25:57.000
And you'll notice I have
a If statement here.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.968
So basically, if the user
has never clicked anything,

00:25:59.968 --> 00:26:02.801
then it's basically
just all those underscores.

00:26:02.801 --> 00:26:05.434
So instead of saying underscore,
underscore, underscore--

00:26:05.434 --> 00:26:07.200
you know, that gets
really annoying, right?

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.534
Instead of saying that,

00:26:08.534 --> 00:26:10.501
we can just directly
tell the user, "Hey,

00:26:10.501 --> 00:26:12.501
click here to get a code."

00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:14.501
And if they've already
gotten a code,

00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:16.868
then we go further
and we split up the number

00:26:16.868 --> 00:26:18.033
into individual digits

00:26:18.033 --> 00:26:19.601
so that when it gets
spoken back,

00:26:19.601 --> 00:26:25.033
it will definitely be
spoken back one digit at a time.

00:26:25.033 --> 00:26:27.033
Also we talked about
reordering things.

00:26:27.033 --> 00:26:29.133
So notice how the digits
came first

00:26:29.133 --> 00:26:31.767
and then at the end,
we're appending the user name

00:26:31.767 --> 00:26:35.033
so that it's a much
smoother entrance.

00:26:35.033 --> 00:26:38.567
And finally, we just package it
into the accessibility event

00:26:38.567 --> 00:26:40.667
and we return it,
and that's it.

00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:42.133
We're done.

00:26:42.133 --> 00:26:44.200
So let's see how much better
it sounds now

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.133
with the optimized version.

00:26:46.133 --> 00:26:49.901
So we're gonna go back
to a demo.

00:26:49.901 --> 00:26:51.601
Ready?

00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:53.033
Okay.

00:26:53.033 --> 00:26:55.033
So I'm going to now start
the optimized version.

00:26:55.033 --> 00:26:56.534
And this is still a version

00:26:56.534 --> 00:26:59.267
that's actually on Android
Market if you download.

00:26:59.267 --> 00:27:00.434
So you hear this.

00:27:00.434 --> 00:27:02.300
voice: Clicked.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.968
Get code
charles@charlesisawesome

00:27:04.968 --> 00:27:09.968
651729
charles@charlesisawesome.net.

00:27:09.968 --> 00:27:11.100
Chen: Okay.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.767
voice: Launch your
Google Authenticator.

00:27:12.767 --> 00:27:14.400
Chen: So let's go back
to slides.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.567
and, in fact, let's go to Raman

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:17.734
to talk about
well written apps

00:27:17.734 --> 00:27:19.634
are accessible
right off the box.

00:27:19.634 --> 00:27:22.200
Raman: Thanks.
So let's talk about applications

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.567
that are accessible
out of the box,

00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:25.267
because we at Google
do the work

00:27:25.267 --> 00:27:27.100
on the framework.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.868
We do the accessibility APS.

00:27:28.868 --> 00:27:30.834
My team even does
some Eyes-free applications.

00:27:30.834 --> 00:27:34.234
But the nice thing is there's
Android Market out there

00:27:34.234 --> 00:27:36.367
that however billions
of dollars that you heard,

00:27:36.367 --> 00:27:38.200
and it's really, really nice

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.400
to be able to go to Market,
grab an application,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.767
and be able to use it.

00:27:42.767 --> 00:27:45.067
So what's involved
in actually doing that

00:27:45.067 --> 00:27:47.133
and how much success
do you have.

00:27:47.133 --> 00:27:49.100
So years ago growing up,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.434
shortwave radio
used to be my hobby.

00:27:51.434 --> 00:27:54.000
And, you know, technology
is interesting, right?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.634
Today shortwave radio
is old-fashioned technology

00:27:56.634 --> 00:27:58.067
that nobody touches.

00:27:58.067 --> 00:27:59.634
We have these nice
smart phones.

00:27:59.634 --> 00:28:00.834
But yet, we all still listen

00:28:00.834 --> 00:28:02.767
to radio stations
from around the world.

00:28:02.767 --> 00:28:05.701
So radio stations
continue to be a hobby.

00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:09.133
So I wanted to show you
one of my favorite applications

00:28:09.133 --> 00:28:11.634
that I just worked out of
the box for the most part,

00:28:11.634 --> 00:28:14.033
and I pulled it from Market
about six months ago.

00:28:14.033 --> 00:28:15.534
It's called TuneIn Radio.

00:28:15.534 --> 00:28:19.434
It allows you to browse radio
stations from around the world

00:28:19.434 --> 00:28:21.934
and play with
with one click.

00:28:21.934 --> 00:28:24.033
The application
as really accessible

00:28:24.033 --> 00:28:26.067
because it was built with,
you know,

00:28:26.067 --> 00:28:28.901
platform-level Android view
hierarchy elements.

00:28:28.901 --> 00:28:31.901
So you could basically use
TalkBack, scroll through it,

00:28:31.901 --> 00:28:33.434
listen to
the radio station names,

00:28:33.434 --> 00:28:36.467
browse by location,
do searches, click, and play.

00:28:36.467 --> 00:28:38.968
And there was one minor
accessibility problem.

00:28:38.968 --> 00:28:40.601
As I prepared this talk,

00:28:40.601 --> 00:28:42.367
I was hoping that
that problem would persist

00:28:42.367 --> 00:28:44.400
so that I could show all of you

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.567
how easy it was
to fix that problem.

00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:48.667
In the process
of preparing the talk,

00:28:48.667 --> 00:28:49.667
I wrote to the developer
and said,

00:28:49.667 --> 00:28:51.100
"Hey, by the way, look,

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.300
you do have this little
problem in your application,"

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.000
and the problem was
that his play/stop button

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.434
was an image button
that didn't have a label.

00:28:58.434 --> 00:29:01.734
Now, I liked the application
so much

00:29:01.734 --> 00:29:04.467
that I basically learned that
that particular image button

00:29:04.467 --> 00:29:06.467
was the play/stop button
and was happily using it.

00:29:06.467 --> 00:29:07.868
But I told the developer,
you know,

00:29:07.868 --> 00:29:09.667
this is going to be
really easy to fix.

00:29:09.667 --> 00:29:11.334
I said, "We going to to talk
about your app.

00:29:11.334 --> 00:29:12.834
Is it okay with you?"
and he said,

00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:14.534
"Oh, yeah, go ahead,
talk about my app.

00:29:14.534 --> 00:29:15.667
I've already fixed it."

00:29:15.667 --> 00:29:17.467
That's how much long
it took him.

00:29:17.467 --> 00:29:20.234
Basically within 24 hours,
the fix was on the Market.

00:29:20.234 --> 00:29:22.467
Um, Charles, quickly,
we want to show them?

00:29:22.467 --> 00:29:24.033
Chen: Yeah, sure.
We'll show the app.

00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:27.200
Raman: So notice that this app
works dearly well

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.133
in multiple modes
of interaction.

00:29:30.133 --> 00:29:31.734
And that's important,
right?

00:29:31.734 --> 00:29:33.601
It would be extremely ironic

00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:35.601
if, in order to listen
to the radio,

00:29:35.601 --> 00:29:37.000
you first had to
sit down in a chair,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.367
hold your phone
in both hands,

00:29:38.367 --> 00:29:39.601
and squint at the label.

00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:41.133
That'd be stupid, right?

00:29:41.133 --> 00:29:43.434
This goes back to
make your application

00:29:43.434 --> 00:29:45.701
such that it's usable
in all the context

00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:48.234
that your user wants to be able
to use it in--

00:29:48.234 --> 00:29:50.000
jogging, running,
driving a car.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.968
Cooking lunch.
Whatever, right?

00:29:51.968 --> 00:29:54.834
So just take a look at how easy
this application is to use.

00:29:54.834 --> 00:29:58.200
Chen: Okay. So I'm going to
scroll for some categories here.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.434
voice: Music.

00:30:01.434 --> 00:30:04.167
Local radio.

00:30:04.167 --> 00:30:06.901
Search image button.

00:30:06.901 --> 00:30:08.534
Browse.

00:30:08.534 --> 00:30:13.033
88.5 KQED-FM.

00:30:13.033 --> 00:30:14.367
Public forum.

00:30:14.367 --> 00:30:16.634
KQED.

00:30:16.634 --> 00:30:17.868
Raman: So your local NPR station

00:30:17.868 --> 00:30:21.300
is probably faster
to launch with this

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.834
than with your
physical radio,

00:30:22.834 --> 00:30:25.067
which is how it should be,
right?

00:30:25.067 --> 00:30:27.467
In general, if you actually
do the numbers,

00:30:27.467 --> 00:30:28.968
you will find that

00:30:28.968 --> 00:30:31.834
if it takes your user
a minute to do something,

00:30:31.834 --> 00:30:34.801
he's going to do it
a certain number of times a day.

00:30:34.801 --> 00:30:37.467
But if it takes him ten seconds
to do that same thing,

00:30:37.467 --> 00:30:40.868
the number of days--times
that he will use it in a day

00:30:40.868 --> 00:30:43.033
will go up
an order of magnitude.

00:30:43.033 --> 00:30:44.467
We all wear wristwatches--

00:30:44.467 --> 00:30:47.200
well, at least my generation
of people wear wrist watches.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.734
Charles doesn't wear
a wrist watch.

00:30:48.734 --> 00:30:50.000
But see how easy it is

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.601
to look at the time
on your watch, right?

00:30:51.601 --> 00:30:53.901
And that's how easy
you want tasks to be,

00:30:53.901 --> 00:30:56.400
because when they are
that easy,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.634
you do them
a lot more often.

00:30:58.634 --> 00:31:00.367
Flip to the next
line of of the talk.

00:31:00.367 --> 00:31:02.033
So you want to pick up this,
by chance?

00:31:02.033 --> 00:31:03.868
Chen: Sure. So can we
go back to slides?

00:31:03.868 --> 00:31:06.501
Thanks.
So I want to talk quickly

00:31:06.501 --> 00:31:09.601
about how you can test
for accessibility

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:11.067
to make sure that your apps

00:31:11.067 --> 00:31:14.300
are actually
gonna work well.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.067
And the nice thing is that

00:31:16.067 --> 00:31:17.767
on Android,
it's extremely easy

00:31:17.767 --> 00:31:19.434
to simply test by doing.

00:31:19.434 --> 00:31:21.100
So what do I mean by that?

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.133
Well, you don't need to buy
some fancy screen reader

00:31:24.133 --> 00:31:25.667
or spend lots of money

00:31:25.667 --> 00:31:27.968
because Android comes with
a screen reader built in.

00:31:27.968 --> 00:31:30.601
So all you really need to do
to test it for yourself

00:31:30.601 --> 00:31:33.968
to experience
what your app would be like

00:31:33.968 --> 00:31:36.234
for a user
that's on a screen reader

00:31:36.234 --> 00:31:38.701
is to go into settings
and turn on TalkBack.

00:31:38.701 --> 00:31:40.601
It's really easy to do.

00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:42.234
I can even do it right now.

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:44.000
Why don't we actually
just do that?

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.400
So can we switch to demo?

00:31:49.767 --> 00:31:52.300
So all you really need to do
is on your home screen

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.934
if you simply go into
settings...

00:31:56.934 --> 00:31:59.667
man: Demo's up?
Chen: Yeah. Demo's up.

00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:02.000
And you go into...
voice: Settings.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.167
Chen: You go into
accessibility,

00:32:04.167 --> 00:32:05.667
and you just need
to make sure

00:32:05.667 --> 00:32:07.801
that accessibility checkbox
is checked.

00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:09.501
voice: Accessibility settings.

00:32:09.501 --> 00:32:11.267
Chen: And the TalkBack
is checked.

00:32:11.267 --> 00:32:12.901
And once those are checked,
then voila--

00:32:12.901 --> 00:32:14.601
accessibility
is up and running.

00:32:14.601 --> 00:32:16.000
That's just how easy
it is.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.801
Raman: And you heard
a number of things today

00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:20.434
during the keynote
about how Cloud really makes

00:32:20.434 --> 00:32:22.367
for a lot of interesting
experiences

00:32:22.367 --> 00:32:25.100
when you get in your device
because you sign in,

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.968
and all your goodness
comes through.

00:32:26.968 --> 00:32:29.133
Accessibility
is part of that story.

00:32:29.133 --> 00:32:32.300
So for instance,
if I grab a new device

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.033
and sign in,
it actually starts talking to me

00:32:35.033 --> 00:32:38.033
because the cloud knows
that my device has talked to me.

00:32:38.033 --> 00:32:40.100
The moment that accessibility
option gets checked,

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.501
everything talks
and by default

00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:45.334
we can actually turn
that on from the cloud.

00:32:45.334 --> 00:32:47.434
Let's go to the next
section of the talk

00:32:47.434 --> 00:32:50.834
where I'd like to talk
briefly about...

00:32:50.834 --> 00:32:53.133
sort of moving over
from the domain

00:32:53.133 --> 00:32:54.701
of accessibility
and special needs

00:32:54.701 --> 00:32:57.567
over into the domain
of user usability

00:32:57.567 --> 00:32:58.934
which really starts touching

00:32:58.934 --> 00:33:01.300
a very large proportion
of your users.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.834
It touches both your users
with special needs

00:33:03.834 --> 00:33:07.634
and also realizes
that all of us are special

00:33:07.634 --> 00:33:09.067
at some time or the other.

00:33:09.067 --> 00:33:10.868
There are many times
of the day

00:33:10.868 --> 00:33:14.200
when your average user
is functionally blind.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.067
There are many times
of the day

00:33:16.067 --> 00:33:18.834
walking through a noisy
airport hallway

00:33:18.834 --> 00:33:21.767
or, you know, walking through,
you know, a crowded hallway

00:33:21.767 --> 00:33:23.367
in Moscone Center
after the keynote

00:33:23.367 --> 00:33:26.100
where your user
is functionally deaf, right?

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.167
So there are these environments

00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:30.968
where you really want to start
building your application

00:33:30.968 --> 00:33:32.200
to leverage
that environment.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.501
So let's talk briefly
about that.

00:33:34.501 --> 00:33:36.634
So there are three
sort of things

00:33:36.634 --> 00:33:39.868
that I personally like to
point developers at

00:33:39.868 --> 00:33:44.334
in terms of what it means
to build mobile applications

00:33:44.334 --> 00:33:48.200
that are truly usable
in a large variety of scenarios.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.834
The first is leveraging
the fact

00:33:51.834 --> 00:33:54.634
that these devices have
so many sensors and actuators.

00:33:54.634 --> 00:33:56.167
It's something I alluded to

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:58.334
right at the opening
of the talk.

00:33:58.334 --> 00:34:02.000
So basically, the more
that the device knows about

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.834
the current context,
the less you as the user

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:07.934
have to tell it in order
to complete the task

00:34:07.934 --> 00:34:10.167
that you're trying to complete.

00:34:10.167 --> 00:34:12.000
At the end of the day,
that's user interface.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.400
User interface isn't about
clicking fancy colored buttons

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.300
or, you know, making things
go boink, right?

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.634
It's about rapid task
completion.

00:34:21.634 --> 00:34:24.467
And rapid task completion
is really the next bit,

00:34:24.467 --> 00:34:25.968
which is, as I said,

00:34:25.968 --> 00:34:28.234
minimize user interaction
by leveraging the fact

00:34:28.234 --> 00:34:30.300
that the device knows
a lot about you.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.667
These things are called smart
phones for a reason, right?

00:34:32.667 --> 00:34:34.267
It's not just a marketing term.

00:34:34.267 --> 00:34:37.868
There are two reasons why
your device is a smart phone.

00:34:37.868 --> 00:34:40.501
It's smart in the sense

00:34:40.501 --> 00:34:42.501
not because it has
a gigahertz processor.

00:34:42.501 --> 00:34:44.734
It's really smart because

00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:48.000
"A", it has a large number
of sensors and actuators

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.300
for sensing and interacting
with the physical world.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.367
And it's connected
to the cloud.

00:34:53.367 --> 00:34:56.067
However fast your phone's
processor gets,

00:34:56.067 --> 00:34:57.767
the cloud is bigger,
right?

00:34:57.767 --> 00:34:59.968
The cloud,
in terms of intelligence,

00:34:59.968 --> 00:35:01.934
in terms of your
user context,

00:35:01.934 --> 00:35:03.968
in terms of what you did last
on your browser,

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:05.567
what you did last
on your tablet,

00:35:05.567 --> 00:35:06.834
that context is huge.

00:35:06.834 --> 00:35:08.834
And as you leverage it,

00:35:08.834 --> 00:35:11.200
you basically get
the user interfaces

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.734
that disappear
into the background

00:35:12.734 --> 00:35:14.200
and let you complete
your task. 

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.467
And that's the best thing
you can do for accessibility.

00:35:17.467 --> 00:35:19.133
And finally
voice recognition, right?

00:35:19.133 --> 00:35:21.267
Speech recognition
is sort of a technology

00:35:21.267 --> 00:35:24.300
that my friends in the
technology world say is coming.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.467
It's come.
In fact, it's arrived,

00:35:26.467 --> 00:35:29.200
and it's arrived so ubiquitously
on Android

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.968
that you don't even
think about it anymore.

00:35:30.968 --> 00:35:33.033
Three to four years ago,

00:35:33.033 --> 00:35:34.868
writing
a speech application

00:35:34.868 --> 00:35:37.033
required you to be
a real rocket scientist,

00:35:37.033 --> 00:35:38.667
and I kid you not.

00:35:38.667 --> 00:35:41.167
When I was working in speech
research many years ago,

00:35:41.167 --> 00:35:43.467
most of the people
who worked in speech research

00:35:43.467 --> 00:35:46.667
eventually became rocket
scientists on Wall Street.

00:35:46.667 --> 00:35:48.934
because it was sort of
the same mathematical techniques

00:35:48.934 --> 00:35:50.567
that was used
in both places.

00:35:50.567 --> 00:35:53.033
Today you don't need to be
a rocket scientist

00:35:53.033 --> 00:35:55.033
to write a voice recognition-
based application

00:35:55.033 --> 00:35:57.834
because on Android,
it's one API call away.

00:35:57.834 --> 00:35:59.367
Recognition happens
in the cloud,

00:35:59.367 --> 00:36:01.501
and your application
just gets intelligent.

00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:05.701
Uh, pick up the next slide.
Chen: Sure.

00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:10.167
So how can you obtain feedback
in eyes-busy environments?

00:36:10.167 --> 00:36:13.701
Well, you can leverage
built-in Text-to-Speech APIs

00:36:13.701 --> 00:36:15.334
to generate speech.

00:36:15.334 --> 00:36:18.334
So for example,
if you're jogging

00:36:18.334 --> 00:36:21.234
and you wanna, you know,
fiddle with your music player

00:36:21.234 --> 00:36:23.634
and change tracks,
do you want to stop jogging,

00:36:23.634 --> 00:36:26.067
you know, do this
and try to shade it

00:36:26.067 --> 00:36:27.634
and see what track
is playing?

00:36:27.634 --> 00:36:30.067
No. You wanna be able to keep
on going with your workout

00:36:30.067 --> 00:36:31.534
and just keep jogging, right?

00:36:31.534 --> 00:36:33.868
So here's where you can use
the touch screen

00:36:33.868 --> 00:36:35.200
and you can use spoken feedback

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.734
to tell you what
the next track is.

00:36:36.734 --> 00:36:39.033
And you can just stroke it,
and it should play, right?

00:36:39.033 --> 00:36:42.567
We actually have--
I was talking about that...

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:43.934
RockLock.

00:36:43.934 --> 00:36:46.234
That's another open source
application we have.

00:36:46.234 --> 00:36:47.934
Great for accessibility.

00:36:47.934 --> 00:36:49.868
But actually,
it's great for everyone.

00:36:49.868 --> 00:36:51.534
So when you have Eyes-Busy
interface,

00:36:51.534 --> 00:36:54.400
that's...
that's a good time to use it.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.501
The other thing is,
of course,

00:36:56.501 --> 00:36:58.501
you can use haptic feedback.

00:36:58.501 --> 00:37:00.801
So going back to RockLock
example, right,

00:37:00.801 --> 00:37:03.234
as you switch tracks,
you get a little vibration,

00:37:03.234 --> 00:37:06.133
a little buzz that lets you know
that, hey, something happened.

00:37:06.133 --> 00:37:08.100
So that, in addition
to an auditory cue

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.100
and the fact that music
has switched,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.067
that really sort of hammers
the point home.

00:37:13.067 --> 00:37:14.868
It almost feels like
you're using

00:37:14.868 --> 00:37:17.000
a physical--
physical buttons

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.334
to drive the player.

00:37:21.334 --> 00:37:23.801
So what can we do to minimize
the interactions

00:37:23.801 --> 00:37:26.234
needed to perform a task?

00:37:26.234 --> 00:37:29.634
Raman was touching on several
of these points earlier.

00:37:29.634 --> 00:37:32.501
Well, Android devices
have many eyes and ears.

00:37:32.501 --> 00:37:35.434
It's able to sense things,
it knows where you are,

00:37:35.434 --> 00:37:38.133
and it's got many ways
of catching your attention.

00:37:38.133 --> 00:37:41.934
So for example, you know,
it can flash the screen at you.

00:37:41.934 --> 00:37:44.601
It's got the LEDs.
It's got haptic feedback.

00:37:44.601 --> 00:37:48.000
It can speak to you.
It goes on and on and on, right?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.501
Raman: And with Android
at home,

00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:51.033
it can turn off the lights
in your rooms

00:37:51.033 --> 00:37:52.634
and put you to sleep.
Chen: Exactly.

00:37:52.634 --> 00:37:54.400
Or turn up the lights
and wake you up.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.601
With really loud music.

00:37:56.601 --> 00:37:59.133
So user interaction
is really about

00:37:59.133 --> 00:38:01.567
communicating
the user's intent to the device

00:38:01.567 --> 00:38:04.734
and obtaining feedback
from the device.

00:38:04.734 --> 00:38:07.501
And so I encourage
everyone here

00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:09.767
to think about how you can
best leverage these

00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:12.000
to minimize explicit
user interaction

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.434
and just make things work
for the user.

00:38:15.434 --> 00:38:19.868
Raman: So We'd like to bring
another colleague up here

00:38:19.868 --> 00:38:21.534
for a couple of demos

00:38:21.534 --> 00:38:24.367
for Intersection Explorer
and walkie-talkie.

00:38:24.367 --> 00:38:27.133
As Tim comes up--
Chen: So--so Raman,

00:38:27.133 --> 00:38:29.534
why don't you talk a little bit
more about these applications

00:38:29.534 --> 00:38:31.400
as we resolve
the network issues.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.033
Raman: So while we set the phone
up on the network...

00:38:34.033 --> 00:38:36.300
so Internet Explorer
and walkie-talkie

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.300
are two applications
built on top of Google Maps.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.734
And these were built for
a very concrete use case.

00:38:43.734 --> 00:38:45.767
About two years ago,

00:38:45.767 --> 00:38:48.701
I got dropped off by
the Google shuttle,

00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:50.534
and it was a new driver.

00:38:50.534 --> 00:38:53.033
So he got it exactly right
except that he dropped me

00:38:53.033 --> 00:38:55.701
on the opposite side
of a very small street.

00:38:55.701 --> 00:38:58.200
And I did not have
walkie-talkie at the time.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.267
I did not have Internet Explorer
at the time.

00:39:00.267 --> 00:39:02.767
I knew my home neighborhood,
and I still walked

00:39:02.767 --> 00:39:04.667
in the opposite direction
from home

00:39:04.667 --> 00:39:06.167
and actually spent
about half an hour

00:39:06.167 --> 00:39:08.367
wandering around,
trying to get back home.

00:39:08.367 --> 00:39:10.801
And so we came back
and started building

00:39:10.801 --> 00:39:14.868
a couple of applications
with, at the time, the G1.

00:39:14.868 --> 00:39:19.801
We ultimately built a simple
diverse geocorder at the time

00:39:19.801 --> 00:39:22.334
that would actually
tell you where you were.

00:39:22.334 --> 00:39:23.868
And then about a year ago,

00:39:23.868 --> 00:39:25.868
Google Maps
launched walking directions.

00:39:25.868 --> 00:39:27.601
Walking directions
are really nice,

00:39:27.601 --> 00:39:30.200
and it actually works
out of the box

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.667
with Google Maps
and TalkBack.

00:39:32.667 --> 00:39:37.133
But now here is the bit
about building a user interface

00:39:37.133 --> 00:39:39.234
that minimizes
user interaction.

00:39:39.234 --> 00:39:42.801
The default maps interface
actually has the flexibility

00:39:42.801 --> 00:39:44.334
of picking either
driving directions

00:39:44.334 --> 00:39:46.067
or walking directions.

00:39:46.067 --> 00:39:49.834
That's only one gesture
that I did not want to do.

00:39:49.834 --> 00:39:53.467
We also said...
for the blind user,

00:39:53.467 --> 00:39:56.234
not only do you want to speak
walking directions,

00:39:56.234 --> 00:39:59.234
but you actually want to say
what you're passing.

00:39:59.234 --> 00:40:01.200
You ready?
Chen: Yeah. So I'll use Tim's

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.234
because he has FreeG...
Raman: All right.

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.367
Coming up.

00:40:04.367 --> 00:40:06.501
So Tim will take over
from here

00:40:06.501 --> 00:40:08.534
and sort of talk you
through this as he demos it.

00:40:08.534 --> 00:40:11.434
But it's a very, very
useful application.

00:40:11.434 --> 00:40:14.601
It's one of the--
Chen: Whoo-hoo.

00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:16.400
Whoo-hoo.
Wifi.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.534
Raman: Wifi.
So that's great.

00:40:18.534 --> 00:40:20.234
So demo...

00:40:20.234 --> 00:40:21.501
Chen: Yeah.
It's up and running.

00:40:21.501 --> 00:40:23.100
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.467
Credo: Um...
so Raman has been saying

00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:30.601
these smart phones have so much,
so many sensors in them,

00:40:30.601 --> 00:40:32.100
so in a way, it's a...

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.501
when you're really designing
something for accessibility,

00:40:34.501 --> 00:40:36.000
you can actually go
a bit beyond

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.167
what's in the system level
and take advantage

00:40:38.167 --> 00:40:40.167
of all these different modes
of interaction.

00:40:40.167 --> 00:40:42.734
So this, as Raman was saying,
Intersection Explorer

00:40:42.734 --> 00:40:46.868
is a map-type experience
for someone who's blind.

00:40:46.868 --> 00:40:51.868
And it uses sort of
a virtual D-pad...

00:40:51.868 --> 00:40:53.501
gesture interaction.

00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:58.834
And...

00:40:58.834 --> 00:41:00.033
Charles...

00:41:00.033 --> 00:41:01.868
Chen: Oh. I think we need
to make sure

00:41:01.868 --> 00:41:03.734
this is plugged in tightly.

00:41:07.801 --> 00:41:09.200
Oh, can we--

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.434
[overlapping chatter]

00:41:11.434 --> 00:41:16.100
Chen: Could you please make sure
the audio is on?

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.868
It is? Okay.

00:41:17.868 --> 00:41:19.534
voice: Northeast along
Howard.

00:41:19.534 --> 00:41:23.367
Move 49 meters to left
onto New Montgomery St.

00:41:23.367 --> 00:41:26.067
from Howard.
Northwest along New Montgom--

00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:28.734
North.
Northwest along Howard Street.

00:41:28.734 --> 00:41:31.701
East. Southwest
along Howard Street.

00:41:31.701 --> 00:41:35.400
Move 49 meters
to left onto Hawthorne

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.968
from Howard Street.

00:41:36.968 --> 00:41:39.067
Credo: So you can see
as I'm using this,

00:41:39.067 --> 00:41:40.901
I'm controlling it
via adjusters,

00:41:40.901 --> 00:41:42.968
and these are adjusters that are
gonna be independent

00:41:42.968 --> 00:41:44.534
of wherever I start
on the screens

00:41:44.534 --> 00:41:46.100
so if you can't actually
see the screen,

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.033
it's still just as easy to...
voice: Southwest along Howard

00:41:48.033 --> 00:41:50.767
south--
Credo: to navigate here.

00:41:50.767 --> 00:41:55.300
And the feedback is...
[indistinct]

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.200
and so in particular,

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.667
we're paying a lot
of attention here

00:41:58.667 --> 00:42:01.267
to how we're speaking
each intersection

00:42:01.267 --> 00:42:03.734
so that you get some cues
that make sense to you

00:42:03.734 --> 00:42:07.234
about where you've
explored to...

00:42:07.234 --> 00:42:09.300
voice: Northeast along
Folsom street.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.133
East. Southwest along
Hawthorne Street.

00:42:12.133 --> 00:42:14.234
East. Northeast along--

00:42:14.234 --> 00:42:16.601
moved 136 meters

00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:19.667
to second--Saint crossesFolsom
Folsome street.

00:42:19.667 --> 00:42:22.801
Raman: So this year it's hard
for you to experience

00:42:22.801 --> 00:42:24.501
the haptic feedback
it's providing.

00:42:24.501 --> 00:42:26.200
Next year, we'll make
the chairs vibrate.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.067
But in the meantime,
you can believe me

00:42:28.067 --> 00:42:30.200
when I say that as he moves
his finger over there,

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.000
you can actually feel
each street.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.234
Chen: Or if you can't wait
until next year,

00:42:34.234 --> 00:42:35.467
go catch us
in a sand booth.

00:42:35.467 --> 00:42:37.634
We'd be happy to let you
try it in person.

00:42:37.634 --> 00:42:40.601
Or even better, just dial it
on your phones, right?

00:42:40.601 --> 00:42:42.934
Raman: It works on
many device, so...

00:42:42.934 --> 00:42:45.267
Chen: So let's switch
to the conclusion slide.

00:42:45.267 --> 00:42:47.133
Raman: Right. So conclu--

00:42:47.133 --> 00:42:49.167
to sort of wind up, right?

00:42:49.167 --> 00:42:53.000
A simple takeaway
from this talk

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.434
is that just as
five years ago

00:42:57.434 --> 00:43:00.100
if you had to build
a mobile application

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.367
that ran on a 100 million
devices,

00:43:02.367 --> 00:43:04.534
it was a huge,
hairy task.

00:43:04.534 --> 00:43:06.734
What Android has done
as a framework

00:43:06.734 --> 00:43:08.400
is made that trivial.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.300
Where a high school student
today can be thinking

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:14.033
he'll learn Java, pick up
the tool they're speaking,

00:43:14.033 --> 00:43:15.701
write an application
and get it running

00:43:15.701 --> 00:43:17.734
on 100 million devices.

00:43:17.734 --> 00:43:20.767
Similarly, accessibility
traditionally has been

00:43:20.767 --> 00:43:23.467
a huge hairy, scary
bugaboo thing for developers

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:27.400
where there is a lot of
awareness among developers today

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.000
thanks to things like the
Americans with Disabilities Act

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.467
and the various regulation
around disability,

00:43:32.467 --> 00:43:35.801
so people are aware that
accessibility is important.

00:43:35.801 --> 00:43:37.968
But it's always been
a scary thing.

00:43:37.968 --> 00:43:41.033
A simple takeaway for you
from this talk

00:43:41.033 --> 00:43:44.267
is that accessibility
on Android is not scary.

00:43:44.267 --> 00:43:46.234
It doesn't require
an expert.

00:43:46.234 --> 00:43:50.300
It only requires you
to use the bits in the framework

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.601
that are already there
and test for it.

00:43:52.601 --> 00:43:55.167
And finally,
focus on usability.

00:43:55.167 --> 00:43:59.000
And focusing on usability,
every one of us,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.133
when we sort of sit down
at a keyboard

00:44:01.133 --> 00:44:03.133
and develop these applications,

00:44:03.133 --> 00:44:05.334
there is one thing
and one thing alone

00:44:05.334 --> 00:44:06.868
that drives us.

00:44:06.868 --> 00:44:12.033
What drives us is getting
a lot of users out there

00:44:12.033 --> 00:44:15.734
to benefit from the insights
we have,

00:44:15.734 --> 00:44:17.601
from the flashes
of intuition we have,

00:44:17.601 --> 00:44:19.501
from the creativity we have,
right?

00:44:19.501 --> 00:44:21.133
As software engineers,
we--

00:44:21.133 --> 00:44:24.167
just as a painter picks up
an easel and a bunch of oils

00:44:24.167 --> 00:44:26.033
and creates something beautiful,

00:44:26.033 --> 00:44:28.367
software engineering is
as much an engineering science

00:44:28.367 --> 00:44:29.734
as it's an art.

00:44:29.734 --> 00:44:31.868
when we are building something,
we are creative.

00:44:31.868 --> 00:44:35.601
And the most satisfaction
you get from the creativity

00:44:35.601 --> 00:44:37.000
is by getting your apps
to be used by

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.601
as large a number
of users as possible.

00:44:41.601 --> 00:44:44.334
So from an accessibility
perspective,

00:44:44.334 --> 00:44:46.534
when you sit down
to write your application,

00:44:46.534 --> 00:44:49.801
think of the widest number
of use case scenarios.

00:44:49.801 --> 00:44:51.767
Don't limit your user base

00:44:51.767 --> 00:44:54.701
to somebody who's got
20/20 vision,

00:44:54.701 --> 00:44:56.467
can touch the screen,
can, you know,

00:44:56.467 --> 00:44:58.367
speak and move,
can do everything

00:44:58.367 --> 00:45:00.601
and is sitting on a chair
looking at the screen.

00:45:00.601 --> 00:45:03.367
Design for
the broadest use case

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:06.400
and speed up past completion.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.267
And by doing that,
you will not only make

00:45:09.267 --> 00:45:12.267
a huge impact on users
with special needs...

00:45:12.267 --> 00:45:15.534
What you will inadvertently
achieve with that moon shot

00:45:15.534 --> 00:45:18.868
is that you will vastly
increase your user base

00:45:18.868 --> 00:45:22.167
and find that your users use
your applications a lot more.

00:45:22.167 --> 00:45:24.334
We can start taking
questions from here.

00:45:24.334 --> 00:45:27.067
We'll put up a slide.

00:45:27.067 --> 00:45:28.868
And I think that there's
a microphone up there

00:45:28.868 --> 00:45:30.267
that you can walk up to
for questions.

00:45:30.267 --> 00:45:31.801
Chen: There are actually
two microphones.

00:45:31.801 --> 00:45:33.133
Raman: There are two
microphones.

00:45:33.133 --> 00:45:34.901
All right.

00:45:34.901 --> 00:45:37.200
man: Hello.
I had a question.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.334
So most of the focus
of this talk was

00:45:39.334 --> 00:45:42.033
on vision-impaired users.

00:45:42.033 --> 00:45:45.534
I know, obviously,

00:45:45.534 --> 00:45:50.400
hearing-impaired
and movement-impaired users--

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.434
well, I guess is--
is mainly the focus with Android

00:45:54.434 --> 00:45:56.901
on...on the vision-impaired
use case,

00:45:56.901 --> 00:45:59.267
is that like the biggest
hurdle to jump, or...

00:45:59.267 --> 00:46:01.601
or what's the other focuses?

00:46:01.601 --> 00:46:02.934
Raman: So great question.

00:46:02.934 --> 00:46:04.601
To summarize
for the video recording,

00:46:04.601 --> 00:46:06.601
the question was
is Android Accessibility

00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:08.501
focused on blindness
and low vision

00:46:08.501 --> 00:46:11.067
or are we also paying attention
to other disabilities?

00:46:11.067 --> 00:46:14.267
The answer is we are definitely
paying attention

00:46:14.267 --> 00:46:16.167
to other disabilities,

00:46:16.167 --> 00:46:18.434
and as the question
is summarized,

00:46:18.434 --> 00:46:20.601
a lot of the focus
right now

00:46:20.601 --> 00:46:22.167
is on blindness
and vision impairment,

00:46:22.167 --> 00:46:24.567
because that's where
the biggest challenges are.

00:46:24.567 --> 00:46:27.501
We have another talk later
today from our team

00:46:27.501 --> 00:46:29.868
that sort of gives
an eye-level overview

00:46:29.868 --> 00:46:31.634
of all the accessibility
stuff we are doing.

00:46:31.634 --> 00:46:34.634
And you'll see some very
innovative users of Android

00:46:34.634 --> 00:46:36.634
for helping users
with hearing impairments

00:46:36.634 --> 00:46:38.000
in that talk.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.767
And do come by our sandbox

00:46:39.767 --> 00:46:41.267
where we can talk in more detail

00:46:41.267 --> 00:46:42.868
about the various things
we are doing.

00:46:42.868 --> 00:46:45.567
So absolutely Android
accessibility in general

00:46:45.567 --> 00:46:48.567
and accessibility at Google
is not limited to blindness

00:46:48.567 --> 00:46:49.801
or vision impairments.

00:46:49.801 --> 00:46:51.234
It's a very broad idea.

00:46:51.234 --> 00:46:53.400
Chen: Also, just to add on
to that point...

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:56.834
several Android devices
are hearing-aid compatible,

00:46:56.834 --> 00:46:58.067
so it's a hardware issue,

00:46:58.067 --> 00:47:00.067
and several of them
do have that.

00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:01.601
And in addition to that,

00:47:01.601 --> 00:47:03.400
there are several
open source projects

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.267
aimed at other impairment.

00:47:05.267 --> 00:47:06.767
So for example,

00:47:06.767 --> 00:47:08.534
there's a university project
called Tekla.

00:47:08.534 --> 00:47:09.734
T-e-k-l-a.

00:47:09.734 --> 00:47:11.834
And it's using
the Android IME

00:47:11.834 --> 00:47:13.801
because it's an open,
flexible framework

00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:15.400
and letting you control that

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.601
though a Sip-and-Puff
interface.

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:19.400
Raman: So they are doing it
for Sip-and-Puff.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.534
They are trying to control
wheelchairs with Android,

00:47:21.534 --> 00:47:23.167
all kinds of cool stuff.

00:47:23.167 --> 00:47:24.501
man: Okay, great.
Thank you guys.

00:47:24.501 --> 00:47:26.133
Good work.

00:47:26.133 --> 00:47:28.300
Chen: Question?
man: Yes.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.300
Hi. I have a question
about where to get support

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:36.567
as a developer if I'm writing
an accessible application.

00:47:36.567 --> 00:47:39.167
I had an issue a while ago
where a text view

00:47:39.167 --> 00:47:41.901
with the password tag
just simply would not show up

00:47:41.901 --> 00:47:43.767
whatsoever with the
accessibility.

00:47:43.767 --> 00:47:45.868
I couldn't find out where
to get support.

00:47:45.868 --> 00:47:49.534
There is nothing online
for accessibility whatsoever.

00:47:49.534 --> 00:47:52.634
I'm wondering if you guys are
gonna put up some documentation

00:47:52.634 --> 00:47:55.734
somewhere about how to resolve
common issues

00:47:55.734 --> 00:47:57.534
or just ways to better write
accessible apps

00:47:57.534 --> 00:48:00.434
because all the documentation
I got was "use the content

00:48:00.434 --> 00:48:02.300
description label."

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.767
Chen: So a couple things.

00:48:03.767 --> 00:48:06.601
First is I invite you to look
at links up there.

00:48:06.601 --> 00:48:08.434
We are improving
our documentation.

00:48:08.434 --> 00:48:11.667
There's also an eyes-free
user group

00:48:11.667 --> 00:48:13.067
where you're more than welcome
to ask questions.

00:48:13.067 --> 00:48:16.267
We regularly read these posts
and respond to them.

00:48:16.267 --> 00:48:18.801
And finally, if you're
interested and you have time,

00:48:18.801 --> 00:48:20.701
I'd be happy to talk to you
offline after this

00:48:20.701 --> 00:48:22.801
to look at your specific app
and issue.

00:48:22.801 --> 00:48:24.200
man: All right,
that would be good.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.868
I think actually I looked
at the eyes-free project before,

00:48:25.868 --> 00:48:28.300
but it actually said
"If you're a user, post here.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.801
If you're a developer,
post on Google Groups."

00:48:30.801 --> 00:48:34.133
Raman: That is probably over
a year, year and a half ago.

00:48:34.133 --> 00:48:36.200
If you sort of look at the
overall velocity

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.000
of Android development,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.767
eyes-free work
and accessibility work

00:48:39.767 --> 00:48:41.467
has probably matched that.

00:48:41.467 --> 00:48:44.534
So you may be pleasantly
surprised.

00:48:44.534 --> 00:48:46.501
Of course, documentation
is never perfect.

00:48:46.501 --> 00:48:47.934
And we can always write more.

00:48:47.934 --> 00:48:51.267
But right now, I think about
a month or two ago,

00:48:51.267 --> 00:48:53.334
we actually added
an accessibility section

00:48:53.334 --> 00:48:54.801
to the Android dev guide.

00:48:54.801 --> 00:48:57.667
So you should probably find
a lot of the basic answers

00:48:57.667 --> 00:48:59.167
in there today.

00:48:59.167 --> 00:49:00.968
Chen: So the link is up there.
Please talk to me afterwards.

00:49:00.968 --> 00:49:03.534
man: All right, thank you
very much.

00:49:03.534 --> 00:49:05.667
Chen: Yes?

00:49:05.667 --> 00:49:07.501
man: Yes, Fred Giff
from Open Intense.

00:49:07.501 --> 00:49:10.400
My question goes
in a similar direction.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.534
Do you have some guidelines
or some strategy

00:49:13.534 --> 00:49:17.968
how to make your accessible
applications

00:49:17.968 --> 00:49:21.000
more accessible or discoverable
by the user?

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.667
Do you suggest to add a certain
tag to your market description?

00:49:26.667 --> 00:49:29.033
So that people can find
your app.

00:49:29.033 --> 00:49:32.234
Raman: To summarize
the question,

00:49:32.234 --> 00:49:35.667
are we planning to show
developers

00:49:35.667 --> 00:49:38.868
how to add more mark up
to the applications?

00:49:38.868 --> 00:49:43.968
Was that the question?

00:49:43.968 --> 00:49:46.467
man: Um...well...

00:49:46.467 --> 00:49:50.534
how find the people
my application?

00:49:50.534 --> 00:49:51.734
Chen: Oh, discoverability.

00:49:51.734 --> 00:49:53.567
man: Yes, discoverability.

00:49:53.567 --> 00:49:55.901
Chen: So please advertise it
on the eyes-free group

00:49:55.901 --> 00:49:57.667
if it is something that
is accessible

00:49:57.667 --> 00:50:00.033
and would be helpful
for this user base.

00:50:00.033 --> 00:50:01.801
Raman: In typical Google
fashion,

00:50:01.801 --> 00:50:04.167
a lot of this has happened
bottom-up.

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:08.667
I think one of the easiest ways
for users who need accessibility

00:50:08.667 --> 00:50:13.901
today to discover applications
that are accessible

00:50:13.901 --> 00:50:16.634
is through a website that I call
Android Access.

00:50:16.634 --> 00:50:20.100
I think that it is actually
allowing to post reviews

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.634
of applications.

00:50:21.634 --> 00:50:25.033
So you can actually go
to that site and see

00:50:25.033 --> 00:50:27.968
what people--users who need
accessibility

00:50:27.968 --> 00:50:29.334
think of particular
applications.

00:50:29.334 --> 00:50:32.300
And in the last month,
I've actually discovered

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.234
applications from there
rather than actually

00:50:35.234 --> 00:50:36.868
pulling down applications
from market

00:50:36.868 --> 00:50:38.300
and playing with them myself.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.734
So somebody else is actually
doing that work already.

00:50:40.734 --> 00:50:42.334
It's crowdsourced, right?

00:50:42.334 --> 00:50:43.801
It's a whole bunch of users
doing it.

00:50:43.801 --> 00:50:45.567
So definitely do that.

00:50:45.567 --> 00:50:47.567
Google for the Android
accessibility.

00:50:47.567 --> 00:50:49.300
Do a search for Android
accessibility.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:53.000
You will find a lot of resources
that are grassroots

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.801
and actually work very,
very well.

00:50:55.801 --> 00:50:57.100
Chen: Yes, ma'am?

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.100
woman: I just wanted to clarify
the previous question.

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:03.234
He was asking, "Can you flag an
app on the Android market

00:51:03.234 --> 00:51:06.634
"as 'We're
a very accessible app'?"

00:51:06.634 --> 00:51:07.968
Raman:
That's a great question.

00:51:07.968 --> 00:51:10.567
So "Can you flag a market
application

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.400
as an accessibility
application?"

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.100
It's a feature request
that we've received.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.701
It's a feature request
that I, myself,

00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:18.234
have raised.

00:51:18.234 --> 00:51:20.701
I don't know at what point
something like that

00:51:20.701 --> 00:51:23.133
will become available, but
that's great feedback to hear.

00:51:23.133 --> 00:51:27.334
We'll definitely take it back.

00:51:27.334 --> 00:51:30.467
Chen: All right.
Any other questions?

00:51:30.467 --> 00:51:32.534
Anyone?

00:51:32.534 --> 00:51:34.234
Okay.
Well, thank you.

00:51:34.234 --> 00:51:35.534
Raman: Thank you for coming!

00:51:35.534 --> 00:51:36.234
Chen: And please attend
our next talk.

00:51:36.234 --> 00:51:41.067
[applause]

00:51:41.067 --> 00:51:43.400
Raman: Look forward to seeing
you guys in the Sandbox.
