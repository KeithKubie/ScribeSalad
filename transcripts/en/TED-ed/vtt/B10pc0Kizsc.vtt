00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.518
As far as we know,

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:19.437
there’s only one thing in our solar system
sophisticated enough to study itself:

00:00:19.437 --> 00:00:21.306
the human brain.

00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:24.354
But this self-investigation 
is incredibly challenging;

00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:27.433
a living brain is shielded 
by a thick skull,

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:30.255
swaddled in layers of protective tissue,

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:33.356
and made up of billions of tiny,
connected cells.

00:00:33.356 --> 00:00:38.145
That’s why it’s so difficult to isolate, 
observe, and understand diseases

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:39.814
like Alzheimer’s.

00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:44.132
So how do we study living brains 
without harming their owners?

00:00:44.132 --> 00:00:47.035
We can use a trio of techniques 
called EEG,

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:48.324
fMRI,

00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:49.783
and PET.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:53.605
Each measures something different 
and has its own strengths and weaknesses,

00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:55.895
and we’ll look at each in turn.

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:59.793
First is EEG, or electroencephalography,

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:03.122
which measures electrical 
activity in your brain.

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:07.562
As brain cells communicate, 
they produce waves of electricity.

00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:10.955
Electrodes placed on the skull pick
up these waves,

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:14.635
and differences in the signals detected 
between electrodes

00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:17.706
provide information 
about what’s happening.

00:01:17.706 --> 00:01:20.554
This technique was invented 
almost 100 years ago,

00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:25.425
and it’s still used to diagnose conditions
like epilepsy and sleep disorders.

00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:28.646
It’s also used to investigate what areas 
of the brain are active

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:31.104
during learning or paying attention.

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:32.755
EEG is non-invasive,

00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:34.446
relatively inexpensive,

00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:36.064
and fast:

00:01:36.064 --> 00:01:39.426
it can measure changes that occur 
in just milliseconds.

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:41.822
Unfortunately, it’s hard to determine

00:01:41.822 --> 00:01:45.184
exactly where any particular 
pattern originates.

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:48.775
Electrical signals are generated 
constantly all over the brain

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:52.766
and they interact with each other to
produce complex patterns.

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:57.066
Using more electrodes or sophisticated 
data-processing algorithms can help.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:03.366
But in the end, while EEG can tell you 
precisely when certain activity occurs,

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:06.394
it can’t tell you precisely where.

00:02:06.394 --> 00:02:08.604
To do that, you’d need another technique,

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:13.125
such as functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, or fMRI.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:17.734
fMRI measures how quickly oxygen 
is consumed by brain cells.

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:21.161
Active areas of the brain use
oxygen more quickly.

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:26.353
So watching an fMRI scan while a person
completes cognitive or behavioral tasks

00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:30.775
can provide information about which 
regions of the brain might be involved.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:33.644
That allows us to study everything
from how we see faces

00:02:33.644 --> 00:02:36.228
to how we understand what we’re feeling.

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:41.603
fMRI can pinpoint differences in brain
activity to within a few millimeters,

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:44.775
but it’s thousands 
of times slower than EEG.

00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:46.504
Using the two techniques together

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:50.632
can help show when,
and where, neural activity is occurring.

00:02:50.632 --> 00:02:56.145
The third, even more precise, technique
is called positron emission tomography

00:02:56.145 --> 00:03:00.335
and it measures radioactive elements 
introduced into the brain.

00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:03.474
That sounds much scarier 
than it actually is;

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:08.010
PET scans, like fMRI and EEG, 
are completely safe.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.026
During a PET scan, a small amount
of radioactive material called a tracer

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.256
is injected into the bloodstream,

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:19.015
and doctors monitor its
circulation through the brain.

00:03:19.015 --> 00:03:22.433
By modifying the tracer
to bind to specific molecules,

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:27.083
researchers can use PET to study 
the complex chemistry in our brains.

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:29.906
It’s useful for studying 
how drugs affect the brain

00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:32.863
and detecting diseases like Alzheimer’s.

00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:36.025
But this technique has 
the lowest time resolution of all

00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:40.773
because it takes minutes for the tracer 
to circulate and changes to show up.

00:03:40.773 --> 00:03:44.565
These techniques collectively 
help doctors and scientists

00:03:44.565 --> 00:03:47.909
connect what happens in the
brain with our behavior.

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.165
But they’re also limited 
by how much we still don't know.

00:03:51.165 --> 00:03:55.513
For example, let's say researchers are
interested in studying how memory works.

00:03:55.513 --> 00:04:00.464
After asking 50 participants to memorize 
a series of images while in MRI scanners,

00:04:00.464 --> 00:04:03.035
the researchers might analyze the results

00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:05.774
and discover a number 
of active brain regions.

00:04:05.774 --> 00:04:09.125
Making a link between memory 
and specific parts of the brain

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:11.041
is an important step forward.

00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:12.766
But future research would be necessary

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:15.595
to better understand 
what’s happening in each region,

00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:17.024
how they work together,

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:20.226
and whether the activity is because 
of their involvement in memory

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:23.804
or another process 
occurring simultaneously.

00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:26.645
More advanced imaging 
and analysis technology

00:04:26.645 --> 00:04:29.647
might one day provide 
more accurate results

00:04:29.647 --> 00:04:30.724
and even distinguish

00:04:30.724 --> 00:04:33.214
the activity of individual neurons.

00:04:33.214 --> 00:04:37.485
Until then, our brains will
keep measuring, analyzing, and innovating

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.475
in pursuit of that quest to understand

00:04:39.475 --> 00:04:42.675
one of the most remarkable things 
we’ve ever encountered.
