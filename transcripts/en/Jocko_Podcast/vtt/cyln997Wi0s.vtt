00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.100
So where I think people might get the ideas,
okay,

2
00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:07.360
if I'm in a relationship with my wife and she gives,

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.940
serves me dry chicken again.
Yeah.
Right.
Which is,

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.930
which is a common theme in my household.
And actually thanks to the Internet,

5
00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:17.350
it's actually changed now because she's gotten thousands of people that have now

6
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:21.630
sent her how to keep the chicken moist.
So she does a great job.
But for,
for,
um,

7
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.190
you know,
we're talking about two decades of my life.

8
00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:28.150
We're talking about dry chicken.
This is a problem.
And you know what I did?

9
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.750
I didn't say anything because I just would drink more water,

10
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.400
more water at dinner.
Yeah.
I fear that sometimes people say,
well,
you know,

11
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.320
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna run around and I'm going to tell the truth

12
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:42.320
to everyone all the time on these little things that don't matter.
Now,
my,
my,

13
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.790
my actual best example that I've ever heard of this,

14
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.050
we had a guy in the podcast named Charlie plum.
He was a pilot in Vietnam.

15
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.900
He was shot down in.
Um,

16
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.310
and on his last mission of his deployment,
he was shot down.
He was captured,

17
00:00:57.311 --> 00:01:00.160
he was in the Hanoi Hilton for six years.

18
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.330
This is the deal that they had amongst their roommates.

19
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.940
So they had roommates in a room smaller than we're in right now,

20
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.160
and there'd be four of them in there,
three of them in there too.
From there,

21
00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:12.820
depending on what was going on,
if you did something that annoyed me,

22
00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:16.990
if Jordan does something that annoys me,
we got to live together.

23
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.360
If you do something that annoys me,
it's my fault.

24
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.200
It's my fault for allowing you clip,
clip,

25
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.530
clip your nails together or you pick your nose a lot or you itch your head,

26
00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:28.390
whatever it is that you do.
That bothers me.

27
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.630
It's my problem and I have to absorb it because otherwise what we have is we

28
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:36.790
have like rats in a cage that are going to know each other apart.

29
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.710
And I thought about that while I was reading the part of the book that was

30
00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:45.700
saying,
and you actually also later in the book talk about,
Hey,
you know,

31
00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:47.500
are you going to get fired over this little stupid thing?

32
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.490
Are you going to absorb?
And I talk about that a lot as a leader,
as a,

33
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.230
as a person in a relationship,
hey,
there's problems from your boss.

34
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.830
You absorb them and you don't pass them down to your people.
You know,
you,

35
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.783
you want us to stay,

36
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.580
work or stay late and do a bunch of crazy stuff that we don't think we should be

37
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:06.370
doing?
Cool.
My guys are going to go home.
I'm going to absorb that.

38
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:09.100
I'll get it done myself.
I'm not going to,
I'm going to absorb these problems.

39
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.340
Now are there some tertiary effects?

40
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.800
Of course are secondary effects that now my boss thinks he can get away with

41
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.850
that and all those things.
But I just think there's,

42
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.860
we have to be careful that we're not just throwing spears of truth in people's

43
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.880
heads on a regular basis or black truths.
They're the opposite of white lies,

44
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.610
right?
So black truths are truths you use to hurt other people.

45
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.890
So technically in the moment the statement is factual,

46
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.640
but the context be lies,
right?
Whereas a white lie,
it's like,

47
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:42.820
well it's a little lie,
but you're trying to support a larger truth,

48
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.600
not that white white lies aren't optimal.
You know,
it's better not to lie,

49
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:50.850
but sometimes the best you can manage as a white lie and then maybe that takes

50
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.760
pretty good.
Well,
okay,
so then in those sorts of situations you think,

51
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.760
well first of all,
I have some rules of thumb.

52
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.890
If someone does something at work annoys you.

53
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
<v 1>It's like,
write it off,
man.
It's like that's once.
It's like,</v>

54
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.180
what does that mean?
You're having a bad year,

55
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.040
having a bad day or I'm having a bad day.
It's like it doesn't mean anything.

56
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.190
Do it twice.
Think it's okay,
I'll just write that off.
Write that off.
It's,

57
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.600
that's the same issue.

58
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:21.601
It could still just be circumstance and situation three times.

59
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.900
Okay.
Now there might be grounds for a conversation.
You go and say,
well,
you know,

60
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.210
you put your feet up on my desk like a day ago,
and that was okay,

61
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.210
but then you did it again and then like you did it again.

62
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.710
And I'm thinking it actually happened three times.
Right.

63
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:42.010
So there's no denying it and perhaps that's not optimal.

64
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.850
And then you go for the smallest possible victory.
That's the next thing is like,

65
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.120
I'm not telling you that you're,

66
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.350
what would you say that you lack respect or that there's something wrong with

67
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:56.860
you?
What I'm asking is that if you come in my office,

68
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.280
it would be better for both of us if your feet stayed on the floor.

69
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.330
That okay.
You know,
and that's a small thing.

70
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:09.430
You're not going after the person's character,
right?

71
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:11.800
You're going after the tiny victory.
So you say to your wife,

72
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.160
look like I'm thrilled to death that you're cooking me dinner.
I really,

73
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.060
I'm serious because,
and it could be a hell of a lot worse than it is,
you know?

74
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:22.780
And,
and maybe I could be more helpful around the kitchen.

75
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.250
That's certainly a possibility.

76
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.270
But I have the got this thing with regards to chicken and maybe it's me,

77
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.140
you know,

78
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.140
but could we try for like a month to cook it differently and then we'll revisit

79
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:38.350
it and if I happen to be wrong,
like I'll shut the hell up and she might think,

80
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.370
okay well he is kind of useless around the kitchen and he sort of bitchy about

81
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.930
the chicken and all of that.

82
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:48.931
But maybe I trust him enough to admit that I made a small mistake and rectify it

83
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.700
and we could go along and not have the damn chicken thing hanging over our heads

84
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.980
until we're 80 right.

85
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.550
<v 0>You know,
you just in your second example there you,
I,</v>

86
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.840
I tell people this all the time.

87
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:01.870
So you're coming into my office and you're putting your feet on the desk.

88
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.730
What I'll generally do is make it my fault.
I have generally say,

89
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.680
Hey Jordan,
I hate to be like a nitpicker but I'm really freaked out about germs.

90
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.130
It's really stupid,
but I am.
And when you come in and put your feet on my desk,

91
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.000
it freaks me out.

92
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.220
Can you just do me a favor and not put your fruit in your [inaudible].

93
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.570
Same thing with,
you know,
with the chicken,
it's like,
Hey,
you know what?

94
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:26.770
I have a super sensitive palate.
Refined and I,
yeah.
Tested for refined,

95
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:31.630
sensitive pallet.
Fine.
Sorry,
chicken.
But,
and I just,
yeah.

96
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.320
Could we maybe figure out another way to cook that or,
oh,
could we try,
you know,

97
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.760
but I'll take the blame for,
for the situation,
rather than,

98
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.910
you're,
you're disrespectful and don't put your feet on my desk.

99
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:45.270
This is adopt

100
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.370
<v 1>a more of a position of moral superiority than is absolutely necessary.</v>
