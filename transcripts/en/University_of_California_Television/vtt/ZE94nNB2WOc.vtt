00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.350
- [Female Voice] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.493
for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:10.745 --> 00:00:13.328
(mellow music)

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.780
- Thank you very very much for asking me

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.599
to give a Howison lecture.

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:51.599
I'm humbled by the list of
nine years of predecessors

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.690
on this forum.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.070
But I do have to begin
by explaining my title.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.913
I'm talking about mathematics.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.750
I have a very folksy eye
doctor who is a bit of a fan.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.580
He said to me he had read a book of mine,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.950
and he gave me a marvelous compliment.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.537
He said, "You write just
like my third-grade teacher

00:01:13.537 --> 00:01:14.927
"told me to write.

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:19.370
"Never use a 10-cent word when
a three cent word will do."

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.860
Well, of course, Proof,
Truth, Hands and Mind

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.480
are pretty expensive words,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.630
but they're no more
than five letters long,

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.920
much better than 11-letter
words like mathematics.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.640
But why my title?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.380
First because proof has
been an essential part

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.223
of Western mathematics ever since Plato.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.890
And Plato thought that mathematics

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.113
was the sure guide to truth.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.170
I want also to think of
how we do mathematics

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.190
in a material way,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.113
that Plato would hardly have acknowledged.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.260
We think with our hands
and our whole bodies.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.470
We communicate with each other.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.470
Not only by talking and
writing but by gesticulating.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.391
If I am thinking mathematically,

00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:15.860
I may draw a diagram to take you through

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.090
a series of thoughts, and in this way,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.573
I pass my thoughts to you.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.320
I was astonished a short time ago

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.280
when an established
American poet, Kelly cherry,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.670
wrote a poem, a sonnet about
me proving Godel's Theorem

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.570
in a logic class some 50 years ago

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.943
when I was a novice prof
and she was a grad student.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.940
The poem describes me as
covering all four blackboards

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.190
in a room in Virginia with chalk,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.450
gesticulating the while.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.530
I still remember, she writes,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.380
how you started on one
blackboard and worked your way

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.640
around the room, four walls whited out

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.910
in the blizzard of chalk.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.803
The concluding couplet of the sonnet runs,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.430
like gazing into someone's
mind and seeing his thoughts,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.060
no two alike come into being.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.980
Not a very good poem, the
book said out of the blue

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.980
but it surprised me by
expressing one of the connections

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.700
between mathematics and
the body that interests me.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.530
And hence my mysterious title,
Proof, Truth, Hands and Mind.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.530
But of course, there's
much more to the connection

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.560
between hands and mathematics
than gesticulating.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.160
George Lakoff, here at
Berkeley has done much

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.220
to make us aware of how so
many mathematical concepts are

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.673
as he puts it embodied.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.733
Mathematics is a specialist interest,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.680
yet it's the only branch
of human knowledge

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.580
that has consistently obsessed
many of the dead great men

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.400
in Western philosophical canon.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.400
Not all by any means, but
Plato, Descartes, Leibniz,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.870
Kant, Husserl and Wittgenstein
form a daunting array.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.600
And that omits the angry skeptics about

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.790
the significance of
mathematical knowledge,

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.750
such as Berkeley and Mill.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.163
And the logicians such
as Aristotle and Russell.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.550
If I cast my eye down this
list of Howison lectures,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.450
I would add at least Michael
Dermott, Hilary Putnam,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.250
Saul, Kripke and Quine to that list.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.270
And in the opinion of some,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.610
those are the most
important Howison lectures

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.580
that you read on that list.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.840
Others would point to many
more distinguished speakers

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.420
who could care less about mathematics.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.440
And yet a certain ideology of mathematics

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.050
has infected philosophy.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.570
The terms of the bequest
of the Howison Lecture

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.893
which you can read here, penned in 1919,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.630
use an idiom that few of us or none of us

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.530
would use today.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.146
It tells us that Prof.
Howison thought of the world

00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:07.150
as a community of free
persons, finite and infinite

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.230
sustained by a vision of the perfect,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.280
perfect with a capital P.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.390
And where did this vision originate?

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.170
In Plato's conception of mathematics.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.910
Why has mathematics mattered so much

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.900
to so many famous philosophers?

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.740
Aside from the naysayers such as Mill,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.570
it's first of all because they
have experienced mathematics

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.820
and found it passing strange.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.680
The mathematics they have encountered

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.290
has felt different from other experiences

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.673
of learning discovery
or simply finding out.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.960
Now, many people do not
respond to mathematics

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.400
with such experience or feelings.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.570
They really have no idea what
is moving those philosophers

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.310
and they're in good company.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.940
Take David Hume, one of my
heroes who can do no wrong.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.520
I doubt that he had a mathematical moment

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.560
in his entire life.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.080
Experience in mathematics
in no way implies

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.680
the possession of philosophical
gifts or vice-versa.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.910
But those philosophers who
have experienced mathematics

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.550
have built it into their conceptions

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.253
of pretty well everything.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.383
So what is philosophy of mathematics?

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.940
There are three types
of philosophical issues

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.810
about mathematics, I call them ephemeral,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.793
scholastic and perennial.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.350
The ephemeral ones are the pressing ones

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.260
arising out of recently discovered

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.060
but disquieting mathematical facts

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.210
we have not yet figured
out how to live with.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.810
Ephemeral doesn't mean unimportant,

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.943
it means present but
perhaps not long-lasting.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.270
Most generations during
which mathematical research

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.680
has been intense produce

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.680
their own ephemeral
philosophical difficulties.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.790
Mathematicians worry
about them just as much

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.353
or more than philosophers do.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.350
What I call the scholastic issues,

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.020
again not with a negative
sense, no more than ephemeral

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.050
are usually generated
within philosophy itself

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.453
and are almost unknown outside it.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.200
The perennial questions
are for everyone including

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.033
and maybe especially including beginners.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.290
There are a few topics
that are easily grasped

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.720
if you have any live experience
of mathematics at all.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.720
They've always been there and
they're not going to go away.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.593
I have no intention of
making them go away.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.560
I shall touch on the
ephemeral but more briefly

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.640
than I would like.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.010
The issues really matter
to how we should think

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.120
about mathematics now in 2010.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.510
But they're not my primary topic,

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.086
I shall sketch a few,
'cause it seems to me

00:08:02.086 --> 00:08:05.670
that far too many
philosophers of mathematics

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.040
intent on scholastic issues tend

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.583
to ignore pressing matters
arising from current math.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.720
In contrast, I shall bypass
what I call scholastic matters,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.770
and so this talk will not much resemble

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.373
most current literature in the
field of academic philosophy.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.300
Instead, I shall strive
for a second adolescence

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.920
and address perennial
questions which in my opinion,

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.430
are the reason why there is

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.833
philosophy of mathematics at all.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.250
Second adolescence, I've
written far too many books

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.360
but not published almost
nothing about mathematics.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.993
Yet it was my first love.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.560
My PhD thesis came in two parts.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.203
One was called Proof,
first word of this lecture.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.460
The other, of 30-odd pages
had nothing to do with it

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.270
but proved some results in logic.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.543
Happily, the examiners liked
the latter and they passed me.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.660
But I had been gnawing at the topics

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.510
of the other thesis, Proof, all my life.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.380
And I finally venture 50 years later

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.810
to continue writing that thesis.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.840
And the talks I am giving
this week including this one

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.000
are different aspects of that project.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.860
I have been quietly obsessed
by Wittgenstein's remarks

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.180
on the foundations of mathematics,

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.160
ever since I bought the book
on the 6th of April 1959.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.940
And my dissertation was a
first passionate confused

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.400
expression of the effect
of that book on an

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.453
as yet unformed mind.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.475
If Professor Tahara is present tonight,

00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:56.150
he can witness that I was
impassioned with the remarks

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.030
when we were both very young

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.560
and knew each other very briefly.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.740
I do however, take up new topics

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.360
which it would have been hard
to think about 50 years ago.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.540
Proof, I want to say
something about the first word

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.373
in my title.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.800
Proof has been a hallmark
of Western mathematics

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.143
descended from Greece.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.240
There was plenty of what we can recognize

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.660
as mathematical thought in ancient China,

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.493
Egypt, Babylonia, possibly in Mesoamerica.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.630
We might venture this.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.250
As soon as the people
had invented writing,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.600
they were ready to invent mathematics

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.720
and maybe the Inca did it
without inventing writing.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.500
But writing enabled us to
tap cognitive skills in ways

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.983
very difficult without it.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.800
But the existence of proofs

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.453
is due to a curious historical accident.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:58.410
A handful of people in
the eastern Mediterranean,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.620
Greeks as we call them,
discovered the very possibility

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.623
of deductive proof.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.090
They happened to live in
an argumentative society,

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.440
a few of whose members
wanted a better tool

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.113
for settling arguments than rhetoric.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.670
I want to remind you of
Kant's story of this,

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.470
were heirs to this critical
anomaly in human thought.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.430
In the traditional story,
relayed by Aristotle,

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.960
a legendary (mumbles) discovered proof,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.950
and all the greats repeat
what Aristotle passed on.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.120
It's not terribly good
history in our present opinion

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.083
but it's an important parable.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.050
A short time, Kant, a
short time after publishing

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.150
the first edition of The
Critique of Pure Reason in 1781,

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.670
Kant caught the wave of the future,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.790
something not often noticed
and became something

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.633
of a historicist about human reason.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.570
The new introduction to the second edition

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.903
of the first critique, 1787,

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.743
Pure Reason Has a History.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:12.890
I love his rendering of the
story of the light bulb going on

00:12:13.652 --> 00:12:17.500
over the head of Thalys or some other.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.680
He writes, in the earliest
times to which the history

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.610
of human reason extends,

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.130
mathematics among that wonderful people,

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.720
the Greeks had already entered upon

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.980
the sure paths of science.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.230
The transformations must
have been due to a revolution

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.550
brought about by the happy
thought of a single man.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.760
The experiment which
he devised marking out

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.310
the path upon which the science must enter

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.410
and by following which secure
progress throughout all time

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.890
and in endless expansion
is infallibly secured.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.110
You didn't know Kant went
in for purple prose perhaps.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.080
And he speaks about how the history

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.890
of this intellectual
revolution has been preserved

00:13:00.163 --> 00:13:03.840
in a way which at least
shows that the memory

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.970
of the revolution brought
about by the first glimpse

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.740
of this new path must have
seemed to mathematicians

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.150
of such outstanding
importance as to cause it

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.900
to survive the tide of oblivion.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.850
A new light flashed upon
the mind of the first man,

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.000
be he Thalys or some
other who demonstrated

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
the properties of the isosceles triangle.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.850
Now of course, we would not do all this,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.040
it requires a community,

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.840
we would not do it, a
single man and all that

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.923
but there's a remarkable
parable here being told by Kant.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.410
In the opinion of one of the
most interesting historians

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.390
of mathematics revealed, Greek
mathematics revealed, Netz

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.040
something tumultuous took place

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.810
involving a small number of individuals

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.840
who corresponded and traveled
in the eastern Mediterranean.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.770
Using the metaphor recently
favored in paleontology,

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.200
Netz suggests to quote,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.830
the early history of Greek
mathematics was catastrophic.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.680
Fantastic changes.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.420
A relatively large number
of interesting results

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.913
would have been discovered
practically simultaneously.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.740
Now, maybe this is no
more than a just so story,

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.890
but it is a great parable .

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.593
Like so many parables, it cuts two ways.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.890
In a brilliant critical
notice of Netz's book,

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.872
Bruno Latour has recently written,

00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:35.690
Bruno Latour is a
sociologist of knowledge,

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.940
the one who has most
influenced my own thought

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.840
who says that Plato
kidnapped mathematical proof.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.310
Kidnapped, making it a cornerstone

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.510
of his epistemology and metaphysics

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.440
and he's quite rude about Plato.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.300
To the great surprise of those who believe

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.140
in the Greek miracle, the striking feature

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.630
of Greek mathematics according
to Netz, writes Latour

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.422
is that it is completely
peripheral to the culture,

00:15:00.422 --> 00:15:02.520
even to the highly literate one.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.050
Medicine, law, rhetoric,
political sciences,

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.480
ethics, history, mathematics no

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:13.330
with one exception, the
Plato Aristotelian tradition.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.350
But what did this tradition,
itself very small at the time

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.750
take from mathematics?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.700
Only one crucial feature,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.250
that there might exist one way to convince

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.870
which is apodictic and
not rhetoric or sophistic.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.620
Philosophy extracted from mathematicians,

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.217
not a full-fledged practice but only a way

00:15:32.217 --> 00:15:34.100
to radically differentiate itself through

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.550
the right manner of achieving persuasion,

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.510
which he thinks, which
of course Latour thinks

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.340
is all a con trick.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.230
And Latour speaks for myriads who say

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.430
that they hate or fear mathematics.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.300
If you had to suffer through
geometrical demonstrations

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.940
at school which is
certainly the case for me,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.740
he writes and so on.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.053
Now, I'm in the minority.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.310
In fact, I am lucky enough to have gone

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.830
to a mediocre high school long ago,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.810
a rather unreformed
place where I had to do

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.020
slightly watered-down Euclid,

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.110
and in my case it was
at the age of 13 or 14.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.860
Nerd I was, so I loved Euclid.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.250
It was my escape from a
harsher world around me.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.600
I learned about proofs and I loved them.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.180
So I am a gullible victim
of Plato's abduction

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.440
of mathematics and the victim Kant.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.783
But do we need proofs?

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.620
Little sketch I've given is
highly contingent events,

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.313
flukes of happenstance.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.020
We have by good fortune

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.090
an experimental illustration of that.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.400
China in ancient times,

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.360
developed brilliant mathematical ideas.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.750
But it chiefly worked on
a system not of proofs

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.730
but of approximations.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.470
Proof seldom reared its
head and was seldom esteemed

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.980
in its own right.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.680
Geoffrey Lloyd, comparative
historian of Chinese

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.090
and European intellectual history suggests

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.759
the hierarchical structure of
a powerful education system

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:08.810
with the emperor civil service

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.571
as the ultimate Court of
Appeal had no need of proofs

00:17:13.571 --> 00:17:17.070
to settle anything, whereas a democratic,

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:21.350
very oligarchic, but I
mean limited in democracy,

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.340
democratic society like Athens

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.170
where you had to argue things out,

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.660
at least to an anti-Democrat like Plato,

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.163
proof was a wonderful
replacement for rhetoric.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.450
We could have gone on
just fine without proof.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:41.160
We could have been Chinese
using a sophisticated

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.800
method of approximate
solutions and got ourselves

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.540
to the differential
calculus that way, directly

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.850
if we had fast computers long ago

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.663
who would have needed proof.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.790
I don't support that line of thought

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.190
about what we could have
done, because I think proof

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.040
is so intimately embedded in the history

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.150
of the Western sciences as a model,

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.430
often for the worse rather
than for the better.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:11.210
But we just could have
done without the concept

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.910
in practice of deductive
proofs, but that's where we are,

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.093
that's what we have and we still have it.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:22.630
Now, I was once keen on
proofs but then let them rest.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.370
But there are advantages
to being Rip Van Winkle.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:33.070
Rip slept for only 20 years which happened

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.853
to span the American Revolution.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:39.270
I'm a Rip who has stayed
away from mathematics

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.193
and its philosophizing for
no fewer than 50 years.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.490
Hence I am struck by some
radical changes that may escape

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.700
the notice of those who
have come upon the scene

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.090
more recently or have been able to watch

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.810
it evolve continuously.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.900
There's of course a lot more mathematics.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.220
There are not just new questions

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.010
but new classes of problems
and new methodologies,

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.010
new techniques pretty much unthinkable

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.283
until quite recently.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.840
I think it's not just a matter of degree,

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.670
but doesn't matter.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:15.053
Rip Van Winkle has difficulty
catching up on the new math.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.630
But he easily notices changes in the way

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.870
in which mathematicians of various sorts

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.560
talk about their field.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.173
He attends to the new gossip.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.623
I shall single out four
changes as done deeds.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.210
Certainty, kinds of evidence,

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.653
experimental mathematics and application.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.350
These lead on to what I have
called ephemeral issues,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.130
important topics that
arise from mathematics

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.213
as she is practiced right now.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.370
Certainty, mathematics used to be admired

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.380
as the only certainty.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.340
Any of you who have read
Bertrand Russell's biographies

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.511
or autobiographies will know
what he vowed as a young man

00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:06.683
to make mathematics completely certain.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.710
Mathematicians have finally
allowed themselves to be relaxed

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.180
about what would once have been scandal.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.870
Published proofs are full of gaps,

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.506
even though the result proved
is usually more or less right.

00:20:22.506 --> 00:20:25.520
One mathematician, Richard Borcherds

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.070
of the math department here,
he won a Fields Medal in 1998,

00:20:30.135 --> 00:20:33.890
casually asked me at our first meeting

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.220
after we had discussed his own work,

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.950
if anyone had looked at the
error rate of the proofs

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:42.980
in Principia Mathematica,
especially volume three.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.030
The very concept of an error
rate in published proofs

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.140
was to my knowledge non-existent

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.090
or unmentionable 50 years ago.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:54.740
Now it's a common place anywhere.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.580
Once it seemed a terrible
insult to the queen of sciences

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.060
that proofs are full of holes.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.880
Experts now expect that and
accept it, so long as one sees

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.930
pretty clearly how to
clean up the odds and ends.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:13.550
Sometimes it matters, and the
proofs are deeply fallacious.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.170
In important cases, one worries.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:20.890
But in general certainty has
become a matter of degree.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.303
These thoughts have
become common parlance.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.360
During the last 50 years, the old vision

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.650
of absolute mathematical
certainty which Kant

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.470
took for granted and which drove Russell

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.560
to spend the best years of his
life toiling with Whitehead

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.563
on Principia, they're all history.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.363
Second, kinds of evidence.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.460
It's now publicly acknowledged
that all sorts of evidence

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.383
may be used in support of
mathematical propositions.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.730
Proofs are important,
perhaps they still define

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.510
the discipline but the
working mathematician

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.853
uses all sorts of
non-demonstrative reasoning.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.300
A nice example of sheer
hands-on experimentation

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.470
is in packing problems.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.450
What's the best way to
fit a bunch of tetrahedra

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.620
into a container, which actually has a lot

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.910
of important applications.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.440
People do that with real
little plastic objects.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.360
Pieces from Dungeons and Dragons

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.670
are the cheapest tetrahedra in town,

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.330
and they also do it by
computer simulations.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:30.113
More generally, there is
a widespread awareness

00:22:30.113 --> 00:22:32.790
that demonstrative proof
is not as important

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.340
as it seemed to be.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.010
George Pólya in 1945 had already shown

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.240
that all sorts of
non-deductive good reasons

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.710
arise in mathematical thought.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.380
Polya's one-time student, Imre Lakatos

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.360
wrote his brilliant proofs and refutations

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.440
to show that all mathematical
proofs are fallible.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.590
The Procedure of Proof is what
he called quasi empirical.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.630
Only at the end of a
Hungarian synthesis of proof

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.510
and refutation might one produce something

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.340
that amounted to analyticity.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.700
But it's not Lakatos that made or Polya

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.360
that made mathematicians come out

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.970
of the closet about fallibility.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.260
There's a much richer internal story

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.310
that demands serious sociological study.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.210
One thing with which it's connected

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.920
is the most radical single
change to have a chord

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.393
in mathematics these 50 years,
namely fast computation.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.340
This has become an almost invaluable tool

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.313
for mathematical exploration.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:37.630
In the early days, computers
were merely prosthetics,

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.680
sort of a better pencil.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.500
What matters today are how
computers help us to explore.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.473
So experimental mathematics.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.980
There's been a lot of discussion
by both mathematicians

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:55.220
and philosophers about proofs,
checkable only by computer

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.090
and about computer generated proofs.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.090
The prime example to which
philosophers usually turn

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.773
is the four-color theorem proved in 1977.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.980
Far more important in
my opinion is the advent

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.980
of large-scale experimental
mathematics with its own journal

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:19.290
Experimental Mathematics,
founded by David Epstein in 1992.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.290
David just happens to have been one

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.610
of my undergraduate chums.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:28.470
To avoid misunderstanding, it
was emphasized from the start

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.290
that this was a journal
of pure mathematics.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.630
The point was not to deny
the claim that I shall make

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.890
about pure and applied
mathematics in a few moments,

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.870
but to make plain that the
journal was not interested

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.240
for example in the booming industry

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.550
of simulating experiments
in the material world,

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.370
an activity that depends
of course on the constant

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.000
use of mathematics both in modeling

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.960
the micro and macro universes around us.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.020
But also in designing programs

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.793
in which the models are embedded.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.990
Thus far, most philosophers
seem to have discounted

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.250
experimental mathematics as nothing new.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.360
I think not enough attend
to the way in which

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.160
it is such an extraordinary tool

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.203
for mathematical exploration.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.410
Perhaps an awoken Rip Van
Winkle can arouse his colleagues

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:21.280
from dogmatic dozing.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.853
How about this for a sentence
destined to rouse hackles?

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.650
Experimental mathematics
provides the best argument

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.063
for Platonism in mathematics.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.740
At any rate, as David
Epstein wrote me recently,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.990
these are things that no one dreamt of

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.710
when we were students.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.340
Sometimes what is found
out is quickly replaced

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.963
by a deductive proof.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.800
Some of those deductive proofs
are old-fashioned proofs

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.040
that make sense.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.430
Others are themselves
only machine checkable.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.003
Here there is a real division of attitude.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.120
Some mathematicians regard
computers merely as tools

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.840
of discovery or as search
machines for counter examples,

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.030
after discovery comes justification.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.783
Others think this attitude is obsolete.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.923
I don't take sides.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.910
Mathematicians differ.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.190
Timothy Gowers, a Cambridge mathematician

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.330
who won a Fields Medal in 1998,

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.590
same year as Richard Borcherds,

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.500
is the author of a wonderful book,

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.610
Mathematics: A Very short
Introduction, in which he writes,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.320
my own view which is a minority one

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.430
is that over the next 100 years or so,

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.643
computers will be eventually
supplanting us entirely.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.960
But he continues, most
mathematicians are far

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.850
more pessimistic or
should that be optimistic

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:51.193
about how good computers
will ever be at mathematics.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.530
Incidentally, and perhaps it is relevant,

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.270
I have encountered very
few working mathematicians

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.183
who take Wittgenstein seriously.

00:27:01.227 --> 00:27:04.420
Gowers writes at the
end of his little book,

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.460
anybody who has read both this book

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.190
and the philosophical
investigations will see

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.760
how much the later
Wittgenstein has influenced

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.010
my philosophical outlook
and in particular,

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.043
my view on the abstract method.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.980
But now with computers,
we enter a strange region.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.390
We tend to think of computers
as never making mistakes

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.920
but computers are imperfect,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.910
and their error rate is far greater

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.310
than their manufacturers acknowledge.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.410
This has become a little
branch of mathematics

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:36.383
in its own right.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:42.300
For a exaggeration, Roger Penrose argues

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.420
that all computation is a
quantum sensitive operation

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.613
that is, its probabilistic only.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.610
It only takes one cosmic
ray to turn a zero into one

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.960
and make a different computation.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:00.960
So here is one more ephemeral
problem which of course

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.733
might go on troubling
us for a very long time.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.300
Applications, another change.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.890
There was in 1960, something of a Cold War

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.920
division of opinion.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.930
Soviet Dogma held that pure mathematics

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.390
was bourgeois idealism,

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.823
and that only applied
mathematics was substantial.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.220
But in the West, where what we call

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.020
the philosophy of
mathematics was practiced,

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.720
the concept of pure
mathematics was dominant

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.940
not only among philosophers but among

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.470
many schools of mathematics.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:40.680
It was a curious situation, for
never before had mathematics

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.080
such an effect on the world.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.850
In 1960, everyone was
aware of the possibility

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.010
of blowing everything
up and was busy digging

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:53.370
futile bomb shelters or
walking from Aldermaston

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.510
with the campaign for nuclear disarmament.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:59.720
Perhaps that was the very
reason that mathematicians,

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.603
ostrich-like wanted to
maintain their purity.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.900
I believe that the sharp
distinction between pure

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.583
and applied mathematics was
an aberration that is past.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.530
A lovely end of career
account of the reunion

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.210
of pure and applied is to be found

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.340
in a recent survey article
called Geometry and Physics

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.120
by Michel Atiyah who won
his Fields Medal long ago

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.330
and an Abel prize recently.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.860
The doors between pure and
applied have been unlocked.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.550
Mathematicians have had to learn

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.920
how to think like physicists.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.943
Not only metaphorically
unlocked but literally,

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:41.250
in Atiyah's case.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:44.990
It seems that when he was at
MIT, he discovered that a door

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:49.330
separating mathematics and
physics was permanently locked

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.344
in the building or the extended
building in which he worked.

00:29:52.344 --> 00:29:54.070
Why?

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.650
Well, the physicists had
just installed new carpeting

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.270
and didn't want the grubby
mathematicians messing it up

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.570
with muddy snow on their boots.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.982
Peter Galison tells of a
countertop that can ensue

00:30:04.982 --> 00:30:07.310
when the mathematicians and the physicists

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.540
get different answers.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.490
In his example, the physicists were right,

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.800
their sense of how the
physical world works

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.270
trumped the mathematicians'
conception of space.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.530
In retrospect, one just says that somebody

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.570
made a programming
error but that is really

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.730
not to get at the heart of it.

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:26.020
I'll give just one example
of how the boundaries

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.040
between pure and applied sort of collapse.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.380
It's a real-life example
quite easy to understand.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.273
It's rigidity.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.843
Nothing it seems could be
more practical than rigidity.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:43.200
As soon as human beings
began to build shelters,

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.960
moved out of caves, they wanted structures

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.393
that would not fall down.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:53.010
Some predecessor concept of
rigidity must have emerged

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.730
very early in human consciousness.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.703
Not as a cognitive universal
but as an ecological one.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.430
Take only a very late civilization

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:06.100
about which we actually know something.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.690
The two classic structures
of the North American prairie

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:13.540
where building materials are scarce

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.833
are the wigwam and the teepee.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.600
The former, the wigwam, is
a fairly permanent structure

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.370
in which height is fixed
around a domed frame

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.890
made of branches and
the latter as you know

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.440
is built around a movable frame of poles

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.120
that becomes rigid when erected.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.570
Now, there's a wonderful
mathematics of rigidity.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.753
Some say it goes back
to Euclid but in 1814,

00:31:36.753 --> 00:31:39.680
Cauchy, the French mathematician proved

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.890
the foundational theorem
that any convex polyhedron

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.270
with rigid plates but
with hinges at its edges

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.753
is despite the hinged edges rigid.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:55.800
Here we move from a serious
practical problem, what stays up

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.970
to pure mathematics, an entire discipline

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:02.010
which becomes an aspect
of topology develops.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.130
But then real life strikes back,

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.783
and the mathematicians
learn from the engineers.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:12.090
One of the loveliest rigid
structures is the geodesic dome,

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:15.700
often called the Bucky dome
after Buckminster Fuller,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.550
who worked out some of its a principles

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.430
and patented it in 1954.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:24.803
It's a network of great circles
that interform to triangles.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.210
Much the same effect by the
way seems to have been achieved

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.583
by wigwams built by Apache Indians.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.280
Fuller generalized the concept of rigidity

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.050
to what he called tensegrity,
tensional integrity,

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:41.540
based on a balance between
tension and compression

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.610
which has a lot of
engineering consequences

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.660
both in the large and the small.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.320
That is totally applied
science but tensegrity

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.170
has generated its own rich
and aesthetically pleasing

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.743
field of mathematics.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:57.570
Late in the 19th century,
a french engineer,

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.700
precise engineer, discovered

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.780
flexible non-complex polyhedron.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.920
But it was long thought that
any polyhedron homeomorphic

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.010
to a sphere has to be rigid.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:12.703
In 1978, Robert Connelly at
Cornell found a flexible,

00:33:12.703 --> 00:33:15.297
(mumbles) vertex counting (mumbles),

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.263
does this research have
practical consequences?

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.580
Not obviously.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.963
One application of
Connelly's discovery is one

00:33:25.963 --> 00:33:27.850
can make a flexible
polyhedron for exhibition.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.626
According to Wikipedia,
there's one in Washington

00:33:30.626 --> 00:33:34.230
at the National Museum
of American history.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.010
I don't know why it's not
the Smithsonian but there.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.910
Well, that's an application
which we should not forget

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:41.610
in thinking about applications,

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.230
what I call a secondary application namely

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.400
to enchant schoolchildren with
the wonders of mathematics.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.740
Connelly's polyhedra are

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.180
in familiar three-dimensional space.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.180
Flexible polyhedra are
known and for space.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.290
Are there any flexible polyhedra in more

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.820
than four dimensions?

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.720
A question investigated at present

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.150
for purely aesthetic reasons,
the answers are not known.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.973
So it's pure for the nonce.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.630
I want also to say a word
about the application

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.543
of mathematics to mathematics.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.210
Descartes wrote the
first canonical textbook

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.033
of analytic geometry, The Geometrie.

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:24.970
We often forget it was
published as an appendix

00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:27.420
to the discourse, that is the discourse

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.510
of properly conducting one's reason

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.330
and seeking the truth in the sciences.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:35.670
I like to think of his geometry as a model

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:39.103
of how to conduct one's
reason and seek truth.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.740
The geometry made plain, what
I mean glimpsed at before

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:48.320
for all the world to see that
algebra born of arithmetic

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.973
could be applied to geometry.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.420
It's the first indubitable example

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.310
of the unreasonable
effectiveness of mathematics

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:59.350
developed for one purpose
applied to mathematics

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.670
developed for another purpose.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.710
And I'm dead serious in making a statement

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.150
parallel to the physicist
Eugene Wigner' statement

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.970
1960 article, Unreasonable
Effectiveness of Mathematics

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.010
in the Natural Sciences.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.330
Wigner's title is often read

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:18.710
as the unreasonable applicability
of mathematics to physics.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.550
Descartes gave a stunning example

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.410
of the unreasonable applicability

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:26.070
of mathematics to mathematics,
now why is it unreasonable?

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.560
Because it's almost too good to be true.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.560
Geometry is spatial, algebra
is a child of arithmetic.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.300
Arithmetic is for counting,

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:41.810
a process that as Kant
emphasized takes place in time

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.540
once you get past the point
of just seeing how many

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.620
that is past six or so.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.850
Kant used his thought of the
distinctness of space and time

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.530
manifested by the difference
between geometry and arithmetic

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:58.400
as the road to an entire
critical philosophy

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.783
that has haunted us ever since.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:05.180
It would be a plausible
conjecture for those

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.563
who take a modular view of the brain,

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.920
that the modules that
enable us to navigate

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.920
our spatial environment and
invite geometry are distinct

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.040
from those that gave us the number sense

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.473
to use the title of a
book by Stanislas Dehaene.

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:26.790
Somehow the two coalesce, how come?

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.460
Well, that's not an ephemeral question

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.180
but as a matter of fact, it's not one

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.060
which philosophers have addressed.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.700
The history of mathematics is one

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.340
of diversification and unification.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.310
We start with diversity.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.220
Some peoples, the ancient
Greeks fixed on geometry

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.460
as primary while others in
India and working in Sanskrit

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.150
fixed on numbers as primarily
and bequeath that obsession

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.570
to Islam and Arabic,

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:57.300
but it all keeps turning
out to be the same stuff.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.830
And if you read science journalism,
you'll know for instance

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.850
that one of the reasons
that Andrew Wiles's

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.520
result on Fermat's Last Theorem is deemed

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.140
to be so exceptional and
create new proof ideas

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.740
was that it brought together
branches of mathematics

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.350
which seemed to have nothing whatsoever

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:15.280
to do with each other.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.730
But there's something special
about arithmetic and algebra

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.540
on the one hand and geometry in the other.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.921
Perhaps it's only a contingent fact

00:37:22.921 --> 00:37:25.710
about the historical
development of mathematics

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.440
as we know it, but there's a strange play

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.613
of arithmetic and geometry
throughout our experience.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:36.120
Descartes is a focal point in that dance.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.020
Category theory can be seen
as starting from the premise

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.760
that the two are the same,
and seeing what happens.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.580
So understood it would be a fulfillment

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:48.580
of a Cartesian insight that
geometry and algebra are one.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.330
I think that the question
about algebra and geometry

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:55.760
is one that deserves much thought
and which is not ephemeral

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.840
but it does not bear on my lead question,

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.653
why is there philosophy
of mathematics at all?

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.910
First Russell's answer,
why is mathematics exercise

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.303
such a powerful effect?

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.020
When he had finished
and done with Principia,

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.890
Bertrand Russell sat
down to write a potboiler

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:18.140
that has charmed young people ever since,

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:23.140
The Problems of Philosophy
in 1912, it charms me still.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.710
In the course of covering
the waterfront, he wrote,

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.530
every philosophy which
is not purely skeptical

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.860
must find an answer to Kant's question,

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.280
how is mathematics possible?

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.270
Of course, Russell exaggerated.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:38.370
Some great philosophies that
are not purely skeptical

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:42.080
have had no interest in
mathematics whatsoever.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.230
What's so strange about
mathematics that it should

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.930
however attract so many philosophers?

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.970
Russell mentioned one source of wonder.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:54.420
The apparent power of
anticipating facts about things

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.403
in which we have no
experience is very surprising.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.580
That's a much better way of putting things

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.900
than Kant's glorious exclamation of awe,

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.013
the one that put together
our philosophical argo.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.540
In the (mumbles) any future
metaphysics that will be able

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.990
to present itself as
a science, that's 1783

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:18.280
between the first edition of the critique

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.143
and what I call the historicist
edition of the critique,

00:39:23.212 --> 00:39:25.930
we get the question for
the first time in Kant,

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.753
how is pure mathematics possible?

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.893
And it's a sort of shout.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.530
Here is a great improved
field of knowledge

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:38.330
which is already of admirable compass

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:41.380
and for the future promises
unbounded extension

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.750
which carries with it
thoroughly apodictic certainty

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.410
that is absolute necessity,

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.230
hence rests on no grounds of experience

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:53.030
and is a pure product of reason.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.670
And moreover is thoroughly synthetic.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:58.120
How is it possible for
human reason to bring

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.280
into being such knowledge wholly a priori?

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.480
There we have the
philosopher's words, a priori.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.370
Synthetic and qualified by
adjectives that turn a noun

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:09.890
into a sort of shout.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:12.433
Apodictic certainty, absolute necessity.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.160
Yet that doesn't explain
why so many philosophers

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.670
should be obsessed by mathematics.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.880
The words are more names
for aspects of an obsession

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.613
than explanations of that obsession.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.810
Proof and application when combined point

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.690
to a reason why there has been
a philosophy of mathematics

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:36.580
ever since Plato.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.780
In fact, Plato is I
think the first example

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:44.780
of genuinely unreasonable
effectiveness of mathematics.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.820
In the 13th and last book of the elements,

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.430
Euclid constructed a
regular convex polyhedron

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:56.150
and proved there are only five of them.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.930
Some scholars have argued
this is the conclusion

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.030
which was the whole point of the elements.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.110
We call these five polyhedra
the Platonic solids.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:10.140
In the time is, Plato
proposed that the elements

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.010
of which the universe are built

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.093
are shaped as regular solids.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.570
There was plenty of
pre-Socratic speculative physics

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.800
but Plato took mathematics
devised for supposedly

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.940
aesthetic reasons and applied
it to speculative physics.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.470
It may be the first
known case of a primary

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.010
and theoretical
application of mathematics.

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:35.650
At any rate, neither proof
nor application suffices

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:37.960
on its own to keep the ball rolling,

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.090
but together they are a force
which must be reckoned with.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:45.130
Yet something else is even
closer to the experience

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.743
of mathematical proof.

00:41:46.743 --> 00:41:51.743
It's the sensation that
mathematics is just out there.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.413
And where is there?

00:41:57.064 --> 00:41:59.540
Now that's a problem
but I take the sensation

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.203
very seriously indeed.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.760
It's why I talk about the experience

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.333
of mathematical discovery.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.053
It seems no more than a vulgar
way of describing Platonism.

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:16.330
Indeed, it may appear to
be the most crass form

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:18.250
of Platonism imaginable.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.450
It's the very crassness
that brings it close

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:25.230
to the roots of the
philosophy of mathematics.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:30.160
Philosophizing about mathematics
is haunted by Platonism,

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.450
both naive forms and sophisticated forms.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.630
It's supposed to be a kind of ontology,

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:39.310
but one is tempted to
recycle Jacques Derrida's

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:42.343
brilliant pun and call it hauntology.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.140
Until December 5th, you can
see the hauntology exhibit

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.730
at the Berkeley Art
Gallery just up the street

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.470
and you can read phrases like,

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.610
such an uneasy mixture of
the ancient and the modern

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:59.630
which are applied to a
particular form of British jazz

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:01.363
or British music making, sorry.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.380
But one could apply the same
thing to Platonism itself,

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.983
an uneasy mixture of the
ancient and the modern.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:13.950
I'm afraid to say the art gallery
is cashing in on Halloween

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:17.960
and on this coming Friday, the 29th,

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.310
they are having a sort
of hauntology party.

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:24.310
But I think hauntology is
really a very serious idea.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:26.800
I'm not a Derrida admirer
but I think that pun

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.860
is really enormously thoughtful.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:32.210
No ghost more effectively
haunts all Western philosophy

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.883
than Plato's, and sometimes
I wish for an exorcist.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:40.690
Platonism in its various
guises and disguises

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:42.263
will never be exorcized.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.640
I find it best to say that
in its strongest forms,

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.860
it is a pleasant fable,

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.480
while in its more modest forms as banal.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.430
One logician, Bill Tate,
exemplifies the view

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.533
that when properly stated, it is trivial.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:59.060
I do tend to agree with an
idea I attribute to Nietzsche

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.410
that European languages demand
an existential presupposition

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:05.820
for the terms in the subject position.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.760
European grammars generate
the feeling that if there

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.120
are truths about numbers,
then numbers exist.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.000
This Nietzschean idea is
intended to undermined interest

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.330
in the existence of numbers.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:22.763
Their existence is a trifling
byproduct of our grammar.

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:27.790
One can also say what the
mathematician, Timothy Glowers

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:31.000
whom I referred to before
got from Wittgenstein,

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.753
that it's what we do that
matters, and in the way in which,

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.900
well it's the same way in
which the piece in chess,

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:41.240
the King's rook, it's
not an abstract object.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:45.733
It is rather what it can do
which constitutes its reality.

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:48.870
There are many scholastic physicians here.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:53.230
Quine had what called the
indispensability argument

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:57.400
which is supposed to settle the question,

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.390
numbers and functions do exist
because we quantify over them

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:02.973
in the Natural Sciences.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.100
Quine's maxim, to be is to
be the value of a variable.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.980
Numbers are values of variables
in contemporary physics,

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.380
that's our best available
theory of how things are

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:15.430
hence numbers exist which
means that in some sense,

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:17.507
Platonism is true, QED.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:20.790
And there are widespread
opposition to this.

00:45:22.458 --> 00:45:23.650
Perhaps some of you
will know Hartree field

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:27.340
or doctrines of fictionalism,
structuralism advocated

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.280
by Charles Sahera among others

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.940
holds that what exists are
not mathematical objects

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.290
but mathematical
structures and they exist.

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:37.950
Normalists think that's
pretty cold comfort

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:40.000
and there's some truth in their reaction.

00:45:40.835 --> 00:45:44.880
There really is nothing more
to numbers than their relations

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.970
so numbers, anything you say about numbers

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.640
are about structures and Plato

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.883
need not have been very
perturbed by structuralism.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.270
The numbers are characterized
by certain structures

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:02.470
and there are structures
instantiated by numbers.

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.838
it's still kind of Platonism.

00:46:03.838 --> 00:46:06.920
Now, I apologize for this gross
superficiality, you experts.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.480
I want only to emphasize that
these skirmishes and alarms

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.560
are generated within philosophy itself.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.480
They're scholastic, not
in any pejorative sense

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.360
but only in the sense
that they are of interest

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.040
to those who participate in the activity

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.453
of academic analytic philosophy.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.530
Many mathematicians are content

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:29.620
to call themselves Platonists.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.690
Is a single one of them moved by the fact

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:36.383
that all the sciences quantify
over numbers, I doubt it.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.000
They're moved by the fact that
they discover amazing facts

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.803
about numbers by means of
proof or rumors of proof.

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:47.720
At least some mathematical
objects are experienced

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.980
as out there or structural
relations between them

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.740
are experienced as out there.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.053
What's this out there?

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:58.570
It's convenient to use a debate in which

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:01.420
a self-declared Platonist
mathematician faced off

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.590
against a nominalist neurobiologist.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:07.740
The protagonists were two
French colleagues of mine,

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.230
Alain Connes and Jean-Pierre Changeux,

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.920
published a book in French in 1989

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.163
and slightly expanded in English in 1995.

00:47:20.149 --> 00:47:23.240
Alain Connes who received
the Fields Medal in 1982

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.870
cannot doubt there is a
mathematical reality out there

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:28.583
independent of human thought.

00:47:29.734 --> 00:47:32.300
Changeux is convinced that
mathematical structures

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.653
are byproducts of the innate
endowments of the human brain.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:40.600
I suspect that these two
attitudes are compatible

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.563
but fortunately Conne and
Changeux do not think so.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:46.990
Fortunate because some lines are drawn.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:50.070
I don't say they're drawn
clearly, but clear enough

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.330
that we can look at them.

00:47:53.657 --> 00:47:56.550
Connes was enormously
impressed with the fact

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:58.333
about mathematical research.

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.320
Here we come, he writes, upon
a characteristic peculiar

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.093
to mathematics that is
very difficult to explain.

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:12.680
Often it is possible although
only after considerable effort

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.090
to compile a list of mathematical objects

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:19.363
defined by very simple conditions.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:24.100
Intuitively, one believes
that the list is complete

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.063
and searches for a general
proof of its exhaustiveness.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:32.210
New objects are frequently
discovered in just this way

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:35.890
as a result of trying to
show the list was exhaustive.

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:38.143
Take the example of finite groups.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.200
The notion of a finite
group is elementary,

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.003
almost on the same level
as that of an integer.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.610
A finite group is the group of symmetries

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:48.993
of a finite object.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.580
Mathematicians have struggled to classify

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.040
the finite simple groups, that is to say,

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.030
the finite groups that like the
prime numbers to some extent

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.463
can't be decomposed into smaller groups.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.670
15 years ago, this is 1995,

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:08.310
the last finite simple group,
the monster was discovered

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:10.410
by purely mathematical reasoning.

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:14.220
It's a finite group with a
considerable number of elements.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.420
Then he writes down
the number of elements,

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:19.260
takes 54 digits to write
down the number of elements.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:20.203
It's meaningless.

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:23.300
It's now being shown, he continues,

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.730
as a result of heroic
efforts that the list

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:29.023
of 26 finite simple
groups is indeed complete.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:33.210
Now Connes writes, as
if the monster had been

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.540
just sitting out there quietly grinning,

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.323
waiting for us to discover it.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.620
Now, there's a side tale
here bearing on stuff

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.843
about evidence and certainty and so forth.

00:49:43.807 --> 00:49:48.807
The person who demonstrated
the existence of the monster

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.863
actually called it the Friendly Giant.

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.030
Any mathematician still
had doubts about the extent

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:56.780
to which this fact had been proven,

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:01.210
the fact, the existence of the monster

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.898
and the completeness of the classification

00:50:03.898 --> 00:50:06.500
was actually not established till long

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.990
after Connes had written
his, those paragraph I quoted

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:13.180
by Ash Becker and Smith in Caltech.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.193
That takes two volumes
to prove the result.

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:20.380
The reviewer, very
knowledgeable Ronald Solomon

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.090
in the bulletin of the
American Mathematical Society

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:27.893
asserts that no single person
will ever read the proof.

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:31.730
But a team has checked it, that is,

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.340
particularly the second volume
is divided into five parts

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:37.460
and five different people
check each bit of it.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:42.460
Yet Connes like many others
had no doubts about that fact,

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:44.790
namely the existence of the monster

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:47.950
and the completeness of
system of finite groups

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:49.923
some 15 years earlier.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.170
A nice example of the
way in which certainty

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:57.253
in mathematics has just changed.

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.773
Mathematicians soon made
sense of the monster.

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:04.310
That began with the prolifically
creative mathematician,

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.020
John Conway, with something he called

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.030
the monstrous moonshine conjecture.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.630
It seems so preposterous
it was called moonshine,

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:17.020
because the monster
turned out to be identical

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.523
to an object derived,

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:23.050
from a completely different
branch of mathematics.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:25.380
It had to be a coincidence,

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.530
there couldn't be any connection

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.560
between these two
completely disparate fields.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:33.010
Moonshine, except it was
instead one of the cases

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:37.350
of the underlying unity within
the diversity of mathematics.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:42.240
But here I want only to emphasize
Connes' heartfelt feeling

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.827
of experience that this at
first sight absurd object

00:51:46.827 --> 00:51:49.403
was just there waiting for us.

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:52.230
And it's quite a common reaction.

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:56.950
Richard Borcherds, mentioned before

00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:00.340
got his Fields Medal for proving
the moonshine conjecture.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:03.560
In conversation he said, and
he's allowed me to quote this,

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.510
when you think about the monster,

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.920
you have to wonder who made it.

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.210
It's almost like that
intelligent design stuff.

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:14.730
The monster had such a complex
and yet organized structure

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:17.803
that it is if it had been
engineered by someone.

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:22.510
Now, he was honestly expressing
his persistent astonishment

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:25.020
about the sheer existence of the monster

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.130
that he had proved existed.

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:28.393
He was not advancing,

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:32.130
sorry, whose properties, whose
equivalents to something else

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:33.570
he had proved to exist.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:35.850
He was not advancing an opinion,

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:38.920
he was expressing heartfelt
incredulity of a fact

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.240
that in any ordinary sense

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.230
he understood at least as well
as anyone else in the world.

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:47.660
He was not so much surprised at the fact

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.180
as by the existence of a such a fact.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:54.020
He doesn't of course imagine
the monster had a designer.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.030
He said only the object is
so complex and so delicate

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:02.030
in all its parts that it
as if it had been designed.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.690
And Connes was giving vent
to the same sentiment.

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.880
But when they feel that he was also using

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.600
a certain sort of mathematicians rhetoric

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.520
to scare us into submission.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.780
It didn't work on his fellow
debater, Jean-Pierre Changeux

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.173
who said the monster was just a bore.

00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:23.390
So we're presented with
this meaningless sequence

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:26.840
of 54 digits, so we can see
that it actually factors

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.680
into some very interesting
primes, up to 71

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.330
which are called the
super singular primes.

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:35.210
But all the same, one is reminded

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:38.780
of Wittgenstein's remark about glitter.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:40.670
We're supposed to be impressed when Connes

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:44.740
writes down the number
but somehow it's overdone.

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.150
Instead we're offering

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:48.463
what Wittgenstein called mysteriousness.

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:53.460
In the same context, he
asks, is it already alchemy

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:58.000
that mathematical propositions
are regarded as statements

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.773
about mathematical objects,

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:04.440
and mathematics as the
exploration of these objects?

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.003
That is Wittgenstein is saying look,

00:54:06.003 --> 00:54:09.350
this a whole thing is a confidence trick.

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:12.580
It's that alchemy that
Connes takes for granted

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:15.830
and which he presents
as awesomely mysterious.

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:20.750
Mystery, glitter and
alchemy, Wittgenstein's words

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:23.690
are not all the same but
all three of these words

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:27.700
can be used to refract
different aspects of examples

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:28.663
like the monster.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.650
Wittgenstein himself said,
all I can do is to show

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:35.920
an easy escape from this obscurity

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.123
and this glitter of concepts.

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:41.760
I don't believe there
is an easy escape from

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.650
this obscurity and glitter of concepts,

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:47.160
of the sort illustrated by Connes.

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.220
Maybe there is no escape.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:53.110
It just is astonishing that
a few elementary axioms

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:56.930
or groups should generate
this extraordinary object

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:58.817
which turns out to be related
to a lot of other things,

00:54:58.817 --> 00:55:01.010
and some people claim is even significant

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:02.260
for quantum field theory.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.103
Connes is not an indiscriminate Platonist.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:11.020
He does not think that
all mathematical objects

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:14.433
are like the monster, grinning
and waiting to be found.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:20.640
His idea has more content
than Quine's semantic doctrine

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.410
that if we quantify over any class

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:25.850
then entities of that kind exist.

00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:29.490
He's a highly discriminating ontologist.

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:32.610
He agrees that most of the
tools devised by mathematicians

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.553
are inventions not discoveries.

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:38.270
His labels for such tools is projective.

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:42.160
But they are used to
investigate what he calls,

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.520
strange words, really French, archaic

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.383
or primordial mathematical reality.

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:53.910
This is his way of expressing
a realism about mathematics

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:56.610
that is both modest and specific.

00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:59.760
We construct mathematical
tools in abundance, he writes,

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.670
but what's remarkable is that using them,

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:05.940
we can identify uniquely
various objects that

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.700
are not in his opinion, constructed.

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.210
They constitute archaic, primitive,

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:14.090
original mathematical reality.

00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:17.210
And at least the integers in his judgment

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.350
are a familiar part of that reality.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:22.900
I don't share Connes'
convictions but I find them

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:27.490
more instructive than
blanket scholastic Platonism

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:29.350
which says without discrimination

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:32.660
that abstract objects exist,
or anything over which

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:34.440
we quantify exists.

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.590
The Nietzschean use of
grammar to undermine Platonism

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:40.560
is a powerful tool against the blanket,

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.397
but not against Connes.

00:56:45.318 --> 00:56:46.843
But there's the neurobiological retort.

00:56:48.931 --> 00:56:51.500
Jean-Pierre Changeux holds
that mathematical truth

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:55.259
is constrained by the neuronal
structure of the brain.

00:56:55.259 --> 00:56:58.960
In answer to Connes' example, he retorts

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:02.464
that here we have merely,
I would say glittering,

00:57:02.464 --> 00:57:07.464
an exotic example of the finite
list of regular polyhedra

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:11.063
which so impressed Plato.

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:15.260
And he writes that does
not prove despite Descartes

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:16.820
that we are concerned with properties

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:19.170
that are immutable and eternal.

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.430
Here he speaks as the neurobiologist

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:24.810
who doesn't really experience
mathematical proofs.

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.310
We can easily imagine a
lost dialogue in which

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:30.570
Socrates used the platonic
solids to make the same point

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:33.230
almost word-for-word
that Connes was making.

00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:37.580
He was merely choosing an
example that was in 1989,

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.063
still recent and indeed
unfinished business.

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:45.530
My own opinion is much more obscure

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:48.860
than those of either of
the two controversialists.

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:52.020
I think that what Connes says is right,

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.650
but what he means is wrong.

00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:57.110
He means a fabulous domain of numbers,

00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:59.210
archaic and primordial whose structures

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:01.590
have nothing to do with the brain.

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:04.510
I think that what Changeux says is wrong

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:06.280
but what he means is right.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.740
He means that the
structures Connes so admires

00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:13.033
are byproducts of our genetic envelope.

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:17.630
Both men engage in a debate
that could be called archaic

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:19.680
in a technical sense of the word,

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:22.243
if Greeks before Thalys
had discovered proofs.

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.840
In fact, this debate is
merely ancient and athenian,

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.550
it began at the time of Plato.

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:32.540
It has stage props of today,
the newly discovered monster

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.200
and recent findings in cognitive
science pitted against it.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:39.410
It's nevertheless the perennial debate.

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:41.380
It is one of the two underlying reasons

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.380
why we have philosophy
and mathematics at all.

00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:47.420
The other is the sense
that somehow by proof

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:49.960
we discovered that which
is necessarily true.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.401
Thank you very much.

00:58:51.401 --> 00:58:54.401
(audience applause)

00:58:58.516 --> 00:59:01.099
(mellow music)
