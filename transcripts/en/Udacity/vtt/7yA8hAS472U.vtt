00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.950
Here's a simple site, Skinny Ties.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.040
I've opened up Dev Tools
in another window, so

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.790
when I resize this, you'll see
the resolution show up right here.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.290
And like any responsible,
responsive designer,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.100
I'm starting with a small mobile design.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.550
This one looks pretty clean.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.560
I'll start expanding and at 480 pixels,
I hit the first break point.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.700
There are now two columns, there are bow
ties and pocket squares next to each

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.510
other, okay and at larger than 690
pixels, there are three columns, nice.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.420
Once the view port is larger than 915
pixels, all of the fonts get bigger,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.930
which is a pretty nice touch.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.020
I also noticed a few other small
changes as the page was getting larger.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.720
After you watch this video,
maybe you can check out Skinny Ties, and

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.130
try to find them.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.880
I also took a look at
CNN.com's new layout.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.130
This one is a bit more complicated.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.400
Once again, I am starting small.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.350
Notice the hamburger icon in
the top right-hand corner.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.370
Clicking on it makes
the nav bar show up.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.660
That's pretty nice.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.970
Also notice that there are social media
icons underneath this main story.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.290
I've expanded the page larger
than 725 pixels across, and

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.000
now these social media icons are gone,
unless you hover over.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.090
This would be use something that
would be called a minor breakpoint.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.000
Which isn't a huge page layout change,
but

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.220
there's still something
slightly different.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.510
I've expanded the page
past 800 pixels wide, and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.690
I see that the hamburger icon is gone.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.070
There's more room at
the top of the page,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.160
so as a result, the navigation menu
options are just showing up here.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.480
Larger than 935 pixels,
the layout really changes.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.630
With the extra screen real estate,
a few sentences about the main

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.830
story show up over here, and all of
this description is now on the right.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.240
Notice the social media icons,
are once again showing by default.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.210
Larger than the classic 960 pixel width.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.680
The new screen real estate is being
taken up by other top stories for today.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.000
And I found one more small break point.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.710
Larger than 1024 pixels, an ad shows up.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.860
All in all, not a bad design.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.160
So now, it's time for
you to think about break points.
