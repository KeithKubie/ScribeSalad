NICOLAS COLIN:
Thank you very much.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.528
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:13.528 --> 00:00:15.510
Thank you all for
attending the talk,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.460
and thank you for
everyone watching online.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.240
I'm really glad to
be here to share

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.570
a few ideas about
technology, policy,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.830
and how we need to upgrade our
institutions in these times

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.830
of radical change.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.770
To start discussing
that, I'd like

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.210
you to picture a runner,
one of those runners here.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.390
So it's not a runner that's
running a five kilometer

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.150
race or a sprint
or even a marathon.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.410
It's a runner that's into what
is known as ultra running.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.200
That is a very long
race that drags

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.450
through the day and the night.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.410
And anyone here run
that kind of race?

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.050
Oh, you do, so you're
in better shape than me,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.220
and you can relate to
what I have in mind.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.940
So the idea here is that
to run that kind of race,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.680
ultra running, you need more
than being in great shape.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.110
Well, you need a compass.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.220
You need a map.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.360
You need a headlamp to help
you see through the night.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.420
And the reason I'm
mentioning this today

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.500
is because I think we together,
as a society, are currently

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.880
involved in that kind of race.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.000
And it's a race
that is very much

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.550
about economic development.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.540
It's a long race,
because it's a race that

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.970
can be seen as being
divided into two parts.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.360
So the first part of
this ultra running

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.200
towards economic development
in the digital economy

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.110
is about building
great tech companies.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.300
And you here in
the Bay Area have

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.270
been very good at doing that.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.280
But there's a second
part of that race, which

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.280
is about inventing
or discovering

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.850
the institutions that will
make the new economy more

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.729
sustainable and more inclusive.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.460
And that's a discussion or
conversation we in Europe--

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.130
because I'm European, you can
hear that from my accent--

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.630
we in Europe are very keen to
have that kind of conversation

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.150
about new institutions
for the digital economy.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.090
And if we want to win, if we
want our Western countries

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.890
to remain the most advanced
economies in the world.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.190
The most sustainable
economies in the world

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.840
and the most inclusive
economies in the world,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.280
we really need to be ready to
run that very long race that's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.170
divided into two parts.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.940
So as for me, I'm the
co-founder and director

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.530
of a firm called TheFamily.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.910
So we are based in Europe.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.480
We have offices in London,
where I live, in Paris

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.570
where we founded the
firm six years ago,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.810
and in Berlin, in Germany,
and in Brussels as well.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.240
And what we're
doing in Europe is

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.400
supporting ambitious
entrepreneurs

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.410
across Europe,
entrepreneurs who want

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.960
to build large pan
European tech companies.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.820
But before doing that,
I have a background

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.350
in policy and
government, because I

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.870
used to be trained in
the French civil service.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.210
I actually worked for
more than five years

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.310
for the French government
before joining the tech world.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.890
And so I have this
mixed background

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.390
that makes me interested in
both parts of the race, the part

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.670
that is about building
tech companies

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.770
and the other part that
is about discovering

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.370
new institutions to make our
economy more developed, more

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.070
sustainable, and more inclusive.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.200
And I've written this
book, "Hedge," which was

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.330
published last year to share--

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.950
well, to try and invite
everyone in the tech world

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.890
to participate in
that race that we

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.010
have to run if we want
our economies to be

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.440
more balanced and more
stable and more rewarding

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.510
for the many as
opposed to the few.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.680
And so I'd like to share a few
ideas about what's in the book

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.300
today.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.860
So first of all,
it's a book that I

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.030
wrote to address an
American audience.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.790
It relies on what
I used to study

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.890
in the past about American
history, American politics.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.810
So I've tried to use
all that knowledge

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.750
of this great country,
the US, to try and address

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.310
that audience that
is so different

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.830
from a European audience
in terms of interests,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.540
in terms of perspectives,
experiences, and so on.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.550
And that's because
I think the US has

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.880
a critical, unique
contribution to make

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.680
to winning that two-part race.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.890
And there are three
reasons for that.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.040
So the first reason
is that the US

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.410
has a large, successful,
thriving, local tech industry.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.530
And it's a very important
part of discovering

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.610
new institutions, because
if you have a government,

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.900
like we have in Europe, that
tries to invent and to design

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.430
new institutions without having
large tech companies that

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.450
are local and domestic,
and that they can rely on

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.920
for insight, for knowledge,
for direction, for making sure

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.040
that the new institutions are
really in line with how we

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.130
create value in the new economy,
how we produce, how we consume,

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.080
how we work, well, the
institutions that will come out

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.030
of this effort will be ill
designed and not aligned

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.280
with what the new
economy is about.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.780
So because the US has a thriving
tech industry, part of it

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.090
is located here in the Bay
Area, it's really well ahead

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.550
in terms of being able to
design new institutions.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.020
And that's the first reason why
we really need, as the world,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.940
the US to participate in that.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.390
The second reason why the US is
so interesting in that regard

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.220
is that there is a
federal system here.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.500
And when you talk about
government designing

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.470
new institutions, it's not only
about the federal government

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.610
in Washington DC.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.210
It's also about the 50
states and the large cities

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.700
that all have the legal
and financial power

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.860
to make experiments
in terms of policy

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.730
to try and tackle the
problems in an innovative way

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.530
and to eventually discover
the new institutions that

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.050
then can be scaled up
at the federal level.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.920
So this is a picture
of Louis Brandeis.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.720
So he was the
first Jewish person

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.750
to be appointed to
the US Supreme Court

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.740
early in the 20th century.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.910
And I I'm using
his picture here,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.510
because he's the one who coined
this very interesting concept

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.590
of the 50 states or
the American states

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.810
as laboratories of democracy.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.370
And that's because he was a keen
believer in the federal system

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.200
and was very interested
in the capacity

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.930
to experiment with new
policies on the ground,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.480
at the state level,
or at the local level,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.650
and then get
inspiration from that

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.640
to scale up new policies
and new institutions.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.710
And so the US has that.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.860
You have a domestic
thriving tech industry.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.260
You have a federal
system that provides room

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.020
for many experiments in policy.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.930
And third, well, you already
did that the previous time

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.970
when we went through
radical change economically,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.990
politically, in
terms of technology,

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.270
as well at the beginning
of the 20th century.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.010
Well, the US was a
pioneer at the time

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.320
in terms of reacting
to that change

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.980
by designing new institutions
to try and balance

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.860
that new economy that
nobody really understood.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.280
And so it's what I call
the Great Safety Net 1.0.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.800
It was first designed
here in the US,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.850
and then it provided
inspiration for other countries

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.330
in the world.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.350
And it is known by historians
as the Second New Deal.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.060
So this is actually a picture
of President Roosevelt signing

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.760
an act known as the
Social Security Act.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.740
Behind him is
Frances Perkins, who

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.770
is the Secretary of Labor
at the time, the first woman

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.270
to be appointed to cabinet.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.049
And the Second New Deal was--

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.620
well, many different policies
and many different decisions

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.929
that together formed
the new social contract,

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:44.560
which enabled the US
to succeed economically

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.480
and politically in the
decades after that.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.060
And so there were social
security, obviously.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:59.360
There was government support
for banks issuing mortgages

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.660
with Fannie Mae and
later Freddie Mac.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.390
There was upgraded
banking regulations.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.190
There was assistance
from the government

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.520
to unions so that unions
could bargain with employers.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.970
And all that together formed
what I call the Great Safety

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.400
Net 1.0.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.770
And so what about that
Great Safety Net 1.0?

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.780
So I'd like to share two
ideas about that today.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.990
First, it used to be incredible.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.450
It worked extremely
well in terms

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.990
of providing support to
everyone, households,

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.620
businesses, and making it
possible for the economy

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.330
to thrive.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.620
But second, today it's
obsolete, because the economy

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.210
has recently gone
through radical change.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.900
It's not the same that it was at
the time of the Second New Deal

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.890
obviously.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.150
And so we need to be ready to
upgrade that Great Safety Net

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.580
and go from 1.0 to 2.0.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.490
But before that or
before discussing that,

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.550
I'd like to share a few ideas
about what was the Great Safety

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.720
Net 1.0.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.240
So the first thing that
you should have in mind

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.760
here is that it was designed
around the large corporations

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.840
of the time, the '40s
corporations that were mostly

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.710
about mass production
of tangible goods

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.940
in large factories,
assembly lines.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.420
And so the Great Safety
Net was designed--

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.310
it was very much focused
on the people working

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:32.180
in those corporations,
mainly factory workers,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.580
working along assembly lines.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:40.760
And because the new safety net
lifted those workers up, it--

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.880
through those, because they
were the most critical part

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.890
of the workforce at
the time, working

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.240
for the most productive
corporations of the time,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.560
they lifted everyone
up or almost everyone,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.870
at least the
majority of workers.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.690
And so the Great
Safety Net, designed

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.030
for those people,
those factory workers,

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.220
relied on three pillars.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.560
That's the model have been
developing in the book.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.630
So the first pillar was
about covering those people

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.700
against critical risks.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.280
And it was all--

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.740
it relied on a concept
known by policy wonks

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.630
as social insurance.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.320
So social insurance again
was about providing coverage

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.030
against critical risk.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.750
So for instance, if you
were too old to work,

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:37.160
because you didn't have the
stamina and strength anymore

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.590
to be able to work along
assembly lines, very

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.650
physical demanding
work, then the state

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.870
would provide you
with a pension.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.500
Or you were sick, or you
were hurt at the factory,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:54.590
then the insurance regime
would provide you with money

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:59.310
to pay the rent and
access to affordable care,

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.110
so that you can get back in
shape and get back to work.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:07.130
Or if you lost your
job, they'll provide you

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.220
with unemployment benefits,
so that, again, you

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.900
can pay the rent until--

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.020
and maybe learn new skills
before you find a new job.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.500
So that was all
social insurance,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.700
and what it performed
was covering

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.300
people against critical risks.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.740
The second pillar was
the financial system.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.670
And the financial system is
part of the Great Safety Net,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.480
because it provides people
with access to capital

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.820
whenever they need it.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.770
And so why did you
need access to capital

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.770
in the '40s, the economy
in the 20th century?

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.300
You needed access
to capital when

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.600
you wanted to buy your house,
and a house, especially here

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.620
in the US was an
extremely critical part

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.140
of economic security
for households.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.080
But no one could buy
a house paying cash.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.770
You needed to borrow money from
a bank, issuing a mortgage.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:10.540
And those mortgages were
operated by the private sector,

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.120
but they were made possible
by government-sponsored

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.790
institutions, such as
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.240
And so it's not because
it's to the private sector

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.760
that it's not part of
the Great Safety Net.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.380
The Great Safety Net effectively
included a significant segment

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:32.260
of private business, delivering
economic security and support

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.640
to households.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.220
You also needed
money to buy a car.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.460
A car, in the past,
used to be critical,

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.440
because you needed
that car to go

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.150
from home to work, to
school, to shopping mall,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.470
to baseball stadium.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.160
Without a car, you couldn't
access all the opportunities

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.970
and you couldn't find a
job in the '40s economy.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.510
So the financial system was here
to provide access to capital.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.470
And the third pillar of
the Great Safety Net 1.0

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.140
was strong trade unions.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.440
And they became strong following
the New Deal in the US,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.270
because they were assisted
by the government which

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:17.390
provided them with the
strength and the credit

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.760
to be able to bargain
with employers.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.400
And the reason why unions were
critical in that complex nexus

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.170
of institutions is because--

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.420
well, the version
of the Great Safety

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:36.550
Net that was designed right
after the New Deal in the 1930s

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:40.510
was designed for the
economy of the time.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.240
But then the economy over
the course of decades

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.620
went through several
waves of radical change.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.070
And each time you needed to
upgrade the social contract

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.500
to make the institutions work
for the economy of the day.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.890
And so you needed someone
to take care of that,

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.910
to push in favor of upgrading
the institutions and the rules

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.220
and regulations,
and trade unions

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.410
were the one who
delivered results

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.180
at least until the 1970s.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.900
And so that's what I call
the Great Safety Net 1.0.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.590
It was designed some
time in the 1930s

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:20.650
to deliver good jobs, a steady
income, and economic security

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.250
to most workers in the
context of the '40s economy

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.180
or what economist Carlota Perez
calls the age of the automobile

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.590
and mass production.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.820
And that worked incredibly
well for several decades.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.530
But today, it's obsolete.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.120
And to understand
why it's obsolete,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.000
we need to revisit
the various pillars

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.060
and realize how the
economy has changed

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.570
and why the those legacy
institutions don't

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.270
deliver anymore.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.030
So first, let's start
with social insurance.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.320
So one main reason why social
insurance regimes are obsolete

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.860
today is because we
can't fund them anymore.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.910
This is a picture that shows
you the projected evolution

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.180
of the US federal public debt.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.950
And most of that growing
debt that you see here

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:16.420
is because of Social
Security and Medicare.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.020
And the reason why we have
those funding problems

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:24.940
with social insurance is because
the tax system has not been

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.530
designed for today's economy.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.770
It was designed to tax
households and business

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.910
in the '40s economy, organized
mostly around manufacturing.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.230
But today, the economy
is not like that anymore.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.140
And so we have a hard
time-- governments

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:44.860
have a hard time
generating fiscal revenue

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:49.390
to pay for covering
risks for the many.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.780
That's one problem that we have
with social insurance today.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:57.950
Another problem is that we don't
cover against today's risks.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.640
There are risks that still
exist, like you can still

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.920
be too old to be able to work.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.790
You can still get sick,
and then you need care.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.760
But there are certain
risks that we're still

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.329
covering focusing on that are
not that critical anymore.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:18.220
So I wanted to show you that
picture of Julius Yego, who's

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.829
also known as YouTube
Man, by the way,

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:24.609
because he learned to throw
the javelin by watching

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:26.810
videos of athletes on YouTube.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.690
And he went on to become
an Olympic champion himself

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.190
a few years back.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:39.220
It's an exceptional case and
not everyone is like him,

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.130
being able to learn from
watching videos on YouTube.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.390
But what it suggests, I think,
is a very important idea.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:48.580
It's that today in
the digital economy,

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.260
because we have
so many resources

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.220
online to learn new skills,
to discover new activities,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:59.560
to spot interesting
opportunities, losing your job

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.370
and not having the right
skills is not as critical

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.020
a risk anymore.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.200
And so governments
are very much focused

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.330
on that, like reskilling
the workforce,

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.990
developing the workforce.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.960
But in fact, the workforce today
has access to many resources

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.780
that make it easier for
them to learn new skills

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.600
and to move on the labor market.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.570
So it's a risk that
used to be critical,

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.820
but that is not
critical anymore today.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.870
On the other hand,
there are risks

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.300
that weren't that critical
in the past that are

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.920
becoming more critical today.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.550
And I think that
the next frontier

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:44.930
when it comes to covering
risks is the housing market.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.380
So we're in San Francisco,
so you obviously

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:52.120
know that prices
go up constantly,

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.910
makes it difficult for
people to afford housing.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.430
It makes it difficult for
people who are not here

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.880
to move here to seize the
many opportunities that

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.510
are provided by a vibrant
economy like the one in San

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.870
Francisco.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.180
And this is typical
of a risk that

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.060
wasn't that critical
in the past,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.110
because in the past, in an
economy dominated by factories,

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:19.660
most people lived in suburban
areas, and in suburban areas,

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.550
land is cheap.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.840
So there wasn't that tension
on the housing market

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.340
that exists today,
because today,

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.430
most jobs, more and more jobs,
more and more opportunities

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.230
are located in large cities.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:36.370
And that's why most workers
are flocking into those cities

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.880
and trying to afford
housing, and because we

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:46.150
don't build enough, and because
most regulations on the housing

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.200
market are obsolete,
because we didn't design

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.510
the right institutions
to make for a more

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.300
welcoming urban housing
market for workers.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.660
Well, a lot of people
cannot afford housing,

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.280
where there are jobs and
opportunities for them.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.030
So this is typical
of a risk that

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.980
wasn't that critical
in the past,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.650
but it is becoming more
critical as the economy becomes

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.610
more urban, and that
calls for designing

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.860
a new kind of social
insurance to cover people

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.100
against the risks of not
being able to afford housing,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.010
where there are jobs and
opportunities for them.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.630
So that's for social insurance.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.720
Now, let's move to
the financial system.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.230
The financial system, the
legacy financial system

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.800
and the part that we're
interested in here

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.190
that is consumer finance
is obsolete as well,

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.590
because it provides
us with capital

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:43.760
to invest in assets that are
not that critical anymore.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.250
So for instance, it
makes it quite easy--

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.560
the financial system
makes it easy to buy

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.350
a house in suburban areas.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.860
But today, as I mentioned, most
jobs in the digital economy

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.400
are located in cities.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.730
So you're not interested
in the mortgage

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.870
that makes it possible for you
to buy a house in suburbia.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.150
You want to live in
the city, and no bank

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.350
will be able to lend you
the money to do that.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.140
Another other thing that's
even less critical is the car.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.320
So there are many cars here
parked near those houses.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.010
And when you lived
in suburban areas,

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.540
it was critical to own a car.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.190
But most people living in cities
today know that owning a car

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:31.360
is more a problem than a
solution in your everyday life,

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.550
because it costs a lot of money.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.390
You don't know where to park it.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:42.110
There's congestion on
the roads, et cetera.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:47.110
So you prefer to rely on public
transit or ride hailing or car

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.500
sharing or other solutions,
and owning a car is not

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.360
that critical anymore.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.650
But on the other
hand, there are things

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.580
that we'd like to invest in
today that the banking system

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.670
and consumer finance
don't provide capital for,

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.050
like switching jobs.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.510
In our more
entrepreneurial economy,

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.560
we have to hop from job
to job far more often

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.130
than in the past.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.870
But switching job is not
only like, I quit my job,

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.490
and I find another one.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.090
In many cases, it's about
taking some time off

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.400
to reflect on what
I'd like to do, maybe

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.320
learning new skills on YouTube
or in learning communities,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.750
and then maybe move
to another city.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.240
But if you have a family, you
need to bring your spouse,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.050
and your spouse needs to
find a new job as well.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.870
And then you need
to bring your kids,

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.010
and your kids need to
move to a new school.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:48.080
So all in all, it costs a
lot of money, switching jobs.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.190
But if you go to a bank,
and you say to your banker,

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:54.940
I'd like to switch job, and I'd
like you to lend me some money

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.240
to cover the costs of doing
that, they won't lend you

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.880
the money, because we
never created something

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.730
equivalent to Fannie
Mae or Freddie Mac,

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.210
but to provide people with
capital to switch jobs.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.900
And so that's typical of an
ill-designed financial system

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.580
when it comes to
today's economy.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.960
The other reason why the
financial system is obsolete

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.270
today is because
it's overstretched.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.950
So it all led us--

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.440
this is a woman
protesting Wall Street

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.190
right after the financial
crisis 10 years ago.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.110
And the financial
crisis can very much

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.690
be read as the
result of relying too

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.970
much on the financial
system to provide people

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.430
with capital and
economic security

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.800
at the expense of
the other pillars.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.960
So we've neglected
social insurance

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.930
by not funding it
and upgrading it.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.350
We've neglected unions that
are being basically wiped out

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.990
of the map, and
we've relied too much

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:54.550
on only one pillar out of the
three, the financial system,

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.560
to provide economic
security to people.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.320
And this is why the burden
became too heavy for the system

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:07.600
to support, and it all
collapsed in 2008, leading us

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.210
into the Great Recession.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.190
Finally, while
unions are obsolete,

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:18.250
but for obvious reasons,
they're defending jobs

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:21.250
that mostly don't
exist anymore, or that

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:26.560
are the minority on
today's labor market.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.890
Their preferred means
of action, like going

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.640
on strike, also obsolete,
considering what

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.130
the economy is about today.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:41.710
Their strongholds are all
legacy exhausted industries,

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:45.290
as opposed to new industries
and thriving industries.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:49.000
And so trade unions,
as they are today,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.480
have a hard time staying
relevant for workers.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.110
So all in all,
it's all obsolete.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.680
But to understand how we
can upgrade that safety net

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.960
and move from Great Safety Net
1.0 to Great Safety Net 2.0,

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.930
so there is a lot
about that in the book.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:12.130
I've been trying in the book to
explain what the new economy is

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.670
about, how do we create
value in the new economy,

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.580
how production,
consumption, work,

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.030
relationships between
individuals and organizations

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.410
have changed.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.630
But because I
don't have the time

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.610
to share everything
that's in the book today,

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.790
I'd like to focus on one
framework that's in the book,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.570
and this is the framework
of hunters and settlers.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:40.150
And it's one very important way
in which our world has changed

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.300
through the paradigm shift
from the '40s economy

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.190
to today's digital economy.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:51.040
So in the past, the economy
was dominated by settlers.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.930
And the reason for that is that
at the center of the economy,

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.940
the most critical
part of the economy

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.660
was large, industrial
corporations.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:09.440
And those corporations were
so strong and so resilient

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:17.380
and also very rigid as a result
of that, but that they could

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.740
basically survive over
the course of decades

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.990
without having to invent
themselves too much.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.990
And so because they
provided the stability,

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.360
everyone wanted to work
for those corporations.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.590
That's where you had the highest
wages, the more benefits,

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.050
the more economic security.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.820
And because those
corporations were

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.970
about large factories or
large office buildings,

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.400
you could really
settle around them,

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.280
like I'm going to work
for this employer,

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.560
I'm going to buy a
house nearby, I'm

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.990
going to find a school for my
kids nearby, and that's it.

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.970
I'm settled.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.920
My life is settled.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.930
I'm going to have
that job for life

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.070
and have a career with
the same employer.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.910
And at the margin
of the economy were

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:04.330
the hunters, the ones who were
moving constantly from one city

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.770
to another, from
one job to another,

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:08.770
from one industry to another.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:13.870
And so most hunters were like
students trying new jobs,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.540
while still attending
a university

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:23.050
or migrants, or were at the high
end of the hunting way of life

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:28.030
were the people taking planes,
moving from five star hotel

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.030
to five star hotel, because
they worked in consulting

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.300
or finance or other things.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.230
But that's very much how
the economy was organized.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.090
So at the center were
the large corporations.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.850
Around them were the
settlers, and then

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.490
at the margin of the
economy were the hunters.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.490
And the institutions
that we had at the time

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.500
were extremely
rewarding for settlers,

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.150
because that was the norm.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.490
That was the
preferred way of life.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.820
Today, the economy has
been turned upside down.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.620
And so I won't go
into the details,

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.830
but I'm happy to discuss that
if we have time for questions.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.880
But one key idea
that's in the book

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.210
is that the large
corporations have

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:16.520
been replaced as the
center of the economy

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:21.160
by networked individuals.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:27.210
I think that the most important
player in today's economy

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.925
is not the large
companies anymore.

00:28:29.925 --> 00:28:33.180
It's we individuals,
because we are more equipped

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.800
with powerful computing
devices, and we're all connected

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.810
together through networks.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.750
And that provides us
with a lot of power

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:53.400
and the organizations that
dominate today's economy are

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.250
precisely the ones
that have realized

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.810
there is no more power
in networked individuals,

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.340
and that have been deploying
their operations, so

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.140
has to harness that power
vested in networked individuals.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.790
But because networked
individuals--

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:16.020
well, there's not the stability
that existed with large '40s

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.530
corporations anymore.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:22.260
It's a network, so
it's constantly moving,

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.580
displaced, fragmented,
reorganized.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.580
And people connected
through those networks

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.840
are more impatient.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.490
They want to be served
faster with better

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.680
services at a cheaper price.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.560
And so to be able to
compete in that economy,

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.700
you need to be ready
to be entrepreneurial,

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.860
and that's the key thing
that's-- by the way,

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.370
that's the reason why I've
decided to call the new

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.090
economy, the
Entrepreneurial Age.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.180
That's not because I think
we all become entrepreneurs

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.110
in that economy.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.140
It's because I'm
convinced that we'll all

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.510
work for more
entrepreneurial firms,

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.420
firms that will
design themselves,

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:11.290
so as to be able to
constantly innovate, so as

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:16.520
to better serve that multitude
of connected individuals.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.450
And so when the economy is
about connected individuals,

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:23.590
networked individuals,
suddenly the hunters, those

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:29.440
who are ready to hop from job
to job to seize opportunities,

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.750
to come up with new
ideas, to be more

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.210
entrepreneurial in
their working life,

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:38.140
are rewarded, because they're
the best able to interact

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.450
with that very
important group that

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.730
is now at the center
of our economy,

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.500
the networked individuals.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.100
And so this is why the economy
is now turned upside down.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.280
It's because at the center
are the networked individuals.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.040
Then the most critical
part of the workforce

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.700
is now the hunters, people that
are moving from opportunity

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.530
to opportunity
that are flexible,

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:05.050
that are able to rebound in an
economy that's more unstable,

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.180
because it's more
entrepreneurial.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.600
And so the settlers, those who
really want it to stay in place

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.840
and to keep the same job and
to live in the same house,

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.280
are now at the margin,
suffering, because they're not

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.400
able to seize those
opportunities provided

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.620
by this more
entrepreneurial economy.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.420
So that's the framework
I've been using.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.540
And I think it's important
to have that in mind,

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:33.310
because it helps us realize how
we should revisit and reinvent

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.640
the various pillars
of the safety net.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.770
And so as you go
back through those,

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:42.310
realizing that at the
center of the economy

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.900
it's not factory
workers anymore,

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.480
but it's networked
individuals, you

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.810
need to revisit every
pillar and to realize

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.690
that they should be
redesigned to better serve

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:58.210
the needs of hunters in an
economy driven by computing

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:00.050
and networks.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.510
So what about social insurance?

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.230
Well, social insurance
should cover us

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:08.620
against the risks
that are associated

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.280
with the hunting way of life.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.390
And I think, again, that
housing, urban housing

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.370
is the new frontier here.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.760
We really need new
institutions to make

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.820
it possible for people
hunting from job to job

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.770
to afford housing
where there are jobs

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.530
and opportunities for them.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.770
The financial system should
provide us with capital

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.350
to become better hunters.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.900
Today it provides us with
capital to buy a house

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.500
or to buy your car, which
is not about hunting at all.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.200
It should provide
us with capital

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.950
for whenever we want to
switch job, to switch careers,

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:48.790
or to move from one
city to another, capital

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.560
to take time off,
to learn new skills,

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.700
to move your entire family
from one city to another.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.210
And this means that we
should invent something

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.720
like Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, but to provide capital

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.930
for hunters, rather
than settlers.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.750
And finally the
trade unions, well,

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.760
imagine if the trade
unions, instead

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.430
of defending workers,
where they are

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:17.530
and trying to support
them as settlers,

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:22.060
became platforms to have
workers rebound from job to job

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.550
and to leave the industries
and the companies

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:28.150
that we treat them badly,
to join other industries,

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.550
where they can find better
jobs, better opportunities.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.840
It's a very different
kind of union.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.690
It's not the same as the
industrial unions that

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.110
dominated the '40s economy, but
it wouldn't be the first time

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:44.320
that trade unions or
worker organizations

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.250
reinvent themselves to
account for a paradigm shift.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.750
And so this is what we
should keep in mind.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.260
So now, the reason--

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.640
so I said that my
book was written

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.650
to address an American
audience, but it particularly

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:04.290
addresses a segment
of that audience

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.770
and that is people working
in the US tech industry.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:13.920
So entrepreneurs, tech
employees, tech investors,

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:19.230
and that's because I think
entrepreneurs can really

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:23.040
make a difference in discovering
the institutions that together

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.679
form the new safety net.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:28.380
They're already at work doing
that because entrepreneurs

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.929
and tech companies
in general are

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:34.860
master of the art of solving
problems by using technology

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.750
and coming up with
innovative solutions.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:42.900
And so I've made a
list-- so I'm constantly

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.630
updating the list of the many
startups that, in my view,

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:52.350
are working hard as we speak
at designing the new safety net

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.409
or discovering new solutions
that maybe at some point

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:58.380
could scale up and form
the new safety net.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:02.010
So Lambda School
is a startup that

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.500
provide people with
the opportunity

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.050
to learn new skills, code.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:13.810
And in exchange for a fraction
of their future income,

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:15.540
if they find a job.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.860
So I position them here
between the financial system

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.510
and trade unions because
they're effectively

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.660
a financial institution.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.600
They provide you with the
money to learn new skills

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.410
and you can pay them back later.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.730
But they're also a bit
like a trade union,

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:36.570
because they have these very
strong community of people

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:40.020
learning to code together,
and they provide them

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.110
with the support they
need to find job,

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.140
and they have a clear interest
in you finding the best paying

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.140
job, because, again,
they're rewarded

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.200
with a fraction of your income.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.320
So that's an example.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.550
Another example is
Earnin, so it's a startup

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:03.870
that that's helping gig
workers and freelancers even

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:10.680
their income, and
employees be paid earlier

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.950
without having to wait for their
paycheck at the end of the week

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.680
or the end of the month.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.100
Safety Wing is a startup that
provides insurance products

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.740
for digital nomads.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.160
You have many startups
in the real estate space,

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.120
like Point or DV Homes.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.660
You have Trupo, which
provides freelancers

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.870
with disability insurance.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:42.780
You have Landed, which
is trying to help people

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.510
that they are not paid as
much as tech engineers,

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:49.980
like teachers, nurses, and so on
to find housing where they are

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.910
needed, et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:55.020
So Oscar is active
in the health space,

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.140
and there are many others.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.800
So what I really
wanted to stress here

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.250
is that it's not only
about the government.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.280
It's about all of us together.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.020
We're all in that ultra
running race together,

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.320
and people that are
interested in tech

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.460
and that have already
succeeded in tech

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.120
should pay more attention to the
institutional part of the race,

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.530
and people that are involved
in policy and regulations

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.500
and government should
pay more attention

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.810
to what is happening
in the tech world,

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.980
and we should all
share that knowledge

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.110
to be able to run
that race together.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:39.520
So I think it's important, and
I think it's urgent, by the way.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.190
So my book was
published last year.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.190
I think, today, it's even more
relevant for many reasons.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:51.600
So we're moving forward to
the next presidential election

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.530
here in the US.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:55.620
So there's already a lot
of conversations going on

00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:02.580
about what the new policy should
be regarding the tech industry,

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.220
but how to upgrade the
social contract as well.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.890
There's the rise of China.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.980
And China, in many ways, is
inventing their own version

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.530
of the great safety net
2.0, because they're already

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.077
succeeding in the
digital economy,

00:38:16.077 --> 00:38:17.910
and they really need
to provide their people

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:22.320
with stability and balance
and inclusiveness and so on.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.830
There's Brexit.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.430
There's populism all around
the world, et cetera.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.930
So this is a picture
of Karl Polanyi, who

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:35.520
was an economic historian, known
for one book called "The Great

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.350
Transformation,"
which was published

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.890
in 1944, the last century.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.280
And it's a book
that explains why

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:49.800
the shift to the '40s paradigm
early in the 20th century

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.550
led to the rise of fascism and
ultimately to World War II.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.820
And it's because there was a
mismatch in many countries--

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.350
not the US, because the
US had the New Deal,

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.590
but in many other
countries, especially

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.660
in Europe, there was a
mismatch between what

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:08.460
the new economy was about, the
new risks to which people were

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.610
exposed, the new
problems that they

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.360
encounter in their daily life.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.130
And there was a mismatch
with the institutions.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:19.920
The institutions couldn't
provide people with the support

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.590
and stability that they
needed, and it all led

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:25.800
to a lot of pain,
suffering, anger,

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.790
and ultimately to
the rise of fascism.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:30.270
So I think it's an
urgent discussion.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:33.120
It's even more urgent today.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.010
We're still in the
race to make the West--

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.040
what it used to be, that is,
the most advanced and the most

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.820
inclusive and the most
sustainable economy on Earth.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.340
And I think we should--

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.280
remember that runner I
talked about at the beginning

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:51.940
of my talk--

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:57.580
I think what we should have in
mind is that it's a relay race.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.000
It's a race where we have
to pass the baton many times

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.810
from people who know technology,
to people who know policy,

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.520
to people that are
ready to bridge

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.590
the gap between
those two worlds,

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:12.230
and my book, in many ways, is
a map for you to run that race,

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:16.090
so I invite you to have a look
at it, especially if you work

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:19.750
in tech as an employee, an
entrepreneur, or an investor,

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.870
and participate in that race
to help us win it together.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.870
Thank you, and I have time for
questions if you have those.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.195
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:30.195 --> 00:40:31.820
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for your talk.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.580
My name is Dash.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:43.540
So I am kind of leaning on
your question around settlers

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.370
and hunters.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:47.707
I found it interesting that
you had technology companies

00:40:47.707 --> 00:40:49.540
on the periphery, and
I was wondering if you

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.940
could speak more to that.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.340
This is not an
egoistic question,

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.040
knowing that we're
here at Google.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.250
It seems as if the
framework that you provided

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.880
has tech companies
at the center,

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:08.480
and center in the way of
empowering this kind of mesh

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.790
network of people.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:14.680
And so that's definitely
a positive centering

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.570
for tech companies,
but we're also

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.240
seeing a negative centering
of tech companies.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.620
[INAUDIBLE] and by that I
mean, yes, I can be networked.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.960
But if I'm networked
in the sharing economy,

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.720
so I have a mobile phone, but
let's say I'm an Uber driver,

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.680
and I don't have--

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.740
yes, I have access to
information to switch jobs,

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.950
my current status in
life doesn't allow me

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.090
that kind of the exit
power to do that.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:40.660
And so could you speak
a little bit more

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.220
to why you believe tech
companies are on the periphery

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.240
and maybe speak
a little bit more

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.950
nuanced in terms
of whether that's

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:53.290
a good thing or a bad thing,
should it be regulated,

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:57.310
should there be more
inroads between the kind

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:59.860
of the big tech companies
and new upstarts that

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.100
are trying to provide new
institutions to empower

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.690
more people?

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:08.860
NICOLAS COLIN: So what I
think to try and reformulate

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:14.500
what I said before is
the to be at the center

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.850
of this new economy or as close
to the center as possible,

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:21.130
you need to be entrepreneurial.

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:22.750
And being
entrepreneurial doesn't

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:24.970
mean being a tiny startup.

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:28.480
You can be entrepreneurial
in a large organization.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.220
But being entrepreneurial
means that you

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:35.590
need to be ready to evolve
at the pace of the multitude

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:38.410
of networked individuals,
because, again, they're

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:43.450
constantly demanding better
products at a cheaper price.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:45.340
They want to be served faster.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:51.260
They want new features,
new bundles, new services,

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.100
et cetera.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.180
And you can only afford
being close to them

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.750
if you you're able
to deliver that.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.580
And so that's why the
economy is becoming

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.090
more and more entrepreneurial.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.870
It's because most
large organizations

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:11.020
have a hard time serving
that multitude of demanding

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.000
networked individuals.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.250
And so I have a
few cases in mind.

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:21.070
I think a company like Amazon
has done a great job scaling

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.290
up, while retaining
that capacity

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:26.650
to constantly innovate and to
question its business model

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:29.170
and to reinvent
itself, or expand

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:34.900
on to new markets
on a constant basis.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:39.670
But the danger that large
organizations are exposed to

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:45.700
is that as they become larger,
they embark a lot of rigidity

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:52.390
and a lot of processes,
and they become complacent,

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.690
and they have difficulties to
change to expand, to explore

00:43:55.690 --> 00:44:00.920
new territories, to learn
from their failures and so on.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.520
And so I think that's the
challenge that every large tech

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.920
company has to tackle.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.830
Do they want to remain
close to the center?

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:11.620
And for that, they need to
be more entrepreneurial.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.050
Or if they're not
entrepreneurial enough,

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:16.270
they'll have the stability
and the security that

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:19.930
comes with many assets,
a strong balance sheet

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:23.590
and employing many
people, but they also

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:27.580
have the rigidity
that makes them

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:32.580
less relevant to the networked
individuals at the center.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:36.930
And so I think that it's a good
thing that tech companies are

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.140
moving toward the center,
because at the center,

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:45.970
you basically submit to what
networked individuals want.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:50.170
And so it's an entirely
different field of discussion,

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:52.800
like antitrust and
breaking up tech companies

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.350
and stuff like that.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:57.600
But I think that the
networked individuals are now

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:03.570
strong enough to make sure that
the companies that sell them

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.700
act in their best interests.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:09.000
And what is lacking is
only the institutions

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
to make it possible to provide
those people with stability,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.310
security, and the
capacity to exit.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:17.340
So you mentioned
those Uber drivers.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.020
They're very close
to the center.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.590
They're serving demanding
networked individuals.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:24.600
They're also networked
themselves, as drivers,

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.760
as a company.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:31.620
But they don't have the
safety net that provides them

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:34.800
with the stability and the
security and the support

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.250
that they need to make the
most of their current situation

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:42.330
and maybe rebound to
more rewarding positions

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:43.420
in the economy.

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.990
So this is why we need to
invent this new safety net.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:51.960
It's simply to acknowledge
that the workforce has moved

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.710
from factories to urban
proximity services

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:59.130
and to provide those--

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:01.260
what's now the majority
of the workforce, that

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.740
is proximity service
workers, with the support

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.600
they need to become
the new middle class.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.406
This is really
what's at stake here.

00:46:10.406 --> 00:46:12.450
AUDIENCE: I had a question
regarding your book.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.310
You began your book
with a personal anecdote

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:16.477
about when you were summoned
to court for an alleged

00:46:16.477 --> 00:46:19.080
defamation against a leading
figure in the French taxi

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.130
industry.

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.825
Do instances like
this make you feel

00:46:21.825 --> 00:46:23.700
that corporations are,
in fact, trying to put

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.185
a stop on those innovations?

00:46:27.185 --> 00:46:28.310
NICOLAS COLIN: So I think--

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:33.050
well, yes, so there's
this anecdote,

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:35.090
which dates back
like six years ago,

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.720
when we founded
our firm in Paris.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.120
At exactly the same
time, I wrote a blog post

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.830
that it put online criticizing
the CEO of the largest taxi

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:49.790
company in Paris because
he was introducing himself

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:52.790
in videos and interviews as--

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:55.070
well, the king of
innovation, if you will,

00:46:55.070 --> 00:47:00.620
explaining how his taxi
company was innovating so much.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:05.070
And what I wrote was
that in these interviews,

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:07.580
there was a deep
misunderstanding

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.630
of what innovation was about.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:12.700
And if we relied on such
people to innovate, well,

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:16.580
we as a country, France
and Europe, in general,

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:20.410
will keep on lagging
behind the US and China.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.690
And so he didn't like my blog
post and sued me in court,

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:25.220
and I was cleared later.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:29.420
So that ended up OK.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:34.370
But I introduced the
book with this anecdote

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:39.110
to try and share with
an American audience

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:42.110
what it's like to work
in tech in Europe.

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:47.600
Again, we don't have large tech
companies, like you have here.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.300
But we have many startups
and many entrepreneurs

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:54.270
that realize that you can use
technology in an innovative way

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:58.590
and tackle problems that were
previously without a solution.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.260
The problem is that
those entrepreneurs

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:05.030
have to battle against
powerful incumbents that

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:11.150
have everything to lose
with the economy changing.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:13.820
They don't want those startups
entering their markets.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:17.390
They don't want the value chain
to be redesigned according

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.640
to the needs of
networked individuals,

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.390
and they want regulations to
preserve the status quo as

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:25.730
opposed to lifting everyone up.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:29.210
And so in Europe, we have to--

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:30.900
so you have that in the US.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.160
But it's rather new.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.820
It's called the backlash
against technology.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:40.190
And tech companies have been
adapting the past two years

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:43.940
to that new context in
which they encounter

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:47.030
hostility from
basically everyone

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:50.150
from every part of the
political spectrum and so on.

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:53.240
This is new in the US,
but in Europe, it's

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.540
always been like that.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:58.400
And so we who work
in tech in Europe,

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:02.750
we're used to battling
against a hostile environment

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:05.360
and to force
innovation, not only

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.950
by building great
startups that eventually

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:17.870
become great companies, but also
by sharing that narrative that

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:20.720
basically conveys the
message that startups are not

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.030
only about disruption
and destruction

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.020
and invading your
privacy and destroy jobs.

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:29.540
No, startups are the vanguard
of a new world, which

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:33.440
will reward all of us
with sustainability

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.730
and inclusiveness if we run
the two parts of the race.

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:41.540
The first part, again, that
is building great companies,

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.980
thriving companies.

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:47.480
And the part is parties
inventing new institutions.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.070
AUDIENCE: Quick question
that I am constantly

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:53.840
struggling is how you see the
paradox of having institutions

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.860
that need to regulate the tech
industry that is moving so

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:02.000
fast, and you have institutions
that take a long time

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.130
to make a decision?

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:05.630
NICOLAS COLIN: It's
a good question,

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:13.200
because one of the features
of the '40s economy

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.660
was that it was a
very stable economy.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:19.020
The only thing that was
unstable was consumer demand.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.680
And the Great Safety
Net 1.0 was precisely

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:26.400
designed to provide
stability on consumer markets

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.500
to make it possible
for industrialists

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:32.640
to invest, to plan ahead and
to invest over the long term,

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.430
because they could,
thanks to the safety net,

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:37.020
and the stability
and the security

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:40.260
that it provided
to everyone, well,

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.560
they could count on sustained
consumer demand over the course

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.600
of years or decades.

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:54.190
Today-- so we had stability on
the production side or supply

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:57.400
side and instability
on the demand side.

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:00.610
And the economy
became more stable

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:03.910
because we corrected the
instability on the demand side

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:08.260
by building new institutions.

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:11.410
Today, the problem we have
is that there's instability

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:14.500
everywhere, like the
supply side is unstable,

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.960
because of increasing returns
to scale and network effects.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.600
The demand side
is still unstable,

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.580
because people are
changing constantly

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.910
and want new products
and new services

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:27.010
and have new ideas constantly.

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:29.260
So how do you provide
stability in such an economy,

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.140
and how do you design
stable institutions

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:36.380
that pass the test of time?

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.510
I don't know actually.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:40.990
This is why we really
need to run that race

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:44.280
and to enter the
discovery process.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.410
And that goes through trials
and errors and errors and errors

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:51.420
before we finally
discover what works.

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:55.400
But what I am convinced
of is that you

00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:00.380
can design institutions
for an unstable economy

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.930
with the goal of
providing stability.

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:12.330
So there's this concept by
Nassim Taleb called antifragile

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:16.380
And so antifragile
is not robust.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:20.450
It's how do you survive in
a world that's constantly

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:25.070
changing in which you have to
reinvent yourself and rebound

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:28.760
and get back on your
feet throughout many ups

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.110
and downs and booms and busts.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:34.070
And so it's an
interesting concept,

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:36.800
because this is really
what's at stake here.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.230
We need to design
institutions that

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:43.470
will provide the
stability that's

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:47.650
missing in an economy dominated
by computing and networks.

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:52.030
And maybe those institutions--
so that one part of the book

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:54.250
discusses the
relevance of the state.

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:57.820
Like, the last time, stability
was provided by the state,

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:03.190
because the state was the
largest top down organizations

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:05.560
there was in a given country.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:11.890
And so how could you
regulate the '40s economy

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:15.070
that was dominated by large
top down organizations

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:18.280
by inviting the largest
of those organizations

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:23.920
to enact the rules and to
watch over the various players.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:30.520
Today, I'm not certain the
state is the player that's

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.900
able to deliver that.

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.880
Maybe the new
institutions will be

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:41.700
designed by a complex nexus
of different organizations,

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:45.900
acting like platforms, so
individuals themselves,

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:51.150
the new unions, tech
companies, and governments

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:58.320
all together will design
that process of upgrading

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.970
institutions to account
for the fast pace of change

00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:04.720
in the economy.

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.270
It's not a top down approach.

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:08.850
In an economy dominated
by networked individuals,

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:12.570
you can't regulate that economy
with a top down approach.

00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:16.380
And that's very much
the problem we have

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.450
on both sides of the Atlantic.

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:21.270
So in Europe, we
don't really get that.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:26.230
So we're trying to do what
we did so well the last time.

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:30.120
That is, have the state
come up with regulations

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:34.230
imposed from the top down,
and it will provide balance.

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:36.930
Here in the US, you have
a better understanding

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:39.060
of what's going on,
but the government

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.990
is still far removed
from the tech industry

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:46.920
and doesn't interact
enough with that industry

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:52.380
to realize that maybe the top
down approaches at enacting

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:55.470
regulations don't work anymore.

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:57.840
So there's a lot of work to do.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.410
And again, keep in mind
that that kind of work

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.090
is not only done
here in the West.

00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:06.990
It's also done in China,
in Southeast Asia,

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:10.600
and maybe they'll come up
with new designs before we do,

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.070
and they'll invent their own
version of the safety net,

00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:21.000
and they'll race ahead
towards economic development

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.560
while we in the West
will be lagging behind.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.220
So that's very much
what's at stake here.

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:28.980
SPEAKER 1: All right, with that,
let's thank him one more time.

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:32.330
