00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.937
- You know one of my favorite
inspirational quotes is

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:05.738
you can't take the
elevator to success,

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:07.406
you have to take the stairs.

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:08.241
And so.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.711
Watch out success, here I come.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.412
FYI, I'm legally
obligated to tell you

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.381
that I am in no way a
certified life coach

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:17.216
but I plan on taking
night classes soon.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:18.284
Woo hoo!

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.719
(laughs)

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.020
Look at this.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.522
(laughs)

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.423
It's gonna take this lady a
long time to find success.

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:26.725
Maybe she should
take the elevator.

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:28.228
- I'm 78 ass hole.

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:30.396
- Hah.

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:31.931
Gotta take any
opportunity you can

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.465
to get a good butt blast.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:36.102
(upbeat music)
One, two, three.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:36.936
(breathing heavily)

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.405
Somebody say quick feet?

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:40.740
Woo hoo.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.574
Five, six,

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:43.743
one handed.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:45.745
(gasps)

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.084
Seven.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.751
Wah, yes baby.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.253
Well it's been a great warm up

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.489
but I'm sure ready to get the
real workout started, right?

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.957
(screams)

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.592
Ah, oh that's bone.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.827
Hey guys.

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:04.097
Had a minor accident.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.264
But hey guess what?

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:06.566
Like my mom said
when I was born,

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.934
there are no accidents.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.101
Just challenges.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.102
(groans)

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:12.071
So, full speed ahead.

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.272
Oh, excuse me sir.

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.674
How much further
is it to the top?

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:17.610
- Ma'am, you're bleeding, gross.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.779
- Why'd he call me ma'am?

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.013
(groans)

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:23.449
A lot of people
take breaks, but,

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:25.417
sometimes life doesn't
allow for breaks.

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:26.586
(breathes heavily)

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.787
I'm just gonna
take a quick break.

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.188
I've got athletically
induced asthma and

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.956
(breathes heavily)

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.758
I ate Mexican pizza for lunch.

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:35.627
(groans)

00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:38.197
I mean just look at this view.

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:39.032
So chill.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.836
(breathes heavily)

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.473
(groans)

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:48.708
Ow.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.310
- Move it you little twit.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.780
- This is your Snapchat
life coach Molly Hawkey,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.683
reminding you to never give up.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:57.516
(upbeat music)

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:58.518
Just stay...

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.154
Hashtag blessed.
