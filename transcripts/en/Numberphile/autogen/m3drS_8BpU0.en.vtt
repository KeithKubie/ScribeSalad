00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
so today I want to tell you about the

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620
so today I want to tell you about the
 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.039
so today I want to tell you about the
pancake number which is among the most

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049
pancake number which is among the most
 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.320
pancake number which is among the most
ridiculously named numbers in maths but

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
ridiculously named numbers in maths but
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.540
ridiculously named numbers in maths but
it is technically to do with pancakes or

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550
it is technically to do with pancakes or
 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.009
it is technically to do with pancakes or
at least pancakes are one nice way to

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
at least pancakes are one nice way to
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.450
at least pancakes are one nice way to
explain what this number is we have a

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
explain what this number is we have a
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.700
explain what this number is we have a
pan full of pancakes here and the idea

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
pan full of pancakes here and the idea
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.839
pan full of pancakes here and the idea
where this is they're not all the same

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
where this is they're not all the same
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.700
where this is they're not all the same
size so have five different sizes of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
size so have five different sizes of
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.439
size so have five different sizes of
pancake and we also have a very

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449
pancake and we also have a very
 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.750
pancake and we also have a very
inconsiderate chef who makes pancakes

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760
inconsiderate chef who makes pancakes
 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.700
inconsiderate chef who makes pancakes
all different sizes and then serve them

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
all different sizes and then serve them
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.000
all different sizes and then serve them
up in the wrong order because I'm sure

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
up in the wrong order because I'm sure
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.170
up in the wrong order because I'm sure
you'll agree if you've got a stack of

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
you'll agree if you've got a stack of
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.670
you'll agree if you've got a stack of
pancakes of all different sizes the most

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
pancakes of all different sizes the most
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560
pancakes of all different sizes the most
satisfying way is to have them in

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570
satisfying way is to have them in
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.999
satisfying way is to have them in
decreasing order of size with the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
decreasing order of size with the
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.170
decreasing order of size with the
smallest one at the top and the biggest

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
smallest one at the top and the biggest
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.490
smallest one at the top and the biggest
one at the bottom so we need to try and

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
one at the bottom so we need to try and
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.139
one at the bottom so we need to try and
get this stack of pancakes back into

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149
get this stack of pancakes back into
 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.639
get this stack of pancakes back into
order so I stick out a plate I'll use my

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
order so I stick out a plate I'll use my
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.880
order so I stick out a plate I'll use my
pancake flipper yep so stick that on a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
pancake flipper yep so stick that on a
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.490
pancake flipper yep so stick that on a
plate so the question now is how do we

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
plate so the question now is how do we
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.170
plate so the question now is how do we
put these pancakes back into the right

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
put these pancakes back into the right
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940
put these pancakes back into the right
order there is a rule about how I'm

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950
order there is a rule about how I'm
 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.350
order there is a rule about how I'm
allowed to shuffle these around I'm

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
allowed to shuffle these around I'm
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.970
allowed to shuffle these around I'm
allowed to take the top section of

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
allowed to take the top section of
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.010
allowed to take the top section of
pancakes and turn it over and that's all

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
pancakes and turn it over and that's all
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.350
pancakes and turn it over and that's all
I can do so in this case and what do I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
I can do so in this case and what do I
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.819
I can do so in this case and what do I
want to do I want to flip maybe the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
want to do I want to flip maybe the
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.740
want to do I want to flip maybe the
whole thing yeah I want to flip the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
whole thing yeah I want to flip the
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.779
whole thing yeah I want to flip the
whole thing no in fact first I'm gonna

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
whole thing no in fact first I'm gonna
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.729
whole thing no in fact first I'm gonna
flip these top two and the reason for

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
flip these top two and the reason for
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.950
flip these top two and the reason for
that will become apparent shortly so I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
that will become apparent shortly so I
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.130
that will become apparent shortly so I
do that so that's one flip and I'm now

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
do that so that's one flip and I'm now
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.200
do that so that's one flip and I'm now
gonna flip the whole thing there we go

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
gonna flip the whole thing there we go
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.120
gonna flip the whole thing there we go
and now I'm gonna flip

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
and now I'm gonna flip
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.940
and now I'm gonna flip
I shouldn't have flipped the top two

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950
I shouldn't have flipped the top two
 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.590
I shouldn't have flipped the top two
I'll figure this out eventually so I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
I'll figure this out eventually so I
 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.880
I'll figure this out eventually so I
flip those three that's three flips and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
flip those three that's three flips and
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.920
flip those three that's three flips and
now flip the whole thing again as four

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
now flip the whole thing again as four
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.520
now flip the whole thing again as four
flips

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
flips
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.069
flips
and if I hadn't flipped those top two at

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
and if I hadn't flipped those top two at
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.390
and if I hadn't flipped those top two at
the start I would have had not to do

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
the start I would have had not to do
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.640
the start I would have had not to do
this no but nevermind so that's five

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
this no but nevermind so that's five
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.310
this no but nevermind so that's five
flips which is fine because I know that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
flips which is fine because I know that
 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.380
flips which is fine because I know that
any stack of pancakes can be fixed in

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
any stack of pancakes can be fixed in
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690
any stack of pancakes can be fixed in
five or fewer flips this one I suspect

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700
five or fewer flips this one I suspect
 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.710
five or fewer flips this one I suspect
could have been in slightly for your

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
could have been in slightly for your
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080
could have been in slightly for your
five but in this case I've used exactly

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
five but in this case I've used exactly
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.760
five but in this case I've used exactly
five which is within the bound so that's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
five which is within the bound so that's
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.240
five which is within the bound so that's
fine

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
fine
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.639
fine
so any stack of five pancakes can be

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
so any stack of five pancakes can be
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.560
so any stack of five pancakes can be
done in five or fewer flips there

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
done in five or fewer flips there
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.240
done in five or fewer flips there
obviously some that well this is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
obviously some that well this is
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.740
obviously some that well this is
currently in the state where it needs a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
currently in the state where it needs a
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.840
currently in the state where it needs a
row flips but they're obviously some

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
row flips but they're obviously some
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.580
row flips but they're obviously some
that can be done in fewer than five and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
that can be done in fewer than five and
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590
that can be done in fewer than five and
the most you'll need for five pancakes

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
the most you'll need for five pancakes
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.969
the most you'll need for five pancakes
doing it in the most efficient possible

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979
doing it in the most efficient possible
 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.240
doing it in the most efficient possible
way is five so the pancake number four

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
way is five so the pancake number four
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.219
way is five so the pancake number four
five pancakes is their four five and

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
five pancakes is their four five and
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.869
five pancakes is their four five and
this works for any number of pancakes in

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
this works for any number of pancakes in
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.940
this works for any number of pancakes in
a stack so I can show you what happens

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
a stack so I can show you what happens
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.100
a stack so I can show you what happens
with three pancakes there are

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
with three pancakes there are
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.780
with three pancakes there are
six possible orderings for three

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790
six possible orderings for three
 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.490
six possible orderings for three
pancakes so I could have small medium

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500
pancakes so I could have small medium
 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500
pancakes so I could have small medium
large three at the bottom again but

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
large three at the bottom again but
 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.750
large three at the bottom again but
instead have two and then one two at the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
instead have two and then one two at the
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.720
instead have two and then one two at the
bottom then three then one like that one

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
bottom then three then one like that one
 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.340
bottom then three then one like that one
at the bottom and then two and then

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350
at the bottom and then two and then
 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.340
at the bottom and then two and then
three two at the bottom one three like

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350
three two at the bottom one three like
 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.710
three two at the bottom one three like
that and finally one at the bottom three

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720
that and finally one at the bottom three
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.660
that and finally one at the bottom three
and then two that gives me all six

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670
and then two that gives me all six
 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.970
and then two that gives me all six
possible orderings and for each one of

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980
possible orderings and for each one of
 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.770
possible orderings and for each one of
these I can work out how many flips I

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
these I can work out how many flips I
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.660
these I can work out how many flips I
need to get it back into the the sort of

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
need to get it back into the the sort of
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.820
need to get it back into the the sort of
standard correct way up so in this case

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830
standard correct way up so in this case
 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.980
standard correct way up so in this case
it's zero flips it's already there this

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990
it's zero flips it's already there this
 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.720
it's zero flips it's already there this
can be done in one which is just to flip

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730
can be done in one which is just to flip
 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.430
can be done in one which is just to flip
the whole thing this one can be done in

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440
the whole thing this one can be done in
 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.620
the whole thing this one can be done in
one flip this one if I flip those top

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630
one flip this one if I flip those top
 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.020
one flip this one if I flip those top
two and then flip the whole thing I'll

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030
two and then flip the whole thing I'll
 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.760
two and then flip the whole thing I'll
get back to sorting so I'm going to call

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770
get back to sorting so I'm going to call
 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.070
get back to sorting so I'm going to call
that one two flips this one if I flip

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080
that one two flips this one if I flip
 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.229
that one two flips this one if I flip
the whole thing and then flip those top

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239
the whole thing and then flip those top
 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.350
the whole thing and then flip those top
two around that'll be two flips and in

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360
two around that'll be two flips and in
 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.840
two around that'll be two flips and in
this case this is the most difficult one

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850
this case this is the most difficult one
 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.520
this case this is the most difficult one
because this can't be done in fewer than

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530
because this can't be done in fewer than
 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.550
because this can't be done in fewer than
three flips so I can do it in three and

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560
three flips so I can do it in three and
 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.170
three flips so I can do it in three and
I would maybe say flip the whole thing

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
I would maybe say flip the whole thing
 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.580
I would maybe say flip the whole thing
and then you flip the top two and they

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590
and then you flip the top two and they
 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.900
and then you flip the top two and they
look the whole thing but it can't be

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910
look the whole thing but it can't be
 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.280
look the whole thing but it can't be
done in fewer than three so for three

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290
done in fewer than three so for three
 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.760
done in fewer than three so for three
pancakes the pancake number is three yes

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770
pancakes the pancake number is three yes
 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.350
pancakes the pancake number is three yes
it does look a little bit patently so

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360
it does look a little bit patently so
 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.820
it does look a little bit patently so
for three it's three for four it's four

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830
for three it's three for four it's four
 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.280
for three it's three for four it's four
for five it's five after that it starts

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290
for five it's five after that it starts
 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.380
for five it's five after that it starts
to go on so every so often it goes up by

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390
to go on so every so often it goes up by
 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.060
to go on so every so often it goes up by
two instead of going up by one so it's

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070
two instead of going up by one so it's
 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.380
two instead of going up by one so it's
not quite always just the number of

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390
not quite always just the number of
 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.670
not quite always just the number of
pancakes that you've got but it is

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
pancakes that you've got but it is
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.650
pancakes that you've got but it is
actually something that people try and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660
actually something that people try and
 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.940
actually something that people try and
calculate they try and work out what is

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
calculate they try and work out what is
 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.310
calculate they try and work out what is
the pancake number for a given number of

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320
the pancake number for a given number of
 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.770
the pancake number for a given number of
pancakes and it's actually an ongoing

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
pancakes and it's actually an ongoing
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.590
pancakes and it's actually an ongoing
question because for 20 pancakes we

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600
question because for 20 pancakes we
 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.750
question because for 20 pancakes we
don't know what the pancake number is no

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760
don't know what the pancake number is no
 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.850
don't know what the pancake number is no
no it's it's an open question in maths

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860
no it's it's an open question in maths
 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.740
no it's it's an open question in maths
we don't actually have 20 or above we

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
we don't actually have 20 or above we
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.120
we don't actually have 20 or above we
don't actually really know that what the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130
don't actually really know that what the
 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.410
don't actually really know that what the
answer is to this and I guess it's

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420
answer is to this and I guess it's
 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.670
answer is to this and I guess it's
partly because it's just a massive

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680
partly because it's just a massive
 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.070
partly because it's just a massive
computation if you've got 20 pancakes in

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080
computation if you've got 20 pancakes in

computation if you've got 20 pancakes in
a stack the number of possible ways you

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850
a stack the number of possible ways you
 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.000
a stack the number of possible ways you
could order 20 pancakes in a stack is

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010
could order 20 pancakes in a stack is
 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.590
could order 20 pancakes in a stack is
massive for any given ordering the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600
massive for any given ordering the
 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.090

number of possible sets of flips you
 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.470
number of possible sets of flips you
could do it's even massive er you know

is the most efficient would take a lot

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140
is the most efficient would take a lot
 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.810
is the most efficient would take a lot
of computer time so no one's managed to

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820
of computer time so no one's managed to
 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.990
of computer time so no one's managed to
crack that yet for 19 it's 22 I think

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000
crack that yet for 19 it's 22 I think
 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.880
crack that yet for 19 it's 22 I think
something like that so yeah these we

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890
something like that so yeah these we
 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.069
something like that so yeah these we
know it's more than 22 and in fact we

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079
know it's more than 22 and in fact we
 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.849
know it's more than 22 and in fact we
know it's less than I think 35 and the

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859
know it's less than I think 35 and the
 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.830
know it's less than I think 35 and the
reason the person that we have to credit

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840
reason the person that we have to credit
 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.360
reason the person that we have to credit
with the the fact that we know it's less

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370
with the the fact that we know it's less
 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.950
with the the fact that we know it's less
than 35 is Bill Gates

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960
than 35 is Bill Gates
 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.439
than 35 is Bill Gates
so Bill Gates that the guy off of

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449
so Bill Gates that the guy off of
 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.540

Microsoft when he was at university in
 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.990
Microsoft when he was at university in
1979 when he was 24 he did a paper

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000
1979 when he was 24 he did a paper
 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.340
1979 when he was 24 he did a paper
unfortunately the paper wasn't called

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350
unfortunately the paper wasn't called
 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.680
unfortunately the paper wasn't called
like on the pancake number it was called

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690
like on the pancake number it was called
 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.170
like on the pancake number it was called
something like algorithms for prefix

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180
something like algorithms for prefix
 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.700
something like algorithms for prefix
reversals because that's the the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710
reversals because that's the the
 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.320
reversals because that's the the
technical computer science term for this

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330
technical computer science term for this
 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.820
technical computer science term for this
if you're taking the first section and

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830
if you're taking the first section and
 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.689
if you're taking the first section and
reversing it

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699
reversing it
 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.790
reversing it
that's a prefix reversal and his paper

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800
that's a prefix reversal and his paper
 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.590
that's a prefix reversal and his paper
they proved that there is an upper bound

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600
they proved that there is an upper bound
 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.659
they proved that there is an upper bound
for the pancake number four if you know

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669
for the pancake number four if you know
 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.159
for the pancake number four if you know
how many pancakes you've got what the

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169
how many pancakes you've got what the
 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.350
how many pancakes you've got what the
upper bound is for any pancakes so I

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360
upper bound is for any pancakes so I
 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.290
upper bound is for any pancakes so I
think for n pancakes they prove that

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300
think for n pancakes they prove that
 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.040
think for n pancakes they prove that
it's 5 n plus 5 over 3 which means that

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050
it's 5 n plus 5 over 3 which means that
 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.570
it's 5 n plus 5 over 3 which means that
for 20 pancakes it's 105 over 3 that

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580
for 20 pancakes it's 105 over 3 that
 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.400
for 20 pancakes it's 105 over 3 that
means it's 35 that is thanks to Bill

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410
means it's 35 that is thanks to Bill
 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.930
means it's 35 that is thanks to Bill
Gates since then they've actually worked

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940
Gates since then they've actually worked
 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.879
Gates since then they've actually worked
out a better upper bound for it that's

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889
out a better upper bound for it that's
 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.379
out a better upper bound for it that's
slightly nicer if they've now shown that

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389
slightly nicer if they've now shown that
 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.779
slightly nicer if they've now shown that
anything is less than 18 and over 11

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789
anything is less than 18 and over 11
 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.060
anything is less than 18 and over 11
which was found in 2009 which was

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070
which was found in 2009 which was
 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.070
which was found in 2009 which was
exactly 40 years later they managed to

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080
exactly 40 years later they managed to
 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.499
exactly 40 years later they managed to
improve on that bound so there is a way

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509
improve on that bound so there is a way
 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.870
improve on that bound so there is a way
that will always work for any given kind

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880
that will always work for any given kind
 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.730
that will always work for any given kind
of messed up stack of pancakes so the

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740
of messed up stack of pancakes so the
 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.860
of messed up stack of pancakes so the
trick is that you take whichever pancake

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870
trick is that you take whichever pancake
 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.899
trick is that you take whichever pancake
is the biggest pancake that's not

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909
is the biggest pancake that's not
 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:32.460
is the biggest pancake that's not
currently where it's supposed to be and

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470
currently where it's supposed to be and
 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.529
currently where it's supposed to be and
put it to the top and then I put that

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539
put it to the top and then I put that
 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.270
put it to the top and then I put that
one to where it's meant to be if you

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280
one to where it's meant to be if you
 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.800
one to where it's meant to be if you
keep repeating that so if now safe

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810
keep repeating that so if now safe
 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.450
keep repeating that so if now safe
pancake 3 wasn't in the right place you

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460
pancake 3 wasn't in the right place you
 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.830
pancake 3 wasn't in the right place you
do the same thing you put it to the top

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840
do the same thing you put it to the top
 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.300
do the same thing you put it to the top
and then each time you you're kind of

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310
and then each time you you're kind of
 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.890
and then each time you you're kind of
definitely gonna place at least one

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900
definitely gonna place at least one
 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.540
definitely gonna place at least one
pancake possibly more if you're lucky

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550
pancake possibly more if you're lucky
 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.330
pancake possibly more if you're lucky
you will always do it in 2 n minus 3 so

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340
you will always do it in 2 n minus 3 so
 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.670
you will always do it in 2 n minus 3 so
4n pancakes in the case of 5 it would

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680
4n pancakes in the case of 5 it would
 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.379
4n pancakes in the case of 5 it would
always do it in 7 or fewer but I know

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389
always do it in 7 or fewer but I know
 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.300
always do it in 7 or fewer but I know
that 4-5 pancakes the pancake number is

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310
that 4-5 pancakes the pancake number is
 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.950
that 4-5 pancakes the pancake number is
5 which means there is a way to do all

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960
5 which means there is a way to do all
 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.050
5 which means there is a way to do all
of them in five or fewer so that

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060
of them in five or fewer so that
 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.129
of them in five or fewer so that
wouldn't be necessarily the most

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139
wouldn't be necessarily the most
 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.050
wouldn't be necessarily the most
efficient method the nice thing about

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060
efficient method the nice thing about
 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.300
efficient method the nice thing about
this is he actually originated from like

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310
this is he actually originated from like
 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.159
this is he actually originated from like
a real world problem so there was a

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169
a real world problem so there was a
 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.230
a real world problem so there was a
mathematician Jacob Goodman who was

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240
mathematician Jacob Goodman who was
 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.180
mathematician Jacob Goodman who was
trying to solve a problem in the real

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190
trying to solve a problem in the real
 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.920
trying to solve a problem in the real
world and this thing occurred to him is

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930
world and this thing occurred to him is
 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.629
world and this thing occurred to him is
like oh that's an interesting puzzle you

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639
like oh that's an interesting puzzle you
 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.640
like oh that's an interesting puzzle you
know how can i how can i find how many

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650
know how can i how can i find how many
 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.379
know how can i how can i find how many
flips it takes to do this and he wasn't

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389
flips it takes to do this and he wasn't
 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.270
flips it takes to do this and he wasn't
actually using pancakes at the time it's

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280
actually using pancakes at the time it's
 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.129
actually using pancakes at the time it's
really unfortunate he wasn't in a

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139
really unfortunate he wasn't in a
 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.080
really unfortunate he wasn't in a
kitchen you know cooking pancakes and

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090
kitchen you know cooking pancakes and
 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.790
kitchen you know cooking pancakes and
discovered this he had a stack of towels

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800
discovered this he had a stack of towels
 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.800
discovered this he had a stack of towels
in the cupboard it was a really domestic

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810
in the cupboard it was a really domestic
 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.540
in the cupboard it was a really domestic
math problem and he had to try and put

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550
math problem and he had to try and put
 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.279
math problem and he had to try and put
these towels in the cupboard but he just

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289
these towels in the cupboard but he just
 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.050
these towels in the cupboard but he just
had a shelf and there wasn't any kind of

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060
had a shelf and there wasn't any kind of
 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.730
had a shelf and there wasn't any kind of
surface nearby and he needed to change

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740
surface nearby and he needed to change
 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.620
surface nearby and he needed to change
the order of the towels so he could just

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630
the order of the towels so he could just
 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.120
the order of the towels so he could just
take the top of the stack and flip it

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130
take the top of the stack and flip it
 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.980
take the top of the stack and flip it
over and he kind of was like actually

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990
over and he kind of was like actually
 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.990
over and he kind of was like actually
that's that's

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000
that's that's
 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.370
that's that's
nice problem and he wanted to write it

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380
nice problem and he wanted to write it
 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.170
nice problem and he wanted to write it
up for a magazine for american

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180
up for a magazine for american
 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.850
up for a magazine for american
mathematical monthly and he was like oh

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860
mathematical monthly and he was like oh
 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.980
mathematical monthly and he was like oh
how can i reframe this so that it's a

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990
how can i reframe this so that it's a
 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.570
how can i reframe this so that it's a
nice accessible thing and this idea of

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580
nice accessible thing and this idea of
 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.940
nice accessible thing and this idea of
using stacks of pancakes with a flipper

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950
using stacks of pancakes with a flipper
 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.800
using stacks of pancakes with a flipper
this is his way into this he used the

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810
this is his way into this he used the
 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.360
this is his way into this he used the
pseudonym he wrote an article under the

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370
pseudonym he wrote an article under the
 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.730
pseudonym he wrote an article under the
name of harried waiter which is harried

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740
name of harried waiter which is harried
 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.380
name of harried waiter which is harried

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390
waiter who's carrying the pancakes and
 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.520
waiter who's carrying the pancakes and
so on and it was you know is a nice

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530
so on and it was you know is a nice
 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.810
so on and it was you know is a nice
little here's a problem and people

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820
little here's a problem and people
 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.610
little here's a problem and people
responded to it and wrote back and stuff

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620
responded to it and wrote back and stuff
 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.530
responded to it and wrote back and stuff
so that was how the the thing kind of

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540
so that was how the the thing kind of
 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.720
so that was how the the thing kind of
first originated but it's since it's

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730
first originated but it's since it's
 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.640
first originated but it's since it's
become like a real thing and people work

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650
become like a real thing and people work
 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.530
become like a real thing and people work
on it people publish papers on it so

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540
on it people publish papers on it so
 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.150
on it people publish papers on it so
there's a chap called David Cohen who

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160
there's a chap called David Cohen who
 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.890
there's a chap called David Cohen who

his spare time when he's not writing for
 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.540
his spare time when he's not writing for
The Simpsons I guess he trained as a

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550
The Simpsons I guess he trained as a
 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.150
The Simpsons I guess he trained as a
computer scientist and while he was

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160
computer scientist and while he was
 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.800
computer scientist and while he was
studying he also did a paper on this

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810
studying he also did a paper on this
 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.390
studying he also did a paper on this
which was on a thing called the burnt

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400
which was on a thing called the burnt
 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.220
which was on a thing called the burnt
pancake problem and in that case you've

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.230
pancake problem and in that case you've
 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.900
pancake problem and in that case you've
got pancakes where one side of the

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:26.910
got pancakes where one side of the
 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.210
got pancakes where one side of the
pancake is burnt and you want to end up

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220
pancake is burnt and you want to end up
 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.470
pancake is burnt and you want to end up
with them all in the right order in the

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:30.480
with them all in the right order in the
 

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.390
with them all in the right order in the
stack but also all the burnt sides down

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400
stack but also all the burnt sides down
 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.620
stack but also all the burnt sides down
so that no one can tell that you've

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.630
so that no one can tell that you've
 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.240
so that no one can tell that you've
burnt all your pancakes on one side and

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.250
burnt all your pancakes on one side and
 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.860
burnt all your pancakes on one side and
that makes it slightly more complex and

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:36.870
that makes it slightly more complex and
 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.030
that makes it slightly more complex and
it means that you have to make sure that

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.040
it means that you have to make sure that
 

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.590
it means that you have to make sure that
you do all the the steps in the right

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:39.600
you do all the the steps in the right
 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.690
you do all the the steps in the right
order and you might find that you've you

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:41.700
order and you might find that you've you
 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.590
order and you might find that you've you
know you've done it right but they're

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600
know you've done it right but they're
 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.120
know you've done it right but they're
all upside down and you need to redo the

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.130
all upside down and you need to redo the
 

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.620
all upside down and you need to redo the
whole thing so that's another thing that

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:45.630
whole thing so that's another thing that
 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.450
whole thing so that's another thing that
