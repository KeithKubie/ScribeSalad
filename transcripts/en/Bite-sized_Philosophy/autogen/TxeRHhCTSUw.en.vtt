00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489
God right so Adam walked with God before
 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.580
God right so Adam walked with God before
he ate the fruit with Eve and then he

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590
he ate the fruit with Eve and then he
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.949
he ate the fruit with Eve and then he
wouldn't walk with God and then Noah

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959
wouldn't walk with God and then Noah
 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.900
wouldn't walk with God and then Noah
walked with God and Abraham walked with

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910
walked with God and Abraham walked with
 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.000
walked with God and Abraham walked with
God and so the idea is well that's that

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010
God and so the idea is well that's that
 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.100
God and so the idea is well that's that
alignment with the highest ideal I think

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110
alignment with the highest ideal I think
 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.740
alignment with the highest ideal I think
it's something like that and you know we

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750
it's something like that and you know we
 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.970
it's something like that and you know we
could think about that as a metaphysical

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980
could think about that as a metaphysical
 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.320
could think about that as a metaphysical
claim as well but I don't think it is I

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330
claim as well but I don't think it is I
 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.690
claim as well but I don't think it is I
mean I've got thousands of letters now

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700
mean I've got thousands of letters now
 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.170
mean I've got thousands of letters now
in the last year from people who have

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180
in the last year from people who have
 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.770
in the last year from people who have
told me that they were in a pit that's

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780
told me that they were in a pit that's
 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.680
told me that they were in a pit that's
exactly right and that they decided that

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690
exactly right and that they decided that
 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.750
exactly right and that they decided that
they were going to try to put their

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760
they were going to try to put their
 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.770
they were going to try to put their
lives together

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780
lives together
 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.300
lives together
and that it worked and so that's really

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310
and that it worked and so that's really
 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.620
and that it worked and so that's really
something you know and they write

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630
something you know and they write
 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.539
something you know and they write
surprised it's like well I decided that

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549
surprised it's like well I decided that
 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.430
surprised it's like well I decided that
I was going to work hard at what I was

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440
I was going to work hard at what I was
 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.080
I was going to work hard at what I was
doing and I wasn't going to lie any more

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090
doing and I wasn't going to lie any more
 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.030
doing and I wasn't going to lie any more
than absolutely necessary I thought I'd

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
than absolutely necessary I thought I'd
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.979
than absolutely necessary I thought I'd
give it a try for a few months you know

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989
give it a try for a few months you know
 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.050
give it a try for a few months you know
and all sorts of good things started to

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060
and all sorts of good things started to
 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.600
and all sorts of good things started to
happen to me it's like maybe that's how

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610
happen to me it's like maybe that's how
 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.819
happen to me it's like maybe that's how
the world works now obviously it doesn't

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829
the world works now obviously it doesn't
 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.500
the world works now obviously it doesn't
work like that all the time right

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510
work like that all the time right
 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.210
work like that all the time right
because you can get sliced off at the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220
because you can get sliced off at the
 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.920
because you can get sliced off at the
knees I mean there's an arbitrary

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930
knees I mean there's an arbitrary
 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.229
knees I mean there's an arbitrary
element to existence that's that you

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239
element to existence that's that you
 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.520
element to existence that's that you
can't wish away but that

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530
can't wish away but that
 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.450
can't wish away but that
doesn't mean that there are it doesn't

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460
doesn't mean that there are it doesn't
 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.070
doesn't mean that there are it doesn't
mean that there aren't bad strategies

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080
mean that there aren't bad strategies
 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.879
mean that there aren't bad strategies
and good strategies and so I do think

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889
and good strategies and so I do think
 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.230
and good strategies and so I do think
that one of the most fundamental

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240
that one of the most fundamental
 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.930
that one of the most fundamental
existential questions is like if things

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940
existential questions is like if things
 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.430
existential questions is like if things

know that people end up with lung cancer

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520
know that people end up with lung cancer
 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.680
know that people end up with lung cancer
because they were exposed to asbestos

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690
because they were exposed to asbestos
 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.590
