MALE SPEAKER: OK, I
think we're ready to go,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.870
so good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.560
It's another exciting
talk at Google.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.120
We're glad you could join us.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.470
Today we are hosting Bill Ury.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.520
He is the author of many
of the definitive works

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.240
in the field of negotiation, the
co-author of "Getting to Yes,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.510
Getting Past No."

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.350
The current book is "Getting
to Yes With Yourself."

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.640
And the idea behind
it is to take

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.240
the sort of personal
and introspective look

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.890
as a means towards approaching
the negotiation table.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
So in many ways, this is
the prequel, the prelude,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.020
to his other works,
and it could even

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.520
help foster the conditions
for world peace.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.460
Bill is also the co-founder
of the Program on Negotiation

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.100
at Harvard University and
has a very distinguished

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.827
international career on the
negotiation circuit as well.

00:00:52.827 --> 00:00:54.410
So without further
ado, please join me

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.700
in welcoming him to Google.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.200
Thank you.

00:00:59.474 --> 00:01:01.140
WILLIAM URY: Well,
it's a great pleasure

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.160
to be here speaking a Google.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.370
I have a great debt
to Google because I

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.080
use Google every single day.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.820
And it makes my life a lot
easier, and some of my projects

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.100
actually also benefit from
Google in the form of AdWords.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.020
So it's just a huge
pleasure to be here,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.720
and I really have
enjoyed the campus.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.400
What I want to talk
to you about is

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.790
what I regard as perhaps the
most important competence

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.700
that we need in today's
times, and that's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.880
the competence of
getting to yes.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.950
Aside from coding,
perhaps, getting to yes

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.100
is a really important skill
for reaching agreements,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.230
for building healthy
relationships,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.510
for resolving disputes.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.600
And it is not always easy.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.110
I've had the privilege of
having a kind of a front seat

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.150
for the last 30 or 35
years on a revolution

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.570
that's taking place around
the world that accompanies

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.200
the knowledge revolution,
accompanies the information

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.530
revolution, accompanies
the internet.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.800
And that's a revolution in
the way in which individuals

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.759
such as ourselves, organizations
such as yours, and societies

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.190
make decisions.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.400
Because traditionally, a
generation or more ago,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.760
maybe, the preeminent
process for making decisions

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.620
was the people on the top
of the pyramids of power,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.500
they give the orders.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.990
And the people on the
bottom follow the orders.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.130
But nowadays, thanks to
the knowledge revolution,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.240
those pyramids of
power are increasingly

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.860
flattening themselves into
networks, organizations

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.000
that resemble networks,
like Google, where

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.350
the form of decision
making shifts from vertical

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.570
to horizontal.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.210
And another name for horizontal
decision making is negotiation.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.070
And what I've also
seen is that when

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.580
I started in this
area of negotiation,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.370
most people had a
notion of negotiation

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.820
as being kind of who's
going to win this.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.080
And that's shifted over time,
as the logic has shifted

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.750
to one into which can we
both satisfy our basic needs.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.560
Can we both win, as it were?

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.050
Can we achieve, you know, a
classic, win-win solution.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.450
It's not always easy.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.740
Today, these days, conflict
is a growth industry.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.660
And if you look
around at the news,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.020
it seems like people
or just as often

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.880
getting to no as they
are getting to yes.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.030
And so my question is, what
stops us from getting to yes?

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.087
So what I'd like to
do if I may just begin

00:03:25.087 --> 00:03:26.920
is just to kind of draw
you out a little bit

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.910
about your own experiences
as negotiators.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.180
Because like it or not,
we are all negotiators.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.240
If I were to define negotiation
very simply and very broadly

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.850
as back-and-forth
communication, you're

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.027
trying to reach some
kind of agreement.

00:03:42.027 --> 00:03:44.360
And you may have some interests
that you hold in common,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.970
like an ongoing relationship,
and you have other interests

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.530
which are in tension,
like you would

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.820
like to get more money for
your products and services.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.194
They would like
to give you less.

00:03:53.194 --> 00:03:55.250
Or, you know, you've
got the budget.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.230
You'd like a larger
slice of that budget.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.130
In that broad sense
of the term, who

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.280
do you find yourself negotiating
with in the course of your day,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.740
would you say,
just to kind of see

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.067
what the variety of
your situations are?

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:08.150
Who do you negotiate with?

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.380
Your kids, OK.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.820
That's not always so
easy to negotiate.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.570
So who else do you
negotiate besides your kids?

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.370
Significant others, OK, so
some of the tough negotiations

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.760
start at home.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.900
Who else do you negotiate with?

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.700
Your teammates,
coworkers, who else?

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.900
Yeah?

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.144
Yourself-- on the one hand,
you want to push yourself.

00:04:39.144 --> 00:04:40.810
On the other side,
there's a part of you

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.220
that feels tired and exhausted.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.050
OK, so there's this negotiation
inside of ourselves.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.480
So if you were to
just make a ballpark

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.690
estimate of how
much of your time

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.280
you spend engaged,
broadly speaking,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.270
in the act of back-and-forth
communication,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.710
trying to reach
agreement with your kids,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.140
your significant other, your
colleagues, your coworkers,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.272
your bosses, clients,
suppliers, yourself,

00:05:09.272 --> 00:05:10.730
what percentage of
your time do you

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.730
think you spend engaged
in this process.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.310
If you had to take a
guess, what would you say?

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.342
About half?

00:05:19.342 --> 00:05:20.800
OK, how many would
agree with that?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.370
It's about half.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.240
OK, how many would say
it's even more than half?

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:32.230
OK, so whatever it is, that's
a huge chunk of our time.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.040
And we may not
always think of it

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.000
in the formal sense
as negotiation,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.160
but in the broad
sense of the term,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.350
this is a process we're engaged
in from the moment we get up

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.320
in the morning to the moment
we got to bed at night.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.140
So let me ask you a couple
other questions here.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.030
If you were to think
back over the last 10

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.480
years of your careers--
you've kind of risen up

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.190
and you have more
authority and so

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.110
on-- would you say
the amount of time

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.350
that you spend negotiating has
stayed pretty much the same?

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.070
Has it gone down over time?

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.340
Or has it gone up?

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.830
Up, how many would
say it's gone up?

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.700
OK, that's a majority.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.830
So that's what I call this
negotiation revolution.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.650
There's a kind of a
negotiation revolution.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.760
I see it in every
country I visit.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.020
As the form of
decision making shifts,

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.250
negotiations become--
the preeminent form

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.820
for making decisions, not
just at work, but at home,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.770
in our communities, in politics,
in the world-- and the question

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.380
is, how do we learn
to do it better?

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:46.310
And my question is what
stops us from getting to yes?

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.020
Let me ask you,
just for a moment,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.920
just to take one any situation
you'd like just to have in mind

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.980
as we talk about this
subject of getting

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.150
to yes for the next hour.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.630
Take any situation that
you'd like to focus on,

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.044
some negotiation you're involved
in, could be with your child,

00:07:04.044 --> 00:07:05.710
it could be with your
significant other,

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.190
it could be with a coworker.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.190
Just pick a situation, OK?

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.880
Everyone pick a
situation, something

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.780
that's been maybe a little
problematic for you,

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.650
some negotiation
you're involved in.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.240
OK, everyone got one?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.350
So then let me ask you if there
are two kinds of negotiations.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.280
There are the external
negotiations that are outside,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.890
let's say, with customers,
with suppliers, you know,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.660
standardly what we talk
about as negotiation.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.780
And then there are the
negotiations inside,

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.880
like inside the family
or inside your work unit.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.750
How many of you, just
out of curiosity,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.772
have just selected an
external negotiation?

00:07:43.772 --> 00:07:45.230
That was what came
to mind when you

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.115
were thinking about
a problematic one.

00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:49.350
How about internal?

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.620
OK, a lot of
internal-- and so if I

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.300
ask you this question
of if you were

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.190
to make a broad
generalization, just

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.520
from your own experience, which
is more problematic for you--

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.170
the external negotiations
or the internal ones?

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.090
Which ones tend to
give you more trouble?

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.200
How many would say it's
external gives me more trouble?

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.809
OK, how many would say it's
internal gives me more trouble?

00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:14.600
That's interesting.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.030
If you look around the
room, it's like 90%.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.250
Now obviously both
can be problematic.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.310
And in fact, a lot of
external negotiations

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.500
have an internal component.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.460
But so my question is this.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.289
Because basically my passion
for the last 35 years

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.710
has been helping
people, organizations,

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.070
societies get to yes, from
family feuds to boardroom

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.830
battles, from labor
strikes to civil wars

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.182
in different parts of the world.

00:08:43.182 --> 00:08:44.640
And the thing that's
kind of struck

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.782
me is that, actually, when
I think about what makes

00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:51.990
negotiations very difficult,
what I've gradually come

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:57.640
to realize is that the
negotiation with ourselves--

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.220
you know, what could be more
internal than the negotiation

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.850
with ourselves?

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.820
Because it seems
like we experience

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.530
internal negotiations
as more problematic,

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.670
but perhaps the most problematic
is the one with ourselves.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.800
And this is what I've found
is that perhaps our biggest

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:21.220
opponent, the biggest obstacle
to us getting what we want

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.170
in life and in our
negotiations, is not

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.830
what we often think it is.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.280
It's not just the other person
across on the other side

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.084
of the table.

00:09:31.084 --> 00:09:32.500
That person can
be very difficult.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.150
Those people can
be very difficult.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.480
And I've specialized in
dealing with difficult people

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.430
in difficult situations.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.360
But I find that however
difficult that person

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.130
is, the most difficult
person we have to deal with

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.740
is-- I have to deal with,
at least-- is right here.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.630
It's myself.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.706
We are, in some ways,
our own biggest opponent.

00:09:51.706 --> 00:09:54.080
That's the person we look at
in the mirror every morning.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.940
That's the person who's going
to give us the most trouble.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.960
I think it was President
Teddy Roosevelt who once said,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.940
if you could give
a kick in the pants

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.190
to the person who will give
you the most trouble in life,

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.430
you would not sit for a month.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.990
We are often our
own worst enemies

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.460
because we human beings, for one
thing, we're reaction machines.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.110
We tend to react.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.220
We tend to react
in ways to do not

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.530
serve our long-term interests.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:39.900
And so my question is, how
do we turn that biggest

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.900
opponent of ours into
our biggest ally?

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.260
That's what I think
of as the process

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.950
of getting to yes with yourself.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.490
How do you turn your own
opponent, yourself as opponent,

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:53.620
into an ally?

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.970
It's not easy.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.640
And what I've found is
that what we tend to do

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.650
is it's almost as if
we get in our own way.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.670
And it's almost as if
we've been negotiating.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.629
And the way I've tended to
focus on negotiation, always

00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:09.920
on the other side of the table.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.450
And I realize that
part the problem

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.667
is on this side of the table.

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:16.250
And it's almost as if we've been
negotiating with one arm tied

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.820
behind our back because
we're negotiating just

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.370
focused on the external,
influencing the other person,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.360
when in fact our
biggest opportunity

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.000
is to start off by influencing
this person right here.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.540
And so what I'd like to do
with you for a moment is just--

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.310
from that realization,
I've kind of

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.240
come to realize that getting
to yes is an inside job.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.940
And so what I'd like to do is
talk about how do we do that.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.010
How do we handle that first
and perhaps most important

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.010
negotiation that
we ever engage in,

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.690
the one that starts from within?

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.920
What are some principles of how
do you get to yes with yourself

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.144
as the first step towards
getting to yes with others?

00:12:01.144 --> 00:12:02.560
How do we do that
in our homework?

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.300
And I know here-- I
just had the pleasure

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.000
of spending several
hours with Meng,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.810
and I know you
have these courses

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:13.540
about searching Inside yourself
and doing that work of self

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.460
awareness and of attention
training and so on.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.240
So this will be very congruent
with that kind of work.

00:12:22.239 --> 00:12:24.030
What I'd like to do is
just review with you

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.225
just a few principles.

00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:27.350
And then I'd like to leave
time for some questions,

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.250
so we can go into any
of your situations

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.850
or any questions you might
have about negotiation.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.770
But I'm going to go over
some principles that

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.440
are the very same principles
we might apply outwards,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.000
but to apply them inwards first.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.250
I think of them as the
psychological antecedents

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.070
to the process of
getting to yes.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.410
So the first, and
maybe the foundation,

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.910
that I've been teaching for
many years around negotiation

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.500
is the ability
to-- I like to use

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.220
the metaphor of
going to the balcony.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.210
The balcony,
basically, it's almost

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.930
like you're negotiating
up here on a stage.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.140
Part of your mind goes to a
mental or emotional balcony

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.920
overlooking that stage, which
is a place of perspective.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.240
It's a place of calm.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.860
It's a place of clarity.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.080
It's a place of self control.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.000
It's a place where you can
keep your eyes on the prize,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.550
because so often,
we're reacting.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.310
We're often reacting
out of fear.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.150
We're reacting out of anger.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.610
And as the old saying
goes, when angry,

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.640
you will make the best
speech you will ever regret.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.690
And we sometimes get brought
into a process of either

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.100
attacking the other side
sometimes out of anger,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.820
or accommodating, giving in,
to the other side out of fear,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.330
or simply avoiding
conflict altogether.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.640
How many of you, just out of
curiosity, if I ever ask you--

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.360
I sometimes think of this as the
three A's-- you know, attack,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.840
accommodate, and avoid.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.980
If you said, I have a
tendency to accommodate,

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.660
how many would say that you
have a tendency to accommodate?

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.760
I would say you have a
tendency to attack more

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.080
when you're in a conflict.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.870
How many would say you
have a tendency to avoid?

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:24.120
OK, and sometimes we use a
combination of all of them.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.450
We may accommodate for a
long time with our child,

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.980
and then we suddenly lose it.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.480
You've been to that
movie, you know?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.945
And then we attack, and
then we go back to avoiding.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.170
The question is, is
there a better way?

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.545
And I think there
is a better way

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.450
of getting to yes, which
is actually engaging

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.400
the differences in
a constructive way.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.200
But in order to do
that, it requires

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.370
us to go to the balcony.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.590
And it's hard to go to
the balcony these days.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.220
And particularly
today with everything,

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.020
all our technology and cell
phones and texts and tweets

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.770
and everything that's going on,
it's so easy to get reactive.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.390
I mean, for example, you're
sitting there at your computer

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:08.634
and you get an email that you
suddenly felt, wait a minute.

00:15:08.634 --> 00:15:10.300
They didn't consult
me on that decision.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.216
And you kind of feel
ticked off and irritated.

00:15:12.216 --> 00:15:16.660
So it's just very natural
to compose a reply.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.350
You get that
instant satisfaction

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.900
of hitting the Reply button.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.660
But you don't just
hit the Reply button,

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.730
you hit the Reply All button.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.460
And then it goes out to
the entire organization

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.090
and you start to see
conflicts start to escalate.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.630
There is a button on that
screen that is often rarely used

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.270
that I think of as
the balcony button,

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.340
and it says, Save as Draft.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.550
That's the one where you
get it out of your system.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.230
You save it as a draft.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.699
Then everyone has their
favorite techniques

00:15:43.699 --> 00:15:44.740
for going to the balcony.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.660
Some people might, you
know, breathe or meditate.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.030
Some people might go for a walk
in these lovely surroundings

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.840
here or go have a cup of coffee
with a friend or sleep on it.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.920
But you're going to come
back after a few minutes

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.564
or a few hours.

00:15:57.564 --> 00:15:58.980
You're going to
look at that email

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.313
and you're going to ask
yourself the important question.

00:16:01.313 --> 00:16:04.470
Is this going to
advance my interests?

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.730
Is this really going to serve
the needs of the situation?

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.390
And most likely you're going
to hit the Delete button,

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.080
and then you're going to pick up
the phone and call the person,

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.840
get together with
them or however

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.260
to try to resolve the situation.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.470
Because email as it turns
out, while it's a great way

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.070
to convey information,
is not such a great way

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.160
to deal with anything
that's emotionally delicate.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.250
So those are all ways
of going to the balcony.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.830
But the question
is, a lot of people

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.550
find that they fall
off the balcony.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.730
We fall off the balcony.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.630
It's just natural.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.838
And so the question is how
can we say on the balcony?

00:16:40.838 --> 00:16:44.937
And so this brings me
to the next principle,

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.020
which is one of the key
principles of negotiation.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.716
I mean, if people ask me,
what's the most important skill

00:16:50.716 --> 00:16:52.340
that a negotiator
needs to have-- there

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.048
are a lot of skills
that we need to have,

00:16:54.048 --> 00:16:56.630
but if I had to pick one--
usually I pick this one.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.530
It's the ability to put yourself
in the other side's shoes,

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.960
in other words, the ability
to try and understand

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.410
what your coworker really
wants or what your child wants

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.960
or what your
significant other wants.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.609
It's to listen to them.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:14.079
Because after all, negotiation
is an exercise in influence.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.200
You're trying to
change someone's mind.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.170
How can we possibly
change their mind

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.839
if we don't know
where their mind is?

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.990
So putting yourself
in their shoes is key.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.940
But what I've discovered
in teaching this over many,

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.650
many years is that it's
not easy for people

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.350
to put themselves in
the other side's shoes.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.910
It's not easy for us to listen
to others because there's

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.930
so much going on for
us in our own minds

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:42.270
already that there's no mental
or emotional space for us

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:46.450
to be able to invite in the
other person's concerns.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.560
And so the biggest block to
us being able to put ourselves

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.379
in the other side's
shoes-- which is key

00:17:51.379 --> 00:17:53.670
if you're dealing with
customers or clients or anything

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.020
like that, it's absolutely key--
but the biggest block is us.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.770
And so what I
found paradoxically

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:03.290
is that there is a psychological
antecedent to putting ourselves

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.440
in the other person's
shoes, and that's

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.590
to put ourselves in
our own shoes first.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.720
In other words, not
just to listen to them,

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.470
but before we can
listen to them properly,

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.160
we need to listen to ourselves.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.840
We need to be able to see
ourselves from the balcony.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.260
We need to be able to practice
the skills of self observation

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.790
and watch what happens.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.540
I think it was Benjamin
Franklin who centuries ago said,

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:35.070
observe all people,
yourself most of all.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.410
So what I'd like to do is
tell you a little story,

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.680
just if I may, from
my own experience

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.160
of when I began to really focus
on this whole issue of how

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.240
do I negotiate with myself.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.630
I was involved some
years ago as a mediator

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:59.360
in a conflict in Venezuela.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.120
I had been asked
by President Carter

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.860
to be a third party in between
the government of Venezuela,

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.570
the president whose name was
Hugo Chavez-- some of you

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:14.370
may remember him-- and
the political opposition.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.360
And it was a time when there
were about a million people

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.270
on the streets of
Caracas, the capital city,

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.970
demanding the resignation of the
president and a million people

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.076
on the streets supporting him.

00:19:25.076 --> 00:19:26.700
And there was some
violence, and people

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.880
were genuinely afraid it
might lead to a civil war.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.020
Anyway, at one point-- I
had a number of meetings

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.030
with President Chavez--
but one of them--

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:39.820
he was a kind of complex and
somewhat volatile individual--

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.080
but at one of them, we had
a meeting with my friend

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.420
Francisco, colleague
Francisco, set at 9 o'clock.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.400
He liked to meet at night
in the presidential palace.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.140
And we waited patiently there.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.070
And finally midnight came
and we were ushered in

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.182
to see the President.

00:19:54.182 --> 00:19:55.890
Instead of finding
him alone at midnight,

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.380
we found his entire
cabinet arrayed behind him.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.570
And he said, so, Bill.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.430
He said, have a seat here.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:05.620
Now tell me what do you
think of the situation here?

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.657
What's your impression?

00:20:07.657 --> 00:20:09.615
And I said, well, you
know, Mr. President, I've

00:20:09.615 --> 00:20:11.880
been talking to some of your
government ministers here

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.430
and some of the opposition
and it seems to me

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.067
you're making some progress.

00:20:17.067 --> 00:20:19.400
As soon as he heard the word
progress, he got triggered.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.010
He said, what do
you mean progress?

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:21.860
Are you blind?

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.650
You're not seeing
the dirty tricks

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.110
those traitors in the
opposition are up to.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.070
And he proceeded to get furious,
leaned in very close to my face

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:37.360
and started to yell for
approximately 30 minutes,

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.710
in front of his entire cabinet.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.230
Now if you put yourself in my
shoes, I was kind of going,

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.920
wait a minute.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.390
I'm not blind, you know.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.780
You're trying to defend yourself
and thinking about that.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.230
But then, thankfully,
I was able to go

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.950
to the balcony for a
moment and ask myself

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.190
the important question.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.219
Is it really going to advance
my cause, the cause of peace,

00:20:56.219 --> 00:20:58.260
for me to get into an
argument with the president

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.730
of Venezuela?

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.980
So I thought the better of it.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.420
I bit my tongue, and I
just listened to him.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.800
And sure enough,
he was a man who

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.050
could go on for eight hours,
give a speech, no problem.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.750
If I had interrupted him
and tried to argue with him,

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.080
I'm sure it could have
gone way off the tracks.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.260
And I was thinking in
myself, OK, two years of work

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.230
here in Venezuela
all down the drain.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.150
You get reactive in
a situation like that

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.720
when someone is shouting
at you like that.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.830
But somehow I was able
to go to the balcony,

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.410
suspend my normal reaction.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:35.920
And I saw after 30 minutes,
by me not reacting,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.490
I saw his shoulders kind
of sink a little bit.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.910
And in a weary tone of
voice he said to me finally,

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.400
so, Bill, what should I do?

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.810
Well, that is the sound
of a human mind opening.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.980
When you try to deal
with someone who's

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.980
in an angry state
of mind, they're

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.870
not going to listen to reason.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.622
But at some point he
finally is saying, OK, so

00:21:58.622 --> 00:21:59.330
what should I do?

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.720
He's willing to open, so
I said, Mr. president,

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.670
I think the entire
country of Venezuela

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.550
needs to go to the balcony.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.450
It's almost Christmas time.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.010
Last Christmas the
festivities were

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.920
canceled because
of the conflict.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.040
Why not have a truce
and give everyone

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.230
a chance to enjoy the
holidays with their families?

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.060
And when we come
back in January,

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.060
maybe everyone will
be in a better mood.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.240
And President Chavez
said, that's a great idea.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.280
I'm going to propose
that in my next speech.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.040
His mood had completely shifted.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.180
And then he said
to me, you know,

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.430
over Christmas I'm going to
travel around the country.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.654
And I'd like you to come
with me and see the country.

00:22:33.654 --> 00:22:36.320
And then he thought for a moment
and he said, but wait a minute,

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.170
you're neutral.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.990
Maybe it won't be
so good for you

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.380
to be seen always in my company.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.910
He said, but that's no problem.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.550
I'll give you a disguise.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.760
Anyway, his mood had
completely shifted.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.920
Now why was that?

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:55.500
Because in order for me to
put myself in his shoes,

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.875
I first had been able to
put myself in my own shoes.

00:22:57.875 --> 00:22:59.250
Because when I
was waiting there,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.830
in those three hours that
I was waiting for him,

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.310
I took some time just,
like, to meditate or just

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.310
to be quiet by
myself, quiet my mind,

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.840
listen, so that I
was less reactive.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.080
And even when it
was happening, then,

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.550
from a balcony perspective
I could just watch.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:17.120
I could observe
my thoughts about,

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.410
oh, all my work is
going down the drain.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.650
I could observe my emotions
of being embarrassed.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.450
I could observe my
physical sensations.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.100
And instead of
reacting to them, I

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.310
could simply let them
pass so that I could then

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.420
focus on President Chavez.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.780
So again, just a lesson to
me about how important it

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.630
is to put yourself
in your own shoes

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.770
before you try to put yourself
in the other person's shoes--

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.230
how important it is to
listen to yourself before you

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.300
listen to others.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.090
And of course in doing
that, what you find

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.610
is you can uncover
what are your deepest

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:53.110
needs in this situation.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.720
What do you really want?

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.200
Now that may seem
very obvious to us,

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.980
but I can't tell you
how many times I've

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.750
been involved in
situations-- whether it's

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.880
family or work or
politics-- where people

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.720
don't know that
they really want.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.110
We think we know what we
want, but we haven't really

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.360
gone deep enough.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.660
And if I may, I'll just give
you just another example,

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.880
just to kind of illustrate
that from a business context.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:27.720
About a year and a half ago,
I was contacted by a business

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.880
leader that I knew
down in Brazil

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.660
who wanted my help in
helping her father, who

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.960
was one of Brazil's
leading businessmen.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.960
He had founded Brazil's
largest retailer,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.580
had 150,000 employees.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:46.620
And he was involved
in a gigantic conflict

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.150
with his business
partner, who was French.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.890
And they had been
fighting each other

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.700
in the courts for
2 and 1/2 years.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.760
It was all over the papers.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.160
The media called it perhaps
the largest boardroom

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.090
cross-continental showdown
in recent history.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.289
And it was affecting everyone.

00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:07.830
It was not just
affecting the parties

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:11.210
but their families, the 150,000
employees of the company that

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.010
had divided loyalties and so on.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:15.880
And she asked me
if I could help.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.410
I didn't know if I
could help, but I

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.868
agreed to sit down
with her father.

00:25:18.868 --> 00:25:23.270
And I sat down with him at his
home, and he told me the story.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.290
And it seemed to
me he was unclear.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.350
Did he want to fight?

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.692
Or did he really
want to settle this?

00:25:31.692 --> 00:25:34.150
And I think he was torn inside
of himself, like many of us.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:34.730
We're torn.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.162
What exactly do we want most?

00:25:37.162 --> 00:25:38.620
Because he was
going to be chairman

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.970
of the board for
another eight years.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.110
He was already 76,
until he was 84.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.750
So I asked him.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:49.780
I said, Abellio, tell me,
what do you want here?

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.549
What do you really want?

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:52.340
How can I help you?

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.330
I mean, what is it
you really want?

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.260
And he said, well, I want
my stock at a certain price.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.160
I want the elimination of
the non-compete clause.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.390
I want some real estate.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.000
He give me a list.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.730
But as I listened
to it, I said, no.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.063
But, Abellio, you're a man
who seems to have everything.

00:26:07.063 --> 00:26:08.906
You've got everything
you possibly want.

00:26:08.906 --> 00:26:09.780
You're a billionaire.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.440
I mean, what do you
really want here?

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.630
And he finally
said, after I probed

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.640
for awhile, he
finally said, freedom.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.050
That's what I want.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.755
I want my freedom.

00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:25.880
And then that's when I was
hearing the human being.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.080
And then I asked him, what
do you want the freedom for?

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.410
And he said, well, I want
freedom to spend time

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.915
with my family here, which
is the most important thing

00:26:34.915 --> 00:26:35.415
in my life.

00:26:35.415 --> 00:26:38.350
And I also want freedom to
pursue the business deals

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.850
that I've always loved pursuing.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.870
So once we were clear about
what his underlying needs were,

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:51.570
then the negotiation with the
other side became a lot easier.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.840
And even though it had gone
on for 2 and 1/2 years,

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.840
negotiations had broken
down, it took my colleagues

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.880
and I just four short
days from the time

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.900
we had the first
meeting to the time

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.910
we had both men sitting side
by side, signing an agreement,

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.380
shaking hands, press conference,
joint press statement,

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.530
wishing each other well,
making a joint presentation

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.740
to the executives of the
company and to the employees

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.640
of the company explaining it,
and moving on with their lives.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.480
And that just, again,
underscored for me

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.330
how important it is to be
able to uncover your needs.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.100
So in your own situation, if
you think about it for a moment,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.180
it's just always
useful to ask what

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.630
do I most want or need
here, behind what I think

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.770
I need, behind the position,
the concrete thing?

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.420
What's the equivalent of freedom
for you in that situation?

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.670
What's truly important here?

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.540
What's the real prize for you?

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.280
In the negotiation
with your kid,

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.014
what's really, truly
important here?

00:27:51.014 --> 00:27:52.680
What's the most
important thing for you?

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.060
It's, again,
something that we may

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.380
lose sight of when we get
involved in a conflict.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.710
And where that leads you
to, then the question

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:06.190
is, where's the power going to
come from to meet your needs?

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:11.890
Now in negotiation we have a
concept that Roger Fisher and I

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.640
called in "Getting to
Yes" many years ago,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.650
we call it your BATNA.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.990
It's your Best Alternative
To a Negotiated Agreement.

00:28:20.986 --> 00:28:23.360
What are you going to do to
satisfy your interests if you

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.320
cannot reach agreement?

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.153
You know, what's your
walk-away alternative?

00:28:26.153 --> 00:28:27.250
What are you going to do?

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.560
To have an alternative-- if
you don't have this one client,

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.080
is there another client?

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.584
It just gives you a
sense of-- I mean, to me,

00:28:40.584 --> 00:28:42.750
this is what the internet,
this is what Google does,

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.924
is it gives people alternatives.

00:28:44.924 --> 00:28:46.340
Because in the old
days, when they

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.620
didn't have much
information, you

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.830
had to go just with one way.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.280
But now you can
Google and you can

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.510
find other ways of doing it.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:55.210
So to me, in some ways,
you're the BATNA company.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:56.990
You help people.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.615
You give people BATNAs.

00:28:58.615 --> 00:29:00.740
Now what I've found,
though, interestingly

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.150
in teaching this
is a lot of people,

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.280
we don't naturally
think of our BATNA.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.490
We just focus on just
getting the agreement, not

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.860
the alternative.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.010
And what's often
blocking us, I find,

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:16.810
is there's an inner
psychological prerequisite

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.020
to this, which is what you might
call your inner BATNA, which

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.340
is your commitment to take
care of your own needs.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.410
If I go back to the
story of my friend

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:32.740
Abellio for a moment in
the retailer in Brazil,

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.430
when he told me
he wanted freedom,

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.350
I asked him, OK,
Abellio, who can give you

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.239
the freedom you most want?

00:29:39.239 --> 00:29:41.030
Who can give you the
freedom you most want?

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.770
Is it only your arch enemy?

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:48.600
Or to some extent, can you
give yourself that own freedom?

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.210
Once he understood that, oh,
yeah, he could give himself

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.660
a little bit, then
he said, OK, well,

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.562
even without us reaching
agreement with the other side,

00:29:57.562 --> 00:29:58.270
what could he do?

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.550
He could pursue
some business deals.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.130
He moved his office
out of the company.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:07.210
He became chairman
of another company.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:11.010
He spent time, took
holiday with this family.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.410
Psychologically, that
shifted the situation.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.490
Because he was no longer so
psychologically dependent

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:23.320
on the other side, then it was
much easier to reach agreement.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.620
And so the question
again for us to ask

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.870
ourselves is who in the end is
really responsible for meeting

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.460
my needs in the situation?

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.580
What can I do to meet my
needs independently, perhaps,

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.950
of the other side?

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.010
And how can I take
care of myself?

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:41.200
What would that be for you?

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.930
Which brings me, then, to where
does your satisfaction come

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.710
from in negotiation
or in life generally?

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:58.000
Let me just actually ask
you to do quick-- sometimes

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.100
in negotiation we like
to use little exercises.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.100
I'd like to just invite
you to participate

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:06.570
in a quick, 30-second exercise,
if you will, if you wouldn't

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.294
mind, just totally
voluntary here.

00:31:08.294 --> 00:31:10.710
But if you wouldn't mind turning
to the person next to you

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.110
and getting into arm
wrestling position with them,

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.610
as if you were going
to arm wrestle.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.790
For those who want to
demonstrate this, OK?

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.290
Yes.

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:21.440
OK.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.430
As if you were going
to arm wrestle--

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.270
you can even
support your elbows.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.750
OK, here we go.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:38.900
So as in business, you want
to maximize your score here.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.200
Let's say you get
1,000 points every time

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.120
you get the other
person's arm down.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.390
OK.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:46.140
Get ready.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.770
Get set.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:47.269
Go.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.440
You get the other
persons arm down.

00:32:02.665 --> 00:32:03.165
OK.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:10.040
What I see here is there's
a learning process, right?

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.150
There's a learning process.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.230
And essentially there's
a learning process

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:19.270
where-- it was like you
two gentlemen there.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.310
You start off zero-zero, right?

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.590
And that's often how we do it.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.530
And then suddenly, you know,
if you were super strong,

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.160
maybe you get the other
person's arm down once.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.910
But then it was like
a light bulb went on.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.490
And people said, wait a minute.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.000
If I get my arm down,
that's 1,000 points for you

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
and 1,000 points for me
and 1,000 points for you

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.749
and 1,000 for me, like
a windshield wiper.

00:32:37.749 --> 00:32:41.170
And suddenly you're accumulating
tens of thousands of points.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:42.570
Well, think about that.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:47.990
We often approach negotiation
like an arm wrestle.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.970
You know, who's
going to win this?

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.890
But in fact, the
greatest power we

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.480
have may be the power
to change the game,

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.400
from an arm wrestle to a
search for mutual gain here.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.751
And the question for me
is, why is it so hard

00:33:03.751 --> 00:33:04.500
for us to do that?

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.950
It's because there's a mindset.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:10.230
We often have a mindset
in mind that basically

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:14.300
holds that this is, like,
a dog-eat-dog world.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.920
And it's a hostile world.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:22.660
And it's ranged against
me, and somehow its scarce.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.550
There's a mindset
of scarcity, which

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:32.470
is why one of the greatest minds
of the last century, Albert

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.150
Einstein, once
asked this question.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.750
He said, is the universe
a friendly place?

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.120
This is the first and
most basic question

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.720
all people must
answer for themselves.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.320
Now why would Einstein say that?

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.690
Why would he ask that question?

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:52.850
Because his reasoning was
in the wake of World War II

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.870
and the advent of
nuclear weapons,

00:33:55.870 --> 00:34:02.570
he reasoned that if we
basically answer this question

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.200
and say the universe is an
unfriendly place-- because

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.360
after all, who knows--
but if we decide

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.409
to choose the universe
as an unfriendly place,

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:13.150
we're going to see
everyone as our adversary.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:18.072
And collectively we're
going to see other nations

00:34:18.072 --> 00:34:19.530
as our adversaries,
and we're going

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.940
to react at the
first provocation.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.120
And undoubtedly, we're going
to end up in a nuclear war,

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.570
and that will be end
of life on Earth.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:32.840
However, if we can choose
to answer the question

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.590
as is the universe
a friendly place,

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:36.960
we're more likely to treat
people as potential partners.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.540
And we're more
likely to cooperate.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.790
So he thought this was
the underlying question.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.040
In other words, this goes
to a negotiation technique

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.210
which is that one of the
greatest powers we have

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:49.980
is the ability to reframe.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.810
Take the same situation and
see it in different ways.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:57.769
You could frame the situation
as friendly-- life is basically

00:34:57.769 --> 00:34:59.810
on your side-- or you can
frame it as unfriendly.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:03.160
And that's basically our choice.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.040
That's basically our choice.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.550
And how we do that,
after all, depending

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:14.050
on how we make that decision,
affects a lot of things for us.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:17.060
If I might just
use, for example,

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.090
we could reframe the
picture as scarcity.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:24.220
Life is scarce, and so I'm
going to just grab mine.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:30.000
Or we can approach a situation
from a frame of sufficiency.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.980
Maybe there's enough for
both of us or for all of us.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:36.320
And the way in which we frame
that, the underlying mindset,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.640
the underlying assumptions
we bring to that situation

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.610
will affect those things.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:45.540
So these are some of the
ways in which we can do this.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.020
But you can ask yourself,
for example, this question.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.000
Where does my
satisfaction come from?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.040
Is there enough?

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.700
Can I see life on my side?

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.740
In other words, just
question our assumptions

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.030
and see if some of our beliefs,
in fact, are limiting beliefs.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.440
If I might just use an example
from my own personal life,

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.800
one of the better examples of
this where I can learn this

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.780
from is my own
daughter, who is 16.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.450
Her name is Gabby,
and she was born

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.080
with a lot of
medical difficulties.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.442
She's had, like,
15 major surgeries

00:36:17.442 --> 00:36:19.775
on different parts of her
body, structural difficulties.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:27.510
But she somehow has a
positive attitude about life.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.480
She frames things
in a different way.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.380
She doesn't feel
sorry for herself.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.560
She develops her
own inner BATNA.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.887
And one of her dreams
from when she was little

00:36:38.887 --> 00:36:40.720
was she always wanted
to be in the "Guinness

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.350
Book of World Records."

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.280
And so when she was,
like, seven or eight,

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.510
she tried to make
the longest hopscotch

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.039
course in the
driveway with chalk.

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:51.622
And then another one
was she was going

00:36:51.622 --> 00:36:54.170
to try to put the most
socks on one foot.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.860
Anyway, a year
ago, she announced

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.220
that for her 16th birthday
she was going to try again,

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.610
but this time she was
going to do an exercise.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.359
Do you know the exercise
called the plank?

00:37:04.359 --> 00:37:05.940
Does anyone know
what the plank is?

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.290
It's kind of an abdominal
exercise where you lie down

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.080
and you put your elbows down
and you hold your body straight.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.580
I don't know how
long you can do it,

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.481
but I can do it for about
a minute, maybe two.

00:37:16.481 --> 00:37:18.730
Anyway, Gabby wrote away to
the "Guiness Book of World

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.313
Records," and it
turned out the women,

00:37:20.313 --> 00:37:22.650
female record was 40 minutes.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.010
But she went into training.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.095
And when her
birthday came by, she

00:37:26.095 --> 00:37:29.030
was going to do it at
her birthday party,

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.000
actually, try to break this.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.660
And we had to get a little
video camera or whatever,

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.673
just if she did break
it to be able to send it

00:37:37.673 --> 00:37:39.423
in to the "Guinness
Book of World Records"

00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:42.540
and have a certain number
of witnesses and so on.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:48.710
And believe it or not, she went
for an hour and 20 minutes.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:53.590
And she's now in the 2015 book
of Guinness World Records.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:57.470
So I'm just saying, it's
just an example of someone

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:02.130
who is able to not just take
her circumstances for whatever,

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.320
but just to reframe
that ability.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.520
By getting to yes
with herself, then she

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.110
was able to get to
yes with others.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:14.160
In my book, there's
a whole set of steps.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.480
I've gone over a few of them.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.880
Put yourself in your shoes.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.990
Develop your inner BATNA.

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.980
Reframe your picture,
which then allows

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.700
you to stay in
the zone, which is

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.610
the place of peak performance,
the place of flow,

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:29.050
which athletes know
and artists know.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.440
And the question
is, can we apply

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.590
that in our own
daily situations,

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.570
in our own conflicts
and negotiations,

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:36.370
the place of
highest satisfaction

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.580
and performance, which
also then allows us--

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.720
because we've taken care of
our own psychological needs--

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.500
to be able to respect
people, even if at first they

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.390
don't respect us?

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.450
Which turns out to be
key because so often I

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:52.400
find in conflict
situations what happens

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.050
is the other side rejects
us, so we reject them back.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:57.310
And then they reject us back.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:58.980
And we get locked into it.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.330
Someone has to break that cycle.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.000
It could be us, but
it can only be us

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.450
if we are drawing on
our own self respect.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.850
If we are drawing
our own nourishment,

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.630
which then allows us
to give and receive

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:14.030
and to get into a
more cooperative mode.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:16.000
So what I've found
here is there's

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.080
a whole set of steps, that are
kind of inner homework, that

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:25.740
allow us to get to yes much
more easily with others.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.670
Starting with an inner yes,
it produces an outer yes.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.200
And effectively
what this does is

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.640
it provides
[INAUDIBLE] with three

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.480
wins, three
victories in the end.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.660
One is a victory
inside of ourselves,

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.800
which is greater satisfaction.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.250
And the other is a win-win.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.060
We're much more likely
to reach mutually

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.580
acceptable and satisfactory
agreements with others.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.880
But ultimately, it also
brings a win-win-win,

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.290
which is it induces
a more generous,

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.160
a more compassionate
perspective that

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.310
allows us to help
the larger whole,

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:03.980
whether it's the family,
the workplace, or the world.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.780
So let me just end this talk
and take some questions,

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.920
but with one last story.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.520
I spent a lot of time
in the Middle East.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.390
I'm just headed there,
actually, in a few weeks.

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:22.400
I have a project that we use
Google Maps for of developing

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.320
kind of an out-of-the-box,
innovative idea

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.200
of a long-distance walking trail
across the Middle East that

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.030
retraces the
footsteps of Abraham.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:36.810
And it kind of just
brings people together.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:39.600
You walk and you stay
in people's homes.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.649
And it's developing.

00:40:41.649 --> 00:40:42.940
We have about 1,000 kilometers.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.260
It's called Abraham Path.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.760
We have a website.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.380
And we use Google Earth,
and Google AdWords

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.090
has been very kind to us.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:53.120
But anyway, one of my
favorite negotiating stories

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.870
that comes from the
Middle East is a story

00:40:54.870 --> 00:41:01.240
about three brothers, who
receive an inheritance

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.630
from their father of 17 camels.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.230
And the older son
receives half the camels.

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.730
The middle son receives
a third of the camels,

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.660
and the youngest son, he
receives a ninth of the camels.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.190
Well, three sons fall to
dividing up their inheritance.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:21.290
But 17 doesn't divide by 2
and it doesn't divide by 3

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:22.880
and it doesn't divide by 9.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.380
So they get into a
big of a quarrel,

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.750
and each one wants more.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.620
And brotherly tempers
start to get strained,

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.920
and there's almost violence.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.060
Finally, in desperation,
they go and they

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.030
consult a wise old woman.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:36.340
And the wise old woman,
like a good boss,

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.840
thinks about their
problem and says,

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.150
well, I don't have an answer.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:42.740
But if you want,
let me empower you.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:43.830
You can have my camel.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.880
I have one camel.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.000
So the three sons say, OK.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.010
So then they have 18 camels.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:53.760
Well, 18 does divide by 2, so
the first son takes his half.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.041
Half of 18 is 9.

00:41:56.041 --> 00:41:57.450
18 does divide by 3.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:00.226
The second son takes
his third, which is 6.

00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:02.126
18 does divide by 9.

00:42:02.126 --> 00:42:04.700
The third son takes his
ninth, which is two.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.590
You add 9 and 6, 15, plus 2, 17.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.430
They have one camel left over.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.250
They give it back to
the wise old woman.

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:17.240
Now if you think about
that problem for a moment,

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.430
I think it resembles a
little bit the negotiations

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:21.810
that we often get involved.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:25.050
There seems to be, 17 camels,
no way to divide it up.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:28.230
Somehow what we need to do is
to learn to take a step back

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:31.430
to the balcony, change
our assumptions,

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:33.600
and look for an 18th camel.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:38.610
And my suggestion
is that 18th camel

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.360
might in fact be ourselves.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.720
If we can get to
yes with ourselves,

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.077
we're much more likely to
get to yes with others.

00:42:45.077 --> 00:42:45.910
Thank you very much.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.950
So we have some time for
some questions about anything

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.925
in this field of
negotiation, [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:58.925 --> 00:43:00.300
AUDIENCE: You
talked a little bit

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.430
about this at the beginning,
but over your career

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:07.260
with negotiations, how do you
see the internet and technology

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.270
and even Google and Facebook
changing what you do

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.577
and changing how
negotiations happen?

00:43:12.577 --> 00:43:14.160
You talked about how
the hierarchy was

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.535
flattening and
doing [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:15.535 --> 00:43:18.617
And so there's
more negotiations.

00:43:18.617 --> 00:43:20.450
To me, it seems like
you see a lot of people

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:22.469
going out and broadcasting
on social media

00:43:22.469 --> 00:43:24.260
and trying to stake
out their own positions

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.968
and making it harder
to negotiate, maybe.

00:43:25.968 --> 00:43:27.630
WILLIAM URY: For
sure-- you know,

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.460
it cuts in a lot
of different ways.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.540
But one thing that
is very clear-- it's

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:32.970
changing the framework.

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:36.340
A lot of people are taking
their negotiations online,

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.890
in many ways.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:43.949
And in terms of conflicts
like that, you see-- I mean,

00:43:43.949 --> 00:43:44.990
it's partly the internet.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:47.890
It's partly cable TV and so on.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.200
But you see a segmenting,
where people are only

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:55.360
talking to people
who agree with them.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.750
And you see a lot of kind of
use of inflammatory rhetoric

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:05.240
that goes online and that
before wasn't broadcast.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.400
Or you see, for example,
I mean right now you see,

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.080
like, ISIS has gotten
very social media savvy.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.940
They're doing these horrific
beheadings with social media

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:17.830
and using that.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:23.140
So I think we're just in this
first generation of figuring

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:26.010
out how do we deal
with our differences

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:29.460
given this whole new
way of communicating.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.490
And we're in this mix, too.

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:34.870
I think the form of
decision making is shifting,

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.250
but what's also
happening, I see,

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:42.570
is that nowadays everyone
wants to participate

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.520
in decisions that affect them.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.729
People are not nearly as
passive as they were before.

00:44:47.729 --> 00:44:49.978
You know, they were saying,
OK, let the leader decide.

00:44:49.978 --> 00:44:51.660
No, everyone wants
to have a voice,

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.260
and you're starting to show
this up in social media.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:58.920
And so in a funny way,
this negotiation revolution

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.060
means, at least in the short
run, a lot more conflict.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.520
Because a lot of conflict that
was suppressed and avoided

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.890
before, injustice that
there were never addressed,

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.580
are now coming to the surface.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.910
And so it's actually to me,
in the field of conflict

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:18.560
resolution, I see the task
facing humanity right now

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.630
is not so much how we settle.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:23.130
We can't settle all
these conflicts.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.870
The question is, can
we transform conflicts?

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:31.060
Can we change their form from a
violent and destructive form--

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.770
even violent in terms of words,
like you're talking about.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:38.640
Can we learn to use more
constructive and cooperative

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.640
language, even as we
carry on a struggle?

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.060
Because with all the
injustice in the world,

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.910
we maybe need conflict,
actually, to engage it.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:49.370
But can we learn to do
that in an engaging way?

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:52.360
And what I found,
like 35 years ago when

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.660
I started in this field, there
were no courses on negotiation.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:46:00.980
Now there's every business
school, law school,

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.020
school of government,
corporations, you know,

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:04.830
Google-- we have courses.

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:09.100
But I think we're in
the infancy of learning.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:13.140
And what I would love to see
is the kind of creativity

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.760
and the genius that
goes on here at Google

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.930
and kind of better forms
of software and everything,

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:21.710
but used on the software
of human relationships

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:25.270
and used on the software of how
we deal with our differences.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:27.860
And to me, that's
the great challenge.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:32.540
And I would love to see the
mix of looking for the best

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.310
kind of new methods,
new processes,

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:39.040
married together with technology
and see what that would do.

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.360
Because I'm an optimist.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.770
I happen to believe-- or at
least I'm a potentialist.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.120
I really think that human
beings have the potential,

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.120
but I think the
jury is still out.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:55.720
We've got this technology
that's being used for weapons.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.750
Can we take the same
technology and use it for,

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:03.570
as you're using it for,
better forms of communication.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.690
AUDIENCE: I had a question about
just different kind of thoughts

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:10.250
or voices that you might
have going on inside.

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:12.680
So with kind of
the balcony view,

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:16.790
you get to really take
perspective, take a step back.

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:20.010
But then, like, do you
have any personal stories

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:23.530
on your journey to
developing that balcony

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.740
and really being
able to figure out

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.580
which voice inside
your head to say yes to

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:33.100
and developing that awareness
for which ones to say yes to?

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.310
WILLIAM URY: Yeah,
a good question.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:36.720
Yeah, I mean, this is something.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.386
I was just talking
with Meng about this.

00:47:38.386 --> 00:47:46.640
But for me, yeah, it
began with-- everyone

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.200
has their favorite ways
of going to the balcony.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.530
Meditation, for example, is a
wonderful, time-honored, old

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:54.740
practice.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.990
And for me, personally,
one thing I love to do

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:01.026
is-- you have the advantage
here of using nature.

00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.400
What I like to do
is I like to go

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.740
for walks, just to
kind of clear my mind.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:11.660
Like, for example, when
I was in Venezuela.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.560
You need to look for what
methodologies work for you.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.340
I mean, for me, I
was looking for ways

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:20.650
that kind of, like, change
the rhythm of my brain

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:22.950
a little bit, just
kind of put myself

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:27.750
into more of a calm state
so that I could clear.

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:31.460
And then what I learned was
just a simple rule of thumb,

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:35.120
for example, that
helped me was, don't

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.070
make an important
decision at the table.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:39.820
In other words, when
someone's asking you,

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.440
OK, what's your bottom line?

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.585
What's this?

00:48:42.585 --> 00:48:45.495
Just say, let me
get back to you.

00:48:45.495 --> 00:48:47.480
I'll get back to
you this afternoon.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:48.850
I'll get back to you in an hour.

00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:52.400
I'll get back to you
tomorrow morning.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.330
Just what that
did was it allowed

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:59.632
me, then, to go to a balcony and
try to go to a place of clarity

00:48:59.632 --> 00:49:00.590
so that I could listen.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:06.450
Because I find that the
mind's a little bit like water

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:07.450
that comes out of a tap.

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:09.170
There's lot of fizz in it.

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:12.860
And if you can just put it aside
for five minutes, you know,

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.750
the fizz clears and
you can clarify it.

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:18.550
So I've sort of
learned to do that.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:20.570
And I think everyone will
have their own method

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.650
for doing that, of how
you kind of clarify.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:27.280
But just buying time, buying
a little bit of time--

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.100
and I know that in
today's day and age,

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.822
we're being asked to make
quicker decisions, quicker

00:49:34.822 --> 00:49:36.280
things, partly due
to the internet,

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.880
you know, the response rate.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.166
It used to be write a letter.

00:49:39.166 --> 00:49:40.790
It took two weeks to
get back a letter.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:42.289
Now people want an
answer in an hour

00:49:42.289 --> 00:49:45.040
because they just sent
you a text or an email.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:50.720
But to me the motto is
in a fast age like this,

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.450
there's a paradox, which
is if you want to go fast,

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:56.220
you need to go slow.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:00.790
There's a paradox of looking
for ways to slow it down,

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:05.130
even if it's just a few seconds
or a few minutes-- breathing,

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:08.862
for example, as a technique.

00:50:08.862 --> 00:50:10.570
It just brings more
oxygen to your brain.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:13.780
It's just kind of, like, take
a couple deep breaths and just

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.420
be careful about making
decisions right on the spot.

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.670
And that's been helpful to me.

00:50:21.392 --> 00:50:23.100
And then I mean the
other thing I'll say,

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:31.920
too, is that I'm amazed
at how if I do that,

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:32.920
it's like a muscle.

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.630
You develop more,
but you get clarity

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.750
about which voice to listen to.

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:39.000
It becomes clear.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.210
And then if I can't do that,
sometimes you can use a friend.

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:45.560
You can use a friend as your
balcony or a couple of friends

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.200
because sometimes we're
blind to our own blind spots.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.265
But the friends can
see them more easily.

00:50:51.265 --> 00:50:52.890
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you for being here.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:55.070
A quick question about
cultural differences

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:58.140
to people negotiating--
so in your experience,

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:01.040
you've seen a lot of different
types of cultures negotiate.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:05.190
Do you think there's one
universal way that people

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:06.620
are wired to
negotiate, or do you

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.147
think there are true
cultural differences to how

00:51:09.147 --> 00:51:09.855
people negotiate?

00:51:12.122 --> 00:51:14.080
WILLIAM URY: I'm an
anthropologist by training,

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.610
so I have a bias here,
I'll have to say.

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.270
But I do think there are
strong cultural differences.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.700
And that's not to say
that there are not

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:26.030
some universal principles or
some universal-- so there are.

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:30.280
There's maybe a kind of an
under structure of universality,

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.610
but then the way
in which those get

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:34.650
manifested-- very
different in cultures.

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:36.590
Because cultures are
like communication

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.370
They're like languages.

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:40.780
And so they're just different
ways of communicating,

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.700
but, like, there are
a lot of assumptions

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:43.950
that are embedded in cultures.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:49.190
Like, for example, around
time-- American culture

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:53.120
is one of the most impatient
cultures on the planet.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:59.400
But if you go to other cultures
around the world-- for us,

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.186
time is money.

00:52:00.186 --> 00:52:01.310
That's the expression here.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:02.510
Time is money.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.170
In most other places,
time is relationship.

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:08.140
And we want to go there
and do a quick deal,

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.700
and they're saying, whoa,
hold on for a moment.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.420
We haven't established
a relationship

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.790
that builds the necessary trust.

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:21.110
Or, for example, what's
the nature of an agreement?

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:23.990
We have a highly
legalized culture.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.760
There are more lawyers,
say, in the city

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:31.840
of Los Angeles than there are
in the whole country of Japan.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.110
Because we're used
to saying, OK, we're

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:36.620
going to have a legal culture.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.922
And if you don't
keep your contract,

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:39.880
we're going to sue you.

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.830
And we've got this whole thing.

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:44.210
In many other
cultures, they don't

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:45.810
depend on the courts for that.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:49.270
What they depend on is having
built long-term relationships,

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:51.905
so that's the way in which
they achieve compliance.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:57.580
One last thing I'll
say about culture--

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:02.810
this could go on for awhile--
is I had a friend, a colleague,

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:04.960
who was one of the
first anthropologists

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:09.180
to really look at
cross-cultural communication.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.720
His name was Edward Hall.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:14.180
And he coined a distinction
I find very useful, which

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.520
is he said, cultures are
like communication systems.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.860
And he defined it
like a continuum,

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.420
from what he called
low-context communication

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.580
to high-context communication.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:28.470
In low-context communication,
the content is pretty much

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:30.000
all you need to see.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.534
In high-context communication,
you get the content.

00:53:32.534 --> 00:53:34.200
But if you don't
understand the context,

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.690
you don't understand anything.

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:38.140
So a classic example
of high-context culture

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:43.220
would be in East Asia,
say, Japan, for example.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.100
One classic
negotiation in Japan,

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.150
historically, was
when the Shogun, who

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.730
was the military dictator of
Japan a couple centuries ago.

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:56.060
When he ceded power to the
emperor, what did he do?

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.910
He paid a visit to the Emperor.

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:01.490
They had some tea together,
and then he went away.

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:03.070
Note, there was no
signed agreement,

00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:04.740
I wasn't handing over
power to him, like that.

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.080
But it was very clear to
everyone in Japan what had just

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.800
happened because he
went to the Emperor.

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.907
The Emperor didn't
go to him, and they

00:54:11.907 --> 00:54:12.865
understood the context.

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:18.720
But the US is a lower
context culture.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.636
So that we'll send, for
example, Google or whatever,

00:54:21.636 --> 00:54:23.010
you'll send someone
down to, say,

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:26.500
Latin America, which is
a higher context culture.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.530
And you'll send someone
who is the most capable,

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:30.250
the one who knows
the most knowledge.

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.250
He's got all the facts
and everything like that,

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:34.994
but they may be 22 for 25.

00:54:34.994 --> 00:54:36.410
And they show up
in Latin America,

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:37.576
and they say, wait a minute.

00:54:39.842 --> 00:54:42.330
They just sent us a kid.

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.420
Because for them the
social context of,

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.049
wait a minute, who is this
person in relation to who

00:54:47.049 --> 00:54:47.590
and whatever?

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:49.400
Are we supposed to
trust this person?

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.230
So they may not put as much
emphasis on the content

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:53.800
as we do in this culture.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.590
And so understanding
those differences

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:57.269
is really important.

00:54:57.269 --> 00:54:58.810
MALE SPEAKER: Having
said that, thank

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:00.240
you very much for
speaking with us today.

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.740
We'll do a book
signing in the back,

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:04.010
and you can check out
his book on Google Play

00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:05.860
and wherever books are sold.

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:10.790
WILLIAM URY: Great,
and thank you.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:13.820
May you get to yes with
yourself and with others.

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:18.370
And more information about me,
if you ever want to contact me

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:20.021
or whatever, there's
my information.

00:55:20.021 --> 00:55:21.270
But it's been a real pleasure.

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:24.990
I really enjoyed it, and I'm
happy to sign a few books.
