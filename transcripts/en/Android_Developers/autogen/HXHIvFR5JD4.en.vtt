that if you know if you consider some of
 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.250
that if you know if you consider some of
these things then we're really going to

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260
these things then we're really going to
 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.960
these things then we're really going to
be able to consider this as a really

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970
be able to consider this as a really
 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.730

the thing is is that those touch targets

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380
the thing is is that those touch targets
 

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.220
the thing is is that those touch targets
are less than 40 dips square which means

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:52.230
are less than 40 dips square which means
 

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.690
are less than 40 dips square which means
they're really too small to hit with

these sorts of apps you're not expecting
 

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.390
these sorts of apps you're not expecting
to be touch targets because they're too

00:08:59.390 --> 00:08:59.400
to be touch targets because they're too
 

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.460
to be touch targets because they're too
small to be real touch targets so you

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:01.470
small to be real touch targets so you
 

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.720
small to be real touch targets so you
really want to make sure that all these

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:02.730
really want to make sure that all these
 

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.280

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.139
getting involved and in this is an area
with the it's probably the area with the

00:12:56.139 --> 00:12:56.149
with the it's probably the area with the
 

00:12:56.149 --> 00:12:58.059
with the it's probably the area with the
most low-hanging fruit that you can

00:12:58.059 --> 00:12:58.069
most low-hanging fruit that you can
 

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:00.369
most low-hanging fruit that you can
harvest in the form of getting new users

00:13:00.369 --> 00:13:00.379
harvest in the form of getting new users
 

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.740
harvest in the form of getting new users
and so the further that feeling is also

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:02.750
and so the further that feeling is also
 

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.900
and so the further that feeling is also
using some non-standard UX mechanisms so

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:04.910
using some non-standard UX mechanisms so
 

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.910
using some non-standard UX mechanisms so
if you go to add a team you do that by

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920
if you go to add a team you do that by
 

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.860
if you go to add a team you do that by
searching and it will sort of start

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:08.870
searching and it will sort of start
 

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.389
searching and it will sort of start
searching through the database and have

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399
searching through the database and have
 

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:12.249
searching through the database and have
a little modal dialog that says hit back

00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:12.259
a little modal dialog that says hit back
 

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:14.620
a little modal dialog that says hit back
if you want to stop searching we

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:14.630
if you want to stop searching we
 

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.949
if you want to stop searching we
makes sense but is weird and confusing

00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:17.959
makes sense but is weird and confusing
 

00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:19.749
makes sense but is weird and confusing
and just doesn't feel right well anytime

00:13:19.749 --> 00:13:19.759
and just doesn't feel right well anytime
 

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:22.660
and just doesn't feel right well anytime
you have to put text on your screen that

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:22.670
you have to put text on your screen that
 

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.759
you have to put text on your screen that
says hit this button to do something

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:24.769
says hit this button to do something
 

00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:26.889
says hit this button to do something
you've done it wrong yeah exactly you

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:26.899
you've done it wrong yeah exactly you
 

00:13:26.899 --> 00:13:28.329
you've done it wrong yeah exactly you
want everything to be as intuitive as

00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:28.339
want everything to be as intuitive as
 

00:13:28.339 --> 00:13:30.850
want everything to be as intuitive as
possible to just feel normal feel like

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:30.860
possible to just feel normal feel like
 

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.829
possible to just feel normal feel like
it's the right way and to further that

00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839
it's the right way and to further that
 

00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:36.730
it's the right way and to further that
feeling is there's also things like well

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:36.740
feeling is there's also things like well
 

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.379
feeling is there's also things like well
no I mean that's really it the risk here

00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:38.389
no I mean that's really it the risk here
 

00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:41.110
no I mean that's really it the risk here
is that you're going to be making giving

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120
is that you're going to be making giving
 

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.370
is that you're going to be making giving
people unfamiliar things and they're

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:42.380
people unfamiliar things and they're
 

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.680
people unfamiliar things and they're
going to find that intimidating once you

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:44.690
going to find that intimidating once you
 

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.930
going to find that intimidating once you
get some data into the app you can see

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:46.940
get some data into the app you can see
 

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.879
get some data into the app you can see
that that depth and breadth of coverage

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:48.889
that that depth and breadth of coverage
 

00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:51.009
that that depth and breadth of coverage
is there which is a great stuff so I

00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:51.019
is there which is a great stuff so I
 

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:52.840
is there which is a great stuff so I
really think that the next step for the

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:52.850
really think that the next step for the
 

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.069
really think that the next step for the
developers here is to sit down and

00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079
developers here is to sit down and
 

00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:55.930
developers here is to sit down and
really think about a design that's

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:55.940
really think about a design that's
 

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.519
really think about a design that's
really going to draw users in something

00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:57.529
really going to draw users in something
 

00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:00.160
really going to draw users in something
clean something intuitive easy to use

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.170
clean something intuitive easy to use
 

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.019
clean something intuitive easy to use
and I think that's probably the next

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:02.029
and I think that's probably the next
 

00:14:02.029 --> 00:14:03.759
and I think that's probably the next
step here before we go into too much

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:03.769
step here before we go into too much
 

00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:05.620
step here before we go into too much
detail there so the last step we're

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:05.630
detail there so the last step we're
 

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.379
detail there so the last step we're
going to look at today is spory it is

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:08.389
going to look at today is spory it is
 

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:12.879
going to look at today is spory it is
I love the banner I hate the icon it's a

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:12.889
I love the banner I hate the icon it's a
 

00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:14.769
I love the banner I hate the icon it's a
rounded rectangle with a gradient feel

00:14:14.769 --> 00:14:14.779
rounded rectangle with a gradient feel
 

00:14:14.779 --> 00:14:16.540
rounded rectangle with a gradient feel
like I'm looking at your banner and I'm

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:16.550
like I'm looking at your banner and I'm
 

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.400
like I'm looking at your banner and I'm
seeing like real branding there it's

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:18.410
seeing like real branding there it's
 

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.309
seeing like real branding there it's
like strong colors strong images you

00:14:21.309 --> 00:14:21.319
like strong colors strong images you
 

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:24.100
like strong colors strong images you
know something very distinctive and then

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.110
know something very distinctive and then
 

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.639
know something very distinctive and then
I look at the logo that's like it's it's

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:27.649
I look at the logo that's like it's it's
 

00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:29.230
I look at the logo that's like it's it's
so sort of generic and boring it's got

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240
so sort of generic and boring it's got
 

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.210
so sort of generic and boring it's got
the right guy whatever is yeah why

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:31.220
the right guy whatever is yeah why
 

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.629
the right guy whatever is yeah why
haven't they used their their football

00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639
haven't they used their their football
 

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:38.050
haven't they used their their football
player silhouette in the iconic fit well

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:38.060
player silhouette in the iconic fit well
 

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.090
player silhouette in the iconic fit well
it would look nice it would get you out

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:40.100
it would look nice it would get you out
 

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.829
it would look nice it would get you out
of that whole rounded rectangle with a

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839
of that whole rounded rectangle with a
 

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.290
of that whole rounded rectangle with a
little shiny part yeah exactly so I

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:44.300
little shiny part yeah exactly so I
 

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.150
little shiny part yeah exactly so I
think that that would be in a really

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160
think that that would be in a really
 

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.220
think that that would be in a really
easy way I think to straightaway make

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:48.230
easy way I think to straightaway make
 

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.960
easy way I think to straightaway make
this landing page even more distinctive

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:49.970
this landing page even more distinctive
 

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.460
this landing page even more distinctive
and more than that once the app is

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:51.470
and more than that once the app is
 

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.280
and more than that once the app is
installed the users have a lot of apps

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:54.290
installed the users have a lot of apps
 

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.749
installed the users have a lot of apps
installed right you need to make your

00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759
installed right you need to make your
 

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:57.009
installed right you need to make your
icon from in which people are going to

00:14:57.009 --> 00:14:57.019
icon from in which people are going to
 

00:14:57.019 --> 00:14:58.480
icon from in which people are going to
remember and you can see that they've

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:58.490
remember and you can see that they've
 

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.019
remember and you can see that they've
stuck a little football in here which is

00:15:02.019 --> 00:15:02.029
stuck a little football in here which is
 

00:15:02.029 --> 00:15:04.360
stuck a little football in here which is
almost a hint that like well we used to

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:04.370
almost a hint that like well we used to
 

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.150
almost a hint that like well we used to
have just the the logo and no one knew

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160
have just the the logo and no one knew
 

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.069
have just the the logo and no one knew
what the hell it was so we added the

00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079
what the hell it was so we added the
 

00:15:09.079 --> 00:15:10.929
what the hell it was so we added the
football and so people have it but now

00:15:10.929 --> 00:15:10.939
football and so people have it but now
 

00:15:10.939 --> 00:15:12.100
football and so people have it but now
it looks like you're part of the

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.110
it looks like you're part of the
 

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.480
it looks like you're part of the
football Network or something yeah

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:13.490
football Network or something yeah

football Network or something yeah
exactly

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:14.060
exactly
 

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.480
exactly
looks like a badge exactly right so

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:16.490
looks like a badge exactly right so
 

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.350
looks like a badge exactly right so
you're heading in the right direction

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360
you're heading in the right direction
 

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.170
you're heading in the right direction
but keep going there I think is the the

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:20.180
but keep going there I think is the the
 

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.179
but keep going there I think is the the
big tip I mean this is nitpicky stuff

00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:22.189
big tip I mean this is nitpicky stuff
 

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:23.679
big tip I mean this is nitpicky stuff
but from a lot of what we've been

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:23.689
but from a lot of what we've been
 

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:25.269
but from a lot of what we've been
hearing from developers is they want to

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279
hearing from developers is they want to
 

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:27.189
hearing from developers is they want to
get more downloads they want to have

00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199
get more downloads they want to have
 

00:15:27.199 --> 00:15:28.530
get more downloads they want to have
more successful merchants

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:28.540
more successful merchants
 

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.450
more successful merchants
and it's these little nitpicky things

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:30.460
and it's these little nitpicky things
 

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.550
and it's these little nitpicky things
which us as developers were like come on

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560
which us as developers were like come on
 

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.230
which us as developers were like come on
it's just an icon who cares well in

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240
it's just an icon who cares well in
 

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.490
it's just an icon who cares well in
speaking of merchandise and remember the

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:35.500
speaking of merchandise and remember the
 

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.590
speaking of merchandise and remember the
way that people bought your app was by

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600
way that people bought your app was by
 

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.720
way that people bought your app was by
looking at this banner that's far and

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:39.730
looking at this banner that's far and
 

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.550
looking at this banner that's far and
away the most important first impression

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:41.560
away the most important first impression
 

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.990
away the most important first impression
they're going to get and then once they

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000
they're going to get and then once they
 

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.120
they're going to get and then once they
download it there's nothing about that

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.130
download it there's nothing about that
 

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.550
download it there's nothing about that
banner that translates into the icon

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560
banner that translates into the icon
 

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.700
banner that translates into the icon
except for some subtleties of the color

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:50.710
except for some subtleties of the color
 

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.740
except for some subtleties of the color
scheme and it's not a very unusual color

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:52.750
scheme and it's not a very unusual color
 

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.680
scheme and it's not a very unusual color
scheme so I don't think I'd be able to

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:55.690
scheme so I don't think I'd be able to
 

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.300
scheme so I don't think I'd be able to
find it later on secondly you want to

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:57.310
find it later on secondly you want to
 

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.620
find it later on secondly you want to
make sure people can find it up they've

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:58.630
make sure people can find it up they've
 

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.910
make sure people can find it up they've
installed because a lot of people will

installed because a lot of people will

had so I don't know if they tested this
 

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.730
had so I don't know if they tested this
on larger devices or they just have

that's why we don't use that hands when

that's why we don't use that hands when
we play soccer yeah now I understand oh

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:06.730
we play soccer yeah now I understand oh
 

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.220
we play soccer yeah now I understand oh
that's the answers the whole question

that's the answers the whole question
 

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.949
that's the answers the whole question
for me so yeah we need to make sure that

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959
for me so yeah we need to make sure that
 

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:13.050
for me so yeah we need to make sure that
the touch targets are a little larger

and there's also a lot of features that

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:14.770
and there's also a lot of features that
 

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.710
and there's also a lot of features that
almost feels like the problem here is

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720
almost feels like the problem here is
 

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.470
almost feels like the problem here is
that the app didn't want to add too many

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480
that the app didn't want to add too many
 

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.300
that the app didn't want to add too many
activities or too many screens so they

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:21.310
activities or too many screens so they
 

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.210
activities or too many screens so they

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.400
tried to cram everything into one screen
and then it became a little bit

unfortunate because one of the things
 

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.080
unfortunate because one of the things
that I think is absolutely crucial with

an app like this is to have animations
 

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.340
an app like this is to have animations
everywhere because you need to

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:34.350
everywhere because you need to
 

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.430
everywhere because you need to
understand which data you're leaving and

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440
understand which data you're leaving and
 

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.620
understand which data you're leaving and
which data is coming in if it just kind

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:39.630
which data is coming in if it just kind
 

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.570

easily to mentally lose your place and
so I wanted to highlight this because

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:45.180
so I wanted to highlight this because
 

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.490
so I wanted to highlight this because
there's actually the only one of the

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500
there's actually the only one of the
 

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.720
there's actually the only one of the
three apps we're looking at today which

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:47.730
three apps we're looking at today which
 

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.120
three apps we're looking at today which
has a tablet implementation and this is

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.130
has a tablet implementation and this is
 

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.950
has a tablet implementation and this is
a really good example of a kind of app

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960
a really good example of a kind of app
 

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.660
a really good example of a kind of app
which would do well to have such an

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:53.670
which would do well to have such an
 

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.430
which would do well to have such an
implementation because a lot of people

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440
implementation because a lot of people
 

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.810
implementation because a lot of people
are going to be sitting on their couch

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820
are going to be sitting on their couch
 

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.340
are going to be sitting on their couch
with their tablets in their hands maybe

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:58.350
with their tablets in their hands maybe
 

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.620

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:17.730
version for your tablet owners so how
 

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.300
version for your tablet owners so how
did they do it how did these developers

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:20.310
did they do it how did these developers
 

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.370
did they do it how did these developers
create apps which have all of this data

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380
create apps which have all of this data
 

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.830
create apps which have all of this data
which gets updated really frequently

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840
which gets updated really frequently
 

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.570
which gets updated really frequently
keep it all fresh keep it all low

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580
keep it all fresh keep it all low

batteries so I'm going to spend the last

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:29.610
batteries so I'm going to spend the last
 

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.790
batteries so I'm going to spend the last
few minutes of today's app clinic doing

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:31.800
few minutes of today's app clinic doing
 

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.830
few minutes of today's app clinic doing
a bit of a deep dive into low latency

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840
a bit of a deep dive into low latency
 

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.950
a bit of a deep dive into low latency
updates which still effectively use the

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960
updates which still effectively use the
 

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.910
updates which still effectively use the
battery so where do you start off so a

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:40.920
battery so where do you start off so a
 

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.090
battery so where do you start off so a
good app is like a good Butler right so

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100
good app is like a good Butler right so
 

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.270
good app is like a good Butler right so
you are going to want to have all of

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280
you are going to want to have all of
 

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.520
you are going to want to have all of
that data on screen as quickly as you

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:49.530
that data on screen as quickly as you
 

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.430
that data on screen as quickly as you
can I love the fact that you have this

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440
can I love the fact that you have this
 

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.870
can I love the fact that you have this
later you've been using this slide for

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880
later you've been using this slide for
 

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.270
later you've been using this slide for
years and and yet it resonates with me

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:56.280
years and and yet it resonates with me
 

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.130
years and and yet it resonates with me
not at all because I've never had a

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140
not at all because I've never had a
 

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.670
not at all because I've never had a
butler good or otherwise uh closest I've

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:01.680
butler good or otherwise uh closest I've
 

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.100
butler good or otherwise uh closest I've
ever come is down Yardley marathon nice

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:04.110
ever come is down Yardley marathon nice
 

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:05.540
ever come is down Yardley marathon nice
well that's yeah that's my experience

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:05.550
well that's yeah that's my experience
 

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.220
well that's yeah that's my experience
with a butler as well but you know

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:07.230
with a butler as well but you know
 

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.950
with a butler as well but you know
um see if you can can squeeze that into

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960
um see if you can can squeeze that into
 

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.150
um see if you can can squeeze that into
a slightly smaller look on screen there

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:14.160
a slightly smaller look on screen there
 

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.860
a slightly smaller look on screen there
you go

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:15.870
you go
 

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.659
you go
okay so what we're saying here is really

00:22:17.659 --> 00:22:17.669
okay so what we're saying here is really
 

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:19.010
okay so what we're saying here is really
is that you want to have your

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020
is that you want to have your
 

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.390
is that you want to have your
information you want to have it when you

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400
information you want to have it when you
 

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.890
information you want to have it when you
want it you don't want to wait for it at

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900
want it you don't want to wait for it at
 

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.200
want it you don't want to wait for it at
all and so what that translates into is

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:24.210
all and so what that translates into is
 

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.270
all and so what that translates into is
that you need to figure out what that

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280
that you need to figure out what that
 

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.370
that you need to figure out what that
trade-off is between latency and battery

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380
trade-off is between latency and battery
 

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.680
trade-off is between latency and battery
life so basically you know the less

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:30.690
life so basically you know the less
 

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.200
life so basically you know the less
latency you have the shorter battery

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:33.210
latency you have the shorter battery
 

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.640
latency you have the shorter battery
life you have and the reality is that

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:34.650
life you have and the reality is that
 

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.860
life you have and the reality is that
that trade-off for most users it wants

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:36.870
that trade-off for most users it wants
 

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.840
that trade-off for most users it wants
to be here right you want to have

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:38.850
to be here right you want to have
 

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.080
to be here right you want to have
maximum battery life zero latency which

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.090
maximum battery life zero latency which
 

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.780
maximum battery life zero latency which
is kind of a hard trick to pull off but

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:44.790
is kind of a hard trick to pull off but
 

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.549
is kind of a hard trick to pull off but
what that translates into for us as

00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559
what that translates into for us as
 

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:48.169
what that translates into for us as
developers is you need to make a

00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179
developers is you need to make a
 

00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:49.610
developers is you need to make a
compromise you need to make a decision

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620
compromise you need to make a decision
 

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.470
compromise you need to make a decision
about how are you going to do those

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480
about how are you going to do those
 

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.880
about how are you going to do those
downloads when are you going to do those

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:52.890
downloads when are you going to do those
 

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.650
downloads when are you going to do those
downloads now it's obvious to say that

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:54.660
downloads now it's obvious to say that
 

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.560
downloads now it's obvious to say that
you should do transfer as little info as

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:57.570
you should do transfer as little info as
 

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.810
you should do transfer as little info as
you can as infrequently as you can but

00:22:59.810 --> 00:22:59.820
you can as infrequently as you can but
 

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.460
you can as infrequently as you can but
for apps like this that doesn't really

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:01.470
for apps like this that doesn't really
 

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.620
for apps like this that doesn't really
work you need the data it needs to come

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:03.630
work you need the data it needs to come
 

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.060
work you need the data it needs to come
in there's lots of it that's a big

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:05.070
in there's lots of it that's a big
 

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:06.680
in there's lots of it that's a big
strength of the app so you need to

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:06.690
strength of the app so you need to
 

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.000
strength of the app so you need to
figure out how can you do it efficiently

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.010
figure out how can you do it efficiently
 

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.730
figure out how can you do it efficiently
now it turns out that the way that the

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740
now it turns out that the way that the
 

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.500
now it turns out that the way that the
mobile radio state works actually

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:12.510
mobile radio state works actually
 

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.909
mobile radio state works actually
impacts how you need to make that

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919
impacts how you need to make that
 

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:16.310
impacts how you need to make that
decision so the way it actually works is

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320
decision so the way it actually works is
 

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.200
decision so the way it actually works is
it'll be on standby mode drawing as

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:18.210
it'll be on standby mode drawing as
 

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.900
it'll be on standby mode drawing as
little battery current as possible then

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:20.910
little battery current as possible then
 

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.289
little battery current as possible then
as soon as someone or some app wants to

00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299
as soon as someone or some app wants to
 

00:23:24.299 --> 00:23:25.640
as soon as someone or some app wants to
download data it's going to power up

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:25.650
download data it's going to power up
 

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.230
download data it's going to power up
that radio that takes a couple of

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240
that radio that takes a couple of
 

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.240
that radio that takes a couple of
seconds of latency then the radio is

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:29.250
seconds of latency then the radio is
 

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.980
seconds of latency then the radio is
going to be on full power transmitting

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:30.990
going to be on full power transmitting

every time they click a link so we're
 

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.590
every time they click a link so we're

tell us well it means that if you've got

00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799
tell us well it means that if you've got

go back into full stand but I know one
 

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.500
go back into full stand but I know one
of one of the saddest things about this

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:22.510
of one of the saddest things about this
 

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.260
of one of the saddest things about this
particular behavior is that something

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:25.270
particular behavior is that something

particular behavior is that something
that you know if you were on a desktop

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:27.280
that you know if you were on a desktop
 

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.750
that you know if you were on a desktop
would make a huge amount of sense is is

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760
would make a huge amount of sense is is
 

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.890
would make a huge amount of sense is is
horrible for a mobile environment and

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:31.900
horrible for a mobile environment and
 

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.260
horrible for a mobile environment and
that's going and checking to see if

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:34.270
that's going and checking to see if
 

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.340
that's going and checking to see if
there's anything you need to download

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:35.350
there's anything you need to download
 

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.830
there's anything you need to download
exactly it's just as expensive in many

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840
exactly it's just as expensive in many
 

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.290
exactly it's just as expensive in many
cases to do an entire download as it is

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:40.300
cases to do an entire download as it is
 

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.630
cases to do an entire download as it is
to just check and see if something is

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640
to just check and see if something is
 

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.730
to just check and see if something is
available precisely and so all of the

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:44.740
available precisely and so all of the
 

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.660
available precisely and so all of the
things which we're going to be talking

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:45.670
things which we're going to be talking
 

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.550
things which we're going to be talking
about now are ways in which you can make

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:47.560
about now are ways in which you can make
 

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.590
about now are ways in which you can make
sure that all your data transfers happen

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600
sure that all your data transfers happen
 

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.750
sure that all your data transfers happen
basically in one go so you're already

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760
basically in one go so you're already
 

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.340
basically in one go so you're already
paying the price of bringing up the

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:53.350
paying the price of bringing up the
 

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.680
paying the price of bringing up the
batter the the radio getting the battery

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:55.690
batter the the radio getting the battery
 

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.600
batter the the radio getting the battery
drain associated with that just do all

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:57.610
drain associated with that just do all
 

00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.700
drain associated with that just do all
of your transfers as much as you can and

00:24:59.700 --> 00:24:59.710
of your transfers as much as you can and
 

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.560
of your transfers as much as you can and
so what that comes down to is doing

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:01.570
so what that comes down to is doing
 

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.360
so what that comes down to is doing
things like prefetching so if you're

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:03.370
things like prefetching so if you're
 

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.680
things like prefetching so if you're
going to be downloading some data

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:04.690
going to be downloading some data
 

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.660
going to be downloading some data
download a bunch of data it's going to

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:06.670
download a bunch of data it's going to
 

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.180
download a bunch of data it's going to
be more efficient batch and bundle and

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:09.190
be more efficient batch and bundle and
 

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.430
be more efficient batch and bundle and
preempt so anytime you've got data which

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440
preempt so anytime you've got data which
 

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.350
preempt so anytime you've got data which
isn't or a transfer which isn't

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360
isn't or a transfer which isn't
 

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.330
isn't or a transfer which isn't
particularly time-sensitive just batch

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:15.340
particularly time-sensitive just batch
 

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.950
particularly time-sensitive just batch
it just hold on and then the next time

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960
it just hold on and then the next time
 

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.880
it just hold on and then the next time
you have something which is

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:17.890
you have something which is
 

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.890
you have something which is
time-sensitive send it all in one go

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:19.900
time-sensitive send it all in one go
 

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.720
time-sensitive send it all in one go
this is particularly useful for things

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:21.730
this is particularly useful for things
 

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.550
this is particularly useful for things
like ads for analytics anything like

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:23.560
like ads for analytics anything like
 

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.890
like ads for analytics anything like
that which isn't time-sensitive you know

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:25.900
that which isn't time-sensitive you know
 

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.630
that which isn't time-sensitive you know
this is actually the hardest thing to

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:27.640
this is actually the hardest thing to
 

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.020
this is actually the hardest thing to
for a beginner to implement but once you

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.030
for a beginner to implement but once you
 

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.090
for a beginner to implement but once you
get into the habit of doing it this way

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:33.100
get into the habit of doing it this way
 

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.400
get into the habit of doing it this way
it becomes a beautiful way to implement

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:35.410
it becomes a beautiful way to implement
 

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.720
it becomes a beautiful way to implement
your app that all of the all the data

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:39.730
your app that all of the all the data
 

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.060
your app that all of the all the data
that you're planning to transfer is kept

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.070
that you're planning to transfer is kept
 

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.030
that you're planning to transfer is kept

network is and download more data if we

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:45.180
network is and download more data if we
 

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:45.500
network is and download more data if we
have a

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:45.510
have a
 

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.300
have a
faster connection this is especially

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:47.310
faster connection this is especially
 

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.100
faster connection this is especially
true not just because of the speed

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:49.110
true not just because of the speed
 

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.500
true not just because of the speed
implications but also because the faster

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:51.510
implications but also because the faster
 

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.330
implications but also because the faster
networks tend to have a bigger battery

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340
networks tend to have a bigger battery
 

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.190
networks tend to have a bigger battery
drain so it's even more important that

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200
drain so it's even more important that
 

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.750
drain so it's even more important that
you minimize the number of times that

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760
you minimize the number of times that
 

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.660
you minimize the number of times that
you're basically spinning up the radio

00:28:59.660 --> 00:28:59.670
you're basically spinning up the radio
 

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:03.410
you're basically spinning up the radio
to do another data transfer if you can't

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:03.420
to do another data transfer if you can't
 

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.210
to do another data transfer if you can't
use cloud-to-device messaging if you

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220
use cloud-to-device messaging if you
 

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.460
use cloud-to-device messaging if you
just need to do regular polling for

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:07.470
just need to do regular polling for
 

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.920
just need to do regular polling for
whatever reason try and figure out a way

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:09.930
whatever reason try and figure out a way
 

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.210
whatever reason try and figure out a way
that you don't need to use regular

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220
that you don't need to use regular
 

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.580
that you don't need to use regular
polling but if if you've done that and

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:13.590
polling but if if you've done that and
 

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.290
polling but if if you've done that and
there really is no alternative make sure

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:15.300
there really is no alternative make sure
 

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.030
there really is no alternative make sure
that you use inexact repeating alarms

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:17.040
that you use inexact repeating alarms
 

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.320
that you use inexact repeating alarms
and this is a way of being able to set a

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:18.330
and this is a way of being able to set a
 

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.020
and this is a way of being able to set a
regular polling alarm which is going to

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:21.030
regular polling alarm which is going to
 

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.480

allow you to synchronize all of those

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:23.490
allow you to synchronize all of those
 

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.680
allow you to synchronize all of those
things at the same time so that

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:24.690
things at the same time so that
 

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.020
things at the same time so that
basically it so it's a way of letting

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:27.030
basically it so it's a way of letting
 

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.720
basically it so it's a way of letting
the system do some batching for you it's

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:29.730
the system do some batching for you it's
 

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.220
the system do some batching for you it's
also worth trying to make sure that

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:31.230
also worth trying to make sure that
 

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.560
also worth trying to make sure that
you're not using wake alarms if at all

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:33.570
you're not using wake alarms if at all
 

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.970
you're not using wake alarms if at all
possible for this sort of thing so that

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:34.980
possible for this sort of thing so that
 

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.200
possible for this sort of thing so that
you're not draining the battery while

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:36.210
you're not draining the battery while
 

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.470
you're not draining the battery while
the user isn't even using their phone
