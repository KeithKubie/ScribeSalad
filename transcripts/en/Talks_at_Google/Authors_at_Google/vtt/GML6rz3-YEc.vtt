PRESENTER: I'd like to
introduce Jill Ebstein.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.110
She's a personal friend.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.847
And she's a writer, but writing
is not really her day job.

00:00:15.847 --> 00:00:17.680
She's worked for lots
of large corporations,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.150
like HP and Citicorp and some
biotech startups in the area.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.755
And she does business
consulting and marketing.

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:28.880
But she likes to deal with
the human side of things

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.310
and interact with people.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.800
And that's what really
led her to write this book

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.390
or compile this book.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.150
And she's got another book
already out and another one

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.870
on the way that she's
working on or thinking about.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.838
So without further
ado, Jill Epstein.

00:00:42.838 --> 00:00:43.921
JILL EBSTEIN: I love that.

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:46.570
Nice, short, and to the point.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.010
I'm so glad to be here.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.050
Jason, thank you
for bringing me.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.720
And I want this to
be a conversation,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.260
a two-way conversation,
not just a one-way thing.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.960
And I think I want to
start by describing what

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.060
led me to do this at my pace.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.770
As you see, this book is all
about blue sky and open roads.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.100
And I did this
because at the time,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
Sheryl Sandberg's book
had come out on "Lean In."

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.490
And as most of you
remember, "Lean In,"

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.075
it was sort of-- you
can belly up to the bar,

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:18.700
and you can get a
lot further if you're

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.580
completely invested
and determined

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.930
and willing to raise your hand.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.810
And so it was actually a great
message for a lot of-- it

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.240
was really written for women,
and a lot of women loved it.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.179
And a lot of women
felt marginalized and

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.720
disenfranchised from
the whole thing,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.650
and there was no book
that seemed to capture

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.580
the way they were doing life.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.820
And I got a little
tired of hearing

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.760
a lot of the judgmentalism
between the women

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.200
were what I call
on the autobahn,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.600
going full speed ahead
in a linear fashion,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.970
and the ones who were on the
winding road with the stops

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.940
and the starts and the
u-turns and the forks

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.550
in the road, ones who
were venturing in a much

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.110
different kind of pace.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.120
And I really
believe that we have

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.351
to try hard to reserve judgment
and to basically find our way

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.850
and let other people
find their way.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.490
And so in the spirit of
trying to help create

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.639
a voice for those women
who felt marginalized

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.970
with the "Lean In" conversation,
I wanted their stories.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.060
And I looked around, and
I couldn't find that book.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.510
And so I decided, well, we
need to capture those stories.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.130
And when my kids
were in high school,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.410
there was a series
called "This I Believe."

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.846
It was 500-word pieces.

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:29.470
I don't know if
anybody knows about it.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.040
But it was very pithy.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.604
It captured a moment, a belief.

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:34.270
And I thought, well,
you really couldn't

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.470
tell a journey in any real way
of any interest in 500 words.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.970
But what if I did 1,000 words?

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.400
Could I capture my
story in 1,000 words?

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.610
So I wrote my story.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.640
Then I assembled some good
friends into my house.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.450
And I said, I want you to
read this piece that I wrote.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.700
Don't pay any attention to me.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.366
I'm just going to be
working on the side

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:55.480
while you read my piece.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.730
Which of course, was not true.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.690
I was totally staring
at them the whole time,

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.980
seeing were they absorbed.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.860
Were their eyes wandering
off different places?

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.667
And I knew I had
a loser, actually,

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:07.750
at that one, because they
weren't really absorbed.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.291
And then I actually
interviewed them,

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:10.720
which is what I
do in my day job,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.820
is I interview and
get market feedback.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.000
And I learned some of
the gotchas for me.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.430
And so then I rewrote
my piece completely.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.860
And then I came up with the
idea of guidelines, which now

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.960
drives every "At My Pace" book.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.562
And so I came up
with the guidelines.

00:03:24.562 --> 00:03:25.270
I wrote my piece.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.620
I sent it back to my friends.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.642
And they were like,
oh, this is awesome.

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:30.100
I got such positive
feedback, and I

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.724
knew they weren't doing it to be
nice, because I saw the first.

00:03:32.724 --> 00:03:33.460
Round

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.150
So then I got the message out.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.630
I did two things simultaneously.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.213
One is I got the message out to
friends of friends of friends,

00:03:41.213 --> 00:03:42.700
because I wanted a big circle.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.860
And I said I want people
to tell their stories.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.850
I have guidelines.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.920
I will help them.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.829
And so I was getting
the message out.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.370
And the second thing
I was looking at

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.830
is how am I going to
actually deliver a book?

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.390
Can I find an agent?

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.980
So I went to four
different agents

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.710
that were recommended to
me with my connections.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.720
And all four agents
independently

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.310
said the same thing--

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.340
will this be about
some famous people?

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.940
I said, no.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.920
This is about people
like you and me--

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.297
good, ordinary,
everyday people trying

00:04:11.297 --> 00:04:12.880
to construct a life
and a journey that

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.400
has meaning, to which they
said-- each one of them

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.892
independently-- that
is a great idea,

00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:19.600
but I can never sell
this to a publisher.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.339
It needs famous.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.989
So I felt that was clear.

00:04:23.989 --> 00:04:25.780
And so then I decided
I would self-publish,

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.269
which I like that
anyway, because I

00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:28.810
get to be in the
driver's seat, and I

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.720
get to own the pace
myself of how we do this.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.800
So I then proceeded to
start to collect pieces.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.880
And so the first piece and the
36th piece, I think, in a way

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.590
that I could never
have predicted,

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.400
as bookend pieces
totally tell the story

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.400
and the goal about my pace.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.490
The first piece was called
"Discovering My Way,"

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.557
and it's by a woman
named Fran Heller.

00:04:53.557 --> 00:04:55.140
I don't read too
much on these things,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.030
but I read a little bit, just so
you can get it in their words.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.680
And Fran's story
is the following.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.490
She grew up as a daughter
of an academician.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.200
And during his
sabbatical, she would

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.690
go to Spanish-speaking
countries,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.420
and she learned to
speak Spanish fluently.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.580
And she learned how to
acculturate and really

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.220
take on the environment
she was living in.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.250
And she remembers
being five years old

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.290
and saying to her parents--

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.260
she heard Sargent Shriver
announced the Peace Corps,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.720
and saying, I want to do the
Peace Corps when I get older.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.280
She remembered-- at five.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.020
So then she grows,
and she does life.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.530
She joins.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.020
She has a job at the ACLU.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.970
She has a job at a
publishing house.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.170
She gets married.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.270
They go do the Peace Corps.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.130
And then she comes back.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.690
They have kids.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.270
And when they have kids, she
feels like her priorities

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.320
change a little bit.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.050
At least how she wants to do
life changes a little bit.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.180
She doesn't want
to go back to work.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.710
She wants to be at home.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.170
She wants to be with
other like moms.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.250
At the time, it was
moms in her area

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.860
that were doing the same thing.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.690
She did that for a while.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.440
And then she realized she really
needed to go back to work.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.180
So she becomes a travel agent.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.860
She starts her
own travel agency.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.421
So she has the freedom to
be able to come and go, make

00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:09.420
some money, run a business,
but be with her kids

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.830
if she wants to.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.500
And then her daughter is
diagnosed with cancer.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.900
And the next thing she knows,
she's at the hospital 24/7,

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.060
helping with her daughter
and with her laptop

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.380
doing her business.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.960
And she's with all
these Latino families

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.026
who don't speak the
language as well

00:06:27.026 --> 00:06:29.400
and are trying to navigate a
very complicated health care

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.700
system.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.700
And there she is, taking
care of her daughter,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.210
and also reaching out and
helping these families.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.770
Her daughter passes.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.230
Her marriage dissolves.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.860
And now she's trying to figure
out what does she do next.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.900
And it turns out that
one of her clients,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.610
when she was doing
a travel brokerage,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.820
was a Wall Street firm that
traded in energy credits.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.620
And at the time she was
servicing his travel needs,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.140
she said, you have an
opportunity, I think,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.200
in the retail market.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.990
Have you ever tried
the retail market?

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.960
But it wasn't something in
his bandwidth at the time.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.140
And so when she's figuring
out what to do next,

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.787
he says to her, well,
you have this idea.

00:07:09.787 --> 00:07:11.370
Why don't you come
work for us and see

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.860
if you can make this
retail segment go?

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.840
So she thought,
well, what the heck.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.670
She is the kind of
person who will always

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.027
go stretch herself and
try something different.

00:07:20.027 --> 00:07:21.360
And she does that for two years.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.820
And for two years, she's
on the trading floor,

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.940
which she describes
as a noisy frat house.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.700
And after two years, she
decides it's really not her.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.850
She doesn't know what is her,
but she knows that's not her.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.800
And then through
serendipity, she

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.560
has coffee with an
acquaintance who turns out

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.270
to be a social worker.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.750
And the social worker describes
her position, what she does.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.910
And friends says, ah, that's it.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.300
That took her back to that
moment in the hospital

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.340
when she was helping
people navigate the system,

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.190
and she loved being
a help and a support.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.440
And so I will now read from
the book what she writes.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.210
"At the ripe age of 44, I
enrolled in grad school.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.200
I was one of the oldest in the
group and considered every day

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.590
an opportunity, no
matter the workload.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.740
My first day was
on 9/11, and I was

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.120
at my internship at a senior
center in Washington Heights.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.190
There were many Latinos
in the room with me

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.030
glued to the TV, some of
them political refugees that

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:29.080
had fled to the US as
their ultimate safe haven.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.800
Their doubt and
anxiety were palpable.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.679
I was in the right
place for me."

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.809
That was the very first
piece I worked on,

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:38.429
"Discovering My Way."

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.620
And it was very
validating for me.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.500
Here was a woman-- a really,
truly wonderful woman--

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.990
who had to weather
pain, had to weather

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.390
the complexities of life,
who ended up in her 40s

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.490
finding her calling.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.830
I was in New York
in the last year,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.330
and I actually met
her face to face,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.000
because most of my conversations
happened on the phone.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.709
And she just loves
what she does.

00:08:58.709 --> 00:08:59.500
She is in Columbia.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.380
She started a
palliative care program,

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.560
which was also hearkened back to
her daughter and her treatment

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.980
with cancer.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.320
And so I thought, wow.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.910
This is great.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.440
This is motivating to me to
know that I have something

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.230
here that I can work with.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.500
So then I proceeded to
send out my guidelines

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.740
and capture stories.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.190
And it took about a
year, a year and a half.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.310
And then I think I'm all done.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.700
I'm having lunch at my
daughter's in Manhattan

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.690
in New York.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.770
And my niece is there.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.290
And I say to my daughter,
Sarah, this is awesome--

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.340
35 pieces.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.350
I'm ready to publish.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.110
And my niece, who's in her
mid-thirties, says to me,

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:42.090
do you have that voice,
that woman who is single,

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.920
who never got
married, who never had

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.620
kids, who always felt that she
let her family down because she

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.920
didn't meet their expectations?

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.670
I said, Hillary, I
have single women.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.650
Not everyone has kids.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.020
But maybe I don't
have that voice.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.940
Do you want to write that piece?

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.960
And she did.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.260
And that piece is the piece
that-- when I tell you

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.218
this book has been reviewed
by so many people--

00:10:05.218 --> 00:10:07.420
that piece always
captures people's

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.400
hearts and their attention.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.840
Because Hillary is so
talented and so wonderful

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.270
in so many ways, and she should
never have any self-doubt.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.490
There should never be any
of that feeling of why am I

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.865
not measuring up to other
people's expectations, whatever

00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:21.490
those are.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.710
And yet she had them.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.692
And so she decides
one day while she's

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.150
watching the
marathon, the New York

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.030
marathon-- she
says to her friend,

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.800
we're going to run the marathon.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.625
And her friend is
a little surprised.

00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:36.750
And she says, why are we
going to run the marathon?

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.000
Because it will be the first
true choice of something

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.140
that I did for me that was
never expected by anybody else.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.000
I want to run the marathon.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.760
Hillary is a large woman,
and she doesn't like to run.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.175
But somehow, this challenge took
on such significance to her.

00:10:53.175 --> 00:10:54.550
And she trained
for a whole year.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.620
I would ask her how is it going.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.941
And besides the
sores and the aches

00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:00.690
and the need for a
massage, she would say,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.900
I'm so sick of Beyonce.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.640
I've been listening to so
much Beyonce when I run.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.931
I've got to find somebody else.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.680
So then that year was the year
that Hurricane Sandy happened.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.770
And so after all that
training for a year,

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.020
the marathon was canceled.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.150
She was devastated.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.760
I really-- the most
serious mourning and loss

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.542
that I've seen in a long time.

00:11:23.542 --> 00:11:25.750
And I understood it in a
way that I couldn't possibly

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.630
have understood had I not
understood this piece.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.450
And then she signed
up to do it again,

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.680
and the next year, she runs.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.210
And she describes at
the end of her story

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:42.390
what it meant to her to see
all these people lining up.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.390
Because she had friends.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.306
My daughter was there.

00:11:44.306 --> 00:11:47.380
She had a lot of people lining
up to support her in this run.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.620
And she said their presence
not only provided strength

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.840
and encouragement
along the route,

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.700
but it was an affirmation of me
and my choices, a celebration

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.900
that even if my life doesn't
follow the predictable path,

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.800
I am worthy of being celebrated
for the choices I do make

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.860
and all their iterations.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.220
And the question I
asked myself when

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.750
I was looking at
all these pieces

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.810
is-- the first piece was
about discovering my way.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.320
The last piece was about
celebrating my choices.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.440
How do we go from
discovery to celebration?

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.780
What's that process
that gets us there?

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.410
So I will share with you
what I call the new three

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.260
R's that I learned.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.930
But before I do
that, I want to know,

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.920
does anybody have any questions,
any thoughts so far in anything

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.670
that I've said?

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.320
Anything you want to say?

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.820
Yes.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.900
AUDIENCE: I'm interested in
how you collected the stories--

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.550
if you were looking
for certain voices

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.258
and would go and seek
them out, or if you

00:12:44.258 --> 00:12:48.430
would spread the word throughout
your network, and people self--

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.510
signed up for it?

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.620
how did you navigate that?

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.760
JILL EBSTEIN: Well,
that's a great question.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.780
It was both.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.480
I definitely had
a push going on.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.730
And I went to so
many different--

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.280
you think all the places in
your world that you've been,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.740
and I would go into
those places and say,

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.562
does anybody here
want to write a story?

00:13:04.562 --> 00:13:06.520
Do you know anybody who
wants to write a story?

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.519
But what I didn't want--

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:09.820
I'm in my late 50s.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.330
I'm Jewish.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.050
I live in Newton.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.210
I'm privileged.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:18.760
I did not want 36 people
that were like me.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.790
If I were to grade myself
on that particular score,

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.470
I would give myself
a B or B minus.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.420
I tried very hard.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.340
But a lot of people are
uncomfortable telling

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:27.910
their story.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.920
And actually, when
you deal with what

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.830
I call ordinary people, people
like you and me, most people

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.140
either, A, don't feel they
have a story worth telling--

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.510
I have to convince them that
they have a great story.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.040
I'll tell you an example
of that in a second.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.647
And then some people just
think they don't write.

00:13:42.647 --> 00:13:44.480
A lot of people are not
comfortable writing.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.690
And to that, I always say,
but I am your safety net,

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.379
because I love to write.

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:50.170
And I can help you even
capture your voice.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.390
I spend a lot of time
working on these pieces

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.680
with the contributors.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.870
So I take those away.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.290
Now, the second book, which
I'll do a plug for later,

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.870
called "Lessons From My
Mother--" it looks like this--

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.830
I did a much better
job on capturing

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.010
a much broader audience.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.300
Well, first of all,
it's men and women.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.080
But it also-- it's across
geographies, ethnicities.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.440
But that's a good question.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.898
And it's something that I feel--
and I actually acknowledge

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:19.150
that right in front.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.270
I say, I didn't do a great
job on that when I tried.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.670
But you can't make
people tell a story who

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.160
don't want to tell your story.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.970
JILL EBSTEIN: Any other
questions before I move on?

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.450
OK.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.110
So how we get from
discovering my way

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.120
to celebrating my choices?

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.320
I think there's a new three
R's that we need to embrace.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.100
And the first one is resilience.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.280
Now, we see resilience written
up in stories all the time.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.400
But when you hear
these stories, and you

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.400
see the moments of challenge
and struggle and the strength

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.620
that it takes for
people to persevere,

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.890
it gave, for me,
resilience a new meaning.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.290
So I had a colleague of mine
from my HP days who said to me,

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.040
you need to call my--
first email my sister.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.890
And then if she
doesn't email you back,

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.440
you need to call my sister,
because she has a great story.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.360
And I find out a little
bit about her story,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.160
but not enough to do much.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.690
So I email.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.790
Susana Fonticoba is her name.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:18.540
And nothing back.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.620
I email her again.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.940
And then I email her.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.490
I say, your sister, Jeanie,
says I must talk to you.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.586
You have a great story.

00:15:24.586 --> 00:15:25.960
And here's what
I'm trying to do.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.370
So she calls me back and
she says, I have no story.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.590
I said, well, Jeanie
says you have a story.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.660
Tell me a little
bit about yourself.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.950
There's not that much to tell.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:35.460
OK.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.200
I was widowed at 40.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.031
I lost my job.

00:15:38.031 --> 00:15:39.030
I had to raise two kids.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.110
I had to start a business.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.900
And yes, I got through it.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.024
But what's the story there?

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.400
I'm like, that's a story.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.272
So what happened-- her story
is so poignant and so--

00:15:49.272 --> 00:15:50.730
when I first read
it, I literally--

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.120
I'm not a crier or a
teary kind of person,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.800
and I hate mushy gushy.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.040
But her story really
did get to me.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:05.340
She remembers taking a
chairlift up Cascade Mountain.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.680
And they get to the
top of the mountain.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.300
And She's in her 20s.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.371
It's beautiful.

00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:12.120
And they decide it's
such a beautiful day,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.717
they'll just walk
down, it's so pretty.

00:16:14.717 --> 00:16:16.800
Of course, they don't
realize how far the walk is.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.633
And they're walking and
walking and walking.

00:16:18.633 --> 00:16:20.610
And it looks like
they've gotten nowhere.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.710
And so she sits down,
and she pouts on a rock.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.335
She sits down on a
rock and just pouts.

00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:26.890
And her husband says to
her at the time, get up.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:27.630
You can't pout.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.880
Nobody is going to rescue you.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.670
Nobody is going to be here.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.510
We have to get ourselves
down the mountain.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.500
And he's thinking about
sunset, how far it is, what

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.699
the pace is they have to keep.

00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:37.990
So they get down before sunset.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.870
All is good.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.740
And when he's 42,
she's 40, he just

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.010
dies of a sudden heart attack.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:45.060
She has two young kids.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.200
I think they're,
like, 10 and 12.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.520
And she's working
at AT&amp;T. And shortly

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.530
thereafter, she's laid off.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.780
So they don't have much money.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.720
She is doing this--
she's mourning the loss.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.800
But she finds comfort
in her widow friends.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.140
They're the ones who
understand her loss.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.270
But her widow friends
are much older than her.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.869
There aren't too many
40-year-old widows.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.440
And AOL has just hit this world.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.150
And they have computers,
and they do not

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.849
know how to make AOL
work on their computer.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.079
So she's like, this is great.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.119
She helps them with
AOL on their computer.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.640
And in exchange, she gets
this companionship and support

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.130
system that she
desperately needs.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.940
So her friends--
they appreciate her.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.370
They also understand
what she's going through.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.507
And so one of her
friends says to her,

00:17:35.507 --> 00:17:37.590
basically, she should start
a business doing this.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:42.160
She says-- this is
what she describes.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.680
She says with no help,
with no job, and no spouse,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.810
I helped my friends learn
their way around AOL

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.300
to keep my sanity.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.970
One day, one of my
friends suggested

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.240
that others like her were also
struggling with their PCs.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:02.060
And since no one was hiring, I
could simply create my own job.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.470
It's madness, I thought.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.870
I had no experience
being a business owner.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:10.420
But then I had been
no hiker either.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.580
So she has that image of
going down the mountain,

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.790
and she can't pout.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.440
She has to get herself going.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.490
I spread the word.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.440
And soon, I was in
business, coming

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.670
to the rescue of many a senior
lost in the world of Windows

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:23.870
and AOL.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.960
While the money was a fraction
of what I used to earn,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.610
my new job was helping me
become a whole person again.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.670
Along the hike down my own
personal Wildcat Mountain,

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.700
life changed in many ways.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.030
I became business-savvy
and gained confidence

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.440
I never would have foreseen.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.150
I joined a professional
organization.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.710
I was soon on its
leadership team,

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.420
and then I became president.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.900
And all the while, I was
developing my business.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.630
Over the years, I had to
stand strong and survive

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.030
many major events
without my husband--

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.930
graduations, walking my
daughter down the aisle,

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.630
the girls moving out as adults.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.690
And she finished and
she said, I started out

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.110
as a shy wife of a man
who was bigger than life.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.520
If the young woman in her 20s
could meet this mid-50s woman,

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.000
she would be
completely astonished.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.380
The funny thing about
that piece to me--

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.310
I always felt like, wow, the
growth and the resilience.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.972
But I went-- my mother,
who recently passed--

00:19:25.972 --> 00:19:26.930
I'd go visit her a lot.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.220
She lived in Denver.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.930
And the facility
that she was at,

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.947
I would get a people
group of people together.

00:19:31.947 --> 00:19:33.530
I'd start talking
about these stories.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.750
And you just want to
keep them engaged.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.570
And whenever I read that
piece, they were like, well,

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.830
we could update that.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.910
If the 50-year-old in us could
meet the 80-year-old in us,

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.410
they would be
completely astonished.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.230
You can look ahead
and see the growth.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.950
So that's a great
example of resilience.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.730
And that one was poignant
and has some very sad moments

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:57.230
in it.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.810
But also, you felt very
good about where she got.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.090
But there's others
that are just funny.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.310
There's a piece in
here by Sandra Gregory

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.140
called "A Few Minor Repairs."

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.050
And she and her husband,
they ride the dot com boom,

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.856
and they have all the houses,
and they have the cars.

00:20:11.856 --> 00:20:12.980
They're leading a big life.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.000
And then the bust happens, and
then they lose their wealth.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.130
And eventually, they
lose their marriage.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.710
They have a little bit of--

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.880
I think maybe she would call it
some combination of stupidity

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.500
and a massive ego.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.310
They decided to open up an auto
repair shop for fancy cars,

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.630
because they drive fancy cars.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.775
So they'll take their last
dollars that they have

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:36.870
and make that work,
and it doesn't work.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.874
And the next thing you
know, she is sleeping--

00:20:38.874 --> 00:20:40.040
their marriage is dissolved.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.830
She is sleeping in the
basement of her brother's

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.740
house on a Little Mermaid bed
while her kids are upstairs.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.050
And she talks about what
she's going to do next.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.430
And she also lands on her feet.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.400
So there's a lot of
stories of resilience.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.960
So that's the first R,
which is resilience.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.200
The next R is reinvention.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.399
But I feel like reinvention is
a very big word, and most of us

00:21:00.399 --> 00:21:01.940
don't really know
what to do with it.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.190
It sounds like such
an overwhelming thing

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:08.130
to do to suddenly remake
yourself into something else.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.580
So I call it-- there was a
woman who wrote a piece here,

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.670
Donna Surges Tatum, and she
talks about taking a left turn,

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.530
doing that occasional
thing, that change-up

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:18.710
that takes you out of your
ordinary comfortable zone.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.960
And I feel like that's a lot
more realistic about what

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.450
we can sign up for sometimes.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.820
And I would say that
for me, "At My Pace"

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.290
is a reinvention story
for me, because I never

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.280
thought of myself as
publishing books and speaking.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.579
When I speak, I usually speak
about market research findings.

00:21:36.579 --> 00:21:38.120
I don't speak about
things like this.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.780
So it was helpful for
me to actually see

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.640
that this is something that
people do in smaller ways.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.810
So there's a bunch of
pieces on reinvention

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.680
that I think are a lot of fun.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.245
But there's one called
"Finding My Passion After 50,"

00:21:52.245 --> 00:21:53.810
by Rhonda Benjamin.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.180
And she's a lawyer,
a real estate lawyer.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.320
She did law for decades.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.600
She raised her kids and
did law, and she hated it.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.290
She hated reading the contracts.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.134
She hated all the bickering and
the contentiousness of it all.

00:22:05.134 --> 00:22:06.800
And she would fantasize
about things she

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.110
could do that would not be law.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.630
And then one night,
she goes out to dinner

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:16.190
with her husband and her
son and her son's girlfriend

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.920
and their parents, her parents.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.310
And the girlfriend's parents are
just a total nightmare to her.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.060
She comes back so
undone and so--

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.730
she does not know what to
do with her restless angst

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:29.570
about this dinner.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:33.030
She felt they were horrible
in many different ways.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.720
And so she tries to go to sleep,
but she can't go to sleep.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.279
So in the middle of the
night, she wakes up.

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:40.070
She's [INAUDIBLE], but
she gets out of bed.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:43.910
And she writes the story of
her dinner and the conversation

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.620
and the peculiarities of it all.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.830
And she is laughing the
whole time she writes.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.420
And all of a
sudden, she realizes

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.640
not just that it's
therapeutic for her,

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.310
but that she always had this
voice in writing that she's

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.230
never really expressed.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.397
And she's fortunate.

00:22:58.397 --> 00:22:59.480
Not everybody can do this.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.420
But she was able to
give up her law job.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.510
And she started a magazine
called "Better After 50."

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.660
And so it just ended
up becoming complete.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.460
That's not a right
turn or a left turn.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.990
That's just a whole
other road entirely.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.830
But you see there is another
story by Melissa Ludtke.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.450
She is a Neiman Fellow.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.040
You guys know what
Neiman Fellows are?

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.470
It's a designation for
very talented journalists

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.360
who get these scholarships.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.610
And she writes about being 40,
thinking she would be a mom,

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:32.510
but she wasn't a mom.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.150
And so she goes to
China, and she ends up

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.490
adopting a baby girl.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.280
And she has now made
her life understanding

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.600
the Chinese culture.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.377
And she has a bunch
of writing and stuff

00:23:43.377 --> 00:23:44.460
that revolves around that.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.034
But in her early years, she
was a sports journalist.

00:23:47.034 --> 00:23:48.450
And so she talks
about-- actually,

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:52.520
there was a great quote in
Melissa's piece about what she

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.040
did and what it meant to her.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.400
And I just-- it
really reminds me

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.707
that there's so much more that
we can do that's in our range.

00:24:01.707 --> 00:24:03.290
You don't have to
actually go to China

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.510
and adopt a daughter to see
that, wow, I can reinvent.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:12.110
But here she talks about "At
two junctures, one recent

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.850
and the other nearly
two decades ago,

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.510
I stepped off my usual
path to head towards places

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:21.680
neither customary ambition
nor conventional wisdom

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.420
would suggest.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.910
The earlier detour
brought me to motherhood,

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.820
and the other one at the age
of 46 when I had no job."

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.940
Now she's working on
bringing her message out.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.190
So I want to stop
here and ask you

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.790
whether reinvention
or taking a left turn

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:43.170
is something you think about
in your own personal lives.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.170
Does it feel
comfortable for you?

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.564
Is it scary to you?

00:24:47.564 --> 00:24:49.980
When you think about that,
what's your overriding emotion?

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.720
Anybody have an example
of a small moment

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.540
that they've taken a turn?

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.760
Yes.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.170
AUDIENCE: I can share one.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.630
It happened probably
10 years ago.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.400
So I had moved to Boston, and
I didn't know anyone here.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.060
I was with my husband, who
got into a graduate program.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.670
And I started to
work at a company

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.300
that I had worked with before,
but with all new people.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.770
And I was having a hard
time settling into the city

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.120
and making friends.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.280
So I started to go to a fitness
studio and take classes there.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.490
And I have no dance background,
no athletic background.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.930
But I decided I wanted to teach.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.730
And so I went through a
six-month training program

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.350
for--

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.240
over a course of 250 hours
back and forth to New York

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.760
to learn to teach
this barre class.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.620
And it's been something I've
done for the past 10 years.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.310
And so it's totally different
to my full-time role

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:53.480
here at Google, and
it made no sense.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.390
But I really-- it was one of
the hardest things I ever did,

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.510
and I'm so glad I did it.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.301
JILL EBSTEIN: Yeah.

00:25:58.301 --> 00:25:59.840
That's awesome.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.390
I remember getting on a
tennis court when I was 38.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:03.800
I played tennis a lot.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.300
And thinking, oh
my god, you're just

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.560
starting a tennis game at 38.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.100
No way.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.308
That was the scariest moment.

00:26:08.308 --> 00:26:10.365
I have done so many
things in my life

00:26:10.365 --> 00:26:12.990
that were nowhere near as scary
as getting on the tennis court.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.399
And now I'm 59, and I
play tennis all the time,

00:26:15.399 --> 00:26:16.440
and I'm on a tennis team.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.606
So when you look back at
those moments, you can say,

00:26:18.606 --> 00:26:21.020
wow, I was able to
overcome my fear.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.277
And not only that, but
it's such a great balance

00:26:24.277 --> 00:26:25.610
to the other things in our life.

00:26:27.761 --> 00:26:30.260
Does it ever feel to you-- when
you think about reinvention,

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.843
does that feel like
a big word to you,

00:26:31.843 --> 00:26:34.946
or does it just feel big to me?

00:26:34.946 --> 00:26:36.570
How many people
think-- hands up if you

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.820
think it feels like a big word.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.090
I think it's scary.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.110
It's not so easy to
actually envision that.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.552
And this helped me to see
some of the small things

00:26:46.552 --> 00:26:47.760
that people do along the way.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.260
It's not wholesale change.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.390
It's incremental
change that people

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.880
do to be able to add a
little bit of a change

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.650
up, a little freshness
in their lives.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.240
So that's reinvention.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.831
And the third R-- so
the R, resilience.

00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:03.330
I'm sorry.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:03.990
Go ahead.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.180
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about
reinvention and whether

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.020
or not, in your
stories, or the stories

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:13.470
that you've acquired or
whatnot, if it's always forced.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.000
It sounds like a
lot of times, it's

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.420
forced based on circumstances--

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:23.130
or if there is a conscious
choice because of want.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.966
JILL EBSTEIN: That's
a great question.

00:27:24.966 --> 00:27:26.340
There are some
times it's forced,

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.560
but there are plenty of
times that it's want.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.950
What I will say is that for
some of the reinvention stories,

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:35.807
these are examples of
people who could do it.

00:27:35.807 --> 00:27:37.890
In other words, they had
enough of the safety net.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.284
They could go take
a flyer out there.

00:27:40.284 --> 00:27:41.700
And for some of
us, that would not

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.240
be something that we could do.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.480
I only can do this book
and all these other books

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.040
because I have a day job.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.980
If this were the
thing that I needed

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.630
to do to send my
kids to college,

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.520
it definitely would not work.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.470
But there are plenty
of people out there--

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:03.530
the book starts out with
a woman named Kim Lorusso,

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.300
and it's called "Falling
Off the Corporate Ladder."

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.480
And her life is just
not working anymore.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.440
And I'm going to
describe that in a second

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.900
under a different topic.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.810
But she didn't have to do it.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.720
Just the pain was too high for
her to keep everything static

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.881
as it was.

00:28:19.881 --> 00:28:21.130
Did you want to say something?

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:21.858
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:21.858 --> 00:28:25.725
[INAUDIBLE] question
which was, in the cases

00:28:25.725 --> 00:28:29.522
where it isn't forced, how
do you know when it's time?

00:28:29.522 --> 00:28:32.334
And how do you
step outside of who

00:28:32.334 --> 00:28:36.530
you are now to recognize
what you might be instead?

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:37.790
JILL EBSTEIN: Yeah.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.360
So that's a great question.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.440
The people-- when I ask them--

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.310
so you made this
change-- it was something

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.877
that typically persisted
inside them for a long time.

00:28:46.877 --> 00:28:48.710
I'll give you the story
of my brother, who's

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:49.730
not in this book.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.880
My brother was a
lawyer on a partnership

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.200
track for a prominent law
firm in the Boston area.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:04.340
And every year, he would
get an application form

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.416
from the Jewish Theological
Seminary to be a rabbi.

00:29:07.416 --> 00:29:08.540
He did this for five years.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.390
And every year, I would
say, Wesley, you have kids.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.370
You have a good career.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.080
You went to a great law school.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.380
Can't you just go give a sermon
here and there, and let it sit?

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.370
Give it up.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.070
That was the practical
person in me.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.200
I wouldn't say that today.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.740
After five years, he
could not say no to it.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.520
It just persisted.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.144
And there are so many
stories like that

00:29:30.144 --> 00:29:33.380
where people-- they just
get driven on a need

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.640
that they have.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.870
But what I will say
is that actually how

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.740
you meet that need might be
more of a tinkering than all

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.630
of a sudden lifting
yourself up and trying

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.860
something very different.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.100
There is a story
here by a woman,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.070
by Suzanne Offit
on the need to dig.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.630
It's another rabbi story.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:54.619
But she had no idea she
wanted to be a rabbi.

00:29:54.619 --> 00:29:56.660
She didn't think she ever--
that was just nowhere

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.190
in her concept of herself.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.250
But she had been reading.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:00.875
She'd had boys.

00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:01.730
She had a bris.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.590
She wanted to read more.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.425
More and more learning took her
more and more a certain way.

00:30:06.425 --> 00:30:08.300
And her husband was
like, well, just continue

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.650
to learn and enjoy that, but
leave our life as our life is.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:13.370
But she couldn't.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.750
She was just propelled.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.840
And to the point that she did
go to a rabbinical school.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.200
She's a wonderful rabbi.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.950
She's a chaplain,
and she really tends

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.330
to the people who are in the
most physically challenged

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.200
states in their life.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.560
And she had to actually
take her family with her

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.919
along this journey.

00:30:34.919 --> 00:30:35.960
And she talks about that.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.910
She talks about their need
to have therapy, and all

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:39.534
of a sudden, that
their whole world has

00:30:39.534 --> 00:30:41.030
been sent in upheaval.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.320
Because now she's dividing
her time in so many ways,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.195
and they're not just
the center of her world.

00:30:45.195 --> 00:30:46.760
and she has so
many other things.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.600
And so it's not an easy path.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.270
But the nice thing
in her story is

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.630
that they all grew
in the process,

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.230
even though there was some pain.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.220
So I don't think-- the answer
is I don't think, in most cases,

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.344
I don't see people-- all
of a sudden, they're like,

00:31:00.344 --> 00:31:01.820
OK, I was this,
but now I'm that.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.945
I feel like there's a lot
of testing and tinkering.

00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:06.740
And the ones who
actually persist usually

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:10.602
persist because they don't
see an option not to.

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:12.560
It's like why I'm thinking
about my third book.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.810
I don't really want to be
thinking about a third book.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:18.127
I want to just enjoy
these two and do my work.

00:31:18.127 --> 00:31:20.210
And yet I know this third
book is about ready to--

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.890
I'm ready to get
the guidelines going

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.010
and start a process again.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.670
So I think there's something
inside you that just drives you

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:30.230
in a way that you can't explain
and maybe can't even control.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.750
Actually, you know
David Samberg from--

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.730
so he wanted to be
a college professor.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.300
He was getting a PhD
in English literature.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.230
He's all about books.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.230
He's always been about
books, but he's a lawyer.

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.260
He was the in-house counsel
for ITA that Google acquired.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.037
And he eventually-- they
acquired a bookstore,

00:31:48.037 --> 00:31:48.870
Porter Square Books.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.160
But that was always a dream.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.090
And eventually, they get it.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.880
But it was something in them.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:00.980
That book thing was in him from
the time I knew him in his 20s.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.880
So the last theme I
want to talk about

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.870
is resetting your perspective.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.140
And that has so
many pieces to it,

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.480
but I'm going to
talk about two today.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.320
One is about the
burdens of perfection.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.460
We live in a time now where--

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.050
here's what we expect
from ourselves.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:22.880
We expect 10,000 steps a
day, an immaculate house,

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.490
kids who are-- if you have
kids, the kids are doing well

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:29.590
in school, and they have all
those extra skills and lessons

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:32.090
and stuff, so they're becoming
these big, well-rounded human

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.200
beings.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.710
And your career is
on track, and you're

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.600
able to communicate
with all the loved ones,

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.114
and you have a book
club that everybody is--

00:32:41.114 --> 00:32:42.530
you have all these
things that you

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.000
think are all going to work.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.710
And of course, that burden
is a big, heavy burden.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.437
And you can burn out
and spin your wheels

00:32:50.437 --> 00:32:52.520
trying to make sure that
all those things actually

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.930
get achieved.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:57.470
So I mentioned Kimberly
Lorusso a second ago.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.930
Her story is that she
opens up the book.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:02.210
She's on a train
headed out of Boston

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.070
to go pick up her
kids from day care.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:08.870
The train has malfunctioned, and
so they're dead on the tracks.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:10.130
Her husband is traveling.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.342
And so yet again, she's
going to be the last one

00:33:12.342 --> 00:33:13.550
to get her kids from daycare.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.930
Yet again, they're going
to end up waiting for her,

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.320
because she doesn't think
she'll get there in the hours

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.024
that they've posted.

00:33:20.024 --> 00:33:21.440
And then she's
going to rush home,

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.060
and she's going to go
through the bedtime ritual,

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.440
and then she's going
to return to her job

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.773
to finish the work that she
didn't finish during the day

00:33:26.773 --> 00:33:28.880
because she was rushing
to get the kids.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.670
So she falls off the
corporate ladder.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.730
And what she describes
is she says--

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:37.550
her husband travels, and she
travels some in the community.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.470
Hard to find time.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.070
So she says after my husband and
I finally find a quiet moment

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.780
to talk about our
challenging schedules,

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.820
three things become clear to me.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:50.360
First, I need to accept that
in our current scenario,

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.230
I can't make everything work
to the standard that I'd like.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:57.020
I know that I am fortunate to
have a set of problems caused

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:01.430
by the too-full plate of being
a parent, a wife, and a working

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:02.510
professional.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:06.530
Believe me-- I wouldn't trade
my problems for someone else's.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:10.159
And yet somehow, I am
not enjoying my bounty.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.940
Everything feels like a
burden, and on particular days,

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.630
a Rubik's cube
that I can't solve.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.787
So she goes back to
her employer to see

00:34:19.787 --> 00:34:21.620
if there is any
flexibility, because they're

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.860
known to be a flexible,
21st-century, modern-day

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.030
employer.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.921
And they say, oh, yes, in
many jobs, but not for you.

00:34:28.921 --> 00:34:29.420
I'm sorry.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.190
We can't do anything
for you here.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.590
So she ends up leaving.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:37.310
And it's scary for her,
but she's also helped out,

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.544
because her husband
has a job, and also

00:34:40.544 --> 00:34:41.960
because she knows
she can actually

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.030
leave this with some
consulting gigs in hand.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.400
She can consult for her
employer, her ex-employer

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:46.901
to be.

00:34:46.901 --> 00:34:48.275
She can do some
other consulting.

00:34:48.275 --> 00:34:50.449
So she can figure how she
can cushion her landing.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:51.980
She's picked up
some teaching jobs.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.334
She's an adjunct
teacher at Emerson.

00:34:54.334 --> 00:34:55.250
So she's made it work.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.250
And she talks about
work-life integration, not

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.180
work-life balance.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.620
It's the ability to be able
to make things work together,

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.360
everything has a
little bit of a give.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.760
But you don't have-- balance
is the word that maybe we

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.170
use, but we don't
really mean, because I

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.628
don't think most
of us don't really

00:35:10.628 --> 00:35:12.320
feel like we have balance.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.380
So she describes-- she
says the good news is

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:19.340
we're not eating Costco roasted
chicken nearly so often.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.040
But the best thing is-- she
says in my brave, remade world,

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.710
I am not as hard on myself.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.470
She has learned that
perfect is not an option,

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:31.280
and if she doesn't try for
perfect, she's a lot happier.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.280
So I then reached out
to my pediatrician.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.105
Now, my pediatrician-- you
talked about how I find people.

00:35:36.105 --> 00:35:38.690
What I knew about her is that
she went to medical school

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.940
in her late 30s, and she
had training in her 40s.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.815
And we didn't pick her
up as our pediatrician

00:35:42.815 --> 00:35:43.730
till her mid-forties.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:45.415
I'm like, that's a great story.

00:35:45.415 --> 00:35:46.790
I don't know what
happened there,

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:48.140
but I know there's
a great story there.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.264
And she did not disappoint.

00:35:49.264 --> 00:35:50.490
It was a great story.

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:55.640
She went to Kent College
during the riots.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.140
She walked down
her wedding aisle

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.420
pregnant in a time when
people didn't do that.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.180
Her parents barely
talked to her.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.200
She is great.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.070
She has three kids.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.410
So she says, OK, I'm
going to talk to you.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.625
And then she tells me her story
about her parents, her kids,

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:10.250
and everything.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.380
I'm like, oh, my god, but
you're the perfect person.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.050
This is what I'm. thinking.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.024
I don't say it.

00:36:14.024 --> 00:36:15.440
And yet, even
behind the perfect--

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.700
it's like Oz behind the curtain.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.380
It's just Oz.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.171
Behind the curtain,
it's just another human

00:36:20.171 --> 00:36:23.900
being with a different set, but
a similar set of challenges.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.730
So now she's getting
ready to retire.

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:29.780
And I say to her, OK, so
what does it all mean?

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.250
What's the point of
what you've learned

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.940
in all these years of being
a pediatrician, and a mom,

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.770
and a wife, and all that?

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.750
And she says-- this is
how she finishes it.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.140
She says, "There have been
many bumps in this journey.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.080
There were so many times I
felt that I was blundering

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.480
and making a wreck of things.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.050
But at this moment, I have found
my peace, and I am thankful.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.240
Sometimes, our words
come back at us.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.280
And right now, I am
hearing the advice

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.680
I have given first-time
parents in what

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.530
I call reality orientation.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.860
There they sit,
exhausted, exhilarated

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.540
with overwhelming
love, determined

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.930
not to make any parenting
mistakes They never

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.850
tell me this, but I see it.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:12.200
I've been there.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.150
I tell them you are not going to
raise the first perfect human.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:18.860
Give up now.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.450
No path is perfect.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.760
No decision is beyond question.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.050
And so I counsel--

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:28.070
love well, be strong,
laugh often, be bold,

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.230
and don't think too hard.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.190
As I enter retirement,
the same goes for me.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.120
And so I will."

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.810
And I felt-- when I
heard those words,

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:40.460
it was like the
exclamation point

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.320
on the burdens of
perfection, what

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.600
we do to ourselves by
expecting our perfect kids

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.910
and our perfect lives.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.531
The last part that I want to
talk about of the three R's--

00:37:49.531 --> 00:37:51.530
I want to remind you, the
first R is Resilience.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:52.926
The second R is Reinvention.

00:37:52.926 --> 00:37:54.800
But somehow, we have to
step it down in a way

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.440
that we can get our arms
around it and play with it some

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.180
so it's not so foreboding.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.460
And the third one is
resetting our perspective.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.370
And we just talked about
the burdens of perfection.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.050
But the next part
about our perspective

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:09.320
is about how we need to
allow ourselves dormancy.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.000
We need to allow ourselves to
be able to be still and have

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.040
some downtime so
that we can continue

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.390
to do what we want to do.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:21.290
If we re-think of
dormancy as what

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:26.210
we need to have before a boost
of productivity, it's helpful.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.890
This is actually--
of all the challenges

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.016
that I've read and
digested and all

00:38:30.016 --> 00:38:31.640
that, this is the
one that I personally

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.490
have the most difficulty with.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:38.770
So I have a very close friend,
and she graduated from Hopkins.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.956
She's super smart
and hardworking.

00:38:40.956 --> 00:38:42.830
And she got on that busy
track that everybody

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:43.940
gets on when you
get out of college

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.350
and you get your first job.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:46.400
And she hated it.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.700
She said, I was not meant
to live a hurried life.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.850
So she and her husband
have a daughter.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:56.330
And she decides she's going
to get off that track.

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:59.360
And she's a fantastic writer,
a poet and a short story

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.200
writer, also a tennis player.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.840
That's how our
worlds came together.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.140
So she writes-- she
was writing poetry,

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:09.110
and her father had a stroke.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.930
And then he was in
Florida, and she's here.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.550
She is going back
and forth, visiting

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.050
him every couple of weeks.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:16.400
They couldn't move him.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.710
And this happened
for over two years.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.920
And she could not
write a poem anymore.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.510
Her poetry pen just died.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:26.005
And for a woman who
loves to write poetry,

00:39:26.005 --> 00:39:27.380
that's the thing
that gives her--

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.910
that's like the barre
for you or tennis for me.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:29.930
That's what she does.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.580
It was painful.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.860
And one morning, she wakes up.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.580
And she has this poem in
her head called "Day One."

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.540
It's in the book.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.640
It's the day that
the stroke happens,

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.540
and she realizes how much
his world has changed, how

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.490
much their world has changed.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:49.610
But she doesn't think
that he realizes it yet.

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:52.670
She then writes 25
poems in the next month.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:55.610
He actually passed a few days
after "Day One" was written.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:58.610
She came down to Florida,
because she got that message.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:02.060
And she just-- all
of a sudden, it

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.820
was just a floodgate
that opened up.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:10.370
Now, that's an extreme case of
dormancy preceding proactivity.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.190
But I think for all
of us, we feel so

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:15.832
compelled to see if we can get
ahead, and do a little more,

00:40:15.832 --> 00:40:16.790
and do a little faster.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.590
My to-do lists are
very long, and it

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.710
seems like I add more to them
than I take off from them

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.910
that it's hard for us.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:28.340
I actually-- I was at ABC doing
this, and I asked the group,

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.005
do they have a hard
time with this.

00:40:30.005 --> 00:40:31.250
These are all women.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.107
They were ABC and ESPN, and
they're pretty much drivers.

00:40:34.107 --> 00:40:36.440
And they're like, oh, we have
a horrible time with this.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.320
But one of them said, I have
a sister, and she does yoga,

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.110
and she just stares at
a wall for 30 minutes.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.906
And that's her-- just
stares at this wall.

00:40:44.906 --> 00:40:46.280
And I'm like, oh,
that's awesome.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.190
And another woman said,
I could never do that.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.190
I'd be looking at that wall.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.180
I'd see a dirty spot.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.580
I'd immediately have to go
get up and scrub the wall.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.670
And that would sort of be what
I would probably be like, too.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:59.720
So I'm wondering, within this
group, do you ever feel like--

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.820
do you have a problem
with dormancy, or can

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.020
you allow yourself to--

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.450
you have a problem
with dormancy.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:07.996
Do you ever have that
smart voice inside you

00:41:07.996 --> 00:41:10.120
that says even if you have
a problem with dormancy,

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.110
I've got to do it?

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:16.116
And what do you do for dormant--
what do you do to be dormant?

00:41:16.116 --> 00:41:18.912
AUDIENCE: I just
watch "Law and Order."

00:41:21.657 --> 00:41:22.990
JILL EBSTEIN: That's a good one.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.573
Anybody else have
any thoughts for how

00:41:24.573 --> 00:41:27.670
they like to be dormant, how
they like to refuel themselves?

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.620
AUDIENCE: Sleep
for, like, 12 hours.

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.430
PRESENTER: Sleep.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:32.409
Sleep.

00:41:32.409 --> 00:41:34.200
Well, we're usually
underslept as a nation,

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.290
so that's probably a good one.

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:40.200
When you think about those
challenges that I've put out

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.910
there-- reinvention, the
burdens of perfection,

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.190
and allowing yourself dormancy--

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.787
are those challenges
that speak to you?

00:41:50.787 --> 00:41:52.370
AUDIENCE: So I was
just going to speak

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:54.750
about dormancy for a second.

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.755
I find that the only
way to be dormant

00:41:56.755 --> 00:42:00.106
is to really be on vacation
for a continuous week

00:42:00.106 --> 00:42:02.980
and not look at the
corporate email.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.468
And the day before
coming back, it's all--

00:42:05.468 --> 00:42:08.480
I have to find out what's
going on before I get there.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.416
But I see people on my team--

00:42:10.416 --> 00:42:11.790
it's not me, but
there are people

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.090
on the team who have their
vacation balance totally full.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:19.190
And the corporation says you can
only accumulate so much time.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:21.840
And they don't take it.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.930
And I don't know how they
manage to not take it,

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.755
because I do need that time.

00:42:26.755 --> 00:42:27.546
JILL EBSTEIN: Yeah.

00:42:27.546 --> 00:42:29.129
AUDIENCE: This year,
I finally decided

00:42:29.129 --> 00:42:31.844
I was going to take a
vacation and completely detach

00:42:31.844 --> 00:42:34.915
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:34.915 --> 00:42:37.935
And so I completely-- it
took me almost two months

00:42:37.935 --> 00:42:39.420
to unbury myself.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.900
I will never do it again.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.730
I will check every other night,
or get some sort of rhythm

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.252
so I know that I
could push it off

00:42:48.252 --> 00:42:51.700
to others that need it
to be or [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:55.160
AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.750
I feel like in some cases, if
you take a week off or take

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.670
two weeks off and you
don't check your email,

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.370
you need three weeks to
recover from your vacation.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:08.030
So that always gets very
taxing, because it almost

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.980
seems like taking a vacation
was a burden in itself

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.480
if you don't look
at email at least,

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.837
or some kind of maneuvering.

00:43:15.837 --> 00:43:18.420
JILL EBSTEIN: Well, I think it's
my biggest personal challenge

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.420
of all the things.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:20.670
And my kids tell me that, too.

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.760
They're like, can't
you just do nothing?

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.080
And it's very hard,
depending on how you're wired

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.220
and what your list is like.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.860
And it also comes back
to that passion or drive

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.560
you have inside you for things
you want to do, and maybe

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.610
the feeling that
nobody else is going

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.234
to do those things
that you need to do.

00:43:34.234 --> 00:43:36.030
So I have a hard time with that.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:39.450
But yet I think that
sometimes, we sort of burn out.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.980
So a lot of this is about--

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.080
when you look at this cover--

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.905
I spent a lot of time working
on the covers of my books

00:43:45.905 --> 00:43:47.280
and what it's
going to look like.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.450
I want the open road.

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:50.157
I want blue sky.

00:43:50.157 --> 00:43:51.990
I want us to feel like
we have opportunities

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.490
to do so many different things
that we're not as constrained

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:55.500
as we feel.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:59.790
And yet if we expect ourselves
to have the perfect life,

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.686
if we expect ourselves to
be busy and productive all

00:44:02.686 --> 00:44:04.560
the time, then the road
doesn't look so open.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.150
The sky doesn't look so blue.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:08.670
And so that's the challenge.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.430
But if you look at
discovery to celebration,

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.620
to be able to celebrate,
to have that energy,

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.900
to be able to affirm
what you're doing--

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.460
those are some of
the pieces that

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.050
have to fall into place
for us to get there.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.560
So now I'm going to make my
small little pitch at the end.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.320
So first of all, if
you guys read this,

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.980
I would love reviews on Amazon.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.430
That would be very helpful.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:30.730
Give it whatever you want.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:32.112
I don't care about the ratings.

00:44:32.112 --> 00:44:33.570
I care that it gets
read and people

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.730
have real comments on it.

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:36.590
I apologize.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.499
It is all women in
this particular book,

00:44:39.499 --> 00:44:41.040
and that was because
I was responding

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.520
to the "Lean In" conversation.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.520
But now I'm going to do
my pitch for book number

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.200
two, which is men and women.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.280
And this is "Lessons
From Our Mothers."

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.110
It's a mother bird and a small
bird, and it's giving a flower.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.570
So it's about gratitude.

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:55.370
Can you see that?

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:56.880
It's about gratitude.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.820
And for some people, that
flower is an olive branch

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.930
for complicated relationships.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:06.360
It's about how they make
their peace with their moms.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.940
But for others, it's about just
genuine ease and appreciation.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.250
And all these books,
all the "At My Pace,"

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:17.190
it's really about trying
to expand our conversation

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:20.130
with people that we care about,
on topics that we care about,

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.780
and being able to
take advantage of all

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.970
the different perspectives.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.790
Everybody is different,
but yet our pain points

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.710
and our challenges, there's a
lot of commonality in there.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:33.360
And if this book ends up
facilitating conversation

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.920
and some understanding,
then I will

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.070
have met my personal goals.

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:39.950
Well, thank you all so
much for coming today.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.220
I really appreciate that.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.970
[APPLAUSE]
