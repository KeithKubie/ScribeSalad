00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.166
I met Sal when he was a 10th grader at

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.707
Grace King High School.

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:07.290
He was in my Algebra Two class.

00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:10.819
That was a kid who challenged me,

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:12.322
he was a natural leader

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:16.852
as far as getting other
kids involved and active.

00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:19.519
- Oh man, you teaching AP Calculus now?

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.360
- That's right, I am.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.132
- Really, awesome! Oh man, I
would've brought you on stage!

00:00:23.132 --> 00:00:23.965
- No!

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:26.014
- No seriously, I didn't
know you were here!

00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:28.405
This guy, he wrote my
recommendations for college,

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:30.942
like honestly like none
of this would've happened.

00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:31.900
- No.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.775
- I don't know what to
do, I feel like crying.

00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:35.783
- No, I'm crying.

00:00:35.783 --> 00:00:38.824
This guy really hasn't changed one bit.

00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:41.871
It's still the same Sal Mankan
that I saw in high school.

00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:45.705
Down to earth, easy going, accessible,

00:00:45.705 --> 00:00:48.362
nothing pretentious about him, okay.

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:50.805
And that's one of the
things that really makes

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:52.911
Khan Academy what it is.

00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:54.426
It's like you know,

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:57.012
the whole thing is like the
gift that keeps on giving.

00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:00.262
Which I think what education is about.
