00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:09.275 line:0%
I'm here because
I'm designing

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.945 line:0%
a type of nuclear
reactor that can run

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.280 line:0%
entirely on nuclear waste.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.482
<i> It's able to
 consume the waste.</i>

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.318
<i> So it actually turns it into</i>

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:22.622
<i> a clean and carbon-free
 source of electric power.</i>

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:25.291
<i> We started
 developing this design</i>

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:29.728
<i> for a nuclear reactor that can
consume the existing stockpiles</i>

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:32.465
<i> of nuclear waste, of
 used nuclear fuel.</i>

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.035
And we started a company to
commercialize the design.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:39.705
It's able to reduce the waste's
lifetime and break it down

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:43.442
and use it to generate enormous
amounts of electric power.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.278
So, just to put
some numbers on it.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:49.916
<i> If you take all 270,000
 metric tons of nuclear waste</i>

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.317
<i> that exists worldwide</i>

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.086
<i> it's about a football field's
 worth of nuclear waste</i>

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.821
<i> that exists worldwide.</i>

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:58.091
<i> We can turn it into
 enough electricity</i>

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.660
<i> to power the entire
 world for 72 years.</i>

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.764
Even taking into account
increasing electricity demand.

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:07.934
So, it's just a staggering
amount of electricity

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.068
that's left in this waste.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:10.837
And I think that
there's a possibility

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:14.440
to start thinking of it as
a resource to be tapped

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.009
rather than a liability
to be disposed of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.378
without any further thought.
