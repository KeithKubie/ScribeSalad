00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:12.144
The year is 15 CE
and the Roman Empire is prospering.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.266
Most of the credit will go to the emperor,

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.661
but this success wouldn’t 
have been possible

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:20.521
without loyal soldiers like Servius Felix.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:24.934
Servius enlisted as a legionary 
eight years ago at age 18,

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:29.050
the son of a poor farmer
with few prospects.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.311
Unlike the majority of legionaries,
he doesn’t gamble,

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:34.915
so he’s been able to save 
most of his wages.

00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:36.758
He’s even kept his viaticum,

00:00:36.758 --> 00:00:40.651
the three gold coins he received 
when he enlisted.

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:45.369
If he survives until retirement, 
he’ll receive several acres of land.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:48.010
And he’s grown rather fond 
of a girl back home

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.199
whom he intends to marry.

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.811
But he’ll have to wait until he completes 
his 25 years of service

00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:55.425
before that can happen.

00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:59.491
And the life of a legionary 
is dangerous and grueling.

00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:02.790
Today, Servius’s legion, 
along with three others,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.530
has undertaken a “great march” 
of 30,000 Roman paces,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.111
the equivalent of nearly 36 kilometers.

00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:13.011
Servius’s armor and weapons,

00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:14.281
including his gladius,

00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.189
scutum,

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.511
and two pila,

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.082
weigh over 20 kilograms.

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:22.219
And that’s not counting his backpack, 
or sarcina,

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.230
which contains food and all the tools
he needs to help build the camp –

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.991
spade,

00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:28.730
saw,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.600
pickaxe,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.489
and basket.

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:35.020
Although Servius is exhausted, 
he won’t sleep much tonight.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.801
He’s been assigned the first watch,

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:39.016
which means looking after 
the baggage animals

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:42.601
and keeping alert
against a possible ambush.

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:46.090
After he’s done, he lies awake, 
dreading the day ahead,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.070
which will force him 
to recall his worst nightmare.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.041
At dawn, Servius eats breakfast 
with his seven tent companions.

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:58.841
They’re like a family, all bearing scars 
from the battles they’ve fought together.

00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:00.402
Servius is from Italia,

00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:03.878
but his fellow soldiers hail 
from all over the empire,

00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:07.019
which stretches from Syria to Spain.

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:11.479
So they’re all far from home 
in the northern land of Germania.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.081
Servius’s legion 
and three others with him today

00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:18.371
are under the command of
Emperor Tiberius’s nephew Germanicus,

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:23.271
named for his father’s military successes
against the Germanic tribes.

00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:25.952
Each legion has close to 5,000 men,

00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:28.800
divided into cohorts of about 500,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.960
further subdivided into centuries 
of around 80-100 men.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.611
Each century is commanded by a centurion.

00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:41.139
An aquilifer, or eagle-bearer, marches at
the head of each legion

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.992
carrying its eagle standard.

00:02:43.992 --> 00:02:47.472
The centurions march beside 
the legionaries belting out orders,

00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:49.870
“Dex, sin, dex, sin,"

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.650
“Right, left, right, left,"

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.459
starting with the right foot as the left 
is considered unlucky or sinister.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.331
Despite the strict discipline, 
there’s tension in the air.

00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:03.340
Last year, some legions 
in the area revolted,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.070
demanding better pay 
and a cut in the length of service.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.829
Only their general’s charisma
and negotiating skills

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.850
prevented wholesale mutiny.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.460
Today is a “just march,” 
only 30 kilometers.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.980
As the marshes and forests of Germania 
lie beyond the empire’s road system

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.001
the men must build causeways
and bridges to make headway—

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:28.871
something they’ve recently spent 
more time doing than fighting.

00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:33.970
Finally, they arrive at their destination,
a place Servius knows too well.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.041
It’s a clearing on the outskirts 
of the Teutoburg Forest,

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:40.811
where six years ago, during the
reign of the Emperor Augustus,

00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:44.212
Germanic tribes under 
their chieftain Arminius

00:03:44.212 --> 00:03:47.854
ambushed and destroyed three legions.

00:03:47.854 --> 00:03:49.583
Proceeding along a narrow path,

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:53.719
the legions were attacked from 
forest cover under torrential rain

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.933
with their escape blocked.

00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:59.136
It was one of the worst defeats 
the Romans ever suffered

00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:03.175
and Augustus never lived it down.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:06.368
Servius was one of the few survivors.

00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:11.311
Servius still has nightmares of 
his comrades lying where they fell.

00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:16.173
But now the army is back to bury 
the dead with full military honors.

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:18.131
As he helps in the task,

00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:23.791
he can’t help wondering whether the bones
he handles belonged to someone he knew.

00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:28.630
Several times he wants to weep aloud, 
but he pushes on with the task.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.265
The glory of the Empire 
can go to the crows.

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:35.660
All he craves is to retire 
on a small farm with his wife-to-be,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.485
if the gods should spare his life 
for 17 more years.
