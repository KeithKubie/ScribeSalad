00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
Problem number 20.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.970
At a local bookstore, books that
normally cost b dollars

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.270
are on sale for $10 off
the normal price.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.930
So not just $10, it's $10
off the normal price.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.990
So if the normal price is b.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.810
So b is the normal price.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.010
The sale price is $10 off the
normal price, or b minus 10 is

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.920
the sale price.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.920
How many dollars does it cost
to buy 3 books on sale?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.100
So each book on sale is going
to be b minus $10.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.430
So if you buy 3 of them, you
just multiply that times 3.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.720
So it's going to be 3
times b minus 10.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.710
And you see that choice
right there.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.790
Now if they didn't write like
this, if they multiplied it

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.690
out, you would just
distribute the 3.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.170
So it would be 3 times
b, which is 3b, minus

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.020
3 times 10 or 30.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.860
But that's not one of the
choices right there.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.710
And then lucky for us,
this choice is there.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.590
3 times b minus 10. b minus 10
is the cost of each book on

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.320
sale, $10 off the
normal price.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.570
Problem 21.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.260
If a line passes through the
points A and B shown below--

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.100
so this is A and this is B--
approximately where does the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.690
line cross the x-axis?

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.010
Approximately.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.110
So they just want us
to get a sense.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.600
So they're talking
about this line.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.990
Let me draw it here.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.200
This line right there, and I
just keep going like that.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.100
Do my best to draw
it straight.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.220
If you had another
pencil, you could

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.525
actually draw it perfectly.

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:41.550
And so where does it
cross the x-axis?

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.040
The way I drew it, it does cross
the x-axis right there.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.380
So let's see which of
these say that.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.300
So between minus
3 and minus 2.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.330
Well, yeah, I mean just the
way I drew it, this wasn't

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.690
exact, but that looks
pretty good.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.900
So I'll underline this.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.640
If there were some other choices
that were close to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.670
that, I'd have to be a little
bit more exact.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.020
But let's see what the
other choices say.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660
Between 0 and minus 1.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.240
Well, that means here.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.800
And clearly the line didn't
cross anywhere near there, so

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.449
that's definitely
not our answer.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.050
Between 0 and 1.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.440
The line was nowhere near there,
so it's not there.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.610
Between 1 and 2.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.650
Clearly not there.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.910
So we can be very confident
that our choice is A.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.970
Out of all of the choices,
that's the one that even gets

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.400
close to where even my rough
drawing crossed the x-axis.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.190
Actually, even my rough drawing
did go right between

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.580
minus 3 and minus 2.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.490
Problem 22.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.630
Which expression is equivalent
to this thing right here?

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.450
Let me rewrite it.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.200
So we have 7 times a squared
times b, times 7

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.750
times b times c squared.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.530
So when you have multiplication,
it's actually

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.110
commutative.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.550
You can switch the order
of multiplication.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.750
So if we just switch the order
of this, we could say that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.210
this is the same thing
as 7 times 7

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.580
times a squared, right?

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.940
7 times 7.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.610
That's that right there.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.710
And then you have times
an a squared.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.100
That's that right there.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.970
And then you're left with these
two b's, so you could

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.470
say times b times bc
squared, right?

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.750
That is that right there.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.650
And so we can just
rewrite this.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.920
7 times 7 is 49.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.710
a squared is just a squared.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.630
b times b is b squared, and
then you have a c squared.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.200
So it's 49a squared, b
squared, c squared.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.350
Which is choice C.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.620
49a squared, b squared,
c squared.
