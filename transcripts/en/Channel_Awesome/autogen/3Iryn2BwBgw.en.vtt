00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:34.820 align:start position:0%
happens I guess one or the other could
 

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
happens I guess one or the other could
take<00:08:35.060><c> over</c><00:08:35.300><c> if</c><00:08:35.990><c> they're</c><00:08:36.410><c> not</c><00:08:36.620><c> in</c><00:08:36.860><c> balancers</c><00:08:37.490><c> I</c>

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:37.610 align:start position:0%
take over if they're not in balancers I
 

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.100 align:start position:0%
take over if they're not in balancers I
mean<00:08:37.729><c> I</c><00:08:37.789><c> didn't</c><00:08:38.000><c> quite</c><00:08:38.210><c> get</c><00:08:38.419><c> that</c><00:08:38.599><c> part</c><00:08:38.900><c> yeah</c>

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:39.110 align:start position:0%
mean I didn't quite get that part yeah
 

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.540 align:start position:0%
mean I didn't quite get that part yeah
see<00:08:39.410><c> that's</c><00:08:39.530><c> why</c><00:08:39.740><c> why</c><00:08:39.919><c> should</c><00:08:39.979><c> we</c><00:08:40.250><c> take</c><00:08:40.400><c> down</c>

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:40.550 align:start position:0%
see that's why why should we take down
 

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.969 align:start position:0%
see that's why why should we take down
the<00:08:40.610><c> orbit</c><00:08:41.030><c> when</c><00:08:41.210><c> the</c><00:08:41.300><c> planets</c><00:08:41.690><c> align</c><00:08:41.979><c> there</c>

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:42.979 align:start position:0%
the orbit when the planets align there
 

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
the orbit when the planets align there
is<00:08:43.130><c> the</c><00:08:43.310><c> chance</c><00:08:43.580><c> for</c><00:08:43.880><c> a</c><00:08:44.090><c> ship</c><00:08:44.270><c> to</c><00:08:44.390><c> go</c><00:08:44.420><c> down</c><00:08:44.720><c> okay</c>

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:45.410 align:start position:0%
is the chance for a ship to go down okay
 

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.650 align:start position:0%
is the chance for a ship to go down okay
and<00:08:45.680><c> you</c><00:08:46.040><c> want</c><00:08:46.280><c> everything</c><00:08:46.640><c> in</c><00:08:46.910><c> Belper</c><00:08:47.390><c> shore</c>
