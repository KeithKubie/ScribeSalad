00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.980
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.210
I think I'm on.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.510
Okay. We're going to dive in.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.810
I'm told we're a
little behind time.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.350
So I hope you're all enjoying
the 2018 National Book Festival.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.510
It's certainly a day
-- yes, please applaud.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.050
[ Applause ]

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.520
It's certainly a day full of fun
and exploration and learning,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.160
or at least I always think so.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.460
My name is Anya Creightney.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm the Programs Manager in the
Poetry and Literature Center

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.920
which is housed in the
Library of Congress.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.020
The Poetry and Literary Center
is many things, but the thing

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.830
that you may know about
us is we're the home

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.330
of the U.S. Poet Laureate.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.140
So today is particularly
auspicious because I'm joined

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.300
by not one, but two Poet
Laureates here on stage,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.740
Miss Tracy K. Smith
and Mr. Robert Hass.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.040
Welcome to you both.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.840
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Thank you.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.340
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: So just
so we get the formality

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.590
out of the way, I'll read
a brief bio for you both.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.000
Robert Hass was born in
San Francisco, California.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.280
He is the author of nine poetry
collections including <i>Field</i>

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.070
<i>Guide, Praise, Sun Under
Wood, Time and Materials,</i>

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.820
<i>Poems 1997 through 2005."</i>

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.670
<i>And his newest collected,
Apple Trees at Olema </i>.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.970
He is a Pulitzer Prize

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.210
and National Book Award
winner, among many others.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.980
Bob Hass served as U.S. Poet
Laureate from 1995 to 1997.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.230
He's turning off his
phone [laughter].

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.590
Tracy K. Smith was born in
Falmouth, Massachusetts,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.670
and raised in Fairfield,
California.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.070
She's the author of four books
of poetry including <i>Wade</i>

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.550
<i>in the Water, Life on Mars </i>,
winner of the Pulitzer Prize,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.550
<i>Duende, and The
Body's Question </i>.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.870
She's also the author of a
memoir, <i>Ordinary Light </i>,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.990
finalist for the 2015
National Book Award.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.930
Tracy was reappointed U.S. Poet
Laureate in March of this year

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.950
by our current Librarian of
Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.510
So, again, please, one big
round of applause for our pair.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.270
[ Applause ]

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.940
So we're here today to discuss
their recent respective books.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.110
Tracy's Book, <i>American
Journal </i>.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.130
I'll hold up this show-and-tell.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.590
<i>American Journal, 50 Poems</i>

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.610
<i>For Our Time </i>is an anthology
co-published by the Library

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.770
of Congress and Greywolf Press.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.600
Tracy, you both selected
the poems

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.680
and wrote the introduction
for this book.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.320
And, Bob, your book, <i>A Little
Book on Form, An Exploration</i>

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.770
<i>Into the Formal
Imagination of Poetry </i>.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.670
Maybe even -- no not quite up
there, but any rate, here it is.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.440
And I think of the book
as a sort of deep dive

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.010
into the history of poetry,
but also the inclinations

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.870
that get us to write
poems in the first place.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.290
So I wonder, Tracey,
if you'll kick us off

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.590
and maybe start with a poem.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.890
It's as good a place as any.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.190
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Oh, yeah.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.490
What a great idea.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.980
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Perhaps you could read

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.590
from <i>American Journal </i>,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.290
and "A Poem by Ivy
Frances," on page 418.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.590
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Sure.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.270
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Do you
want to -- can borrow my book.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.570
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Okay.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.310
"Sugar and Brine,
Ella's Understanding."

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.310
Daddy slaughtered the hog
right there in the side yard,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.110
and it hurt to see it.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.300
But that won't stop
me from eating.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.830
Come Thanksgiving,
I'll dip a bit of ham

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.110
in Jackson's ribbon cane syrup
and pop it inside a biscuit.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.550
When it's time to
celebrate, something dies.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.590
When something dies, we
take it with the sweet.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.110
Take my cousin, Gerald.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.640
He left us last summer
-- a tractor accident.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.570
We were cousins by marriage,
but friends by choice.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.970
So I cried more than when I
broke my leg jumping off the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.890
front porch, bone
snapped clean through.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.050
After the funeral, as
the Lord is my witness,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.230
those were the best
potato pies I ever had.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.800
Yesterday, the yellow
pines meet the creek,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.170
that boy on the other side

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.620
of the property line helped
bring his daddy's cattle in.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.330
I watched him watch me
standing in a field littered

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.520
with cow's corn, my
head tilted just enough

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.390
to let him know I was curious.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.060
He left a scarlet ribbon
tied to the barbed wire.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.190
My heart skipped quicker than
a swallow's when I found it.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.300
Now I'm wondering that
throat's going to open.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.810
I need to warn him.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.640
The wheel never rests,
never stops

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.440
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Thank you.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.100
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Ivy Frances.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.400
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
So I chose --

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.720
that is a leaping-off point
for a couple of reasons.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.600
One I think the poem so
beautifully captured the voice

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.760
of a child, first and foremost.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.410
And it also does this thing
with cognitive dissonance

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.710
that we all can recognize.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.480
You know, loving and, you know,
attracted to something that,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.620
you know, either dies, an
animal that is then killed,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.930
so on and so forth, right?

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.230
And I love the ending.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.410
And so the warning, that sort
of harbinger at the end, right?

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.120
It certainly has a presence.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.840
But I also chose it
because the poem is,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.820
in a way, easy to penetrate.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.920
And I know that the
poems that you chose

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.320
for this book were intentional.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.320
And so I wonder if you
can talk a little bit

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.810
about the assemblage of the
book and what you were trying

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.110
to capture with the project.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.410
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Sure.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.720
I agree with you
about, by these poem,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.080
I think that it's
beautiful, it's direct,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.690
the vocabulary is
clear and familiar,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.310
and it touches upon
feelings that are troubling,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.260
that are sort of subterranean,
and it captures a moment

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.550
of a dawning awareness
from a child's perspective.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.850
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.210
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: I wanted
to find or celebrate poems

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.220
that allowed you to have
an immediate experience.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.130
I think all poems are
doing a lot of work

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.130
to facilitate an immediate
sense of connection

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.700
between the reader
and the speaker.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.060
This anthology is an
offering, as I see it,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.840
to people who love poetry
and might want to think

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.250
about how poems can
show us different things

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.730
about ourselves, about life in
this country, about language.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.560
But I also wanted it to
be an offering for someone

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.320
who might have a little bit
of anxiety or apprehension,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.320
having perhaps been told

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.020
that one must have a vigorous
vocabulary of literary terms

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.690
and knowledge of literary
history, that reading poetry is

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.380
about sleuthing something out.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.360
I wanted to put all of
that to rest for somebody

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.820
and say you can read this
poem, hear it speak to you,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.210
feel certain visceral feelings
activated without needing

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.500
to name the poetic devices.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.970
So I hope it's a book
that will bring poetry

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.990
to immediate life for a reader.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.290
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Mm-hmm.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.590
It certainly did for me.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.380
Well, you mentioned
life in this country.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.090
And in the introduction
you tell us that the title

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.530
of the whole thing is borrowed
from a Robert Hayden poem.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.830
Robert Hayden, of course,

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.760
was the first African
American U.S. Poet Laureate.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.750
So I thought a nice
homage there.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.710
But the poem itself if about
an alien whose from outer space

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.940
and comes down to
Earth and he's short

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.810
of describing what
it is he sees.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.370
And he's both, you
know, attracted,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.890
but he's also repelled
and, at times, confused.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.190
And so in a way it made me
think a little bit about poetry.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.580
And I think -- do you
think it's poetry's job

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.330
to both describe what it is that
we're inherently attracted to

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.290
and can it also relieve
what we're repelled by?

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.500
Can it do that work or
should it do that work?

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.630
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well,
I definitely turn to poems

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.610
for the difficult and sometimes
dark feelings that I live with,

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.810
the questions that
point me in directions

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.920
that aren't necessarily
celebratory, even while I also,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.190
of course, understand
that poetry is great

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.040
at bringing a sense
of wonder and joy

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.970
and hope into new language.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.210
Yeah, I think that whatever the
topic, what poems are doing,

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.140
and this came up at the
end of the last session,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.850
I think it's bring --
poems are bringing language

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.000
and sometimes unlikely language
to bear upon the feelings

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.880
that are deep within us,
the things that we live

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.690
with without necessarily
talking about --

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:05.990
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Right.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.810
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: -- the things
that confound us sometimes.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:14.900
Poems do a lot of work
to bring the right terms

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.200
to bear upon that.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.500
And I think it's exciting

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.040
when the terms are not
literal or direct, you know.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.340
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.640
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Poems are not
trying to translate something

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.600
in literal terms, but to
say feeling is so strange.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.030
We've got to do some - we've
got to go to the wrong context

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.540
to get the right feelings.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.840
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: I know.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.320
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: And I
find a great relief in that.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.620
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.920
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: This is
an anthology that has gone

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.470
through in celebration of things
and poems that are maybe going

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.250
to be useful for the things
that we live that are heavy,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.990
that are, you know, difficult
to share even with one's self.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.290
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Yeah, I agree.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.730
It sounds like you're
describing the act of trying

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.460
to transmogrify private
language and make it a human --

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.160
or share it with another human
which I think is really special.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.850
Would you read another
poem from the book?

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.150
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Oh, yeah.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.450
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
A poem by Ross Gay.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:04.850
Okay. Give the title.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.150
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Okay.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.730
This is Ross Gay's
"Becoming a Horse."

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:14.490
It was dragging my hands along
its belly, loosing the bit

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.990
and wiping the spit from its
mouth that made me a snatch

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.720
of grass in the thing's
maw, a fly tasting its ear.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.450
It was touching my nose to his
made me know the clover's bloom,

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:33.850
my wet eye to his made me
know the long field's secrets.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.270
But it was putting my
heart to the horse's

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:40.060
that made me know
the sorrow of horses,

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.540
the sorrow of a brook
creasing a field,

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.270
the maggot turning
in its corpse.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.850
Made me forsake my thumbs for
the sheen of unshod hooves.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.410
And in this way drop my torches.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.820
And in this way drop my knives.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.400
Feel the small song
in my chest swell

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.120
and my coat glisten and twitch.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.820
And my face grow long.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.630
And these words cast
off, at last,

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:16.380
for the slow honest
tongue of horses.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.680
In some ways this poem kind

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.660
of enacts what you're
talking about.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.960
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
You're picking

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.260
up what I'm saying [inaudible].

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.560
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.530
You know, this poem offers
us a recourse to feelings

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.140
that sit outside of language and
also a sense of unlikely empathy

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.500
or connection, right, between
the human and the horse.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.380
And it's not bringing the
horse into human terms.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.630
It's finding a place that
literally embodied by the horse

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.500
that allows the speaker to
feel something that's larger

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.390
and stranger than
what is ordinary.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.760
I love the things
that he discovers.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.190
The sorrow of horses.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.140
The sorrow of a brook
creasing a field.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.280
That's not the immediate feeling
I would get, but, you know,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.920
he's guiding me to recognize
a sense of, you know,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.280
maybe mortality or finitude

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.530
from a perspective
that's outside of a human.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.700
I like that, you know, the poem
begins by saying it was this

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.920
that gave me that, it was
this that gave me that,

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.970
but then there's a way toward
the bottom of the poem,

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:21.400
a sentence begins, feel
the small song in my chest.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.620
This could just be a colloquial
way of extending it was this

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.620
that made me feel that.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.150
But it also, by that
point in the poem,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.660
feels like a command
to the reader --

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.960
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Absolutely.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.950
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: -- feel the
small song in my chest swell

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.810
and my coat glisten and twitch.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.920
And so reading the poem I'm
also invited into the, you know,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.490
the point of view and
the perspective that's --

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.010
of the great beast.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.310
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.610
That said so capably.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.380
And you were thinking along on
the same lines I was thinking.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.840
The lines for me, and in
this way drop my torches

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.550
and in this way drop my knives,
feel the small song in my chest.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.490
That small song can
be poetry, right?

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.240
Even the way you read it, you
pause and it was pleasurable

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.600
to hear how you read
those lines.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.620
It really made me -- it seemed

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.500
as if it enacted what it
is you're attempting to do

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.470
with your [inaudible] project.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.360
And so I know this is
a companion essentially

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.070
to your project, travelling
the country, rural countries --

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.090
excuse me, rural
communities, in fact.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.460
So maybe you want to
tell us a little bit

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.110
about your Poet Laureate
Project, where you've been.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.130
I know you're just
freshly back from Alaska.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.430
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.730
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: As fresh
as yesterday, all of yesterday.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.850
So tell -- share with
the audience a little bit

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.140
about how it's been and who
you've seen in the travels.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.440
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Oh, yeah.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.740
It's been such a gift.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.670
So the project is now called
American Conversations,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.000
Celebrating Poetry
in Rural communities.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.890
And that's really
what it's been.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.590
We've taken trips to different
small rural communities

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.160
in different parts
of the country.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.380
The states that we've
visited so far are New Mexico,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.340
South Carolina, Kentucky,
and Alaska.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.860
And in each state we visited
different communities,

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.900
either libraries and community
centers or more curated spaces

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.340
like rehab facilities,
retirement centers,

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.380
and talked with people of --
large and small groups of people

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.680
about what they hear,
what they're reminded of,

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.250
what they're made to want to say
back to the palms that we read.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.800
So this -- now that this book
is in print, it feels almost

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.620
like a -- I said this -- it
feels to me like a hymnal

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.930
or something, when having
grown up going to church.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.500
We have something that
we can open together,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.680
read the poems together,
and then say,

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.980
okay, what do you notice?

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.560
Where can we go from here?

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.970
My wish has been to get to a
place that's not small talk

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.540
as an outsider in a community

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.740
where many people
know each other.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.560
I want to talk about
what's real.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.980
And I think a great way
of leaping into that is

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.030
to have the vehicle of
the poem to say, oh,

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.200
I hear my mother's
voice in this poem.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.060
I'm thinking in the Ivy
Frances poem about when I began

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.870
to recognize what loss was.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.380
This is how that happened.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.610
And so suddenly the poems
are allowing us to open

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:16.170
up different interior
spaces and it's exciting

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.130
to me that, a, that happens.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.650
It's not just a wish.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.920
That the conversations
about poems are not really

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:30.370
that different from place
to place, and that readers,

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.320
no matter who they are,
when they listen willingly

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.540
and carefully to a poem,
they make it useful

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.530
for where and who they are.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.670
So a poem that is
ostensibly about family

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.950
or about love can be useful
to someone who's wrestling

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.390
with questions of
addiction, can be useful

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.120
to someone who's dealing
with loss, in the same way

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.700
that when we look at abstract,
you know, designs, we often,

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.530
as humans, see human faces.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.360
I think a poem does --
invites the same kind

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.190
of involuntary work in a
reader, and that's been --

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.900
it's been exciting to
learn different things

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.200
about poems that I like.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.500
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: So it sounds

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.800
like people have dropped their
torches and their knives --

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.100
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.400
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: --
and had a conversation.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.720
So how have the trips
affected you

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.300
and your learning
about yourself?

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.400
You're talking a lot about how
[inaudible] we can be a vessel

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.170
to have a conversation
with others.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:26.540
But has it changed your
conversation with yourself?

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.840
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well, yeah.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.580
I feel - I love the
feelings that I get.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.900
There was something so
beautiful about visiting --

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.850
in Alaska we visited a Veterans
and Pioneers Retirement Center

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.380
because there are many
people who were part

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.930
of the Homesteading Movement in
Alaska who came and, you know,

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.030
cleared or worked the land
for a period of years.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.560
And now they've retired
with the sponsorship,

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.930
I guess, of the state.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.530
So there were people that
were speaking actively.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.590
But there were many people in
the room that were not verbal.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.730
There were people who were, you
know, living with Alzheimer's.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:07.470
And to be in a gathering where
speech wasn't the main thing

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.010
that was happening, where poetry
was allowing something else

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:15.320
to enter the room -- a lot of
people use the word humbled,

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.280
but it was humbling in
a really beautiful way

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.290
to realize something's
happening,

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.390
and it's not going
to announce itself.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.180
I have a lot to think about.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.690
I feel sort of gifted by
the different reactions

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.220
and the fearlessness of
people in coming into a space

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.810
where maybe they're not as
used to thinking and talking

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.450
about poems, but being willing
to let something happen.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.590
And, of course, I've seen some
really incredibly beautiful

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.240
parts of the country.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.060
And I've gotten a little
glimpse or even description

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.730
about what life there is
driven by or characterized by.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.030
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
That sounds beautiful.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.370
Bob, I want to bring you
into the conversation.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.030
Does all this talk about
laureateship bring you back

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.580
to your two terms as
U.S. Poet Laureate?

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.880
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: Yes.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.360
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Yes Good short answer.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.660
And anything else?

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.960
What does it call up for you

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.640
as you're hearing Tracy
describe this unique time

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.330
in very few people's lives
to be the U.S. Poet Laureate?

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.550
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: Well,
the job is odd.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.820
Yes. We were talking
about it beforehand,

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.110
that you're given this title

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:24.550
and you suddenly get a whole
bunch of projections --

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.850
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Right.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.150
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: -- that
you didn't get before.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.450
I've been going around
the country.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:33.070
We -- poets of our
generations did reading poems.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.130
But then you're called Poet
Laureate and someone comes

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.400
up after the reading and
say, would you hold my baby

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.010
so I could take a
picture of you?

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.680
That hadn't happened
before [laughter].

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.280
So there was that experience.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.000
And the puzzle of what
to do with this --

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.860
to talk to the world about
this art we love, you know?

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:57.330
Trying to weigh -- to
take whatever shine comes

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.550
with the title and
shine it back on people.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.580
I thought about spending
a week in this --

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.840
in the middle of winter in
the school in Chicago run

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.440
by Catholic nuns for --

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.970
everybody's been kicked
out of every other school.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.420
When I got the job of being Poet
Laureate I thought, oh my god,

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.720
what do I wear, you know?

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.020
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Right.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.320
The practical questions.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.620
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: Thoreau thing.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.920
Beware anything that
requires new clothes.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.490
But I bought one of those --

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.150
I brought one of those
heavy black overcoats

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.390
that Congressional
Aids wear on the Metro.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.240
And I put it on and
I was in Chicago

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.450
and there was a young woman

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:47.150
in the audience just
kind of looking at me.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.660
And I was blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.710
And I -- it was unnerving,
her gaze.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.800
And I said, Gloria,
what are you thinking?

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.500
And she said, I'm thinking
your world/my world.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.320
So you learn --

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.620
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.120
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: -- learn
things from our experience.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:12.110
A school in Houston,
not far from George

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:18.650
and Barbara Bush's house,
where most of the students --

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.970
it's the school named
after Longfellow --

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.170
are Salvadorian refugees
being taught

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:31.040
by a very dedicated African
American teacher who --

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.130
trying to figure out how
to include the parents

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.200
who are mostly illiterate
into the conversation --

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:43.310
started a garden of native
plants and of vegetables

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:47.240
because that was what the
parents were really good at.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.540
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Mm-hmm.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.860
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: And I
got to spend afternoon --

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.140
this was funded by
Shell in Houston.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.840
I got -- Shell Oil.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.140
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Surprising.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.000
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: About which
I have complicated feelings.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.700
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yes,
I imagine [laughter].

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.150
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: But
she had figured a way

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.180
to make the kids proud
of their parents --

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.480
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Mm, that's lovely.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.780
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: --

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.170
while teaching them
what healthy eating is,

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.160
and how to do things
with their hands.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.090
Anyway, it was a great
gift in that way to have

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.560
so many experiences that I never
would have had anywhere else.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.570
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
That's beautiful.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.530
You mentioned school-age
children in this beautiful scene

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.910
that you're describing
here in Houston.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.410
Your Poet Laureate
Project, River of Words,

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.130
was really for children,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.760
was from kindergarten all
the way up until 12th grade.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.060
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: Mm-hmm.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.360
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: That does
that bring up for you now?

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.660
It was a project.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.960
Maybe you can describe
what it was.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.540
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: Well,
River of Words was just --

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:47.870
was a project to just try to
get into the schools every year

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:53.270
for children occasioned to
make art and to write poems

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:58.040
about their immediate
environment, whatever it was.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.980
And at that time, for example,

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.590
in schools of education
there were no programs

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.460
about environmental education.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.320
That's changed since.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.820
So at the time we started
to do that, to get the --

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.600
and the program continues today.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.570
There are thousands
of school kids who get

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.630
out their art supplies
or get out their paper

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.200
and pen and wrote poems.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.640
So I think it was a
useful thing to do.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.940
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.240
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: Yeah.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.540
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Especially since it continued.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.840
Well, you know, it's funny.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.570
In the previous event
just before this one,

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.540
I think it was Patricia
Lockwood or someone was talking

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.390
about time being nonlinear.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.100
And so in preparation for this
conversation, I listened back

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.810
to your inauguration
as U.S. Poet Laureate.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.780
And you closed the whole reading

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.720
with a somewhat unusual poem
called "Shame, An Aria."

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.150
And I was so moved.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.360
I mean, it's not -- it's
not a conical Bob Hass poem.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.900
I really don't think
of it that way.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.200
But I was so moved.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.390
And I wonder if you would read
it for everyone if -- and if --

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.370
you can say no and
read something that --

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:04.670
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: No, I
would be happy to read it.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.970
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Okay.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.270
Thank you.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.570
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: But --

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.870
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: This
is quite a pleasure for me.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.170
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: --
poems that follow you

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.470
around like some embarassing
pet animal [laughter]

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:13.770
when -- this is one of them.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.070
My students say, are you going

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.370
to read your nose-picking
poem [laughter]?

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.840
Just so I give you a
clue to what it's about.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.840
This is "Shame, An Aria."

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.430
You think you've grown
up in various ways

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.430
and then the elevator door opens

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.100
and you're standing inside
reaming out your nose --

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.330
something about the dry
air in the mountains --

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:37.350
and find yourself facing two
spruce elderly couples dressed

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.610
like improbable wildflowers in
their primary color definitely

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:46.090
on vacation sports outfits,
a wormy color of one

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.760
of the body's shameful and
congealed lubricants gleaming

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.970
on your fingertip under
the fluorescent lights,

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.240
and there really
isn't too much to say

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.860
as you descend the remaining two
flights with them in silence,

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.780
all five of you staring
straight ahead

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:07.620
in this commodious aluminum
group coffin toward the

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.380
ground floor.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.460
You are, of course, trying to
think of something witty to say.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.110
Your hand is, of course, in your
pocket discreetly transferring

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.410
the offending article into
its accumulation of lint.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.950
One man clears his throat
and you admit to yourself

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.380
that there are kinds of people
-- not people in particular --

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.850
you hate, that these are they,

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.470
and that your mind is
nevertheless working

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.570
like a demented cicada
drying its wings after rain

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.620
to find some way to save
yourself in your craven,

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:45.510
small child's large
ego's idea of their eyes.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:48.410
You even crank it up a notch,
getting more high-minded

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.690
and lugubrious in
the seconds it takes

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:54.030
for the almost silent
gears and oiled hydraulic

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.850
or pneumatic plungers and cables
of the machine to set you down.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.610
"Nose picking," you imagine
explaining to the upturned,

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.740
reverential faces, "is
in a way the ground floor

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.040
of being [laughter].

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.940
The body's fluids and solids,
its various despised disjecta,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.360
toenail parings left
absently on the bedside table

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.800
that your lover the next
night notices there,

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.880
streaks in underwear or little,
faint, odorous pee-blossoms

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:32.290
of the palest polleny color,
the stiffened small droplets

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.620
in the sheets of the body's
shuddering late night loneliness

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.420
and selflove, russets of
menstrual blood, toe-jam,

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.990
earwax, phlegm, the
little dead militias

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:49.270
of white corpuscles we call
pus, what are they after all

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.140
but the twins of the
juices of mortal glory --

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:58.240
sap, wine, breast
milk, sperm, and blood.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.910
The most intimate hygienes,
those deepest tribal rules

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:06.710
that teach a child trying to
struggle up out of the fear

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.140
of loss of love from anger,
hatred, fear, they get taught

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:16.120
to us, don't they, as
boundaries, terrible thresholds,

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.260
what can be said, or thought,
or done, inside the house

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.310
but not out, what can be
said, or thought, or done,

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:28.290
only by oneself, which must
therefore best not be done

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:32.410
at all, so that the core of
the self, we learn early,

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:36.690
is where shame lives and where
we also learn doubleness,

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.660
a certain practical cunning,
and what a theater is,

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:45.870
and the ability to lie -- the
elevator has opened and closed,

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.900
the silver-haired columbines
of the mountain are murmuring

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.220
over breakfast menus
in the room full

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.240
of bright plastics
somewhere, and you,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.140
grown up in various ways,
are at a typewriter,

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:02.110
thinking of all the slimes
and jellies of decay,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:06.700
thinking that the zombie
passages, ghoul corridors,

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:12.000
radiant death's-head entries to
that realm of terror claim us

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.720
in the sick, middle of the
night sessions of self-hatred

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.770
and remorse, in the day's
most hidden, watchful self,

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.150
the man not farting in
the line at the bank,

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:29.070
no trace of discomfort on his
mild, neighbor-loving face,

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.350
the woman calculating
the distance

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:33.890
to the next person she
can borrow a tampon

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.350
from while she smiles
attentively

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.200
into this new man's
explanation of his theory

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.400
about deforestation, claims us
also, by seepage, in our lies,

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.990
small malices, razor knicks
on the skins of others

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:56.530
of our meannesses, deprivations,
rage, and what to do but face

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:01.730
that way and praise the kingdom
of the dead, praise the power

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.000
which we have all kinds of
phrases to elide the fact

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.210
that none of us can
worm our way out of --

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:11.520
"that no man can evade," "which
all must kneel to in the end" --

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:17.340
praise it by calling it time,
say it is master of the seasons,

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:22.390
mistress of the moment of the
hunting hawk's sudden sheen

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:26.270
of grape-brown gleaming
in the morning sun,

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:29.540
the characteristic slow gesture,

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.940
two fingers across the
cheekbone deliberately,

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:39.000
of the lover dreamily oiling her
skin, in this moment, no other,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.610
before she turns to you the
face she wants you to see

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:48.640
and the rest that she hopes,
when she can't keep it hidden,

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.490
you can somehow love and which,

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:56.510
if you could love
yourself, you would.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:09.390
[ Applause ]

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.690
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Thank
you for your indulgence.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.750
That was quite a treat to
hear you read that poem.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:16.650
I love it for many reasons, but
one, it's funny, as we all hear.

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.240
It's a bit strange.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.400
But also it takes
us in these flights

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.610
of fancy we would never
expect and ends with, I think,

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.150
something very human which
is this idea of boundary

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:32.400
and shame being -- keeping us
from ourselves and from loving

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.050
and truly understanding
one another

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.710
and how it is a learned
intrinsic behavior

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.010
from when you're young.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.760
And how we got to confront it
ultimately and get rid of it.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.060
Am I understanding correctly?

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.360
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: Yeah.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.660
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Okay,
good [laughter], good.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:45.960
My close read is accurate.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.760
Well, thank you for
sharing with us.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.850
That was an absolute pleasure.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.360
Let's turn to a little
book on form.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.990
It's a reference
text, but it's unique

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.290
in its being a reference text.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.800
I think of it as
almost like a notebook,

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.930
notes toward describing form.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.460
Maybe you can talk a little
bit about its assemblage

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.480
and the inclination
to write the book.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.210
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: That book
happened in a funny way

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:13.220
because I was invited to
be a Visiting Professor --

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.830
actually, my wife was invited
to be a Visiting Professor

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.640
of Poetry at the Iowa
Writers' Workshop.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.280
And I came along, and they said,

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.710
would you teach a
course on form in poetry?

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:27.400
And so I looked at books on
form in poetry and they were all

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.340
about hour you make a
sonnet and how you --

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:34.150
and most people don't go around
making sonnets anymore --

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.450
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Right, right.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.750
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: -- that
they don't do anymore.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.960
So I was thinking, well,
how would you go about this?

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:47.130
And I was thinking about little
formal things, the way --

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.040
what makes poetry memorable --

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.340
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.640
&gt;&gt; Robert Hass: -- which is --

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.550
and so I did handouts for the
class on what makes one line

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.110
and what makes two lines
related to each other,

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.410
and what makes three lines.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.740
And I was having fun churning

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.980
out these weekly
readings for the students.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.560
And that was that.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:14.160
And then about 10 years later
my editor wrote to me and said,

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.220
what's this book
you wrote on form?

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.990
And I said, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.900
And it turns out
some of my students

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.630
from this class had
been using these --

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:25.930
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: The notes.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.230
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: --
things online.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.710
And my editor said,
they're really interesting,

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.670
we should do a little
book of them.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:34.440
And I thought, a free
book, you know [laughter].

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.510
A book on form.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.430
So then I started adding to it.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.060
And we had already
definitely decided it was going

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.990
to be called <i>A Little
Book on Form </i>.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.260
And now it's a tone [inaudible].

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.200
But that was how it got started.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:58.190
I was interested in the
way that evolution --

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:02.960
evolution of poetry I think
in every language happened

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.360
because it was the oldest
memory storage technology,

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.270
was saying things rhythmically.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:14.510
So in Serbian and Chinese and
Bantu and every language people

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:19.390
over 200,000 years or however
long human beings have been

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.980
making speech, have been
evolving the most memorable ways

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.770
to say things, at
the core of poetry.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.130
And in the ancient poetry, of
course, the epics all being

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.560
by evoking the goddess
of memory because of --

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.810
so I was interested
in what it --

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:41.170
what kinds of patterning
made things memorable.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.400
So that -- and then I
thought, what is the difference

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.940
between grief poems
and praise poems.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.900
Do they have different
rhythmic patterning?

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.140
So I wanted to go back
as far as I could.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.430
So -- which for us as the
inventorying is literacy

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:02.880
in these different languages.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.050
And if you look across the
room, all the earliest poems

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.500
that got written
down are prayers --

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.800
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.100
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.400
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: -- in
one way or another.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.700
And they have particular
rhythmic patterns.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.420
And so anyway, it was incredible
fun to be suddenly trying

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.170
to explore and give
examples of reading

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.410
from that sense of the art.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:27.710
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
It was fun to read.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:31.310
It's unlike what many reference
texts I've read in terms

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.610
of form, which is

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.550
to say something what
you're describing, Tracy,

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.630
that does poetry a disservice,
which is to say, you know,

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:41.050
a sonnet is this and -- or this
particular metrical pattern

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:43.790
makes X, Y, Z poem
successful, so on and so forth.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.250
Instead, as you're describing,

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.550
it seems like you
were interested

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.050
in what I think you call these
were the sensual gestures.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:50.350
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: Yeah.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.650
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: And its
relationship to imagination.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:52.950
Can you talk about
imagination and how

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:58.530
that also is part of
the whole mixture?

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:01.860
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: When I was
thinking about this, my daughter

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.620
and her kids were with us
for a period in the summer,

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:12.520
and my grandson got up in the
morning and sat on my lap,

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.670
and we read the comics
for a bit.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:19.990
And then said, "Grandpa," he
spoke quite early, but he said,

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:23.800
"Grandpa, if when my folks
get up they want to go

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.300
to the bakery, you can come."

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.450
And I thought, form and desire.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:30.750
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.050
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.350
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: [Laughter]
He's already figured

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.280
out a conditional, and
he's figure out how

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.630
to use it to get to sugar.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:40.650
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: To getting
what he wants [laughter].

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:41.950
It's powerful.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.250
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: I thought --

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.550
that's what I've been
after [laughter].

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:45.850
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:47.150
Yeah. Yeah.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.450
That's great.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:49.750
That's great.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.050
So tell us a little bit

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.520
about how understanding the
imaginative playground makes us

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.070
a better reader,
or a better writer.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:58.990
And Tracy, fell free to
answer that question too.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:00.290
Either of you.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.590
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: What
would you say, Tracy?

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:05.540
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well, I would
say that I'm always interested

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.970
in why it would be --
it would make sense

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:12.130
to turn to a particular form.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.750
What does the particular
form feel

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:16.360
like it could be an
adequate container for,

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.540
and what can it teach
me about the feelings

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.370
that want to get addressed.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:22.750
And so instead of
thinking what --

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:28.290
I'm trying to find a path
into the inside of the form

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:35.220
that can give shape and courage
to my if/then constructions.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:38.040
And that's what I ask my
students to think about, too,

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.240
why would you write a sonnet,
what could it help you to do.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.180
And I'm asking for
real because I want

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.480
to know the answer
to the question.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.740
I say, well, I guess if I
want to think about, you know,

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.570
investing in something and
then finding my way through it

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.430
to something different, a
counterintuitive take on it,

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:56.650
then I might use that form.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:59.220
And then it becomes -- form
becomes about vocabulary

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.970
for grief or desire
or, you know,

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.960
whatever other feeling emerges.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.290
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: I think another
thing that we have in common is

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.560
that with -- in your
[inaudible] poetry

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.020
and with modernism
we inherited the idea

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:22.320
that all the traditional holding
forms are no longer adequate.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.100
That they have to be reinvented
across the whole range

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:30.090
of early 20th Century poets who
are -- where for us, I think,

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:32.860
it was certainly for my
generation, still totally alive

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.130
as models and possibilities.

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:43.310
So there's also the injunction
to re-imagine what those shapes,

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.540
shape of grief, shape
of [inaudible] anger,

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:53.100
shape of desire are,
and how to use them.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.620
I was thinking, listening
, Ross's poem is gorgeous

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.170
and in one way is a
completely traditional song.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.190
It's written in the
first person.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.150
It narrates an experience.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.960
In the last lines it tells you
the meaning of the experience.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.310
You can kind of pick
out the beginning

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:15.090
of that kind of poem
in the 1790s.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:18.480
[Inaudible] goes out into the
woods and has an experience.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.340
The [inaudible] goes out and has
a significant experience poem is

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.920
the very form of song
that we've inherited.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:32.250
And you can work in it
as he does in this one,

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.410
and do gorgeous things.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.440
And a lot of poets
are trying to do --

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.180
you can break it up
and try to figure

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.940
out what's next after that.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.590
And that work of imagination
for a writer is figuring out how

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.720
to get out beyond
your comfort zone.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.020
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.490
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: Which in my
experience is often a disaster,

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:53.790
you know [laughter].

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.510
Oh, okay, you can't -- but
you have to keep trying

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.010
or life will make you try.

00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.370
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:00.670
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.080
I've been told more than once
that you can't do anything

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.080
in a poem that you
couldn't do yourself, right?

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.380
And it seems similar to
what you're describing,

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.760
that it's an attempt to keep
going and to keep pushing,

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.970
and to keep pushing
past one's boundary.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.410
Does that seem accurate to you?

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:17.020
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: From my
experience of translating,

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.860
I spent 25 years helping my
neighbor, Czeslaw Milosz,

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:26.140
the great Polish poet, turn his
poems into English, and so I got

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.110
to watch this 30, 40 year body

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.020
of poetry was it
evolved and changed.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.980
And also from other poets that
I've studied, where you just --

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.300
either because I've agreed
to write something or just

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.190
because I love them and
want to understand them.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.660
You get to see that every
poet has a certain range

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:48.140
of modes they can use to get
at what they're getting at.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.890
And it's made me less
uncomfortable with the fact

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:54.870
that I'm -- there are certain
ways I go about things.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.170
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
You have a mode?

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.660
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: I don't know if
you ever had a feeling like, oh,

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.980
no, I'm writing another
Tracy Smith poem?

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.560
Have you?

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.860
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
Oh yeah [laughter].

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:08.850
Yeah. And then you find,
you know, the gradations

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:12.080
that the self can see
are -- there's so much --

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.750
they seem vast, but then what
the outside world can see,

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.470
it's just a millimeter
of difference.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:21.580
But to feel the -- to feel
emboldened by what seems

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:24.860
like a giant step within
your own lexicon is enough

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.000
to keep going, I think.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.380
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: It
seems like we're talking

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:34.580
around living, you know, a
thoughtful, engaging life.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.770
And I wonder what you think --
how poetry helps us do that.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.960
How does it instruct
us in that way?

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.750
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
Well, I think that --

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.800
I always feel like as a
writer, but also as a reader,

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.390
you get to go that
best self place.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.170
And then you come back down
from it and you see, okay,

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.920
but I still yell at people,
I still I get upset --

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.220
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Right.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.520
I still pick my nose --

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.820
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: -- but
language is so beautiful

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.760
because it -- if you let it,

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.230
it can lead you beyond
what is obvious.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.570
It can lead you beyond
what you think is true,

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.720
into something that's
more deeply true.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.090
It's a -- it's almost like
a laboratory for moving

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.030
around to different
perspectives.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:19.880
It certainly urges to listen
to things outside of yourself,

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.540
even if you think it's your own
voice that you're channeling.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:28.340
All of that I think is in
service of being a better self,

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:31.150
being more alive to other
people, and other things

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.380
that aren't people in the world.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:37.070
And maybe even more
submissive toward them,

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.660
which I think is important.

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:45.520
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: At least
that's the renaissance, anyway,

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.250
in Europe, that's exactly
what poetry has been for,

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:54.700
is for the self talking to
the self, the part of you

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.580
that wakes you up to your life.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.670
And that's in a way the
job of a poet, then,

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.640
that I didn't quite know
when I started, is the job is

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:07.300
to stay awake, pretty much,
so that you're available

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:15.650
to this experience of -- I think
of a bookshelf my daughter,

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.380
I don't know if she
was here, when she was

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.070
in high school she was
babysitting at someone's house,

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:22.680
and I brought over her
books because she had forgot

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.290
to bring them to
do her homework.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:27.170
And she said, do you notice
anything about this house?

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:28.470
And I said, what?

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:31.400
And she said, there's no TV,
they're readers [laughter].

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.350
And I went and looked at the
bookshelf and you could tell

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:39.050
that there was -- one of them
was probably a psychotherapist,

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:41.620
and one of them maybe was
a medical administrator

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.800
or something, and there were --
I saw what novels there were,

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.150
and what history books.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.980
One of them liked to read
English detective stories.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.660
One of them read
self-help books.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.290
And there were a
few books of poetry.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:57.980
Sylvia Plath, Langston
Hughes, Auden,

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.110
Ferlinghetti was a
[inaudible] area.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:01.830
And I thought, that's
about right.

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:07.730
These are busy people with busy
lives, and they're not like me,

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:10.900
reading poetry all the time,
but what poetry is form

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.320
in their life is that place
where you wake up to yourself.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:18.030
You know? To say, what
the hell is going on here,

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:19.860
when the noise stops
for a minute.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.310
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
Oh, I love that.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.610
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Yeah, that's nice.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.920
And it's no small task
to continue to do it.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.490
Well, you mention -- well,
it's funny you're comment

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:31.200
about there not being in a TV
in this house makes me think,

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.780
is there something
that poetry can do

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.800
that other art forms cannot?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.940
That you think that poetry is
best suited to do this thing

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:44.790
or maybe multiple
things, I don't know.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.340
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
Well, I think that --

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:50.820
I mean, a lot of what I value
in poetry lives in other forms.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.090
I like the way that poetry
allows us to stop time,

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:57.430
turn it backwards,
open things up.

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:58.780
Language does that.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.120
Film does that.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.130
But when you're reading
a poem it's just you

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.640
and the speaker doing --
on this journey together.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.280
I don't know, what else?

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.250
There's more, but I'm
curious about you would say.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.890
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: I think
it can do a lot of --

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:21.200
I think it can do some
things that film can do.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.820
Song is a separate art, is
complicated from poetry.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:30.020
Fiction. The thing that poetry
can specifically do is --

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.480
that belongs to it as an art,

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.690
is that it comes
from the inner voice.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:41.600
And it shapes it around things
you've thought and felt.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:47.320
And it's more intimate art than
any of the others in that way.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.590
And the places where
-- I think about myself

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:53.780
as a 17 year old
kid in the basement

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.980
of City Lights bookstore,
opening books of poems

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.680
and seeing people saying things
I didn't know you could say.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.430
It introduced me to
myself in a certain way,

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:10.650
and I think that's still
the deepest power of poetry.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.760
The kind of oral poetry
that was being described

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:18.060
in the last panel, that has to
do with communal experience.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.360
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah,
that's what I was going to add.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.660
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: It has to do

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:21.960
with bringing a bunch
of people together.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.770
And it's great, and I
love that kind of writing.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.450
And in a way my blah, blah,

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.200
blah [inaudible] is
that kind of poem.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.600
It can be performed.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.520
But the poetry that I love
the most is the self-talking,

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.940
the most intimate way to other
people's most intimate selves.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.240
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: I
feel like that even

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:43.400
that private lyric moment
that shapes so much poetry,

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.660
it's a living in the
same way that, you know,

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.790
the Bible is supposed
to be, a living word.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:52.100
I really do believe that
poetry is animating language

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.840
to a place that's
-- that is capable

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.450
of creating a sense
of community.

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.190
I feel that when I'm
in a group of people

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:02.780
and we are listening
together in wrapped silence

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:06.320
to this one voice, which becomes
larger than one voice in a way.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.370
That feels like creative.

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:11.620
Like it's making a world happen.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.380
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: And
there isn't that --

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:18.060
I mean, the thing to me is poets
begin with the kind of love

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.930
of the radiance of language.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:23.530
I was thinking about the
power of your poem was

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:27.940
to say things --
saying a thing plainly.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:33.070
You have to fall in love
with being able to say,

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:37.530
it's late afternoon
and the sun is misty.

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:41.530
Just let it sit there at that
line, or whatever the line is.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:46.500
The sheer magic of being able
to take our senses and turn it

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.490
into these musical [inaudible].

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:52.550
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
That was beautiful.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:54.470
I mean, there are -- we have
just a couple minutes left,

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:56.420
so I just want -- since
we're supposed to talking

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.410
about the making of poetry
here, maybe we can close

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:02.920
and you can say, what's
something that you listen for,

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.220
either when you're writing?

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.610
And we've talked about this
in so many ways, but for those

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:08.730
of us who are writing
poems in the room,

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.790
how to make themselves
attentive to either a line,

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.590
as you're describing
in the book, Bob.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:16.330
You said one line led to
another and so on and so forth.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:17.760
Or a poem itself.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.100
And maybe that can be the --

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.400
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Okay.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.700
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: --

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.000
the parting advice to
those in the audience.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.300
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: I'm in town
with my eight year old daughter

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.370
and yesterday we went to
the Aaron Space Museum

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.380
and did a virtual
reality simulation

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.800
of going into a wormhole.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.070
And I was thinking, that's
what we're trying to do in art.

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.480
We're trying to cover
these impossible distances

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.330
with like single words.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:42.490
And I think that I get
excited when I see that happen.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.700
I think metaphor
is the wormhole.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.060
But sometimes metaphor
can live in a single word,

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.450
it can live in a verb chosen

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.830
from the animal kingdom
that's actually in service of,

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:55.440
you know, describing a
human or child or anything.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.300
You're covering this
amazing distance,

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.090
even while you're
going somewhere else.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.390
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.690
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: And I get
excited when poems can do

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:05.400
that kind of succinctly, yet
robustly at the same time.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.700
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Time machine.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.000
Bob.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.300
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: I think
everybody is different

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.570
that way, but there are types.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:13.010
Somebody said that the two kinds

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:15.570
of poets are oxen
and lions [laughter].

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:20.120
That they oxen put on the
harness and they pull every day.

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.420
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah?

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.720
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: And the
lions sit around for a week

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.520
and then pounce [laughter].

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.770
And I think I've been
both at different times.

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:31.180
I'm definitely an oxen
where it comes to prose.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.020
I have to pull.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:37.780
And I tend to -- poets get
asked this a lot, you know,

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.080
how do you write poems?

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.380
And the answer, of course,

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.750
is we don't have the
faintest idea [laughter].

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.050
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Right.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.350
Right.

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:47.120
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: But it certainly
begins for me with music.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:51.620
With the disturbance into music,
of a phrase, of whatever kind

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.750
of phrase that suddenly
sounds like an entry -- yes?

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.050
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:57.350
Oh, yeah.

00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:58.650
&gt;&gt; Robert Haas: An entry, yeah.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:46:59.950
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Well, I
think we can all relate to that.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.070
Well, it's been an absolute
pleasure to talk to you both.

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:03.370
Our time is up already.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:05.170
Thank you so much.

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:07.720
