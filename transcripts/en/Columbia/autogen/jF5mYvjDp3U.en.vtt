very often choose many things about the
 

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.970
very often choose many things about the
circumstances not just the circumstances

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980
circumstances not just the circumstances
 

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.850
circumstances not just the circumstances
of our birth but the very sense of who

you know he was in a different position
 

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:52.130
you know he was in a different position
he was worried explicitly and always

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.140
he was worried explicitly and always
 

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.790
he was worried explicitly and always
about the fading of the history of

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800
about the fading of the history of
 

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.100
about the fading of the history of
Palestine the fading of Palestinian

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:58.110
Palestine the fading of Palestinian
 

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:01.370
Palestine the fading of Palestinian
culture the pushing of Palestine into

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:01.380

oblivion that it would become it would

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:04.740
oblivion that it would become it would
 

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.200
oblivion that it would become it would
be something that no one would remember

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:06.210
be something that no one would remember
 

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:09.020
be something that no one would remember
or that there would be no way to install

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:09.030
or that there would be no way to install

the memory to archive it to insist on it
 

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.300
the memory to archive it to insist on it
and so oblivion was what he was fighting

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:14.310
and so oblivion was what he was fighting
 

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:19.190
and so oblivion was what he was fighting

that history remained alive and I think

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640
that history remained alive and I think
 

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.820
that history remained alive and I think
that's that's really really important

working throughout the infrastructure
right so one of the things that happens

01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:44.840
right so one of the things that happens
 

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.330
right so one of the things that happens
is that the infrastructure of course

01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:46.340
is that the infrastructure of course
 

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.490
is that the infrastructure of course
gets bombed or destroyed and then the

cycle right and one of the problems with
 

01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:57.190
cycle right and one of the problems with
it is that you don't actually think

01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:57.200
it is that you don't actually think
 

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.390
it is that you don't actually think
about well what is it

01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400
about well what is it
 

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.970
