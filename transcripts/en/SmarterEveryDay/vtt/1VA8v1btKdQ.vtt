Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.040
So to fly slow is one of the more difficult things to do because you don't have as much airflow over

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.080
your control surfaces. To fly at zero air velocity is the hardest thing to do of all.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.160
Over the past weekend I've been making observations of hummingbird flight

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.190
in my back yard. So let's look at my observations and then we'll come back, and we'll look

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.230
at the science of how hummingbirds fly. You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.300
[music]

00:00:30.320 --> 00:02:51.480
                                 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.340
So what does olive oil and lasers have in

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.370
common. Hummingbirds obviously. Dr Doug Warrick

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.380
at Oregon State University and Dr Brett Tobalske at University of Montana have been

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.420
studying hummingbirds by using a nozzle to spray olive oil

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.520
in the air around a hummingbird. And then they'll take a laser and then they'll

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.570
slice sections of the air where the olive oil is, to measure

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.630
the flow field. Basically it's called digital particle image

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.640
velocimetry. What you do is you get a picture of an oil droplet, you wait

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.650
some finite amount of time later and then you get another picture of an oil droplet. That gives you

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.700
a two dimensional visualisation of the flow field around a hummingbird, which is awesome.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.730
So what you can do is you can use this information to calculate exactly

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.770
what the hummingbird is doing to stay aloft. In these pictures you can see here,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.810
you can see vortices underneath the wing. Using this technique they

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.840
discovered that about 70% of the hummingbird's lift comes from the fore stroke,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.880
and 30% comes from the back stroke. It's not 50-50 like I used to think it was.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.930
Another thing I observed is when a hummingbird would come into the feeder, right before he'd get there

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.000
he would make this tail flick. I didn't know what that was so I called Dr Warrick and asked him.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.030
Right now Dr Warrick and his team of biomechanists don't really know what this tail flick means.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.110
They're not sure if he's changing the airflow around his body

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.140
or if he's changing his centre of gravity under his wings so that the can make a maneuver that way.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.150
What they are doing however is making a six degree of freedom model so that they can

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.160
study this further. If you want to learn more about it check out the links in the video

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.190
description. So a lot of you have been asking about what kind of camera I've been using. It's a Phantom made by

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.230
Vision Research. If you want more info on it go to the description, I'll put a link there for you

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.270
so you can go to the website. Other than that click the bird feeder here, and uh..

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.480
You can subscribe.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.340
Oh.. Just subscribe by clicking

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.360

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.420
[cough] That is...

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.470
That's some good stuff.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.490
