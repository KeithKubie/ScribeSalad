00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.930
MALE SPEAKER: I want to
introduce Chef Charles Phan

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.620
from the famed restaurant,
The Slanted Door.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.810
I remember I've been going to
this restaurant since '95, so

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.150
it's a real pleasure
to have him here.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.129
He's a real San Francisco
success story.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.260
How many restaurants do you have
now, and what's on the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.610
horizon for you?

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.320
CHARLES PHAN: We actually
have five.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.920
We had six, but we're
down to five.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.960
I guess always my favorite one,
the new one, we're doing

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.295
a Bourbon and Creole concept.

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:39.700
We haven't figured
out a name yet.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.870
Some working title like
[? Bird Bar ?]

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.300
or Horseshoes.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.470
The idea is just to have these
vintage out of production

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.040
Bourbon that doesn't
exist anymore.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.930
Unfortunately, the whole
industry is just dying,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.090
because all these old little
distilleries that made some

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.640
great bourbon-- it takes
like 20 years to age--

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.030
and so we want to showcase
that, and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.130
Creole and fried chicken.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.170
So that's coming up.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.280
MALE SPEAKER: And I was just
hearing you talk about, you

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.285
actually won some awards
for your mixology.

00:01:11.285 --> 00:01:14.330
Do you mind talking about
that a little bit?

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.610
CHARLES PHAN: Crazy enough, our
family, and not just the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.690
immediate family--

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.650
we started the company
17 years ago.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.750
And the head manager's been
with me 15 or more.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.170
So about 20 years ago, we
started serving cocktail.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.190
We were really the first local
San Francisco restaurant to do

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.630
mixology, and doing things
naturally and organic product.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.050
Remember, the first cocktail we
made was like a margarita.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.740
I didn't want to use these
plastic lines that comes in a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.710
little plastic ball,
and Rosa mix.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.340
And this year, at the Tales
of the Cocktail, this is a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.830
convention for all the
cocktail folks.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.090
And I think regular folks
can go sign up.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.210
It's a week long of drinking and
research in New Orleans,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.669
and they give out awards.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:16.540
It was for nomination, and we
won the category of best

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.750
restaurant bar.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.860
And they have, I think, regular
bar, hotel bar,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.930
restaurant bar.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.830
And it was really amazing that
the colleague of the cocktail

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.820
world think we make
the best cocktail.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.770
Actually, there was competition
from London, also.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.694
A European was also in the
mix for this award.

00:02:37.694 --> 00:02:39.770
MALE SPEAKER: So you mentioned
that your restaurant, there's

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.340
a real family atmosphere
involved.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.905
You actually have some real
family members that work for

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:45.060
you, don't you?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.630
CHARLES PHAN: Yeah, I've
got 22 relatives.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.820
I don't have a choice in that.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.470
I have to hire them, because
my mom says so, and I can't

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.230
really fire them.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.740
I guess I can fire them if they
do something illegal.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.390
Like, hitting somebody,
that would be illegal.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.740
Well, the family
aspect of it--

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.130
I came and I wanted to do
classic Vietnamese food with

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.160
organic ingredients.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.400
And I have a background in
architecture, so I want to do

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.950
modern design, and I didn't want
to have a restaurant with

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.860
bamboo and Buddha and
stuff like that.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.060
Not that that's bad, but that's
just not my thing.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.920
And I was just sick and tired
of the stereotyping.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.540
I didn't want to do that.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.800
But once we started doing it,
and I needed help on the wine,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.880
and we have a wine director
for 14 years, and then he

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.000
finally quit and went to
farming, we were the first

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.150
company in San Francisco
to do Riesling.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.780
And no one would do in Riesling,
and we were getting

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.850
a lot of flack for that.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.970
But it would really
go with our food.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.870
Napa Valley was kind of angry
that we don't use them, but it

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.810
just was hard, because the
alcohol content would make the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.820
Vietnamese food taste bad, and
make the wine taste bad.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.690
But now Napa Valley is growing a
lot of lower-alcohol stuff--

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.420
under 14%, and that worked
with our food.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.960
Same thing with our cocktails.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.079
So we apply the same methodology
to everything we

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.310
do, from composting--

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.010
we were the first company
composting

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.900
with the garbage company.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.710
They were a guinea
pig 17 years ago.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.835
And San Francisco developed a
whole system of composting

00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:34.580
that was unlike any other
place, because

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.560
of the Kyoto summit.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.300
They wanted to reduce their
waste by 50%, I can't

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.210
remember, a couple years ago.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.760
And we were the first company.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.210
Part of the guinea pig.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.170
And literally, today, we produce
only 16% waste of all

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.290
our facilities.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.620
Everything gets composted.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.310
The oil gets recycled.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.540
In fact, there's people who come
and pick it up, take the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.930
used oil that we take, and go
make something with it, which

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.610
I'm not allowed to say.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.860
But they pick up my oil, so it
doesn't go into a landfill or

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.000
the sewage system.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.040
The cocktail, same thing.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.760
I just wanted to
make it simple.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.050
Food with a story,
have a history.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.040
So my philosophy behind all
this, and hence the book, is

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.480
to bring a little piece of
Vietnam to here, but using

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.490
local ingredients, and using
local sensibility.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.630
What I mean by that is I can't
really cook beef well done.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.470
Most folks here don't
like shoe leather.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.240
But in Vietnam, or other parts
of the country, they might

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.930
like their meat cooked
a little bit more.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.250
But I remember eating
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.190
beef-- a dish that's very
popular at Slanted Door--

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.450
in a hotel in 1992, and they
were using flank steak,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.750
smaller cut.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.680
And I thought the flavor was
great, but I thought the beef

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.100
was a little chewy.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.820
Then, opening year, at the
time there was a lot of

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.740
airline fillet, and you used
to be able to get whole

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.500
medallion fillet at United first
class, and everybody was

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.870
doing that back then still.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.750
So they had these tails that
no one wants, and it was

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.430
really cheap.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.340
And I got them, and I cut them
into little pieces, and I was

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.770
serving fillet.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.390
And I sort of created that
dish using fillet.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.310
And today, the airline industry
stopped serving

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.720
fillet, and we buy
a grass fed.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.850
We continue to improve using a
grass fed beef fillet, and

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.820
we're using an organic
watercress for the bedding.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.870
So the recipe is traditional,
but just the

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.810
way we present it.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.650
So I don't try to really
mess with the food.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.410
I mean, a lot of the kitchen
folks like to play around with

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.005
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:03.130
and form and all that, but
sometimes I don't let that get

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:09.130
in the way, because I think our
mission is always, bring a

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.240
little story about the food, and
tell you, this is how the

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.610
Vietnamese are doing it.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.220
This is the Vietnamese
aesthetic.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.940
Whether you like it or
not is not my issue.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.560
It's for me to present it.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.230
Obviously if you don't
like it too much,

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.970
I'll go out of business.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.550
So I have to make food that
people like to eat, but we

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.860
always want to challenge that.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.030
And I cooked dinner the other
night at [? Chez Panis ?] and

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.750
one of the courses we wanted
to do was sardine clay pot

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.160
with cherry tomato.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.385
And a few people, my chefs say,
wow, this is so fancy.

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:44.620
You should fillet it.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.230
And I say, no, in Vietnam,
we don't fillet anything.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.555
That's just not how
it happens.

00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:50.690
In fact, we like to
suck on the bone.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.550
So for me, I just don't
want to temper that.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.260
And we put it in a beautiful
crockery with

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.630
fine linen and China.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.260
It doesn't look like
Vietnam at all.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.720
But the bowl looks like
Vietnam, you know?

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.030
For me to present that.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.120
If you don't want to buy it--

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.830
And I did, in fact, that dish
has struck out a few times at

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.700
Slanted Door, because no one
bought it in the first year.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.840
MALE SPEAKER: So is there a
particular dish that you've

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.070
had since you started
your restaurant

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.490
that's on the menu today?

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.270
CHARLES PHAN: There's
quite a bit of them.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.630
The dish that kind of gave me
the impetus to start the

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.850
restaurant was the
spring roll.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.760
My mom, it was her--

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.720
Just a little background.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.190
I went to school--

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:34.720
I came to San Francisco when I
was in eighth grade in 1978.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.750
We left Vietnam in '75.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.580
I went to junior high.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.880
I went to Mission High.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.409
I really wanted to
be a potter.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.654
Is that Mission High?

00:08:43.654 --> 00:08:45.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.540
CHARLES PHAN: Oh, OK.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.370
Cool.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.890
And I wanted to be a potter, and
my dad wanted me to be an

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.780
engineer and a doctor
and stuff like that.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.520
And I ended up getting
into Cal.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.030
I got into Cooper Union, but
ended up going to Cal to do

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.390
architecture so he'd get off my
back of yelling at me for

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.270
doing art school.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.960
But during that time, I got a
job bussing tables in '78.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.330
He was a janitor.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.370
And I really saw the
food business

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.430
from the service side.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:19.240
And I went to school not knowing
that I wanted to cook.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.630
And I guess I like to cook,
and I cook a lot at home.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.380
My folks had two jobs.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.390
Then I left school, didn't
finish school, and ended up

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.590
running my folks' garment
business.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.510
And I actually had a clothing
store and tried to design

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.220
clothes, but that didn't
go too well.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.350
It wasn't really my thing.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.370
I was just trying to be
entrepreneurial like my folks.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.870
They were doing stuff they'd
never done before.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.890
Then that I went belly up,
and lost a lot of money.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.800
It was during the savings
and loan debacle.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.020
People filed Chapter 11,
we lost a lot of money.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.800
And then I actually got into
software, and selling software

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.190
for the SGI.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.230
And running around down here
setting up dealers, and in

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.990
post production, we were trying
to go against the

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.640
[INAUDIBLE] the clientele
and so on using--

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.900
But back then, I think it cost
$50,000 to get 30 seconds into

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.270
the computer of video.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.120
And that company went belly up,
and that's when I had a

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.640
little money from my job and
started Slanted Door in 1994.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.970
It took me a year to build it.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.460
I always had this idea my head
to build Slanted Door in this

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.380
small little place with a modern
design and the food,

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.920
but I never lost track that,
because of [? Chez Panis ?]

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.320
in Berkeley, I always wanted
some really simple.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.320
But my thing is always have a
history and story with food.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.910
So when I'm learning Moroccan
and Japanese, I like to go to

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:56.670
the source, learn how the
flavor, and just kind of come

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.340
back and create the craft.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.210
Anyway, over the year, people
asked me [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.183
book, and--

00:11:03.183 --> 00:11:04.512
MALE SPEAKER: That was
my next question.

00:11:04.512 --> 00:11:06.290
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.120
CHARLES PHAN: Well, never
graduated college.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.600
That's why.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.680
I don't like to do homework.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.225
And there's a reason why I never
graduated from college,

00:11:14.225 --> 00:11:17.250
and it's just, I never finished
my English [? 180 ?]

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.420
that I had to turn
in my paper.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.880
But more seriously, I didn't
think I had enough stuff.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.620
I think you've got to have
enough things to

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.740
say to write a book.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.760
But finally, after about two
years ago, my agent convinced

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.320
me to send out a proposal.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.250
And originally, everybody wanted
a Slanted Door cookbook

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.020
and recipes.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.170
I didn't think that cool.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.480
I always thought it looked like
a high school yearbook,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.690
and a couple years later,
you go back, and it's

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.330
like, who's that guy?

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.740
You know?

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.490
I really wanted to do a book
that showed people how to

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.390
cook, and more important,
to give you

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.150
the Vietnamese aesthetic.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.850
And the idea is to really want
you to understand not only

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:08.160
just how to cook, but how to you
eat this food, and why the

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.430
Vietnamese eat it this way.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.380
There's a reason for it, and
sometimes I don't know what

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.270
the reason, but this
is how they eat it.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.060
If they eat a bowl of pho, they
would put them in one

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:17.850
thing at a time.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.030
They don't put the whole
thing together.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:25.790
And the technique part, I see
a lot of people that don't

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.070
understand the stir fry,
the steam technique.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.840
They just kind of blindly
put the stuff together.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.530
So the whole impetus of the book
was like, OK, these are

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.620
the principles of stir fry, and
these are the principles

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.910
of grill, and these are
the dos and don'ts.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.770
And if you understand that, it's
going to make your life a

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.500
lot easier how to cook
this stuff, because

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.310
this stuff is not--

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.210
in fact, you shouldn't
follow the recipe.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:53.350
I think you should understand
why we do what we do, why we

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:57.080
brown the beef first, or steam
the broccoli first before we

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.090
brown the beef.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.620
Because there's a
reason for it.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.860
If you do beef and broccoli
stir fry, the broccoli is

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.940
going to be hard, and the beef,
you want medium rare.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.670
You can't just throw everything
in like a salad

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.190
bowl with a big flame underneath
and toss it, hoping

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.110
that all the stuff
is going to cook.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.980
So you've got to steam your
vegetable first, pull it out,

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.490
brown your meat, make
your sauce,

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.630
and assemble it together.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.535
But most people just kind of
picture the word stir fry, and

00:13:23.535 --> 00:13:24.860
just tossing.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.290
And same with grilling.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.140
Most people just go out and buy
an expensive gas grill,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.700
because they see it
at Home Depot, and

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.950
they dream about it.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.970
I hate those things.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.230
Those are the worst thing.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:42.360
I think a great charcoal grill,
if you know how to

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.360
harness it and cook [INAUDIBLE]
those, it's just

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.940
one of the biggest joys of
cooking is to really feel like

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.920
you can do this in a campsite.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.590
And there's just basic
rules that you know.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.770
It takes 30 minutes to
start your fire.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.290
Like all this-- once you're
comfortable with that, it's so

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.990
easy to come home,
start that fire.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.150
You don't buy briquettes,
because I

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.200
don't know what's inside.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.980
And with the charcoal, there's
a lot of air-- if you stack

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.470
up, it's got a lot of air, so
when you light it, it catches

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.870
on fire faster.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.300
Briquettes are just these little
square things the rest

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.470
of the world does not use.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.140
Only in America.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.950
MALE SPEAKER: Is there a
particular recipe in the book

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.890
that you're really proud of, or
you think everyone should

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.110
go home and make?

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:31.390
CHARLES PHAN: Well, no, no, I
think you should just pick

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.410
some that [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:37.550
like a technique, and
focus on that.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.180
There's some stuff that
will take you three or

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.190
four days to do.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.880
It's really hard.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.770
Like making the rice paper skin,
you actually have to go

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.810
to Home Depot first to buy,
like, making the tin, and it's

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.390
just amazing.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.400
It's called [? bankun. ?]

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.680
I made this.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.330
I was invited to cook
at The Master.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.250
This is in Carmel.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.040
They don't do that now.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.870
It's called Pebble Beach
Food and Wine.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.410
And they invite people all
over the world, France,

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.780
Germany, to cook them
super expensive.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.440
It was my first trip going
down there, and we were

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.020
fighting over the
kitchen space.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.510
And me and this chef--
she's since retired--

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.490
this 60 year old lady were
relegated to the pastry

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.620
department with a little
Bunsen burner.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.540
And we made this steam thing.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.350
Basically, you make it a ring,
you get this piece of nylon

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.200
fabric, like a parachute
fabric.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.800
You stretch it with a hose
clamp, then you make this

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.970
batter and you pour it, and then
you steam it, you peel

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.760
out with two stick, and
you make this roll.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.660
And when we did that, the entire
kitchen stopped and all

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.570
surrounded us.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:50.130
And it was one of the coolest
moments in my cooking career

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:54.650
to see all these fancy three
star, five star, whatever

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.140
Michelin restaurant chefs who
stop everything and see this

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.390
thing with a little
Bunsen burner.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.100
And she would just gracefully
wrap this thing.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.260
It's in the book.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.610
It's going to take
you three days.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:11.940
But it's just supple, and it's
just amazing, and it makes me

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.540
so happy to have this little
peasant food competing with

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.700
the caviar, the foie gras,
the five star restaurant.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.910
And still, as long as she's
sitting there, beautiful

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.830
setting, and nice linen, and
great food, it really doesn't

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.720
matter where it comes from.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.230
MALE SPEAKER: So when was the
last time when you were back

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:32.350
in Vietnam, and can you share
anything from your trip there?

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.670
CHARLES PHAN: Yeah.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.920
The book was shot in Vietnam.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.000
When I go to Vietnam, it's
always a little blurry.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.170
Vietnam's amazing,
especially today.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.160
The first year I went
back was 1992.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.900
I left '75, '92, the
smell and sound--

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.240
the sad thing is, Vietnam
had just sat

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.210
dormant for a long time.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:00.310
In fact, the year Bill Clinton
came to my restaurant in 2000,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.030
in April, and June he went back
and opened up Vietnam.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.740
That's the year my relatives
started seeing changes,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.940
started making money.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.030
Prior to that, they were
pretty much living off

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.230
probably $40 a month.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.914
They were in poverty.

00:17:13.914 --> 00:17:16.220
It was horrible.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.500
And Vietnam was [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.220
My wife's in Bangkok, so I've
been going to Bangkok for the

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.060
last 17, 18 years, and you
really see the difference

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:26.845
between the development.

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:29.520
And Vietnam's still trying
to catch up.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.450
Fortunately, they really are
learning how to protect the

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.220
environment.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.500
So there are lot
of bans on teak

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.350
export, antiquity exports.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.900
But at the same time, they're
like everybody else.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:48.220
They try to get their Mercedes,
and they try to live

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:48.830
a good life.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:53.140
And it's changing a lot, so I do
encourage you to go sooner

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.020
rather than later.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:59.060
But it's a lot easier today,
because back in '92, there

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.650
were hardly any restaurants,
because people are poor.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.100
I think food follows money.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.230
When there's a lot of money,
there's a lot of good food.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:11.190
And there's an amazing expat
community there today compared

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.240
to 10 years ago.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.670
And you find a couple of those
guys, they'll tell

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.260
you where to eat.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.530
I'm on the board called One
Vietnam dot [INAUDIBLE]..

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.660
I think.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:29.330
It's sort of like a place where
people can donate money

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.150
back to Vietnam.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.070
That's another source.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:35.460
You can kind of look for a
blog and story, because

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:42.470
unfortunately, we don't have
Yellow Pages or Yelp or all

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:47.230
this extensive review
on restaurants.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.010
Like here, we can look at.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.510
Over there, still, a restaurant
can be gone in six

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:58.260
months, so you kind of rely on
local experts who live there.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:03.820
My suggestion is do go.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:08.810
Try and eat not a whole lot of
raw things, and bring your

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.580
Pepto Bismol and
diarrhea pill.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.800
You're going to get sick, not
because it's got a lot of

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.191
disease, but it's because
you're overeating.

00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:21.600
If you're like me, when I
travel, I eat six meals a day.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.810
So therefore, hence,
I get sick.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.280
And I'm not even tell you how
many rounds of drink I have in

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.950
between that.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.950
So by nature, you're
going to get sick,

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.050
because you eat so much.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.800
But secondly, try to
eat something warm.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.940
My first place usually
is the wet market.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.380
The wet market's amazing,
and I wish that we

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.870
understand that more.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.690
In this country, we've tried to
build more farmers market.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.100
Over there, they're trying
to shut it down.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.600
They want Safeway.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.980
And it's just a crazy circle.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.410
The production chain from farm
to table is very short.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:57.880
They have a lot of
little farms.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.760
A little pig rides on
a scooter, goes to a

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.620
slaughterhouse, and gets cut
up and goes to the market.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.050
If you go to these markets,
you actually don't see any

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:07.580
refrigeration.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.950
It looks a little scary, but if
you smell it, if you open

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:14.230
your nose, you notice there's
nothing rotten, which means

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.940
they killed it in the morning,
and they eat it that day.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:22.520
And they don't have tags that
say expire by October 15th.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.830
There's no expiration date.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.180
You literally smell it, and if
you can't figure out if it's

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.750
rotten, then you shouldn't
be cooking it anyway.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:33.200
So unfortunately, they try to
become us, and we try to

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.220
become them.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.920
It's just kind of sad.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.610
And in Hong Kong, it's
the same way.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:46.680
And they don't really have,
unfortunately, a lot of

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.290
practices of protecting the
fisheries and so on, but

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.930
still, they don't have radar
yet to go out and fish mass

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:55.810
amounts of fish.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.260
But they start getting to.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.300
In fact, a lot of tuna
is coming out

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.050
of the Vietnam water.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.520
In fact, a lot of places--

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.890
a friend of mine, Paul
[? Bukalole ?]

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:09.150
in Vegas, amazing restaurant at
the Wynn, and he gets fish

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.780
from mostly Italy.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.110
And most of his fish actually
come from Libyan water.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.130
And when Libya went to war, he
couldn't have any fish to

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.240
sell, because a lot of
these places are just

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.120
getting fished out.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.840
And some of the places, actually
war torn, nobody's

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.590
fishing there yet.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.210
In fact, the joke is,
fishes in Libya

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.780
actually have beards--

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.440
like, long beards, because
they're so old.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.730
So anyway, Vietnam is a really
amazing place to visit.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.950
And you go to the market,
there's a lot of food there.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.360
You can eat the hot food, and
hot food, usually, you're

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.530
fairly clean.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.200
And just use your judgment.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.600
And sometimes you can look at
the back of the stand, if they

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.730
have running water or not, if
they're just carrying water to

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.410
wash their bowl, stuff
like that.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.220
And the market is just like
a cool place to visit.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.980
But today, there's so many
restaurants, I can't tell you.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.155
It's probably 100 times more
compared to 10 years ago, when

00:22:07.155 --> 00:22:08.350
I ate in Vietnam.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.740
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.670
So with the architectural
background, how much of an

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.690
influence do you have on your
restaurant designs, and what

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.610
do you focus on?

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:21.930
CHARLES PHAN: Well, fortunately,
I meet my dear

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:25.370
friend, now my close friend Ole
Lundberg, Lundberg Design

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.650
in 2004 when I moved to
the ferry building.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:29.470
He's in the book.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.950
There's actually a couple
photographs.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:35.260
A lot of the book was shot in
his outdoor kitchen in his

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.980
weekend home in Sonoma Coast.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.820
So Ole, it's a funny thing.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.510
When everybody finds out that I
was going to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:46.510
everybody sent a portfolio,
and they say,

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.340
you should hire us.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.030
In fact, some architects say,
I've eaten at your restaurant

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.100
for years, and they would tear
out the portfolio with a

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.730
fusion restaurant, with a Buddha
head, and they circle

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.200
it and they say, look, I
do Buddha restaurants.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.660
And no one really
gets who I am.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.820
And Ole, I went in there, and
he had a big old shop.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.480
In fact, I was on my way to
the dump in Carhartt and

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.500
hoodie and his receptionist
said, you know we're an

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.570
architectural firm, right?

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:17.770
We're not a contractor.

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.290
He was going to throw me out.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.560
But anyway, we met, and I asked
him how you would do my

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.170
restaurant.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.390
He said, well, you take a really
simple thing, and you

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.870
make it really beautiful.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.590
I'm going to do the same, so I'm
not going to give you fake

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.420
Formica, and it's really about
the craft and building.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.670
So if you go to the Slanted
Door today, everything is

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.110
built by his shop--

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.490
like, the reception desk,
even the table

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.020
bases, the light fixture.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.650
It's about the craft of
building, through that, the

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.040
design, obviously.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.680
And that restaurant is 10 years
old, it's getting like

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.260
1,000 people through it, and
it's holding out pretty well.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.550
And he and I have become
essentially drinking buddies,

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:58.490
and that's why we're building
this bourbon bar.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:03.040
In fact, there was like 400
bottles in this office right

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.130
now because we got on eBay and
collected all these vintage.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:08.890
We couldn't find them.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:12.260
Some of these do not exist at
all, and crazy enough, last

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.180
week, eBay shut down the whole
alcohol sales division, so we

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.700
just got it in the
nick of time.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.080
So we got these amazing bourbon,
interesting bourbon

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.700
from the last 40 years.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.190
And the idea with this bar is
an American whiskey bar.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.100
We don't have any scotch, and
the whole idea is just

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.860
preserving this culture that
is dying by the day.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.845
I mean, when I first opened
bar 10 years ago, we were

00:24:36.845 --> 00:24:39.470
buying this one company called
[INAUDIBLE], and no

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.620
one knows about it.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.290
In fact, you get on eBay today,
it's running at $250 to

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.750
$400 a bottle.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:50.110
And we used to buy so much,
that was our well bourbon.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.820
It's crazy.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.900
And we used to get
our own barrels.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.060
And about a year ago, they cut
us off, because it was sold to

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.100
a bigger company.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.930
And it's kind of a bummer,
because I'm no longer dealing

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:06.210
with the family, and the
demand is so high.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.230
So what happened in bourbon
is, you age it.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.200
You could have 100,
200 barrels,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.250
and they're all different.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.600
They're put in these what's
called rick houses, and

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.020
they're not temperature
controlled.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.650
In fact, the whole idea
is just let mother

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.260
nature do its thing.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:23.100
And the upper level is hotter,
so the alcohol will go in and

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:29.040
out of the charcoal char wood,
and it absorbs some of the

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.920
brown flavor.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.950
And each barrel tastes
a little different.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.940
We used to get to pick our own
barrel, but most manufacturers

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.870
don't like to do that.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.310
They like to mix all the 12
year olds, mix it all and

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:44.390
bottle it so they have
a consistent product.

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.030
And we used to get
our own barrel.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.470
It's Danny Meyer and myself were
the only two people, and

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.030
Danny was an amazing
restaurateur in New York City,

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:56.220
and he's from St. Louis.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.370
And unfortunately, all this
thing is gone, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.970
destroyed, it's all gobbled
up by big conglomerates.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:08.020
So we try to save
some of these--

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.230
the stuff we know is good that
we're putting on the list.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.300
So this is sort of like
a special place to

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.690
buy a shot of bourbon.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.510
MALE SPEAKER: So being a big
restaurateur now, what have

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.470
some of your challenges been,
scaling up your operation?

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.570
And also, what's new on the
horizon other than your

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:25.820
bourbon bar?

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.110
CHARLES PHAN: It's always
a challenge.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.900
I think just people.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:37.280
My chef Justine, she
came to me like six

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.350
months after I opened.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.570
We used to fight so crazy
[INAUDIBLE] certain day, I

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:41.962
don't want to go to work,
because either I'll kill her

00:26:41.962 --> 00:26:43.140
or I'll fire her.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.680
One or the other.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.320
But now we're like the left
hand and the right hand.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.310
And just managing that
relationship, because now

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:56.390
she's got kids, and she's got to
move on, because, I mean, I

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.380
used to be on the line every
night, and I have kids, and I

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.770
can't do that anymore,
so she took over.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.700
And now she has kids,
she can't do that.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.450
And finding the next generation

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:08.750
constantly doing that.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.010
How do you keep doing the same
thing and get people inspired?

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.240
That's kind of tough, because
I'm bored out of my mind

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.870
making spring rolls and shaking
beef, but at the same

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.000
time, it's my rent money, so
I kind of have to do it.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.310
But we always try to find
a way to do it.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.980
But always creating these new
projects, it really inspires

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.010
the whole team.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:37.780
The constant struggle is always
finding ingredients.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.545
We'll find a chicken farmer.

00:27:40.545 --> 00:27:45.730
Like, commodity chicken is about
$1.10, $1.20 a pound,

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.430
sometimes goes down
to $0.80 a pound.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.910
These are like the Tysons
of the world.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.400
But organic chicken's $4.00 a
pound, and they still go out

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:53.830
of business.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.620
At $4.00 a pound, they
can't make it.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:02.440
And every year, we see them go
out of business, and our

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.110
demand never goes lower.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.840
We just get higher and higher
on these demands.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.260
How you do that?

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:17.060
So often, it's supplied by
multiple farms, and sometimes

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.880
we have to pay them more.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.490
And balancing between value to
our customer and charging the

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.750
right price.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:28.410
But often, the number
doesn't lie.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.510
Sometimes you just got
to charge a lot.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.030
And in hoping that, OK, maybe
you shouldn't eat

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:33.960
chicken every day.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.040
Maybe it should be a little
bit more special.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.370
Maybe it's all wrong that
chicken is $1.60 a pound.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.130
In Vietnam, when I was growing
up, you get it once a month.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.180
You go kill the chicken.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.150
It's a big deal.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.340
Here, you can get chicken three
meals a day, breakfast,

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.920
lunch, and dinner, and
seven days a week.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:57.420
And I think we've got to realign
what's important and

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.290
not always say it's
got to be cheap.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.790
MALE SPEAKER: So I just have a
quick question, then I'll open

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:04.640
it up to the audience.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.273
What do you think the kitchen
of the future looks like?

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.320
CHARLES PHAN: Well, they go
through these fads, right?

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:24.860
And in the '80s, when I was
busing tables in '78, '79,

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:32.780
this [? called ?] nouvelle
cuisine, like, they gave you

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.940
almost like the Google logo--
three colors and three pieces

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.180
about that long.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.550
And then afterwards, you've got
to go to Chinatown and get

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.920
full, because there's no
food on those plate.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.230
And that was the '80s, right?

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:48.830
And now, for a long time,
[INAUDIBLE] this whole

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.080
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.360
But what I see lately is that
people are starting to get

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.550
fatigue of sitting through three
hour long meals, these

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.240
fancy meals.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.940
They still want good food, but
they just want it a little bit

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.270
more casual.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.750
They can just get in and out
and not have a [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.160
come and talk to you,
and on and on.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.850
I mean, there are always going
to be fancy restaurants, but I

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:25.970
think that people are super
educated now, more than ever.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:30.100
When I first opened, I served
maybe five whole fish the

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.870
entire night.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.630
Busy restaurant, 300 customers,
and three of them

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.450
will come back.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.240
People were upset they
saw the head.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:44.190
Today, I serve 30, 28 fish a
night, and there has not been

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:48.010
a fish coming back within
the last seven years.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.240
And with the Food Network, and
all this stuff, people are

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.830
just a lot more educated
about what food.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:57.400
And so I don't even
try to guess what

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.880
people like or not like.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.390
I just put it out there.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:01.240
If it works, it works.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.220
If it doesn't, I just
pull it back.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.450
At this point, at some point,
you just don't try to guess.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:10.420
But because I come from this
angle of classic Vietnamese

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.960
food, so I'm very confident
in the food I put out.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:20.920
What they don't like, then we
can always adjust and not

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.010
continue serving the food.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:30.820
But product ingredients are so
important, and also not eating

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.280
extinct fish like Chilean
sea bass.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.390
In fact, there's a
recipe in there.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.370
It was the first fish.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:41.110
I used to blow through about
50 pounds of flesh--

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.830
just meat--

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:46.130
a day at the original Slanted
Door, and they found out this

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.080
fish doesn't reproduce until
they're 40 years old.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.380
And in fact, today, Whole Foods
started saying it's OK,

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.650
but I don't believe it.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:58.230
So I don't eat Chilean sea
bass, but that is the

00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.340
fish for that dish.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:31:59.760
Steamed.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.780
I use the black bass now, but
that fish is so much oil with

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.970
three mushroom steam.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.220
It's just sublime.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.070
You just can't eat it,
unfortunately.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.240
And we try to substitute
other things.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.900
Unfortunately, I have to
admit that nothing even

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.560
compares to that fish.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.900
And crazy enough, that fish,
the hotel people loved it,

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.400
because you can stick in
that box for two hours

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.560
and it never dies.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.420
And this is one of those fish
that will make you look good,

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.710
even if you can't cook.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.010
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.780
So I'd like to open
up to questions.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.490
You mind stepping up to the
microphone, please?

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.550
AUDIENCE: The French left the
footprint on the colonial

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.366
architecture of Vietnam.

00:32:42.366 --> 00:32:46.650
Could you talk about how they
also left the footprint on the

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:47.850
cooking of Vietnam?

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:51.130
Are there any dishes which
really combine the best of

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:51.900
French classical cooking
with Vietnamese?

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.870
CHARLES PHAN: Well, everybody
would say that the Vietnamese

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.210
sandwich, the French
left there.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.720
But I like to say that we took
a French baguette and we made

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.160
it 100 times better.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.760
Definitely, the French had.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.110
The Chinese were in there much
longer, and the dishes like

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.720
the braised short ribs, it
will be a very minute

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.280
difference.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.030
Like, we don't have ovens.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.380
We don't roast the bone.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.620
That's why the beef noodle
soup, I blanch it in hot

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.810
water, and that's why I want
to explain all this to you.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:28.090
Because French classic stock
making, you blanch the bone,

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.500
you coagulate the blood.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.840
So you simmer it, the blood
doesn't break into little

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.300
microscopic and make
your soup cloudy.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.110
And Vietnam, we don't
have ovens, and we

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.020
have very simple tools.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.460
And you blanch it in hot water,
you wash out all the

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.140
gunk, it sucks the blood out
inside the bone, that bandsaws

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.720
all the crud.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.660
So in this case, we don't have
stock, so we use water to do

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.920
the short ribs.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.990
And it's just much lighter.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:54.810
And we don't have the
pavanse herb.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.720
We use lemon grass and ginger
and fish sauce.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.850
So it's a little different
version.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:04.350
Then we try to do casserole,
like French food, and we do a

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.870
horrible job at it, so
it's not in the book.

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:10.320
AUDIENCE: So you were talking
about how customers are no

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.860
longer sending back whole
fish because they

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.469
don't like the head.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:16.300
I'm imagining that authentic
Vietnamese peasant cuisine

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.750
probably still has some features
that Westerners

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:19.949
wouldn't be happy with.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:21.550
If you're a peasant cook,
you don't waste

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.900
any part of the animal.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.800
Chicken feet kind of
things, intestines.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.750
Are you planning to
introduce more

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.489
adventurous Vietnamese food?

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:30.389
CHARLES PHAN: I try.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:31.719
I did a [? Wu-Hing ?]

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:36.980
general [? store, ?] which is
Chinese braised pork knuckle.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.270
It's not a big seller.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.760
In fact, there's pork
knuckle soup.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.909
One of the cleanest broths.

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:48.010
Everybody knows beef and
chicken, but a pork knuckle

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:51.159
soup in Vietnam is
just amazing.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:53.719
I mean, I love chewing on
the knuckle afterward.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:55.840
In fact, if you're going
to buy pig feet, you

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.240
want to buy the front.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.340
The back's a lot tougher,
because the back needs to kick

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.390
more, so you buy
the front feet.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:06.580
And we are that actually anal
about which part of

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.170
the animal we eat.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:12.500
The tripe and that stuff, yeah,
I always try to convert

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.360
people to eat that weird stuff,
but even my own family,

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.990
my kids and my wife, and
they don't buy it.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.980
But I think eventually,
there's always

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.890
people that do it.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:24.230
Chris Constantino opened a
restaurant, nothing but offal

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.950
in San Francisco.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:30.130
But things like shrimp paste,
and if you don't talk about

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:31.420
it, people don't get
freaked out.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.490
I mean, we do a fish called
[? jakaten lung. ?]

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:40.150
It's a dish out of Hanoi that
is named after the street.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.820
I mean, it's named after
the restaurant.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.410
They only have one dish, and the
only thing you choose is

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.180
Heineken or soda or tea.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.690
That's your choice of menu.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.020
You go there, because they
give you only one dish.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.470
And the sauce is made out of
this ground up anchovy sauce

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:56.700
with pineapple, and it's
one of the most

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.560
amazing balanced sauce.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.230
But if I just gave you the
straight up anchovy, it just

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.975
smells like sewage.

00:36:04.975 --> 00:36:07.400
It smells pretty bad.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:11.140
Same thing with stinky tofu, but
sometime, somehow, people

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.040
just kind of like that smell.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.760
So I can't explain it.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.240
But is it going to change
drastically?

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.030
No.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.310
Probably a very small
population.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.970
We'll probably have better bet
in San Francisco than the

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:28.085
middle of the country.

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:31.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah, going back to
the discussion about fish, do

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:36.230
you see the future of this sort
of sustainable cooking as

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.980
figuring out direct replacements
for each of these

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.080
fish, or do you think that we
need to grow the recipes for

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.510
the more sustainable fish
like sardines and those?

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:49.900
CHARLES PHAN: Well, a
recipe is a recipe.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.320
If it doesn't work-- like, this
recipe is pretty simple.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.680
What's happening today is, like,
the east coast started

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.360
learning how to manage their
fishery much better than the

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.800
west coast.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.440
That's why last year they found
out all the crab's not

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.010
happening, or the salmon
is not happening.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.320
So they were kind of slow
to catch up with that.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.740
But I can tell you the success
stories, like the black bass

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.350
out in Maryland, the scallop.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:19.020
In the '70s, it got so
bad that scallop

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.190
was going to be extinct.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.370
And no one even knows this.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:26.260
By the way, if you eat
great scallop, fresh

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.970
scallop, it's amazing.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.260
And unfortunately, a lot of
scallops are covered in this

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.190
product called TSP.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:38.230
They preserve it, and they break
down super fast so that

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:43.190
you have the word day boat
scallop because the last day,

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:47.020
whatever the last batch is, they
don't cover this stuff.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.800
It's not waterlogged,
so they charge more

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.900
for day boat scallop.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.180
We need to start eating
farm raised fish.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.960
We just got to eat
the right one.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:05.070
For a long time, salmon gave a
really bad rap on these closed

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:08.810
containers, all these
antibiotics were put in there,

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.950
food coloring to make their--

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.545
you know?

00:38:13.545 --> 00:38:16.170
I think there's a book out
called "The Four Fish," and it

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.550
talks a lot about how
to manage all this.

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:22.983
In fact, the author talks about,
we don't go out and

00:38:22.983 --> 00:38:26.250
shoot a buffalo and put
it in Costco, right?

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:27.880
But we do that with tuna.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.380
And essentially, that's
what we're doing.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.240
We shoot this wild animal, big,
and we put inside this

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.850
mass scale, and we eat
it like we just chuck

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:38.130
it out of some factory.

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:43.540
So I think all of us in the
community, from chef to

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.730
consumer, we've just got to make
sure that we don't eat

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:48.380
the fish that we can't eat.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.050
And the best place is
really the Monterey

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:54.350
Bay Aquarium chart.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:57.950
They do a very abbreviated
version, just

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.340
kind of color coded.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.920
But for us we go
a level deeper.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.590
And sometimes, for instance,
we'll use certain cod from the

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:10.720
east coast, if they align
cod by the right family.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.900
And there's a balance, also,
keeping these communities

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.790
alive up in the Northeast.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:18.160
Like, you can't just say, well,
you can't fish anymore.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.110
I mean, sure, you can
say that, because

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.020
you've got a day job.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.610
They don't.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:27.350
So it's just, if everybody's on
top of it, the marketplace

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:29.540
will dictate.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.620
If you go to a wedding,
you say, I'm not

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.060
eating Chilean sea bass.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:38.540
So hopefully, enough people do
it, I guarantee you, even big

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.370
hotels will stop using it.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:45.290
Because a lot of those guys,
they just worry about their

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:46.840
job, and they don't care
about anything else.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.160
And they serve this stuff, and
we've got to put pressure on

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.450
them not to do this stuff,
because it's sad.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:40:00.000
Lobster is another great story
how it's abundant now, the way

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:09.220
they don't let you take
female lobster.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:12.170
AUDIENCE: You talked about how
you've gone back to Vietnam

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:13.780
and all that.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.080
I'm not sure how often.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.620
But each time you do, have you
seen them progress from when

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.060
they first opened to all the
progress they've made, they've

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.540
become a lot more metropolitan
and all that.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.910
Have you seen their food change
a lot between when you

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:33.570
left in '75 and what they
serve now, what's become

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:34.230
mainstream now?

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.220
And have you gotten any
inspirations from that for

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.470
your own food?

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.770
CHARLES PHAN: Vietnam
was very closed off.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:45.410
When I was growing up, you only
learned Vietnamese food.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:48.605
You might get influence, let's
say, from a northern cook, or

00:40:48.605 --> 00:40:51.770
a Hue, which is a
central region.

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:54.920
But today, there's sushi,
there's tapas, there's French

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.970
restaurants.

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:57.990
And pretty soon,
I think they're

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:59.510
going to get Food Network.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:05.700
So they can't help themselves,
except to-- when you give a

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.890
cook something, they're
going to cook.

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:11.690
They're not going to say, it's
Japanese, I don't do it.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:14.400
They want everything you want.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.590
And you can see how
it affects it.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:25.940
But at the same time, there's
a lot of local restaurants

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:30.410
that are getting very busy,
because the local economy is

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:33.250
doing well.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:37.520
And they're just exploiting the
bounty of what they can

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.270
catch, and sometimes, to their
fault, they're eating a little

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.210
lobster they shouldn't
be eating.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:47.360
And hopefully, the country is
smart enough to start telling

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.690
people not to catch it.

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:49.700
But it's pretty hard.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.860
They're not wealthy, so they
don't have government money to

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.925
regulate catching these
little baby lobsters.

00:41:55.925 --> 00:41:57.320
It's going back to the
lobster story.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.300
You've got to be seven inches
from the back of

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.710
the head to the tail.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:03.650
That's the only size
you have to catch.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.340
If it has eggs, then you have to
put it back, and you put a

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.510
notch in its tail.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.480
It's called the V notch, and it
pretty much guarantees that

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.930
lobster lives forever, because
even if you pick them up a

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.360
second time around without
eggs, you see a V notch,

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.520
you've got to put it back.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.320
And in fact, about four or five
years ago, Massachusetts

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:27.100
decided to go along with
everybody else, because the

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.140
eastern seaboard, they
go in circles.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.730
The lobsters migrate
in circles.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.590
So in Boston, Massachusetts,
you weren't

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:34.990
going along with Maine.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:39.280
And finally, they did it, and
lobster prices have been

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.830
stable, they got more than ever,
and in fact, every two

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:47.240
licenses has to retire before
one could be issued.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.800
And they have less people
fishing, they get more product

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.400
than ever, and I do recommend
eating lobster in New England.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.710
I don't know why it
tastes better.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:00.090
And I ship them here literally
from a friend of mine's boat,

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:01.430
and it doesn't taste the same.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.240
I think the stress makes
them taste bad.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.855
And something about boiling
in the local water.

00:43:07.855 --> 00:43:09.460
It's just amazing.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.270
MALE SPEAKER: So one more
quick question.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:14.520
You said that in addition to the
Monterey Bay Sea Aquarium

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.090
guide, you go one
step further.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:17.020
How do you do that?

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.310
Do you work with local
fishermen?

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:22.320
CHARLES PHAN: Well, there's
a guy, Paul Johnson, who

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:22.510
[? wrote ?]

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:23.270
Monterey Fish.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:24.360
He's got a book out.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.940
There's only a few
guys I trust.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:33.520
And also, when you travel, like
today, all our shrimp is

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.610
from Louisiana.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.190
We don't buy frozen shrimp
anymore from Asia.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:40.160
It took me a long time.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.400
Finally, Jimmy [? Gower ?]

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:48.000
started to figure out how to get
this shrimp to fly standby

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.560
with Southwest.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.260
And I'm not kidding.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.445
And literally, he picks them
up, covers them in ice, and

00:43:55.445 --> 00:43:56.990
it's not even sorted.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:59.300
And it's so fresh, because
shrimp comes

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.180
in different sizes.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.980
They're by catch, they sort it,
and they cut the head off.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.290
It's all this labor.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:10.850
Frozen shrimp, Thailand, it's
about $6.00, $7.00 a pound,

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:16.350
and fresh, wild shrimp, it's
about, with head, which means

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:18.490
you've got to have some
waste there, it's

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:20.990
about $14, $16 a pound.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:27.540
And today, I think we only use
less than 15% from wild

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:33.170
shrimp, and the 85% come from
frozen shrimp from Asia or

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.200
across the globe.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.200
I don't have time to find out
what's happening in Asia, and

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.210
even Monterey doesn't know
what they do over there.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:47.880
So I was happy to work with
Jimmy and have all wild shrimp

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.720
inside our restaurant.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.090
And the head breaks the
shrimp down very fast.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.930
That's why when you buy shrimp,
usually it doesn't

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.180
come with the head, because
there's something chemical

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.910
that makes them all measly.

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.360
And the head is the
best flavor.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.720
You cut the head, and even if
you don't eat it, the juices

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.430
coming out, like the
caramelized shrimp

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:09.410
dish, it's a must.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.430
And even whole food, you buy
frozen one, it's not the best,

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:15.310
but it's still better
anything.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:17.910
And don't be afraid
to use that.

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:19.410
MALE SPEAKER: Charles will be
up here to sign your book.

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:20.660
Thank you very much.
