MALE SPEAKER: Please join me
in a massive round of applause

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.660
to welcome Ben Miller.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.921
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.702
Hello.

00:00:12.702 --> 00:00:13.827
BEN MILLER: Thank you, Rob.

00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:15.280
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.020
I really appreciate that
spontaneous welcome.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.472
Thank you.

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:21.180
MALE SPEAKER: Ben,
you've written a book.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.640
BEN MILLER: I have.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.120
MALE SPEAKER: It's very good.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.850
I finished it last night.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.394
It's about the search for
extraterrestrial life--

00:00:26.394 --> 00:00:27.060
BEN MILLER: Yes.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.360
MALE SPEAKER: --what
that might look like--

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.890
BEN MILLER: Yes.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.098
MALE SPEAKER: --and how we
might go about finding it.

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.960
BEN MILLER: Exactly.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.770
MALE SPEAKER: Why did
you write the book?

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.610
BEN MILLER: I think it was a
bit of a midlife crisis thing,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.110
really.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.990
I mean, I just got very
into-- my scientific training

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.250
was in physics.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160
I've just always loved science.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.210
It's not something
I've done as a career,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.360
it's always been a hobby.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.500
It's just something I just
really get a lot of enjoyment

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.630
from and a lot of pleasure from.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.450
And this book started
with a previous book.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.700
I wrote a book called "It's
Not Rocket Science," which

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.300
is basically-- I felt there
weren't any books out there

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.450
which described the best
bits of science for people

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.450
without-- for bright people
without-- a scientific training

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.050
or background.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.710
So I thought, well, would
it be possible to write

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.180
about all the bits of
science that I love

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.710
and explain it in
a way that, say,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.080
a creative person with a
really good arts degree

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.110
could maybe pick up and
really get access to science.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.930
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.350
And this is digging deep
into that particular topic

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.782
of astrobiology and [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:35.490
BEN MILLER: Yeah.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.240
So when I was doing that
book, I came across-- partly,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.170
I wanted to do some
stuff about DNA

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.040
and the latest
advances in biology.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.760
And that just got me
really interested in life,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.420
you know, the physics
of life, what is life.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.220
I came across a brilliant
book by Erwin Schrodinger

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.580
called "What is Life,"
which talked, really, about,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.940
how does life fit in with the
second law of thermodynamics.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.249
One of the topics I hadn't
covered in the first book

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.290
was entropy and the second
law of thermodynamics.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.498
So I thought, wow, is that
something that I could try

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:17.820
and-- is that something I
could try and do justice to.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.880
Also, I just think
aliens is a funny topic.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.960
There's something
naturally amusing about it,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.600
sometimes intentionally,
sometimes unintentionally.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.094
And at the beginning of the
book, whereas, the first book,

00:02:31.094 --> 00:02:32.510
I was really in
my comfort zone, I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.975
was writing about things that
I knew quite well, this book,

00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:37.100
I didn't know any of this
stuff when I started out.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.020
So it was also like-- for me--
it was like my dream adult

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.500
education course, really.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.690
So I went to meet all
these amazing people,

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.460
incredible people.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.010
And to begin with, I had a real
embarrassment about asking them

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.580
about-- one of the first
people I went to meet

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.330
was the head of the UNOOSA,
the UN Office of Outer Space

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.999
Affairs.

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.290
MALE SPEAKER: She's our
ambassador if aliens come down.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.331
BEN MILLER: That's right.

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:11.754
So the idea-- and this
was sort of where,

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:13.170
partly, the idea
for the book came

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.770
from-- the idea is that
if aliens were to land,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.770
the UN needs to have a response.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.330
I mean, this is literally like
if they landed in a space ship

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.040
and came out and held
a press conference.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.940
There would have to be
somebody-- there's somebody

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.007
whose job it is, at the UN,
to liaise with the aliens.

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:38.590
MALE SPEAKER: That's
not her only job.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.030
BEN MILLER: That's
not her only job.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.950
She's also got to find ghosts.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.260
No, it's not her only job.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.386
That office, they basically keep
track of all the satellites.

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:54.260
Basically, if you want
to put a satellite up,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.210
you have to talk
to UNOOSA first.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.810
And yeah, so I went to
meet her and I felt so--

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.185
and the story is in the
book-- I felt so embarrassed.

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:08.940
I was going to this very eminent
Malaysian physicist who'd

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.759
set up the Malaysian
space program

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.675
and had launched the
first Malaysian satellite

00:04:13.675 --> 00:04:14.966
and was now the head of UNOOSA.

00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:17.100
And I went to have this thing.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.000
And I said, well,
so could we just

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.870
talk about this aliens thing?

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.000
And I said, is it true
that if aliens land,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.990
then you're the
designated spokesman

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.530
on behalf of the human race?

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.540
And she said, yeah, it's
pretty cool, isn't it?

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.440
And I just had the most
brilliant chat with her

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.360
where we got on.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.970
Quickly, you start
talking about life.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.773
You very quickly get on to
what makes life so special.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.140
We very quickly got onto
even spiritual subjects.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.930
You know, what does it all mean.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.990
What are we here for?

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.470
And why do we want
to talk to aliens?

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.270
And I began to
realize that there

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.640
was real science, that you
could go-- what you could do

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.530
is you could take all the
latest stuff that we had found

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.260
in astronomy, and you could
take all of the latest stuff

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.010
that we had found in
evolutionary biology,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.750
and you could put
it all together,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.170
and you could do a pretty good
job, really, of finding out

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.000
what life on Earth could tell
you about any other life that

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.870
might be out there.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:44.100
And that's in every respect--
how it might get its start,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.140
what life is in physical
terms-- you know,

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.350
is there any-- it's
a huge subject.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.590
How would you communicate with
it if you could communicate?

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.650
Just say, for
example, we did manage

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.390
to receive some kind of signal.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.860
How would we know
it was a signal?

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.960
Could we decode it?

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.610
If we couldn't decode
it, what information

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.070
could we get from it?

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.097
And it becomes a
really-- It's just--

00:06:16.097 --> 00:06:17.680
MALE SPEAKER: I
think, on that topic--

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.980
BEN MILLER: --a
fabulous subject.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.680
MALE SPEAKER: --there was a
point where you were talking

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.820
about Zipf's law and dolphins--
and we'll move on to the that--

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.110
BEN MILLER: Ah.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.860
MALE SPEAKER: --which is weird.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.360
BEN MILLER: Oh my god.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.818
MALE SPEAKER: But
essentially, even

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:27.620
if you can't understand
what is in a signal,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.279
you could prove that it
had intelligence behind it.

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.820
BEN MILLER: Well, yes, I imagine
that information theory will

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.653
be bread and butter to
a lot of people here,

00:06:35.653 --> 00:06:37.250
but it was very new to me.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.110
And the idea that you
could-- basically,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.380
the mathematical
properties of language

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.010
are there whether or
not you can understand

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.120
what the message says or not.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.790
So you could know
that something--

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.450
you can't know that
it is language,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.010
that it is
communication, but you

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.170
can see whether it has the
properties of language.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.980
And you can see how
complex a language

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.549
it could possibly
be without knowing

00:07:08.549 --> 00:07:09.590
the content, the message.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.090
MALE SPEAKER: If you analyze
the speech patterns of a child,

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.290
they're less complicated
than the speech

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.900
patterns of an adult.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.200
BEN MILLER: Exactly.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.574
So they did this
brilliant thing.

00:07:14.574 --> 00:07:20.679
So one of the stories in
the book is about how--

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:21.970
and this was really news to me.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.652
I hadn't realized that we think
of ourselves as very special.

00:07:25.652 --> 00:07:27.110
Homo sapiens, we
think of ourselves

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.810
as being really extraordinary.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.930
We are intelligent.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:38.460
It began with the domestication
of animals and farming.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.370
And then we built civilizations.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.920
And then we discovered language.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.580
And we have this story
that we tell ourselves

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.262
where we are completely
unique on the planet.

00:07:49.262 --> 00:07:50.720
And it's really,
really interesting

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.670
to discover that all
those traits are there

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.740
in other species.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.240
MALE SPEAKER: You talk about
farming as something ants do.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.634
BEN MILLER: Ants, yeah.

00:08:00.634 --> 00:08:03.760
There's a South
American ant that's

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.942
been farming, fungus farming,
for about 6 million years.

00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:11.150
MALE SPEAKER: They treat
the fungus with antibiotics.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.274
BEN MILLER: They treat the
fungus with antibiotics,

00:08:13.274 --> 00:08:15.660
they farm it, they cultivate
it, they use it as food.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.170
It's farming.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.400
You can't argue with it.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.800
It's definitely farming.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.860
The crow family-- I met
this fabulous professor

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.360
at the University of Cambridge
who's done a lot of work with

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.970
crows and has shown that
crows have cognitive abilities

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.350
not just on a par with
chimpanzees, but in some cases,

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.770
better than chimpanzees.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.880
And you start to form
this picture of-- it

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.570
starts to become very,
very interesting.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.960
And you see our own
very lucky position

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.740
as being more of an
accident, really,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:04.380
than a vital last step in a long
chain of progressive evolution.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.739
It's really interesting.

00:09:05.739 --> 00:09:07.780
MALE SPEAKER: And you call
out the intelligence--

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.520
so, the example of convergence,
where different elements come

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.910
about through entirely
different evolutionary paths--

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.860
BEN MILLER: That's
a great example.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.120
MALE SPEAKER: --and
intelligence being one of those.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.953
BEN MILLER: Exactly.

00:09:16.953 --> 00:09:20.330
So again, new to me was this
idea of convergent evolution.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.500
We've all heard of
divergent evolution.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.400
Organisms speciate over
time, and we end up

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.900
with a planet that's full of
all kinds of different things.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.220
But there's also
convergent evolution.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:39.810
So things like wings have
evolved independently,

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.050
maybe half a dozen times,
in different species,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.170
completely unrelated.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.510
In fact, convergence is such
a problem for biologists

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.940
that many mistakes
have been made

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:56.252
since the 19th century,
where one creature from one

00:09:56.252 --> 00:09:58.793
part of the planet looks so like
a creature from another part

00:09:58.793 --> 00:10:00.584
of the planet, they
believe they're related

00:10:00.584 --> 00:10:03.690
and only later find out that
they are on a completely

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.470
different evolutionary path.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.219
MALE SPEAKER: I was
reading, this morning,

00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:09.890
that carnivorous plants have
evolved nine times in five

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.390
different orders.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.200
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.658
BEN MILLER: And
this is everywhere.

00:10:13.658 --> 00:10:18.720
So teeth, eyes-- our eyes are
remarkably similar, in design,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.310
to octopus eyes, for example.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.580
But obviously, the common
ancestor of us and the octopus

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:32.010
is-- you're going right back
to the Cambrian explosion

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.780
540 million years ago.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.600
It's really striking.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.180
And intelligence--
there is intelligence

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:47.880
in-- arguably, intelligence in--
dolphins, in crows, in octopus.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.290
You could include dogs, cats.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.289
There's all kinds of
different creatures.

00:10:53.289 --> 00:10:54.830
Of all of those,
the most interesting

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.570
is probably octopuses
and mammals,

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.550
because again, it's
such a long way back.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.080
But even with crows,
for a common ancestor

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.650
between crows and us,
you've got to go back

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:13.920
to what they call an amniote,
something that was basically

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.430
just laying eggs on land.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.450
MALE SPEAKER: Well, let's
go right back [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.590
So you open the book
with extremophiles--

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.020
so, bacteria in a rock here?

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.929
How do I--

00:11:21.929 --> 00:11:23.470
BEN MILLER: There's
been three-- what

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:29.680
was happening is all-- three
different areas of science

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.999
are all converging on
the same point, really.

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:34.540
We've had the Kepler
Space Telescope,

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.455
which has shown us that
Earth-like planets are common.

00:11:39.455 --> 00:11:40.830
So whereas 20
years ago, we might

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.160
have believed there
were no other planets

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.040
outside the solar
system, we now know

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.900
Earth-like planets are common.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:51.080
And maybe something like
one in 1,000 solar systems

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.930
is like our own, with
a big, cold Jupiter,

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.220
terrestrial planets the right
distance from a Sun-like star

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.380
to have water on their surface.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.330
We know that these
things are common.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.540
So that was one area.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.880
There's another area, which was
extremophiles, which has also

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.680
been going in parallel, where
we've discovered that life

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:18.620
on Earth is much more resilient,
creative, resourceful than we

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.160
ever realized.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.050
We thought that there was a
certain zone of temperatures,

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.459
acidities, pressures, radiation
levels where life could exist.

00:12:28.459 --> 00:12:30.750
And time and time again,
we've discovered that's wrong.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.530
You always find some bacterium
somewhere, very, very happy

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.440
to live in those conditions.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.730
And then finally, there's
been the advances-- again,

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.700
this is all new to me,
and it's really, really

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.670
great stuff-- advances
in evolutionary biology.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.820
So we've now got some
really good theories that

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:53.690
make an awful lot of
sense, not the Darwin warm

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:58.880
pond that you may heard
of, but this idea that life

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.140
began in alkaline
hydrothermal vents.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.930
Because you get a particularly
unique situation there where

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.710
you've got lots of
transition metals.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.970
One thing we do know is
that life, as we know it,

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.325
adores transition metals.

00:13:11.325 --> 00:13:14.830
It kind of uses transition
metals as little batteries

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.870
to borrow electrons from
and pay electrons back

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.990
when it suits it.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.520
You have this great-- it's
an electrochemical cell,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:32.210
basically, because the first
sea waters were acidic.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.890
And if you have an
alkaline hydrothermal vent,

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.180
you essentially get,
across the membrane,

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:43.790
the semi-permeable membrane of
the bubbles inside the vent,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.640
these gel-like iron
sulfide bubbles,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.220
you get this charge separation.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.970
And that can be used to
drive-- as an energy source,

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.380
to drive-- the formation
of long-chain molecules.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:04.590
So suddenly, so many
missing steps of the jigsaw

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.760
are almost falling into place.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.340
And you begin to have an
explanation for the beginning

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.320
of life that sort of makes
sense in physical, biological,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.839
and chemical terms.

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:18.380
MALE SPEAKER: So
once you have that--

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.340
BEN MILLER: You've
got these three areas

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.173
all coming together.

00:14:20.173 --> 00:14:23.250
And now everyone's going,
shit, there's life everywhere.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:27.630
Because we think volcanic
Earth-like planets

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.810
would be common.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.450
We know that life on Earth
started, pretty much,

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.530
out of the box.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.170
The early Earth, as you know,
was pummeled with asteroids.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.450
We're now pretty sure
that life started even

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.744
during that period.

00:14:43.744 --> 00:14:46.160
So that means that it couldn't
really have been in a pond.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.160
A pond doesn't make sense
if the Earth's getting

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.159
pummeled with asteroids.

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:53.230
But a hydrothermal vent
on the ocean floor,

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.620
that makes complete sense.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.190
And we know that these
planets are common.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.380
And we know that life
can exist in such

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.060
an extraordinary wide
variety of conditions.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.520
In fact, we're
the extremophiles.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.850
This is the thing that
we've basically figured out,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:19.560
that microbial life didn't-- the
first microbial life basically

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.190
used metals as a food source.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.330
Now all life, the
life that produces

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.270
the food, the sugars
that we like to eat,

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:33.030
rips electrons off water,
stuffs them onto carbon dioxide

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.700
to make long-chain molecules.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.230
Well, the first life
ripped electrons just

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.680
from metals that were
in the vent, again,

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.340
stuffed them onto carbon dioxide
to make long-chain molecules.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.756
MALE SPEAKER: So once you have
that early microbial life--

00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:49.133
which, let's assume that it's
quite abundant throughout

00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:50.080
the universe--

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.020
BEN MILLER: Yeah, this
is the difficult bit.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.480
Yeah, this is the
tricky bit, isn't it?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.355
MALE SPEAKER: How do
you get to complex life?

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:58.700
BEN MILLER: So yeah,
microbial life-- common.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.322
Most reasonable people,
I think-- certainly,

00:16:01.322 --> 00:16:02.242
once you've read--

00:16:02.242 --> 00:16:03.950
MALE SPEAKER: I'm
pretty convinced, yeah.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.880
BEN MILLER: --this book--
you would believe, as I say,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.670
it works straight
out of the box.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.560
The trick is to get to
complex, multicellular life.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.400
Now multicellularity,
cells just getting together

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.440
to make life easier for
themselves, that has, again,

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.260
emerged many, many times
throughout history of life

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:23.760
on Earth.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.035
And you get multicellularity
within a billion,

00:16:28.035 --> 00:16:31.650
a billion and a half years
of the first sign of life

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.510
on Earth.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.300
Complex multicellularity,
where you get organisms

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:41.540
with tissues-- and animals
would be the best example

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:48.230
of that-- that has emerged,
maybe, a handful of times.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.855
MALE SPEAKER: But
still more than once.

00:16:49.855 --> 00:16:52.120
BEN MILLER: There's
three types of algae,

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.590
there's basically fungi,
and then there's us.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:01.862
So out of five
times, only once has

00:17:01.862 --> 00:17:04.819
any one of those branches
produced intelligent life.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:09.640
And the problem with
all of those branches

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.859
is, if you follow
the family tree back,

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.297
you get to one, single event.

00:17:16.297 --> 00:17:17.880
And this is the
really worrying thing.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.010
You follow all complex
multicellular life back,

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:27.599
you get to one event, which
was the creation of one

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.890
eukaryotic cell.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.360
So basically, in the
most brief terms,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.230
there were two types
of single-celled life

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.150
on the Earth, the
bacteria and the archaea.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.380
And then, again,
around something

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.300
like a billion and a
half years ago, there

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:50.830
was this one, single event
where a bacteria attempted--

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.330
or, an archaea attempted
to consume a bacteria.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:58.060
And the two set up a kind
of hostage situation.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.470
And the bacteria then
evolved into what

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.620
we call the mitochondria.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.090
And that's where
we get the energy

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:12.010
supply to fund the huge
information overhead

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.930
of complex intelligent life.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.250
The beautiful thread that
runs through all of this

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.860
is energy and information.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:27.790
So we need that constant source
of energy in the vent to power

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.400
the creation of the
very first proto-life.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.960
And then we need-- and the great
innovation of what biologists

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.470
call eukaryotes, creatures like
ourselves which are made up

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:45.160
of not these simple cells,
but these incredibly complex

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:50.730
eukaryotic cells, the great
innovation there is we have

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.380
basically enslaved
bacteria into our--

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.900
Within each of our cells, there
are these mini power plants

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.270
producing this enormous
amount of energy

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:05.330
so that we can store all that
information in a cell nucleus.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.170
And we can suddenly
start to have

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.912
really, really complex life.

00:19:12.912 --> 00:19:14.870
And as far as we know,
that only happened once.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:15.920
MALE SPEAKER: And that's
the bottleneck, really.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.750
BEN MILLER: That's a bottleneck
that we've got to get through.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.330
MALE SPEAKER: Microbial
life-- quite common.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.246
That's the bottleneck.

00:19:20.246 --> 00:19:21.630
And then once you
get past that--

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.150
BEN MILLER: Shocking bottleneck.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.900
Now there is one
element of hope,

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.200
which is, this did happen,
arguably, one other time, which

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.340
is in plants.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.280
So what happened was the
archaea enslaved a bacterium,

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.790
created a eukaryotic
cell, and basically

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:44.670
created mitochondria, the
powerhouse of eukaryotic cells.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.510
Then, another amazing
thing happened.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.550
The other great innovation,
arguably, in evolution,

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.390
is photosynthesis.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.830
Unlike in the vent, where
metals where the food,

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.950
it's taking light energy
and using that to power

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.540
the stripping of electrons
from water and pushing that.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.900
So it's only light, which
is an incredibly good supply

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.090
of water, which is an
incredibly good supply, both

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.150
used to produce long-chain
carbon molecules.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.740
That's a hugely
important innovation.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.140
And that happened when a
eukaryotic cell enslaved

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.670
what's called a cyanobacteria.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.370
Basically, it was
a type of bacterium

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.370
that had evolved chlorophyll.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:29.830
And that's what created plants.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.670
So there's a chink of
hope there in that that's

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.200
the same process, basically.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.170
That's one cell
enslaving another cell

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.630
to do its dirty business.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:48.280
So we enslaved the mitochondria.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.110
We also enslaved the
plasma into our own plants.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.440
So there's some hope.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.180
You could maybe argue,
well, it happened twice

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.840
in the history of life on Earth.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.122
But you can't get
away from the fact

00:21:00.122 --> 00:21:02.205
that the plant thing
happened after the eukaryote,

00:21:02.205 --> 00:21:04.140
so you've still got the
bottleneck back there.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.247
You've still got the
eukaryotic bottleneck.

00:21:06.247 --> 00:21:08.330
And that's the thing that
keeps me awake at night,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.732
frankly, I think.

00:21:10.732 --> 00:21:15.690
So I just think, this
isn't great, is it?

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.040
We've only got one example
of life to work on,

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.015
but there's still a
lot of information

00:21:22.015 --> 00:21:23.640
there, in the history
of life on Earth.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.300
But we're thinking--
it just ends up

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.160
with me thinking that,
intelligent life-- not common--

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.342
not nonexistent, but not common.

00:21:32.342 --> 00:21:34.800
MALE SPEAKER: So if we assume
that intelligence life is out

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.380
there-- let's skip to the
other end of the book--

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.290
you talk about messaging--

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:37.800
BEN MILLER: Yeah, messaging.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.480
MALE SPEAKER: --so, if we
were to receive a message,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.563
what that might look like.

00:21:40.563 --> 00:21:42.850
And you used the example
of hieroglyphs as something

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.470
that, we had a message, we
saw the information there,

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.805
but we couldn't
understand how to read it.

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:48.388
BEN MILLER: This is
a fantastic story.

00:21:48.388 --> 00:21:51.670
This is a fabulous story,
particularly, I imagine,

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.970
if your brain enjoys
coding and decoding.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.790
I mean, this is
just a great story.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.960
So it's the closest thing--
I was trying to think,

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.750
what is the closest that
we've ever got, as a species,

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.620
to decoding the messages
of another species.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.240
And the best example
I could think of

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.760
was, in the 19th century,
when they were attempting

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.380
to-- when Egypt was
suddenly opened up again,

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.300
to the Western world,
through Napoleon's attempt

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:28.062
to colonize it, and suddenly,
we had this flood of-- I mean,

00:22:28.062 --> 00:22:30.520
there had been a few Egyptian
monuments, obviously, in Rome

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.811
that the Romans had collected
and brought back to Rome.

00:22:32.811 --> 00:22:37.020
But really, they were mainly
what they call cartouches,

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.867
basically, the throne
names of the kings.

00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:40.700
Those happened to be
the monuments they had.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.600
They didn't have a
great deal of text.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:48.910
And when Napoleon attempted
to colonize Egypt,

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:54.620
he took with him a shipload
of the French intelligentsia.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.120
This is just such
a brilliant story.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.190
They're called the savants.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:04.460
And among them were Fourier,
the French mathematician,

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.804
there were some extraordinary
French biologists.

00:23:06.804 --> 00:23:07.470
They collected--

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.900
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
Fourier, as in tran--

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.870
BEN MILLER: Yeah,
as in transforms.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.369
Yeah.

00:23:10.369 --> 00:23:11.290
Yeah.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:17.080
And they collected an
enormous amount of text.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.500
Suddenly, they discovered,
wow, it's not just these throne

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.650
names on the monument.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.640
There is a language here.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.710
And they just couldn't crack it.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:32.500
I mean, it took-- it's an
extraordinary story of how they

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.810
eventually managed to-- a
French character, Champollion,

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:41.210
finally managed to--
crack the hieroglyphs.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.050
You know Young's slits?

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.246
You remember Young, the--

00:23:46.246 --> 00:23:47.370
MALE SPEAKER: Thomas Young.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:51.630
BEN MILLER: Thomas Young,
the British-- well,

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:58.900
among many things-- physicist,
he got part of the way there,

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.860
because he managed to guess-- he
had-- actually, ironically, it

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.731
was the throne names that
enabled them to crack the code.

00:24:05.731 --> 00:24:08.230
MALE SPEAKER: Did they have the
Rosetta stone at that point?

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.310
BEN MILLER: Yeah, well,
the Rosetta stone--

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.120
it was the discovery
that-- yes, absolutely.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.970
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe
explain what that

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.630
is in case people don't know.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.730
BEN MILLER: So basically,
it's all over there

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:17.885
for the French in Egypt.

00:24:17.885 --> 00:24:19.260
They're kind of
on their way out.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.040
They're trying to
build a fort at what

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.800
used to be called
Rosetta on the Nile.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.980
And one of the soldiers
discovers-- basically,

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.230
it's just a part of the wall.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.010
It's just one of the bricks.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.551
They're taking down
this ancient wall

00:24:35.551 --> 00:24:37.994
to rebuild it-- is a stone.

00:24:37.994 --> 00:24:40.160
And then, there are three
inscriptions on the stone.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.640
One, they recognize
straight away

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.330
as the Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.290
And there are two
other types of--

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:50.840
MALE SPEAKER: Greek and Coptic?

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.673
BEN MILLER: --Greek.

00:24:51.673 --> 00:24:54.930
Yeah, there's Coptic, and then
there's another type of Greek.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.960
I believe it was Demotic.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.550
So they've got one kind of
Greek that they recognize,

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.550
another kind of Greek
that they don't recognize,

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.478
and the hieroglyphs.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.120
And one of the savants
made the guess,

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.030
this could be the same bit of
text written in these three

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:12.530
languages.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.040
MALE SPEAKER: And it's
really boring text, isn't it?

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.170
BEN MILLER: It's so dull.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.720
Yeah, it's really dull.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.420
It's basically a
kind of a eulogy.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.870
It's saying how
they should honor

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:30.000
one of the kings of Egypt,
and it's really, really dull.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.300
I mean, it's really, really,
extraordinarily detailed--

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.920
you know, this offering
must be made on this day.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.270
And it's sort of like
bureaucracy, really,

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.560
in the extreme.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.080
But this text was, of
course, what enabled

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.130
them to crack the hieroglyphs.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.280
And that's exactly
what we don't have when

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.716
we receive our alien message.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.780
We have no idea of knowing
what is in the message.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:58.850
We can make guesses.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.609
We can hope that the
mathematics is universal.

00:26:01.609 --> 00:26:03.900
And they might send us prime
numbers to start off with.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.130
And maybe they'll send us
a few fundamental constants

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.300
of nature, things that are
independent of whatever

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.790
measuring system
you use, things like

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.897
the ratio of the charge
on an election to--

00:26:15.897 --> 00:26:16.730
MALE SPEAKER: Or Pi.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:17.479
BEN MILLER: Or Pi.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.600
We can hope that we know
what's in the messages.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.749
But if we couldn't crank
the ancient-- you know,

00:26:27.749 --> 00:26:29.540
if we find it so hard
to crack the messages

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.290
of the ancient Egyptians,
it's really hard

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:37.000
to see what hope there would be
apart from through information

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.500
theory.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.958
So this is the wonderful thing,
coming back to the science.

00:26:39.958 --> 00:26:47.150
This guy, Zipf, spotted--
this was news to me.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:50.520
It might not be news
to many people here.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:57.930
But this brilliant
discovery by this American,

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.140
George Kingsley
Zipf-- so he noticed

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.070
that if there's anything
that involves humans,

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:08.010
you can see a certain
kind of pattern.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.300
So say, for example,
if you look at--

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.640
and things obey a sort
of logarithmic scale.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.610
So say, for example, the
richest man in Britain

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.870
will be 10 times richer than
the 10th richest man, who

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.690
will be 100 times richer
than the 100th richest man.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:31.010
And you see this pattern not
only throughout the whole

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.870
of human civilization, but you
also see it in human language

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:35.690
as well.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:39.410
So if you take any text-- I
mean absolutely any text--

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.230
and you start plotting the
frequency of occurrence

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.990
of words against
their rank, you get

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.450
a straight logarithmic plot.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:53.990
So in other words, there are
features of human interaction

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:58.047
and human language that are
independent of the messaging

00:27:58.047 --> 00:27:58.880
system that you use.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.770
MALE SPEAKER: It works
in all languages,

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:01.440
and it seems to be
inbuilt to nature.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.690
BEN MILLER: Inbuilt to nature.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.900
And they did it with dolphins.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:10.300
And they also found that dolphin
whistles obey this Zipf plot--

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.680
not baby dolphins,
because they babble,

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.860
not adolescent dolphins,
because they just slag off

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.490
their parents the whole time.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:22.700
But adult dolphins, you get this
beautiful, straight Zipf plot

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.220
if you plot their most
frequently used whistles

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.920
against the rank
of that frequency.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.720
It's absolutely amazing.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.800
And this comes back to
the work of Claude Shannon

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:39.880
and the fantastic work he
did in information theory

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.910
in showing that the
potential information

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:46.050
content of a message--
you can figure out

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.837
what the potential information
content is without knowing

00:28:48.837 --> 00:28:49.670
what the message is.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:53.350
And this is our best
hope, basically,

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:55.610
when we receive any messages.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:56.640
So what does it mean?

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.927
It means when we're
messaging to aliens,

00:28:58.927 --> 00:29:00.676
you guys are going to
be really important,

00:29:00.676 --> 00:29:04.040
because we're going to have
to send the whole internet.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.980
We'll send the
whole thing, photos

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:15.474
included, for several reasons.

00:29:15.474 --> 00:29:17.640
I think it's important, in
this exercise, that we're

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.880
honest about who we
are, that we think

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:25.680
about our responsibilities
as a species,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.390
that we take our global
organizations seriously,

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:36.700
that we consider
what we have to say

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.350
to other intelligent
alien species

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.440
out there, what
we have to offer,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.020
what we're hoping to receive.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.760
And we just send
them everything,

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.540
because the chances of them
being able to decode it

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.620
are minimal unless they have
a vast, vast amount of data,

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.490
and vice versa.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.950
We don't want to just get
a picture of a stick man--

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.600
you know, the stuff that
we've been sending out.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.395
MALE SPEAKER: On Voyager 1, it's
just a stick man and some DNA.

00:30:01.395 --> 00:30:03.520
BEN MILLER: Yeah, on Voyager
1, a little stick man,

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.520
a naked woman, and a
walking stick or whatever.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.940
We just send a lot.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.899
We just send the
internet, the whole thing.

00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:11.940
MALE SPEAKER: Let's see
if there's any questions.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.000
So the book covers
quite a wide range.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.794
Yeah.

00:30:14.794 --> 00:30:17.698
AUDIENCE: So all the
things that keep you up

00:30:17.698 --> 00:30:19.150
at night, [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.030
If humanity survives, we'll
eventually fill the galaxy.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.040
Our descendants, or the
nearest equivalents,

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.530
will fill the galaxy
and the galaxies nearby.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.760
And no alien species
has done that yet.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.980
So we're not seeing them.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.900
Something is between
them and doing that.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.340
And either that something is
behind us or it is ahead of us.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.610
If the problem is that
complex multicellular

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.870
life, eukaryotic
cells and stuff,

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:55.260
are very, very
rare in the galaxy,

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.520
that means it's behind us.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.150
That means that we can
rest easy that we're

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.800
going to make to the
rest of the galaxy.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.370
If it's ahead of us, we
should be very pessimistic.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.880
And I worry about that.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.432
So every time I hear
something that says,

00:31:08.432 --> 00:31:10.890
this is why alien life is rare,
it's because of some filter

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:14.579
that we've gone through,
then I feel better.

00:31:14.579 --> 00:31:15.620
BEN MILLER: Yeah, me too.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.059
And of course, there's another
possibility, isn't there,

00:31:18.059 --> 00:31:20.350
which is, it's there, but
it's simply not visible to us

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.670
because we just simply aren't
looking for the right thing.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.890
And if we think how transient
our technologies are--

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:35.120
we send our first signals-- our
first narrowband signals were

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.530
radio waves that were just
blasted out everywhere

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:38.180
into space.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.690
We then went almost
radio silent as we

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.510
started to-- our
own communications

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:51.640
became via satellites and cable.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.610
We're now starting to use--
laser communication is probably

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.780
a much more energy
efficient and reliable

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:03.580
way to set up some kind
of interstellar network.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.010
So that's probably the
way we're going next.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.010
How long will that last?

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:11.270
Maybe that lasts 10, 20
years before we're modulating

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.760
neutron beams or something.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.273
Who knows?

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.930
I take some comfort from that.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:27.700
I think, well, we are
passing our-- so transient,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.540
these technologies
and what we use.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.020
Already, the
classical information

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.270
that we've got on
the internet, there's

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.330
going to be a new
phase where we surely

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:42.360
will move into some other kind
of more quantum-based-- we'll

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.970
move into some other kind of
way of moving of computing

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.220
if not of storing information.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:54.760
So maybe they're there,
it's just like they've just

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.090
kicked over an ant hill.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.537
And we mean nothing to them,
and they mean nothing to us.

00:32:59.537 --> 00:33:00.536
Do you know what I mean?

00:33:00.536 --> 00:33:01.860
MALE SPEAKER: In fact, you used
the example, at the beginning,

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.060
where if a species out that
discovers Voyager 1 floating

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.810
through the galaxy, if they're
superintelligent bacteria,

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:08.740
it's a snack.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.156
But if they're
huge and ginormous,

00:33:11.156 --> 00:33:12.780
they'll miss it,
because it's so small.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:16.540
So we assume people
are like us-- people.

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.660
BEN MILLER: Yeah, we make--
and with some justification.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.970
Because any life that's
on a terrestrial planet,

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.870
we can reasonably assume
that the same tropes

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:28.350
of intelligence,
sociability, languagee--

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.190
we can reasonably assume that
those will crop up again.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.090
They won't necessarily
look anything like us.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.923
Their biology might be
completely different.

00:33:34.923 --> 00:33:38.280
They might be more closely
related to octopuses

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.735
than they are to shrews.

00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:44.635
MALE SPEAKER: But they are
likely to have limbs, weapons,

00:33:44.635 --> 00:33:46.770
eyes, features that we
see over and over again.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:46.810
BEN MILLER: Exactly.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.935
Yeah, and they'll have had
a similar journey to us.

00:33:48.935 --> 00:33:51.080
But then, there's all
kinds of other things

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.410
that could possibly
be out there.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.290
It's a fascinating
problem to grapple with,

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.510
because the only way you
can look for anything else

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.970
is by assuming it's like you.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.810
Do you know what I mean?

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.915
But you're automatically,
then, just completely reducing

00:34:12.915 --> 00:34:14.540
your opportunities
of finding anything.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.710
So there's a real dilemma
right at the heart of it.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.710
MALE SPEAKER: Questions.

00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:24.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.120
Have you thought a little bit
about whether it's wise for us

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.620
to be sending out signals?

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.150
What do you think
the expected value

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.830
is that our first
encounter will be positive

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.019
for humanity as opposed
to possibly catastrophic?

00:34:36.019 --> 00:34:38.310
MALE SPEAKER: Because Stephen
Hawking is very negative,

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.110
isn't he?

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:46.030
BEN MILLER: Yeah, I'm not
so-- don't get me wrong,

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:49.739
some days, I think, oh
god, what are we doing.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:53.000
But then I think, well, we have
been broadcasting-- it's a bit

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.750
late now.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:35:00.010
We've been broadcasting for
about 100 years, haven't we?

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.700
Was it the 1930s?

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.840
I suppose, a good 70, 80
years, we've been going.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.800
So we're already 70 light-years
out in terms of stuff

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.440
that knows we're here.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:21.587
So how is this going to pan out?

00:35:21.587 --> 00:35:24.170
I certainly would expect that,
within 70 light-years of Earth,

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:29.060
there would be other
microbial life.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.240
Do any of us necessarily
think that there

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.940
would be intelligent life?

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.400
That seems unlikely.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.476
Intelligent life at some time
within the last 14.7 billion

00:35:41.476 --> 00:35:41.975
years?

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.780
Interestingly, there's
a kind of cutoff.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.710
As we look back in the galaxy,
we look further back in time,

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.630
it seems less likely that
life could have survived.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.810
You go back more than about 5
billion years and galaxies are

00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:04.760
so active, so
energetic-- there's

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.410
so much really hard
electromagnetic radiation

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.280
around-- it's hard to
see how life could exist.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.522
So you're looking at
a window of about--

00:36:13.522 --> 00:36:14.730
this is an interesting thing.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.230
We're looking at a light
sphere of about 5 billion years

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.530
around us where there
could conceivably

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:24.410
be intelligent life.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:28.830
And interestingly, our planet
is around about that age.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.670
I find that interesting too.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.380
There couldn't really
be life much older

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.864
than about 5 billion years.

00:36:35.864 --> 00:36:37.280
Still, you've got
to figure, there

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.860
could be life out there with a
half-billion-year start on us

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.480
as of right now.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.370
And of course,
communication, once you

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.940
start to get out further and
further into the universe,

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.740
it's that travel time.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.730
So I just think it's
so far away that it

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.920
will be a great experience.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.350
If we pick something up,
we'll know it's a signal.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:37:00.790
We won't necessarily know,
for a long time, what's in it.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:05.590
There's no way, unless
Stephen Hawking's right,

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.370
and they can wormhole here
and hoover up all our water

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:12.870
and then bugger
off somewhere else.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.750
I mean, maybe.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:15.370
Maybe.

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:17.080
But it seems to me
that they're not here

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.690
because it's a really,
really big place

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:22.030
and there's a
fundamental timing issue.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.500
Civilizations,
maybe, don't last.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.590
And certainly, technologies,
if not civilizations,

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.770
don't last long enough
for civilizations

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:35.540
to be visible to one another
at exactly the right moment.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.760
Anyway.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.670
MALE SPEAKER: Yes, sir.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.740
Use the mic.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.890
AUDIENCE: You talked a
lot about biological life.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:47.080
And one of the
conclusions that I come to

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:53.640
is, if I wanted to travel
to another solar system,

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.190
for example, I wouldn't
send a biological being.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:01.190
I would send an artificial
intelligence, or something,

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.130
robot, because all the
scales fit so much better.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.250
And biology's quite messy.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:10.500
And we're not really adapted
for the space travel.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.350
Do you think if we
stopped talking about,

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.400
well, creatures with
arms and legs and eyes

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.005
and the idea of,
well, any sufficiently

00:38:20.005 --> 00:38:22.400
advanced civilization out
there would have actually gone

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.130
through the biological phase
and their progeny would actually

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:28.110
be the machines they made-- they
may still exist in some form.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.710
But do you think
we're actually looking

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:34.204
in the wrong places for
those kind of things as well?

00:38:34.204 --> 00:38:36.120
I guess that's sort of
an open-ended question.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.786
BEN MILLER: I completely
agree with you.

00:38:37.786 --> 00:38:42.110
Yeah, I think that it would
be-- we wouldn't expect--

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:48.840
I mean, certainly, if alien
technology ever makes it here,

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.830
like you, I can't see how it
would possibly be biological.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:58.360
And we can see, from the way
that we're-- we don't even send

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.900
people out into space anymore.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.004
We send robots.

00:39:02.004 --> 00:39:04.295
MALE SPEAKER: The head of
SETI thinks that-- because we

00:39:04.295 --> 00:39:05.336
were watching that video.

00:39:05.336 --> 00:39:06.330
I forgot his name.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.079
BEN MILLER: Martin
Rees is very, very good

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:11.750
on this-- the Astronomer Royal,
Martin Reiss-- very, very

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.940
good on the robots thing.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.420
That makes so much
sense, doesn't it?

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.625
Again, this is one of the
things about the book.

00:39:22.625 --> 00:39:24.250
We're constantly
looking for ourselves.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.920
There's some deep, primal
need, isn't there, out there

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.970
to find ourselves,
our own image.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.350
But if we're really
seriously going

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.430
to look for alien
artifacts, then yeah,

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:40.190
I think we are genuinely
looking in the wrong place.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:43.260
I saw a brilliant
article by Paul Davies

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.720
saying we should
check the Lagrange

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.844
points around the Earth.

00:39:46.844 --> 00:39:47.760
We should have a look.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.485
Is there anything there?

00:39:50.485 --> 00:39:52.610
We're sending stuff out.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.880
We're making use of
those Lagrange points,

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.142
aren't they, with some
of our future spaceships.

00:39:57.142 --> 00:39:58.350
We should go and have a look.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.760
Is there anything there?

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.540
MALE SPEAKER: Or the
center of the galaxy,

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.650
with a supermassive black hole
that's just emanating energy.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.142
So that could be
a place as well.

00:40:06.142 --> 00:40:06.850
BEN MILLER: Yeah.

00:40:09.566 --> 00:40:11.690
There was a really great
Russian physicist as well,

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:15.870
Kardashev, who talks
about-- one of the things

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:23.570
that alien technology presumably
couldn't conceal would be heat.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.850
Because no matter how
advanced your technology,

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.855
you've still got to
comply with the second law

00:40:27.855 --> 00:40:28.605
of thermodynamics.

00:40:31.306 --> 00:40:32.900
You still have to give off heat.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.000
You still have to
degrade energy.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.291
You still have to have an
energy source and degrade it.

00:40:36.291 --> 00:40:39.560
So he had these scales
of civilizations.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.280
He said a Type I
civilization was

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.010
one that harnessed the energy
of its home planet, a Type

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.970
II, its home star, a Type
III, its home galaxy.

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:50.055
And this is another
thing we should doing.

00:40:50.055 --> 00:40:50.930
We should be looking.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.930
We should be looking
for objects like that,

00:40:53.930 --> 00:41:01.120
really large objects that are
dark apart from giving off

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.164
a lot of heat.

00:41:04.164 --> 00:41:05.930
Those are other
surveys, sky surveys,

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.400
that we should be doing.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.820
MALE SPEAKER: Is that where
a species surrounds a star?

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.310
BEN MILLER: Yeah.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.499
Freeman Dyson-- it
was hand-in-hand

00:41:16.499 --> 00:41:17.790
with the work of Freeman Dyson.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.710
And Dyson came up this
idea of this thing

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:24.470
called the Dyson sphere, which
is basically exactly that.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:26.840
You basically
surround-- the idea

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:32.150
is that the home civilization
uses up every ounce of sunlight

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.270
coming from its home star.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.430
And eventually, the
star becomes dark,

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:39.700
because it's just completely
surrounded with technology.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:44.790
So, hard to tell that
apart from a dead star,

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.520
which is also going to give off
a lot of heat and be very dark.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:53.380
But what about galactic-sized
objects giving off--

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.750
objects the size of galaxies
giving off-- a lot of heat.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.090
That would be a good
place to start looking.

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:03.685
MALE SPEAKER: We have time
for a couple more questions.

00:42:03.685 --> 00:42:04.185
Yes.

00:42:04.185 --> 00:42:05.559
Do you want to
just shout loudly?

00:42:05.559 --> 00:42:06.682
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:06.682 --> 00:42:09.734
You mentioned Zipf's law and
what language looks like.

00:42:09.734 --> 00:42:11.622
But as we get better
at communicating,

00:42:11.622 --> 00:42:13.216
we get closer to
the Shannon limit

00:42:13.216 --> 00:42:14.840
of actually making
it indistinguishable

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.000
from random noise.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.446
Do you think that
means that we are

00:42:18.446 --> 00:42:21.280
going to have to have other
civilizations deliberately

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.738
trying to communicate
with us to be

00:42:22.738 --> 00:42:24.540
able to pick up the Zipf thing?

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.957
BEN MILLER: You're
exactly right.

00:42:25.957 --> 00:42:26.790
This is the problem.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.331
As our technology
gets more advanced,

00:42:28.331 --> 00:42:33.740
it gets harder and harder to
tell a really good signal apart

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.250
from noise.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:39.030
I suppose we've
got to hope-- yeah,

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.910
we just hope that they know
that and that they're there.

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:48.940
They're not-- they use some
rubbish coding or something,

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:49.940
just to give us a break.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.320
But you're absolutely right.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.670
Do you know what would do?

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:56.575
It would just be a
simple lighthouse beam,

00:42:56.575 --> 00:42:57.950
or something like
that, would do.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:58.880
Do you know I mean?

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:04.070
Just like an on and off, that's
probably the easiest thing.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:06.010
That's what I hope.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.627
I think, first,
you need-- what I

00:43:07.627 --> 00:43:10.210
would do if I were sending out
a signal is just, first of all,

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:11.530
let's just have a beacon.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:13.790
Let's just have it say,
there's something here,

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.580
so something that just may be
blips in prime numbers or just

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.117
uses some kind
of-- because you've

00:43:19.117 --> 00:43:21.700
got to be able to tell it apart
from pulsars, which are simple

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.810
on and off.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:25.730
So just a regular
lighthouse system won't do.

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:28.080
But let's do
something with number

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.330
and just send out some
kind of beacon signal.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:32.250
And then, if
something contacts us,

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:37.320
then let's worry about opening
a communication channel.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.980
I can't think that, really,
sending messages out is the-- I

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:42.980
just think if you just--

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.755
MALE SPEAKER:
Because wouldn't we

00:43:43.755 --> 00:43:46.255
want-- we would just want to
know someone else is out there.

00:43:46.255 --> 00:43:47.990
So if we found that,
that would be-- it

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.450
would answer our question.

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:49.150
BEN MILLER: That would
be great, wouldn't it?

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:50.510
That would be all
we'd need to know.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:52.226
Also, it's extremely
energy efficient.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.540
Yeah, come to think
of it, let's do that.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.980
We cracked it.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.662
MALE SPEAKER: The
gentleman in the far left.

00:44:03.662 --> 00:44:04.558
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:04.558 --> 00:44:06.363
Thanks for the very
interesting talk.

00:44:06.363 --> 00:44:08.618
I don't have a background
in this matter,

00:44:08.618 --> 00:44:11.704
but I just looked up
[INAUDIBLE] outside light--

00:44:11.704 --> 00:44:12.954
BEN MILLER: We have to sample.

00:44:12.954 --> 00:44:14.954
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] or
civilization will never

00:44:14.954 --> 00:44:15.920
be able to [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:18.994 --> 00:44:20.660
BEN MILLER: We'd have
to sample, surely,

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.710
hundreds of millions of
solar systems like our own

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:28.190
before we'd sampled
anything near enough

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:30.580
to hope to encounter a signal.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:34.660
The great news is the whole
process is speeding up so much,

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.030
that will happen
in our lifetimes.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.530
Everyone here, in this room,
will get to that point.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.890
We will know, pretty
much, whether there's

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.840
intelligent life on the
next, say, 10 million,

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.170
100 million stars
within our lifetime,

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:50.400
thanks to Moore's law.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.910
MALE SPEAKER: The head
of SETI thinks it's 2037,

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:53.730
thinks that we'll
have sampled enough.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:53.930
BEN MILLER: We'll get there.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:54.650
We will know.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:56.691
We'll have a pretty good
answer to that question.

00:44:56.691 --> 00:44:58.420
But you're absolutely
right, it's

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.750
impossible to draw any
conclusion, at the moment,

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:05.529
from that tiny, tiny,
tiny volume of spacetime

00:45:05.529 --> 00:45:06.320
that we've sampled.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.220
I completely agree.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:07.870
MALE SPEAKER: Was it your book?

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:09.245
Or somewhere, I
was reading, SETI

00:45:09.245 --> 00:45:11.320
would use the example
of-- the amount

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.370
that SETI, the Search for
Extraterrestrial Life,

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:16.204
have sampled is a glass of water
if the universe is the ocean.

00:45:16.204 --> 00:45:16.870
BEN MILLER: Wow.

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:18.125
MALE SPEAKER: Of that sort
of order of magnitude.

00:45:18.125 --> 00:45:19.630
BEN MILLER: Perfect.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:22.520
We do know that we're
not in a-- we're

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.600
kind of in a conservation
area, at least.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.920
It's not that busy.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.990
We're not in the middle
of town, we know that.

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:35.180
But you've got to
figure, there's

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:42.500
a lot of-- yeah, in
100 billion stars where

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:46.180
there may be something like
11 billion Earth-like planets,

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.950
yeah.

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.164
MALE SPEAKER: Question here.

00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:50.400
AUDIENCE: Quick question--
to maybe change the subject

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.983
slightly, I imaging
this kind of topic

00:45:51.983 --> 00:45:54.043
must attract a lot of
interesting comments

00:45:54.043 --> 00:45:54.951
and emails.

00:45:54.951 --> 00:45:56.617
BEN MILLER: Yeah,
it's absolutely great.

00:45:56.617 --> 00:45:58.110
AUDIENCE: Can you share, maybe,
a couple interesting ones?

00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:59.400
MALE SPEAKER: Have you
had the UFO types coming?

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.540
BEN MILLER: Yeah, I
get the UFO-- sadly,

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.820
unfortunately,
it's of two types--

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.900
one, people who think
they've seen a UFO, secondly,

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.677
people who think they've
invented a time machine.

00:46:11.677 --> 00:46:13.260
MALE SPEAKER: We
have one [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:16.326 --> 00:46:19.780
BEN MILLER: I'll be
arriving in a minute.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.740
Yeah, I don't know
what to do with that.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.698
I mean, I just don't know
what to do with that.

00:46:23.698 --> 00:46:28.730
Because time machines,
doesn't that effect--

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:32.270
isn't cause and effect
quite important in life?

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:35.030
I have a problem with that.

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:37.030
And as to these
UFOs, I had a lot

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:40.040
of fun researching
UFOs in the book.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.440
That's a whole other
story to get into,

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.960
but it's really great.

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:48.880
If I could just give you
one fact that I learned,

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.260
the guy who saw the first
flying saucer in 1947

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.170
didn't see a flying saucer.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:57.770
He saw something that
was the shape of-- he

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:01.980
saw something that was like a--
he said it was like a pie tin

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:02.860
lid cut in half.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.450
It was a sort of
semicircle that he

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:07.600
saw, a kind of crescent shape.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.350
Right?

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:11.680
But it was misreported in the
press, described as a flying

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.200
saucer, and then,
afterwards, there

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.220
were many, many flying
saucers such as that.

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:19.180
A better example of the
psychology of priming,

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.390
I don't think you can find.

00:47:24.275 --> 00:47:25.400
MALE SPEAKER: I love that--

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.360
BEN MILLER: But then,
there's no reason

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.340
that they shouldn't be here.

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:28.030
That's the point.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:29.113
That's the point isn't it?

00:47:29.113 --> 00:47:31.790
There's no reason
that they-- there's

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:33.810
an important question as well.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.770
You can't dismiss that
on scientific grounds.

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.580
You can dismiss it
on nutter grounds,

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:40.539
but you can't dismiss it
on scientific grounds.

00:47:40.539 --> 00:47:42.704
MALE SPEAKER: When people
used to report that they'd

00:47:42.704 --> 00:47:44.556
been met by aliens,
the aliens always used

00:47:44.556 --> 00:47:45.630
to be inside our solar system.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:47.140
They used to be
Venusians or Martians.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.348
And as our knowledge of the
solar system got greater,

00:47:49.348 --> 00:47:51.980
these aliens happened to come
from further and further away.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.790
So now, they come from other
galaxies and outside, away.

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:58.890
One final question
and we will wrap up.

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:00.000
Yes.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:00.620
Oh, no.

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.150
Yes.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:03.997
Whoever Ben looks at.

00:48:03.997 --> 00:48:06.810
AUDIENCE: I just [INAUDIBLE]
that 100 due to the fact

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:10.184
that we have been propagating
a signal for 100 years.

00:48:10.184 --> 00:48:12.112
I think one of the
things about that

00:48:12.112 --> 00:48:17.172
is that [INAUDIBLE] the total
amount of energy that we

00:48:17.172 --> 00:48:18.380
transmit is relatively small.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.880
There is tremendous
attenuation at that distance,

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.380
so it's like 1 by r squared.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.568
At some point, the
strength of the signal

00:48:25.568 --> 00:48:29.350
is actually lower than the
cosmic background radiation.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:33.100
So I think that to be able
to produce a signal which

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.789
would be-- either you have
to have a directional signal,

00:48:35.789 --> 00:48:38.122
in which case you, again,
have the same problem of which

00:48:38.122 --> 00:48:40.910
direction you aim at or you
have to have a signal which

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:42.714
is so powerful
that you can still

00:48:42.714 --> 00:48:45.174
see it at any appreciable
cosmic distances.

00:48:45.174 --> 00:48:48.126
So given the power
source problem,

00:48:48.126 --> 00:48:51.570
I think that one thing could be
that maybe people who signal,

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:54.030
like, other aliens who
signal, they can only--

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:55.998
you cannot muster a
power source big enough.

00:48:55.998 --> 00:48:58.010
Like, we cannot
manipulate the Sun yet.

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:00.217
We could use that to
signal far enough.

00:49:00.217 --> 00:49:02.216
So it could be that people
just signal, but only

00:49:02.216 --> 00:49:05.930
to their neighborhood,
and that we don't see it.

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:07.971
BEN MILLER: Yes, that's
absolutely right.

00:49:07.971 --> 00:49:08.970
That's absolutely right.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:13.280
And I think one of the
hopes, really, of the next--

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.110
we don't know where to point our
telescopes to pick up a signal.

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:18.520
We don't know where to
point them to send one.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.780
And of the things that--
you're absolutely right,

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.295
to get bang for your buck,
you've got to know where it is.

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:27.420
You've got to know where
you're sending the signal.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.960
Otherwise, you're just going
to waste an enormous amount

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:35.030
of energy sending off
this billowing wave

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:36.750
of electromagnetic
radiation and just

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.080
hoping it's going somewhere.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.070
And as you say, the
strength of that

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:41.850
is just dropping
off exponentially

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:42.960
away from the Earth.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:49.610
BEN MILLER: Yeah, not detectable
far enough away to be picked up

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:50.470
by intelligent life.

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:51.520
So one of exciting things--

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.980
MALE SPEAKER: Leave
us on a positive note.

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.980
BEN MILLER: I will leave
you on a positive note.

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.880
We have this great new
telescope, the James Webb.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.420
It's an infrared telescope.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.570
We know, from the
Kepler Space Telescope,

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:04.590
that Earth-like
planets are common.

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:08.810
So now, what we
do is we find-- we

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:11.400
need to find the
Earth-like planets

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.255
in the vicinity of the Earth.

00:50:13.255 --> 00:50:14.630
And the first
thing we need to do

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:19.390
is image their atmospheres,
use spectroscopy to figure out,

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:23.400
are the gases in their
atmospheres in chemical

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.130
balance or not.

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:26.470
Because if there's
disequilibrium there,

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:27.940
we can be fairly
sure that there's

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:31.270
some kind of life form
powering that disequilibrium.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:34.050
And then, we know where
to point our telescopes.

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.530
The chances of there being
intelligent life, as we all

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:39.869
know, thanks to the eukaryotic
bottleneck-- really,

00:50:39.869 --> 00:50:40.410
really small.

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.690
But it will be a
sensible place to start.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.910
And we can at least find life.

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:47.370
And I'm thinking--
I'm really hoping--

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:50.589
within the next decade,
we'll have the first results.

00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:52.130
Nothing will be
conclusive, but we'll

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.210
have the first
results saying, look,

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:56.300
we looked at this
Earth-like planet

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.920
in this neighboring
solar system.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.070
And look, there's oxygen
in its atmosphere.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:04.560
And it's out of chemical
balance with the other gases.

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.265
So we know there's
something there.

00:51:06.265 --> 00:51:06.860
Do you know what I mean?

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.026
AUDIENCE: Then we nuke them.

00:51:08.026 --> 00:51:09.420
BEN MILLER: Yeah. [LAUGHING]

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.586
MALE SPEAKER: Please join
me in thanking Ben Miller.

00:51:11.586 --> 00:51:14.285
[APPLAUSE]
