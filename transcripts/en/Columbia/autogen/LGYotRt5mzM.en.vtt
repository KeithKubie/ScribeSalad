outside the ground was wet slipped tried
 

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.460
outside the ground was wet slipped tried
to stop slip hit the back of my head and

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:11.470
to stop slip hit the back of my head and
 

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.410
to stop slip hit the back of my head and
again same thing happened 20 minutes

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:13.420
again same thing happened 20 minutes
 

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.780
again same thing happened 20 minutes
later tunnel vision waited another 20

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:15.790
later tunnel vision waited another 20
 

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.390
later tunnel vision waited another 20
minutes it came back but both of these

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:18.400
minutes it came back but both of these
 

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.580
minutes it came back but both of these
were fairly serious head injuries that

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:20.590
were fairly serious head injuries that
 

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.670
were fairly serious head injuries that
you know at the at that time the

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680
you know at the at that time the
 

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.890
you know at the at that time the
attitude was just you know shake it off

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:25.900
attitude was just you know shake it off
 

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.540
attitude was just you know shake it off
it's not a big deal that you know

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:27.550
it's not a big deal that you know
 

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.830
it's not a big deal that you know
there's no blood so you didn't really

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:28.840
there's no blood so you didn't really
 

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.530

get hurt you know you can't see anything

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:31.540
get hurt you know you can't see anything
 

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.690
get hurt you know you can't see anything
so and you know that's not what anybody

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:33.700
so and you know that's not what anybody
 

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.130
so and you know that's not what anybody
told me that was just you know the

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.140
told me that was just you know the
 

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.830
told me that was just you know the
mindset at the time even today it's it's

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:37.840
mindset at the time even today it's it's
 

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.940
mindset at the time even today it's it's
pretty similar

this is one of the astonishing facts
about traumatic brain injury is that it

00:14:19.579 --> 00:14:19.589
about traumatic brain injury is that it
 

00:14:19.589 --> 00:14:21.920
about traumatic brain injury is that it
really strikes people in the prime years

acceleration and forces that are applied
 

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.540
acceleration and forces that are applied
to it and so there's deformations well

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:22.550
to it and so there's deformations well
 

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.490

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640
jello and much softer jello than the
 

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.750
jello and much softer jello than the
jello you eat so gelatin 0.5 percent by

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760
jello you eat so gelatin 0.5 percent by
 

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.820
jello you eat so gelatin 0.5 percent by
weight the jello you eat is about 10

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:45.830
weight the jello you eat is about 10
 

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.850
weight the jello you eat is about 10
times stiffer and we've just poured it

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:48.860
times stiffer and we've just poured it
 

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.700
times stiffer and we've just poured it
in here we let it set and we

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:50.710
in here we let it set and we
 

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.910
in here we let it set and we
we painted a grid on it and we want to

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:53.920
we painted a grid on it and we want to
 

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.520
we painted a grid on it and we want to
take that so this is our skull the bowl

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:56.530
take that so this is our skull the bowl
 

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.280
take that so this is our skull the bowl
is our skull and the jello on the inside

00:21:59.280 --> 00:21:59.290
is our skull and the jello on the inside
 

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.590
is our skull and the jello on the inside
is our brain and if we take that bowl

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600
is our brain and if we take that bowl
 

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.530
is our brain and if we take that bowl
and we move it linearly just slide it

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:04.540
and we move it linearly just slide it
 

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.740
and we move it linearly just slide it
straight on the countertop the the brain

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:07.750
straight on the countertop the the brain
 

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.910
straight on the countertop the the brain
on the inside is actually not going to

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:08.920
on the inside is actually not going to
 

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.530
on the inside is actually not going to
deform that much and that's true for

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:10.540
deform that much and that's true for
 

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.140
deform that much and that's true for
your own brain the brain is because of

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.150
your own brain the brain is because of
 

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.210
your own brain the brain is because of
the high content of water is basically

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:15.220
the high content of water is basically
 

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.000
the high content of water is basically
incompressible and unless we get the

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.010
incompressible and unless we get the
 

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.310
incompressible and unless we get the
outer rigid case our skull to change

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320
outer rigid case our skull to change
 

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.290
outer rigid case our skull to change
shape then the brain on the inside is

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:22.300
shape then the brain on the inside is
 

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.390
shape then the brain on the inside is
not going to deform from linear

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400
not going to deform from linear
 

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.400
not going to deform from linear
accelerations if on the other hand

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:26.410
accelerations if on the other hand
 

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.860
accelerations if on the other hand
because it's so soft it's incompressible

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:28.870
because it's so soft it's incompressible
 

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.320
because it's so soft it's incompressible
but it's very soft if on the other hand

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:31.330
but it's very soft if on the other hand
 

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.320
but it's very soft if on the other hand
we take it and we spin the bowl this is

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:34.330
we take it and we spin the bowl this is
 

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.150
we take it and we spin the bowl this is
what's going to happen so I didn't

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:36.160
what's going to happen so I didn't
 

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.220
what's going to happen so I didn't
Photoshop this this really is I spun the

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:38.230
Photoshop this this really is I spun the
 

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.280
Photoshop this this really is I spun the
bowl and I took a picture of it you can

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:41.290
bowl and I took a picture of it you can
 

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.860
bowl and I took a picture of it you can
see that the squares get turned into

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:43.870
see that the squares get turned into
 

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.860
see that the squares get turned into
diamond shapes and what's happening here

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:46.870
diamond shapes and what's happening here
 

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.140
diamond shapes and what's happening here
is that rather than a change in volume

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:49.150
is that rather than a change in volume
 

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.760
is that rather than a change in volume
to cause deformation we're getting a

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:50.770
to cause deformation we're getting a
 

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.040
to cause deformation we're getting a
change in shape the volume stays

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.050
change in shape the volume stays
 

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.010
change in shape the volume stays
constant and so we get a compression in

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:56.020
constant and so we get a compression in
 

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.050
constant and so we get a compression in
one direction and we get a stretch in

00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:58.060
one direction and we get a stretch in
 

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.030
one direction and we get a stretch in
the in another direction

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:00.040
the in another direction
 

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.770
the in another direction
in such a way that the volume stays the

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:01.780
in such a way that the volume stays the
 

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.940
in such a way that the volume stays the
same and that's what's happening here

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:02.950
same and that's what's happening here
 

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.060
same and that's what's happening here
this is what happens in a head injury in

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:06.070
this is what happens in a head injury in
 

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.790
this is what happens in a head injury in
a car accident a fall any closed head

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:08.800
a car accident a fall any closed head
 

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.280
a car accident a fall any closed head
injury this is what's happening we get a

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:11.290
injury this is what's happening we get a
 

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.740
injury this is what's happening we get a
change in shape of the brain that leads

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:13.750
change in shape of the brain that leads
 

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.620
change in shape of the brain that leads
to shear strain but we don't get a

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:16.630
to shear strain but we don't get a
 

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.040
to shear strain but we don't get a
change in volume so that's what happens

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:20.050
change in volume so that's what happens
 

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.190
change in volume so that's what happens
so what do you dr. Gruber was talking

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200
so what do you dr. Gruber was talking
 

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.190
so what do you dr. Gruber was talking
about the accelerations it's true you

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.200
about the accelerations it's true you
 

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.200
about the accelerations it's true you
don't need to get hit in order to have

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:28.210
don't need to get hit in order to have
 

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.870
don't need to get hit in order to have
your head accelerate rotationally like

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880
your head accelerate rotationally like
 

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.150
your head accelerate rotationally like
this and in that process this is gonna

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:33.160
this and in that process this is gonna
 

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.280
this and in that process this is gonna
happen to your brain so next time you

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:35.290
happen to your brain so next time you
 

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.290

you can tell him he's wrong and you can

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:38.950
you can tell him he's wrong and you can
 

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.390
you can tell him he's wrong and you can
explain to him the right way what really

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400
explain to him the right way what really
 

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.600
explain to him the right way what really
happens so so in a car accident a fall

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:45.610
happens so so in a car accident a fall
 

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.820
happens so so in a car accident a fall

laboratory falls under two main areas
the first is prevention of TBI trying to

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:30.680
the first is prevention of TBI trying to
 

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.090
the first is prevention of TBI trying to
improve safety systems to prevent the

improve safety systems to prevent the
 

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.680
improve safety systems to prevent the
injuries in the first place and here

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:35.690
injuries in the first place and here
 

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.180
injuries in the first place and here
we're really talking about reducing that

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:37.190
we're really talking about reducing that
 

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:38.650
we're really talking about reducing that
energy transfer from the environment

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:38.660
energy transfer from the environment
 

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.820
energy transfer from the environment
whether it's throwing something against

deformation of the brain tissue which in
 

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.610
deformation of the brain tissue which in
turn will reduce whatever injury or even

and the the design of the cars has

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:35.900
and the the design of the cars has

it looks like a terrible crash right but
 

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.570
it looks like a terrible crash right but
but that's because the car was damaged

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:43.580
but that's because the car was damaged
 

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.370
but that's because the car was damaged
not because the occupant on the inside

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:45.380
not because the occupant on the inside
 

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.320
not because the occupant on the inside
was damaged and so all of this is

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:47.330
was damaged and so all of this is
 

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.630
was damaged and so all of this is
crumple zones and and it eats up all of

would be in an accident the driver would
 

00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.409
would be in an accident the driver would
be dead and they'd hose off the

next guy cars don't do that anymore
because they actually protect the people

00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:06.169

trying to develop new therapies for the
head injuries that do a car we're not

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:14.840
head injuries that do a car we're not
 

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.299
head injuries that do a car we're not
always going to be able to prevent all

00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:16.309
always going to be able to prevent all
 

00:27:16.309 --> 00:27:19.330
always going to be able to prevent all
head injuries and so we need to better

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:19.340
head injuries and so we need to better
 

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.280
head injuries and so we need to better
treat those patients and as I said the

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:21.290
treat those patients and as I said the
 

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.810
treat those patients and as I said the
majority the cell death really occurs

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:22.820
majority the cell death really occurs
 

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.870
majority the cell death really occurs
over hours and days after the injury and

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:25.880
over hours and days after the injury and
 

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.940
over hours and days after the injury and
a minority of it occurs at the time of

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:27.950
a minority of it occurs at the time of
 

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.180
a minority of it occurs at the time of
impact and because of that delayed

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:31.190
impact and because of that delayed
 

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:32.980
impact and because of that delayed
fashion it gives us this opportunity to

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:32.990
fashion it gives us this opportunity to
 

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.370
fashion it gives us this opportunity to
try to treat that ongoing progression to

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:36.380
try to treat that ongoing progression to
 

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.150
try to treat that ongoing progression to
break it from that initial stimulus to

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:39.160
break it from that initial stimulus to

now and traumatic brain injury they've

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:48.860
now and traumatic brain injury they've
 

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.159
now and traumatic brain injury they've
been over 30 phase 3 clinical trials

00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:51.169
been over 30 phase 3 clinical trials
 

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:53.560
been over 30 phase 3 clinical trials
that have run all the way through the

that have run all the way through the
 

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.480
that have run all the way through the
FDA process and we've gotten nothing

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:55.490
FDA process and we've gotten nothing
 

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.180
FDA process and we've gotten nothing
there are no drugs for head injured

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:58.190
there are no drugs for head injured
 

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:01.480
there are no drugs for head injured
patients there's nothing so don't get a

patients there's nothing so don't get a
 

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.520
patients there's nothing so don't get a
head injury because there's really

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:03.530
head injury because there's really
 

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:05.440

prevention today is the best way to
 

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.620
prevention today is the best way to
reduce the societal cost of TBI and then

reduce the societal cost of TBI and then
 

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.880
reduce the societal cost of TBI and then
we're looking to

new therapies for head injury for those
that do happen so so that's kind of

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:38.300
that do happen so so that's kind of
 

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.960

question is how far can we stretch the

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860
question is how far can we stretch the
 

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.409
question is how far can we stretch the
brain tissue how much force deformation

00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419
brain tissue how much force deformation
 

00:33:15.419 --> 00:33:17.870
brain tissue how much force deformation
can it withstand before it breaks

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880
can it withstand before it breaks
 

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.619
can it withstand before it breaks
basically we want to measure how it

00:33:21.619 --> 00:33:21.629
basically we want to measure how it
 

00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:24.080
basically we want to measure how it
responds to the mechanical stimulus and

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.090
responds to the mechanical stimulus and
 

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.509
responds to the mechanical stimulus and
determine whether or not it's healthy if

00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519
determine whether or not it's healthy if
 

00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:28.399
determine whether or not it's healthy if
it's functioning after that stimulus or

00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:28.409
it's functioning after that stimulus or
 

00:33:28.409 --> 00:33:31.340
it's functioning after that stimulus or
if it's been damaged and we can do this

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:31.350
if it's been damaged and we can do this
 

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.230
if it's been damaged and we can do this
with our system because we can precisely

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240
with our system because we can precisely
 

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.450
with our system because we can precisely
control that injury stimulus we can

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460
control that injury stimulus we can
 

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.220
control that injury stimulus we can
verify it with the high speed video and

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:37.230
verify it with the high speed video and
 

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.889
verify it with the high speed video and
because we're doing this all on a living

00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:39.899
because we're doing this all on a living
 

00:33:39.899 --> 00:33:41.840
because we're doing this all on a living
piece of brain tissue and we're

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:41.850
piece of brain tissue and we're
 

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:44.419
piece of brain tissue and we're
interested in studying its biological

00:33:44.419 --> 00:33:44.429
interested in studying its biological
 

00:33:44.429 --> 00:33:47.659
interested in studying its biological
living response no that all makes sense

00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:47.669
living response no that all makes sense
 

00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:49.820
living response no that all makes sense
right but from a from an engineering

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:49.830
right but from a from an engineering
 

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.499
right but from a from an engineering
standpoint that's not usually how we

00:33:51.499 --> 00:33:51.509
standpoint that's not usually how we
 

00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:52.879
standpoint that's not usually how we
think of things we usually don't think

00:33:52.879 --> 00:33:52.889
think of things we usually don't think
 

00:33:52.889 --> 00:33:54.919
think of things we usually don't think
of things being alive right you give

00:33:54.919 --> 00:33:54.929
of things being alive right you give
 

00:33:54.929 --> 00:33:56.450
of things being alive right you give
something to an engineer and the first

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460
something to an engineer and the first
 

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.499
something to an engineer and the first
thing they're gonna want to do is pull

00:33:57.499 --> 00:33:57.509
thing they're gonna want to do is pull
 

00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:58.070
thing they're gonna want to do is pull
it apart

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080
it apart
 

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.960
it apart
they're gonna want to break it and

00:33:59.960 --> 00:33:59.970
they're gonna want to break it and
 

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.279
they're gonna want to break it and
that's what we normally do when we think

00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:01.289
that's what we normally do when we think
 

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:03.590
that's what we normally do when we think
of failure we take a piece of steel we

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600
of failure we take a piece of steel we
 

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.360
of failure we take a piece of steel we
put it in a testing machine and we pull

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:05.370
put it in a testing machine and we pull
 

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.580
put it in a testing machine and we pull
on it until it breaks in half we call

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:07.590
on it until it breaks in half we call
 

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:09.440
on it until it breaks in half we call
that ultimate failure when it does break

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:09.450
that ultimate failure when it does break
 

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:11.869
that ultimate failure when it does break
and then once we know that information

00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879
and then once we know that information
 

00:34:11.879 --> 00:34:13.159
and then once we know that information
it tells us something fundamental about

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:13.169
it tells us something fundamental about
 

00:34:13.169 --> 00:34:14.839
it tells us something fundamental about
the material and then we can go off and

00:34:14.839 --> 00:34:14.849
the material and then we can go off and
 

00:34:14.849 --> 00:34:18.470
the material and then we can go off and
and build cars or spaceships or bridges

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480
and build cars or spaceships or bridges
 

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.899
and build cars or spaceships or bridges
and and be certain that they're not

00:34:20.899 --> 00:34:20.909
and and be certain that they're not
 

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:22.129
and and be certain that they're not
going to fail that they're going to

00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139
going to fail that they're going to
 

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:24.200
going to fail that they're going to
withstand whatever forces that we put on

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:24.210
withstand whatever forces that we put on
 

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:27.220

them so this concept though of braking

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:27.230
them so this concept though of braking
 

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:31.129
them so this concept though of braking
doesn't really hold for most biological

00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139
doesn't really hold for most biological
 

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.760

fracturing and braking probably makes

00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359
fracturing and braking probably makes
 

00:34:42.359 --> 00:34:44.540
fracturing and braking probably makes
sense for those but but for non

tearing or breaking doesn't really make

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040
tearing or breaking doesn't really make
 

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.040
tearing or breaking doesn't really make
sense so when we talk about failure or

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.050
sense so when we talk about failure or
 

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:55.220
sense so when we talk about failure or
or injury we need to define what kind of

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:55.230
or injury we need to define what kind of
 

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.389
or injury we need to define what kind of
failure what kind of injury we're

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399
failure what kind of injury we're
 

00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:58.430
failure what kind of injury we're
talking about and really for the brain

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440
talking about and really for the brain
 

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.200
talking about and really for the brain
we're either talking about

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:00.210
we're either talking about
 

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.660
we're either talking about

its ability to think our ability to
think the ability of neurons to do what

information that's coming in make a
 

00:35:14.849 --> 00:35:16.940
information that's coming in make a
decision and send that information back

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:16.950
decision and send that information back
 

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.700

out or we can also talk about cell death

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:19.710
out or we can also talk about cell death
 

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.829
out or we can also talk about cell death
in the brain with it being so highly

00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839

failure when we're talking about

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460
failure when we're talking about
 

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.030
failure when we're talking about
something that's alive and so this is

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040
something that's alive and so this is
 

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.559
something that's alive and so this is
something that we did have published in

00:35:30.559 --> 00:35:30.569
something that we did have published in
 

00:35:30.569 --> 00:35:33.890
something that we did have published in
the past and we developed what we call

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900
the past and we developed what we call
 

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.349
the past and we developed what we call
the cell death tolerance criteria and

00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359
the cell death tolerance criteria and
 

00:35:36.359 --> 00:35:39.349
the cell death tolerance criteria and
basically it gives us a relationship

00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359
basically it gives us a relationship
 

00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:41.450
basically it gives us a relationship
between the amount of mechanical

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:41.460
between the amount of mechanical
 

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.549
between the amount of mechanical
stimulus that we apply to the tissue and

00:35:43.549 --> 00:35:43.559
stimulus that we apply to the tissue and
 

00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:46.099
stimulus that we apply to the tissue and
how much how many of the cells die in

00:35:46.099 --> 00:35:46.109
how much how many of the cells die in
 

00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:48.230
how much how many of the cells die in
response to that stimulus so here

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240
response to that stimulus so here
 

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.940

we stretch the brain and over here is
 

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.160
we stretch the brain and over here is
the percent of cell death so for example

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:58.170
the percent of cell death so for example
 

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.309
the percent of cell death so for example
that 20% strain stretching something 20%

00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319
that 20% strain stretching something 20%

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.190
terms of the function of the brain what
does that mean in terms of the cells

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200
does that mean in terms of the cells
 

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.319
does that mean in terms of the cells
that are that are living there so with

00:36:57.319 --> 00:36:57.329
that are that are living there so with
 

00:36:57.329 --> 00:37:00.230
that are that are living there so with
our data we can now take this one step

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240
our data we can now take this one step
 

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.210
our data we can now take this one step
further and put it into a biological

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220
further and put it into a biological
 

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.359
further and put it into a biological
context and be able to predict how many

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:05.369
context and be able to predict how many
 

00:37:05.369 --> 00:37:07.490
context and be able to predict how many
cells what percentage of cells will die

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500
cells what percentage of cells will die
 

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.620
cells what percentage of cells will die
in this area which percentage of cells

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:09.630
in this area which percentage of cells
 

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.730
in this area which percentage of cells
will be dysfunctional in that

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:11.740
will be dysfunctional in that
 

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.290
will be dysfunctional in that
and why is that all important well

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:14.300
and why is that all important well
 

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.660
and why is that all important well

head injury criterion so every car on
 

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.230
head injury criterion so every car on
the road is its safety standards are

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240
the road is its safety standards are
 

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.160
the road is its safety standards are
based on this number some number this

based on this number some number this
 

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.530
based on this number some number this
number was developed in the 70s and 80s

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:02.540
number was developed in the 70s and 80s
 

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.400
number was developed in the 70s and 80s
but it was developed for and it's it's a

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:06.410
but it was developed for and it's it's a
 

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:08.020
but it was developed for and it's it's a
measure that's based on the linear

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:08.030
measure that's based on the linear
 

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.290

originally designed and developed to

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:16.490
originally designed and developed to
 

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.360
originally designed and developed to
predict skull fracture not to predict

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:19.370
predict skull fracture not to predict
 

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.910
predict skull fracture not to predict
anything about the brain not to predict

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920
anything about the brain not to predict
 

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.070
anything about the brain not to predict
anything about traumatic brain injury so

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:24.080
anything about traumatic brain injury so
 

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.840
anything about traumatic brain injury so
all of the cars on the road are actually

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:25.850
all of the cars on the road are actually
 

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.090
all of the cars on the road are actually
designed to stop skull fracture not

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:28.100
designed to stop skull fracture not
 

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.570
designed to stop skull fracture not
traumatic brain injury and so this looks

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:31.580
traumatic brain injury and so this looks
 

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.150
traumatic brain injury and so this looks
like quite a violent event here but if

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160
like quite a violent event here but if
 

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.100
like quite a violent event here but if
you notice as you look at it most of the

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.110
you notice as you look at it most of the
 

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:38.080
you notice as you look at it most of the
acceleration is all the dummy's head and

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:38.090
acceleration is all the dummy's head and
 

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.360
acceleration is all the dummy's head and
rotation there's actually very very

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:40.370
rotation there's actually very very
 

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.880
rotation there's actually very very
little translational motion of the head

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:42.890
little translational motion of the head
 

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:45.880
little translational motion of the head
it's all like this and so this passes

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:45.890
it's all like this and so this passes
 

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.220
it's all like this and so this passes
this head injury criteria but all of

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:48.230
this head injury criteria but all of
 

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.230
this head injury criteria but all of
those finite element models the

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240
those finite element models the
 

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.670
those finite element models the
computational models I've been showing

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680
computational models I've been showing
 

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.040
computational models I've been showing
you predict over 25 percent strain

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:54.050
you predict over 25 percent strain
 

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.080
you predict over 25 percent strain
throughout the brain because head injury

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:56.090
throughout the brain because head injury
 

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:57.640
throughout the brain because head injury
criterion doesn't take into account any

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:57.650
criterion doesn't take into account any
 

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.710
criterion doesn't take into account any
of that rotational acceleration so

00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720
of that rotational acceleration so
 

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.650
of that rotational acceleration so
there's a push not only by the federal

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:02.660
there's a push not only by the federal
 

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.920
there's a push not only by the federal
government but insurance industry as

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480
well to to develop a new standard that's
 

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.240
well to to develop a new standard that's
based on these computational models that

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:10.250
based on these computational models that
 

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.890
based on these computational models that
will take into account not only the

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:11.900
will take into account not only the
 

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.240
will take into account not only the
linear but also the rotational

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:13.250
linear but also the rotational
 

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:16.000

acceleration so that the cars on the
 

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.610
acceleration so that the cars on the
roads will be designed to actually

roads will be designed to actually
 

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.440
roads will be designed to actually
prevent traumatic brain injuries as

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:20.450
prevent traumatic brain injuries as
 

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:23.740
prevent traumatic brain injuries as

the engineers now know where to set
 

00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:30.640
the engineers now know where to set
these limits for the deformation of the

where else can our tools take us well as
I said this response to injury is

00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119
I said this response to injury is
 

00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:42.970
I said this response to injury is
clearly a biological process so

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:42.980
clearly a biological process so
 

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.609
clearly a biological process so
understanding what that what that

00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:45.619
understanding what that what that
 

00:39:45.619 --> 00:39:47.680
understanding what that what that
process is going from a mechanical

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:47.690
process is going from a mechanical
 

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.990
process is going from a mechanical
stimulus to this biological response at

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000
stimulus to this biological response at
 

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.900
stimulus to this biological response at
a molecular cellular level is is this

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:52.910
a molecular cellular level is is this
 

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.510
a molecular cellular level is is this
whole field of Meccano transduction

whole field of Meccano transduction
 

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.800
whole field of Meccano transduction
Meccano transduction how is it that a

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:56.810
Meccano transduction how is it that a
 

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:58.540
Meccano transduction how is it that a
mechanical stimulus gets turned into a

mechanical stimulus gets turned into a
 

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.910
mechanical stimulus gets turned into a
biological response and so we can use

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920
biological response and so we can use
 

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.579
biological response and so we can use

and once we can understand that process

00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839
and once we can understand that process
 

00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:08.130
and once we can understand that process
in some detail we can start to identify

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:08.140
in some detail we can start to identify

head-injured patients in the future so I

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:19.670
head-injured patients in the future so I
 

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.430
head-injured patients in the future so I
said earlier that most of that cell

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440
said earlier that most of that cell
 

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.890

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.400
reciprocal second strain rate and here
we quantify the cell death using this

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:39.410
we quantify the cell death using this
 

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.980
we quantify the cell death using this
red marker red dye and we really don't

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:41.990
red marker red dye and we really don't
 

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.020
red marker red dye and we really don't
see a big increase until 2 to 3 days

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:44.030
see a big increase until 2 to 3 days
 

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:46.180
see a big increase until 2 to 3 days
after the head injury so that gives us

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:46.190
after the head injury so that gives us
 

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.920
after the head injury so that gives us
this time window in here where we might

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:47.930
this time window in here where we might
 

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:53.589
this time window in here where we might
be able to treat the the tissue to come

00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599
be able to treat the the tissue to come
 

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:55.990
be able to treat the the tissue to come
up with to prevent that eventual cell

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000
up with to prevent that eventual cell
 

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.359
up with to prevent that eventual cell

failed phase 3 clinical trials to date

00:41:01.329 --> 00:41:01.339
failed phase 3 clinical trials to date
 

00:41:01.339 --> 00:41:04.210
failed phase 3 clinical trials to date
and many other failed attempts to

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:04.220
and many other failed attempts to
 

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.099
and many other failed attempts to
develop a new therapy and one of the

00:41:06.099 --> 00:41:06.109
develop a new therapy and one of the
 

00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:07.300
develop a new therapy and one of the
things that they've had in common is

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:07.310
things that they've had in common is
 

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:08.859
things that they've had in common is
that they're all mono therapies they're

00:41:08.859 --> 00:41:08.869
that they're all mono therapies they're
 

00:41:08.869 --> 00:41:11.859
that they're all mono therapies they're
a single drug and this is just how not

00:41:11.859 --> 00:41:11.869
a single drug and this is just how not
 

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:15.250
a single drug and this is just how not
only the FDA sort of enforces it or the

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:15.260
only the FDA sort of enforces it or the
 

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.620
only the FDA sort of enforces it or the
rules enforce it but drug companies want

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:17.630
rules enforce it but drug companies want
 

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.730
rules enforce it but drug companies want
to know that they've got a drug that's

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:18.740
to know that they've got a drug that's
 

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.370
to know that they've got a drug that's
very clean it goes after one target has

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:21.380
very clean it goes after one target has
 

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:25.180
very clean it goes after one target has
no off-target effects and and so that's

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:25.190
no off-target effects and and so that's
 

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:27.430
no off-target effects and and so that's
the way that you know these trials have

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440
the way that you know these trials have
 

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.109
the way that you know these trials have
been designed it's a very specific drug

00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119
been designed it's a very specific drug
 

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:31.210
been designed it's a very specific drug
with a specific target well you might

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:31.220
with a specific target well you might
 

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.400
with a specific target well you might
imagine that you know the analogy of

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:33.410
imagine that you know the analogy of
 

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.620
imagine that you know the analogy of
throwing a computer against the wall you

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:35.630
throwing a computer against the wall you
 

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:37.120
throwing a computer against the wall you
know being a car accident is going to do

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.130
know being a car accident is going to do
 

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.210
know being a car accident is going to do
a lot of bad things

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220
a lot of bad things
 

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.130
a lot of bad things
to your brain not just you know one

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.140
to your brain not just you know one
 

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.070
to your brain not just you know one
thing so in the field of traumatic brain

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:43.080
thing so in the field of traumatic brain
 

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.470
thing so in the field of traumatic brain
injury there's been a push to test

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480
injury there's been a push to test
 

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.710
injury there's been a push to test
combination therapies put drugs together

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720
combination therapies put drugs together
 

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.390
combination therapies put drugs together
that may have gotten close in these

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400
that may have gotten close in these
 

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.210
that may have gotten close in these
previous trials close to showing an

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.220
previous trials close to showing an
 

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.490
previous trials close to showing an
effect and combine them together so you

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500
effect and combine them together so you
 

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.160
effect and combine them together so you
can target multiple pathways

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:57.170
can target multiple pathways
 

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.980
can target multiple pathways
simultaneously and and this has actually

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:00.990
simultaneously and and this has actually
 

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:04.760
simultaneously and and this has actually
come out of the HIV AIDS therapies where

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:04.770
come out of the HIV AIDS therapies where
 

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:06.710
come out of the HIV AIDS therapies where
they're combining multiple drugs

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720
they're combining multiple drugs
 

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.900
they're combining multiple drugs
together and and actually keeping people

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:08.910
together and and actually keeping people
 

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:13.580
together and and actually keeping people
HIV free for for many years so so we've

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:13.590
HIV free for for many years so so we've
 

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.560
HIV free for for many years so so we've
done this with our in vitro model we can

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:15.570
done this with our in vitro model we can
 

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.960
done this with our in vitro model we can
use our in vitro model to test new drug

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:17.970
use our in vitro model to test new drug
 

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.580
use our in vitro model to test new drug
combinations and so here's just one

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:19.590
combinations and so here's just one
 

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.660
combinations and so here's just one
example of a combination of estrogen the

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:22.670
example of a combination of estrogen the
 

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:26.000
example of a combination of estrogen the
hormone estrogen and combined with a

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.010
hormone estrogen and combined with a
 

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.390
hormone estrogen and combined with a
drug called memantine which is a

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400
drug called memantine which is a
 

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.040
drug called memantine which is a
non-competitive NMDA antagonist but it's

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:31.050
non-competitive NMDA antagonist but it's
 

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:32.839
non-competitive NMDA antagonist but it's
used in and youth dependent

00:42:32.839 --> 00:42:32.849
used in and youth dependent
 

00:42:32.849 --> 00:42:35.510
used in and youth dependent
it's a FDA approved drug for treating

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520
it's a FDA approved drug for treating
 

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.760
it's a FDA approved drug for treating
Alzheimer's disease so the idea is that

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:37.770
Alzheimer's disease so the idea is that
 

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.880
Alzheimer's disease so the idea is that
if you use fda-approved drugs we will be

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:40.890
if you use fda-approved drugs we will be
 

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:43.130
if you use fda-approved drugs we will be
able to translate them more quickly so

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.140
able to translate them more quickly so
 

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.500
able to translate them more quickly so
here's the injury the cell death after

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:45.510
here's the injury the cell death after
 

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:48.349
here's the injury the cell death after
the injury without a drug when we use

00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359
the injury without a drug when we use
 

00:42:48.359 --> 00:42:51.740
the injury without a drug when we use
estrogen alone it significantly reduces

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:51.750
estrogen alone it significantly reduces
 

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.829
estrogen alone it significantly reduces
the effects the cell death memantine on

00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839
the effects the cell death memantine on
 

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:57.440
the effects the cell death memantine on
its own also significantly reduces the

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:57.450
its own also significantly reduces the
 

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.030
its own also significantly reduces the
cell death but when we combine them

00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040
cell death but when we combine them
 

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.579
cell death but when we combine them
together we get an even better response

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:01.589
together we get an even better response
 

00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:04.280
together we get an even better response
and so you know in future studies we'll

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:04.290
and so you know in future studies we'll
 

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.930
and so you know in future studies we'll
be trying to translate this it's got to

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:05.940
be trying to translate this it's got to
 

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.480
be trying to translate this it's got to
go through animal tests before we can

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:08.490
go through animal tests before we can
 

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:10.520
go through animal tests before we can
get it to the clinic but here's an idea

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:10.530
get it to the clinic but here's an idea
 

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:13.010
get it to the clinic but here's an idea
of using the in vitro model testing more

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020
of using the in vitro model testing more
 

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.640
of using the in vitro model testing more
drugs getting them through faster before

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:15.650
drugs getting them through faster before
 

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:20.060
drugs getting them through faster before
testing them in animals also alluded to

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:20.070
testing them in animals also alluded to
 

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:23.120
testing them in animals also alluded to
earlier this traumatic chronic traumatic

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.130
earlier this traumatic chronic traumatic
 

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:26.770
earlier this traumatic chronic traumatic
encephalopathy where it's caused by

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:26.780
encephalopathy where it's caused by
 

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.670
encephalopathy where it's caused by
we're pretty sure it's caused by

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680
we're pretty sure it's caused by
 

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.030
we're pretty sure it's caused by
repetitive injuries over one's career

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040
repetitive injuries over one's career
 

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.030
repetitive injuries over one's career
over a long term it's has many a large

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040
over a long term it's has many a large
 

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.460
over a long term it's has many a large
neuropsychological cascade sequelae to

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:40.470
neuropsychological cascade sequelae to
 

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:42.650
neuropsychological cascade sequelae to
it but what we don't know about it are

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660
it but what we don't know about it are
 

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.320
it but what we don't know about it are
the underlying but biomechanics how many

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:45.330
the underlying but biomechanics how many
 

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.980
the underlying but biomechanics how many
hits does it take to begin to develop

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:47.990
hits does it take to begin to develop
 

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.330
hits does it take to begin to develop
this pathology what

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:51.340
this pathology what
 

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.000
this pathology what
what's the minimum duration between

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.010
what's the minimum duration between
 

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.990
what's the minimum duration between
those hits so that they're safe how hard

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000
those hits so that they're safe how hard
 

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.210
those hits so that they're safe how hard
to those hits have to be how many does

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:00.220
to those hits have to be how many does
 

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.310
to those hits have to be how many does
it take before you get this there's a

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:02.320
it take before you get this there's a
 

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.690
it take before you get this there's a
lot of the biomechanics that we don't

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:03.700
lot of the biomechanics that we don't
 

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.360
lot of the biomechanics that we don't
understand which we could study in our

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:06.370
understand which we could study in our
 

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:09.410
understand which we could study in our
dish if we can reproduce this mild

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420
dish if we can reproduce this mild
 

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.720
dish if we can reproduce this mild
repetitive TBI there's also this as I

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:12.730
repetitive TBI there's also this as I
 

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.190
repetitive TBI there's also this as I
alluded to this second impact syndrome

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.200
alluded to this second impact syndrome
 

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.840
alluded to this second impact syndrome
as well where you have a catastrophic

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:15.850
as well where you have a catastrophic
 

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:20.430
as well where you have a catastrophic
outcome after the first one so we have

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:20.440
outcome after the first one so we have
 

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.110
outcome after the first one so we have
shown that we can actually reproduce

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:22.120
shown that we can actually reproduce
 

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.600
shown that we can actually reproduce
this in a dish so our isolated piece of

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:24.610
this in a dish so our isolated piece of
 

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.520
this in a dish so our isolated piece of
brain tissue can actually develop this

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:26.530
brain tissue can actually develop this
 

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.740
brain tissue can actually develop this
repetitive injury synergy we can get

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:28.750
repetitive injury synergy we can get
 

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:30.930
repetitive injury synergy we can get
worse outcome after a second injury so

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:30.940
worse outcome after a second injury so
 

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.240
worse outcome after a second injury so
here we subjected our tissues to a

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:33.250
here we subjected our tissues to a
 

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:37.740
here we subjected our tissues to a
single stretch event of about 10% strain

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:37.750
single stretch event of about 10% strain
 

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.050
single stretch event of about 10% strain
so something low that we know is not

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:40.060
so something low that we know is not
 

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.460
so something low that we know is not
injurious because we've already

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:41.470
injurious because we've already
 

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.830
injurious because we've already
developed a tolerance criteria but if we

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:43.840
developed a tolerance criteria but if we
 

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.720
developed a tolerance criteria but if we
follow that single event with a second

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:45.730
follow that single event with a second
 

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.700
follow that single event with a second
one 24 hours later we get the

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:47.710
one 24 hours later we get the
 

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:50.250
one 24 hours later we get the
synergistic increase in cell death we

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:50.260
synergistic increase in cell death we
 

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.170
synergistic increase in cell death we
get a lot more cell death what's

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:52.180
get a lot more cell death what's
 

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.910
get a lot more cell death what's
interesting though is if we wait 72

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920
interesting though is if we wait 72
 

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.010
interesting though is if we wait 72
hours after the first injury to apply

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:56.020
hours after the first injury to apply
 

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.990
hours after the first injury to apply
the second injury we don't get that

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000
the second injury we don't get that
 

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.350
the second injury we don't get that
synergistic cell death and so this

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:00.360
synergistic cell death and so this
 

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.360
synergistic cell death and so this
speaks to the rest periods that athletes

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:03.370
speaks to the rest periods that athletes
 

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.400
speaks to the rest periods that athletes
have that that have been now instigated

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:05.410
have that that have been now instigated
 

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.580
have that that have been now instigated
in in concussion protocols where you

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:08.590
in in concussion protocols where you
 

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.200
in in concussion protocols where you
need to sit out a certain amount of time

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:10.210
need to sit out a certain amount of time
 

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.720
need to sit out a certain amount of time
a week or so where by sitting out we can

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:12.730
a week or so where by sitting out we can
 

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:15.240
a week or so where by sitting out we can
prevent this catastrophic second impact

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:15.250
prevent this catastrophic second impact
 

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:17.390
prevent this catastrophic second impact
syndrome so now that we have this

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400
syndrome so now that we have this
 

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.700
syndrome so now that we have this

we're studying this to try to understand

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:22.780
we're studying this to try to understand
 

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.930
we're studying this to try to understand
what not only the biomechanics are that

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:24.940
what not only the biomechanics are that
 

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.340
what not only the biomechanics are that
are behind it but then also what

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.670
impacts you know a concussion there's
really no cell death a concussion by

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680
really no cell death a concussion by
 

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.880
really no cell death a concussion by
definition has there's no cell death

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:44.890
definition has there's no cell death
 

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.160
definition has there's no cell death
there's no physical damage to the brain

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:47.170
there's no physical damage to the brain
 

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:48.960
there's no physical damage to the brain
and that's really the concussion is all

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:48.970
and that's really the concussion is all
 

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:50.790
and that's really the concussion is all
about a disruption of the normal

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800
about a disruption of the normal

function typical symptoms after
 

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:58.800
function typical symptoms after
concussion are feeling confused fuzzy in

00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:58.810
concussion are feeling confused fuzzy in

the head as well as learning and memory

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480
the head as well as learning and memory
 

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.420

deficits not being able to concentrate
 

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.000
deficits not being able to concentrate
and so we've asked if we can reproduce

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:07.010
and so we've asked if we can reproduce
 

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.670
and so we've asked if we can reproduce
this these learning and memory deficits

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680
this these learning and memory deficits
 

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.340
this these learning and memory deficits
in our dish with our tissue so you might

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:12.350
in our dish with our tissue so you might
 

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:14.650
in our dish with our tissue so you might
ask how is it possible to study learning

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:14.660
ask how is it possible to study learning
 

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.390
ask how is it possible to study learning

a slice of brain tissue well if we think

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:19.190
a slice of brain tissue well if we think
 

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:22.060
a slice of brain tissue well if we think
about what's learning what memory is at

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:22.070
about what's learning what memory is at
 

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:23.590
about what's learning what memory is at
the most basic level what we're really

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:23.600
the most basic level what we're really
 

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.140
the most basic level what we're really
talking about is a change in the pattern

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:26.150
talking about is a change in the pattern
 

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:29.620
talking about is a change in the pattern
of neuronal activity a change in pattern

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:29.630
of neuronal activity a change in pattern
 

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.800
of neuronal activity a change in pattern
of the the cells in your brain that they

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:32.810
of the the cells in your brain that they
 

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.380
of the the cells in your brain that they
they respond differently to a similar

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:35.390
they respond differently to a similar
 

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.230
they respond differently to a similar
input and so we can actually measure

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240
input and so we can actually measure
 

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.390
input and so we can actually measure
that mathematically in our slice

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400
that mathematically in our slice
 

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.070
that mathematically in our slice
cultures we can put a number to that

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:42.080
cultures we can put a number to that
 

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.800
cultures we can put a number to that
looking at how correlated firing is

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:44.810
looking at how correlated firing is
 

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.200
looking at how correlated firing is
between between electrodes and then you

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:47.210
between between electrodes and then you
 

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.030
between between electrodes and then you
might ask how can we induce learning in

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040
might ask how can we induce learning in
 

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.860
might ask how can we induce learning in
a dish well there's well-established

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:50.870
a dish well there's well-established
 

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:53.650
a dish well there's well-established
protocols where you can induce a change

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:53.660
protocols where you can induce a change
 

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:57.280
protocols where you can induce a change
in the structure of the activity either

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:57.290
in the structure of the activity either
 

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.590
in the structure of the activity either
electrically or we're doing this

00:46:59.590 --> 00:46:59.600
electrically or we're doing this
 

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.200
electrically or we're doing this
chemically so we asked if after a head

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:02.210
chemically so we asked if after a head
 

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.500
chemically so we asked if after a head
injury in our dish whether our slice of

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:05.510
injury in our dish whether our slice of
 

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:08.590
injury in our dish whether our slice of
brain tissue could learn and remember

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:08.600
brain tissue could learn and remember
 

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.250
brain tissue could learn and remember
things in a similar manner to an

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:12.260
things in a similar manner to an
 

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.770
things in a similar manner to an
uninjured piece of brain tissue so let

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:14.780
uninjured piece of brain tissue so let
 

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:17.140
uninjured piece of brain tissue so let
me walk you through this so at baseline

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:17.150
me walk you through this so at baseline
 

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:20.980
me walk you through this so at baseline
before the injury we can measure this

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:20.990
before the injury we can measure this
 

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.620
before the injury we can measure this
structural activity in the in the

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:23.630
structural activity in the in the
 

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:24.910
structural activity in the in the
function of the firing of the neurons

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920
function of the firing of the neurons
 

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.790
function of the firing of the neurons
and we'll put some number to it I can

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800
and we'll put some number to it I can
 

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.800
and we'll put some number to it I can
explain it later but let's just put a

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:29.810
explain it later but let's just put a
 

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.450
explain it later but let's just put a
number to an arbitrary number we'll call

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:31.460
number to an arbitrary number we'll call
 

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:32.380
number to an arbitrary number we'll call
it learning in memory

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:32.390
it learning in memory
 

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:35.080
it learning in memory
so before we teach it anything the slice

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:35.090
so before we teach it anything the slice
 

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:36.550
so before we teach it anything the slice
doesn't know anything so it's got a low

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:36.560
doesn't know anything so it's got a low
 

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.550
doesn't know anything so it's got a low
number then while we're trying to teach

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:39.560
number then while we're trying to teach
 

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.080
number then while we're trying to teach
it something we put in a drug that

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:41.090
it something we put in a drug that
 

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:44.680
it something we put in a drug that
causes it to burst and change its

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:44.690
causes it to burst and change its
 

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:47.910
causes it to burst and change its
activity and and that learning that

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920
activity and and that learning that
 

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.920
activity and and that learning that
structured activity increases so now we

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:50.930
structured activity increases so now we
 

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:52.750
structured activity increases so now we
take the drug off and we wait 24 hours

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760
take the drug off and we wait 24 hours
 

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.940
take the drug off and we wait 24 hours
so this is like the learning period take

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:54.950
so this is like the learning period take
 

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:57.370
so this is like the learning period take
the drug off wait 24 hours and basically

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:57.380
the drug off wait 24 hours and basically
 

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.860
the drug off wait 24 hours and basically
ask the slice if it remembered what we

00:47:59.860 --> 00:47:59.870
ask the slice if it remembered what we
 

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:03.730
ask the slice if it remembered what we
taught it during this time and 24 hours

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:03.740
taught it during this time and 24 hours
 

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.530
taught it during this time and 24 hours
later we've got our uninjured in blue

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:05.540
later we've got our uninjured in blue
 

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:08.710
later we've got our uninjured in blue
and our injured in the orange and our

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720
and our injured in the orange and our
 

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.380
and our injured in the orange and our
injured cultures don't remember what we

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:11.390
injured cultures don't remember what we
 

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:13.990
injured cultures don't remember what we
taught them 24 hours ago so we can

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000
taught them 24 hours ago so we can
 

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.450
taught them 24 hours ago so we can
reproduce so there's no cell death here

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:16.460
reproduce so there's no cell death here
 

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.860
reproduce so there's no cell death here
we can measure the cell death

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:17.870
we can measure the cell death
 

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:20.470
we can measure the cell death
and these are these are mild enough

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480
and these are these are mild enough
 

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.940
and these are these are mild enough
injuries that were not causing cell

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:21.950
injuries that were not causing cell
 

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:23.770
injuries that were not causing cell
death so it's really a model of

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:23.780
death so it's really a model of
 

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.120
death so it's really a model of
concussion where you don't have that

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:25.130
concussion where you don't have that
 

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:26.950
concussion where you don't have that
cell death but you have learning and

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960
cell death but you have learning and
 

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.660
cell death but you have learning and
memory impairments that we can reproduce

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:28.670
memory impairments that we can reproduce
 

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.640
memory impairments that we can reproduce
here and now we can use the system to

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:30.650
here and now we can use the system to
 

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:32.830
here and now we can use the system to
try to understand what it is that's gone

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:32.840
try to understand what it is that's gone
 

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.620
try to understand what it is that's gone
wrong that's underlying these things so

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:35.630
wrong that's underlying these things so
 

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:37.750
wrong that's underlying these things so
basically we're following this up now

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760
basically we're following this up now
 

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.000
basically we're following this up now
and we're looking at what are all of

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:40.010
and we're looking at what are all of
 

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:41.860
and we're looking at what are all of
these molecular players it's a very

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:41.870
these molecular players it's a very
 

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:44.590
these molecular players it's a very
complicated process and we're trying to

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:44.600
complicated process and we're trying to
 

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.870
complicated process and we're trying to
understand what gets broken what of

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880
understand what gets broken what of
 

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.540
understand what gets broken what of
these players that that are involved in

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:49.550
these players that that are involved in
 

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:51.540
these players that that are involved in
this restructuring and the activity are

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:51.550
this restructuring and the activity are
 

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.730
this restructuring and the activity are
damaged by the mechanical event and the

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:54.740
damaged by the mechanical event and the
 

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.560
damaged by the mechanical event and the
long-term goal there is once we if we

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:56.570
long-term goal there is once we if we
 

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:58.870
long-term goal there is once we if we
can identify what is being broken then

00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880
can identify what is being broken then
 

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.270
can identify what is being broken then
maybe we can test drugs that affect

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280
maybe we can test drugs that affect
 

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.780
maybe we can test drugs that affect

those kind of enzymes or proteins to see
if we can repair the damage

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:06.170
if we can repair the damage
 

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:07.780
if we can repair the damage
bring that learning and memory ability

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:07.790
bring that learning and memory ability
 

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:12.070
bring that learning and memory ability

what compounds all of this is is

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:52.090
what compounds all of this is is
 

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:54.210
what compounds all of this is is
different regions of your brain actually

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:54.220
different regions of your brain actually
 

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.500
different regions of your brain actually
have different stiffnesses

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:55.510
have different stiffnesses
 

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:57.930
have different stiffnesses
even we we've measured the mechanical

00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:57.940
even we we've measured the mechanical
 

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.280
even we we've measured the mechanical
properties at different regions of the

00:51:59.280 --> 00:51:59.290
properties at different regions of the
 

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:01.110
properties at different regions of the
brain and we find about a fourfold

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:01.120
brain and we find about a fourfold
 

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.060
brain and we find about a fourfold
difference between the softest and the

so not only that tolerance criteria that

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:06.910
so not only that tolerance criteria that
 

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:10.080
so not only that tolerance criteria that
you see but then also the mechanical

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:10.090
you see but then also the mechanical
 

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:11.460
you see but then also the mechanical
properties are going to dictate that

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:11.470
properties are going to dictate that
 

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:27.430
properties are going to dictate that
overall pattern of damage

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440
 
 

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.380
 
and you talk into the microphones and

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:30.390
and you talk into the microphones and
 

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:32.839
and you talk into the microphones and
other people come here yeah you talked

00:52:32.839 --> 00:52:32.849
other people come here yeah you talked
 

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:35.450
other people come here yeah you talked
about um physical the head like

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460
about um physical the head like
 

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.520
about um physical the head like
following getting hit by it in football

following getting hit by it in football
 

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:39.349
following getting hit by it in football
or something but could you talk about

00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359
or something but could you talk about
 

00:52:39.359 --> 00:52:41.150
or something but could you talk about
what happens to the brain in a shock

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160
what happens to the brain in a shock
 

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.849
what happens to the brain in a shock
wave an explosion sure definitely so we

00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859
wave an explosion sure definitely so we
 

00:52:43.859 --> 00:52:46.190
wave an explosion sure definitely so we
study that as well and in the lab and

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200
study that as well and in the lab and
 

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.490
study that as well and in the lab and
and it's it's it is a different injury

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500
and it's it's it is a different injury
 

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.579
and it's it's it is a different injury
so explosion of blasts is much more

00:52:52.579 --> 00:52:52.589
so explosion of blasts is much more
 

00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:53.680
so explosion of blasts is much more

dissection so so we can culture

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:50.360
dissection so so we can culture
 

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.520
dissection so so we can culture
different regions of the brain we can

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:51.530
different regions of the brain we can
 

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:53.230
different regions of the brain we can
culture the cortex and the hippocampus

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240
culture the cortex and the hippocampus
 

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.430

where it impacts the cortex why you get

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:08.630
where it impacts the cortex why you get
 

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:10.450
where it impacts the cortex why you get
so much hippocampal damage the

something out here and the soft

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:16.790
something out here and the soft
 

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:18.880

that when you deform that anything

00:58:31.359 --> 00:58:31.369
that when you deform that anything
 

00:58:31.369 --> 00:58:33.910
that when you deform that anything
that's stuck on there enzymes different

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920
that's stuck on there enzymes different
 

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.620
that's stuck on there enzymes different
enzymes are going to get knocked off or

enzymes are going to get knocked off or
 

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:38.589
enzymes are going to get knocked off or
or the change and pressure because of

or the change and pressure because of
the deformation changes the dissociation

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:41.720
the deformation changes the dissociation
 

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:44.230
the deformation changes the dissociation
constant and so your inhibitor of a

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240
constant and so your inhibitor of a
 

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.390

protein of an enzyme comes off and it

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400
protein of an enzyme comes off and it
 

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.140
protein of an enzyme comes off and it
and it starts a cascade so so even

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:50.150
and it starts a cascade so so even
 

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:54.760

don't see we're not tearing cells apart
 

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.970
don't see we're not tearing cells apart
and we still get this delayed cell death

00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:05.980
and we still get this delayed cell death
 

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.910
and we still get this delayed cell death
and so that the mechanical transducer

it is thought sort of the first step in
it is we deform a neuron and it releases

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720
it is we deform a neuron and it releases
 

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.970
it is we deform a neuron and it releases
glutamate and then that glutamate

00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:26.980
glutamate and then that glutamate
 

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.589
glutamate and then that glutamate
releases depolarize as a neuron releases

can block that calcium coming in but you
 

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:53.049
can block that calcium coming in but you
don't block cell death later on so and

00:59:53.049 --> 00:59:53.059
don't block cell death later on so and
 

00:59:53.059 --> 00:59:55.420

over weeks yeah yeah that's a great

01:01:55.099 --> 01:01:55.109
over weeks yeah yeah that's a great
 

01:01:55.109 --> 01:02:00.200
over weeks yeah yeah that's a great

keep our cultures healthy viable for
 

01:02:04.229 --> 01:02:08.569
keep our cultures healthy viable for
maybe four weeks I would say and so we

01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579
maybe four weeks I would say and so we
 

01:02:08.579 --> 01:02:11.690
maybe four weeks I would say and so we
we tend to look at more acute events and

just because we don't have the expertise

01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:18.420
just because we don't have the expertise
 

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.249
just because we don't have the expertise
to do it but we have started

01:02:22.249 --> 01:02:22.259
to do it but we have started
 

01:02:22.259 --> 01:02:27.709
to do it but we have started
collaborating with around CEO at obrr

01:02:27.709 --> 01:02:27.719
collaborating with around CEO at obrr
 

01:02:27.719 --> 01:02:30.430

aanh co-op town with the blast as well

01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440
aanh co-op town with the blast as well
 

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.459
aanh co-op town with the blast as well
in Blast two to look at long term longer

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:34.469
in Blast two to look at long term longer
 

01:02:34.469 --> 01:02:39.140
in Blast two to look at long term longer
term changes in tau so so good question

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:39.150
term changes in tau so so good question
 

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:50.980
term changes in tau so so good question
and we're very much interested in it

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:50.990
 
 

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:55.040
 
so you spoke a little bit about teaching

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:55.050
so you spoke a little bit about teaching
 

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:57.620
so you spoke a little bit about teaching
the slices of brain in order to study

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:57.630
the slices of brain in order to study
 

01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:00.980
the slices of brain in order to study
how it reacts and how it changes with

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:00.990
how it reacts and how it changes with
 

01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:02.510
how it reacts and how it changes with
memory can you elaborate a little

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520
memory can you elaborate a little
 

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:12.260
memory can you elaborate a little
further yeah sure I can yes so so we we

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:12.270
further yeah sure I can yes so so we we
 

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:14.690
further yeah sure I can yes so so we we
put the we put the slice cultures on a

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700
put the we put the slice cultures on a
 

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.330
put the we put the slice cultures on a
micro electrode array it has 60 channels

01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:17.340
micro electrode array it has 60 channels
 

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:20.300
micro electrode array it has 60 channels
so 60 electrodes in an array format an

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:20.310
so 60 electrodes in an array format an
 

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:23.120
so 60 electrodes in an array format an
8x8 array without the corner electrodes

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:23.130
8x8 array without the corner electrodes
 

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:25.580
8x8 array without the corner electrodes
so basically it's like sticking 60

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:25.590
so basically it's like sticking 60
 

01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:29.000
so basically it's like sticking 60
needles into the culture to record the

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:29.010
needles into the culture to record the
 

01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:33.140
needles into the culture to record the
neuronal activity we record for about 3

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:33.150
neuronal activity we record for about 3
 

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:36.440
neuronal activity we record for about 3
minutes and we basically identify when

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:36.450
minutes and we basically identify when
 

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:38.570
minutes and we basically identify when
there's activity on an electrode and we

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:38.580
there's activity on an electrode and we
 

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.850
there's activity on an electrode and we
calculate the correlation matrix between

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:40.860
calculate the correlation matrix between
 

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.550
calculate the correlation matrix between
pairs of electrodes and then we

01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:43.560
pairs of electrodes and then we
 

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.920
pairs of electrodes and then we
calculate the eigen value the maximum

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:45.930
calculate the eigen value the maximum
 

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:47.930
calculate the eigen value the maximum
eigen value from that correlation matrix

01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:47.940
eigen value from that correlation matrix
 

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:51.350
eigen value from that correlation matrix
and we call that the the synchronization

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:51.360
and we call that the the synchronization
 

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.760
and we call that the the synchronization
index and that's what I was calling

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:52.770
index and that's what I was calling
 

01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:56.210
index and that's what I was calling
learning and memory just rather than go

01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220
learning and memory just rather than go
 

01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:00.440
learning and memory just rather than go
into all of this during the learning

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:00.450
into all of this during the learning
 

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:05.320
into all of this during the learning
period we've put by Q : in it's a GABA a

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:05.330
period we've put by Q : in it's a GABA a
 

01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:08.900
period we've put by Q : in it's a GABA a
receptor blocker so that the inhibition

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:08.910
receptor blocker so that the inhibition
 

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:10.940
receptor blocker so that the inhibition
and the slice is removed and so you get

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:10.950
and the slice is removed and so you get
 

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:14.690
and the slice is removed and so you get
all of this excitatory tone and and you

01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:14.700
all of this excitatory tone and and you
 

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.610
all of this excitatory tone and and you
get bursting throughout the slice and

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:16.620
get bursting throughout the slice and
 

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:20.420
get bursting throughout the slice and
basically LTP comes from coordinated

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:20.430
basically LTP comes from coordinated
 

01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:22.090
basically LTP comes from coordinated
firing a change in the structure the

01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:22.100
firing a change in the structure the
 

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.170
firing a change in the structure the
circuitry comes from a coordinated

01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180
circuitry comes from a coordinated
 

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:28.100
circuitry comes from a coordinated
firing but between neurons and so while

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:28.110
firing but between neurons and so while
 

01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:29.600
firing but between neurons and so while
we have that drug in there there's a lot

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:29.610
we have that drug in there there's a lot
 

01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:31.850
we have that drug in there there's a lot
of coordinated firing and that that

01:04:31.850 --> 01:04:31.860
of coordinated firing and that that
 

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.220
of coordinated firing and that that
synchronization make number goes up the

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:34.230
synchronization make number goes up the
 

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:36.650
synchronization make number goes up the
eigenvalue goes up we wash it out and

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660
eigenvalue goes up we wash it out and
 

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:40.580
eigenvalue goes up we wash it out and
see 24 hours later if the the activity

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:40.590
see 24 hours later if the the activity
 

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:43.340
see 24 hours later if the the activity
is still correlated if we've got the

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:43.350
is still correlated if we've got the
 

01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:48.800
is still correlated if we've got the
same eigenvalue from the matrix and then

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:48.810
same eigenvalue from the matrix and then
 

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:52.010
same eigenvalue from the matrix and then
the injured ones they didn't they didn't

01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:52.020
the injured ones they didn't they didn't
 

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.750
the injured ones they didn't they didn't
have the same coordinated activity as

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760
have the same coordinated activity as
 

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.570
have the same coordinated activity as
the controls as the uninjured ones 24

01:04:56.570 --> 01:04:56.580
the controls as the uninjured ones 24
 

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.540
the controls as the uninjured ones 24
hours later interestingly the act

01:04:59.540 --> 01:04:59.550
hours later interestingly the act
 

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:00.950
hours later interestingly the act
and the injured ones was actually

01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960
and the injured ones was actually
 

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.980
and the injured ones was actually
greater than the uninjured ones so you

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:03.990
greater than the uninjured ones so you
 

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:06.350
greater than the uninjured ones so you
might expect the reason why you get that

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:06.360
might expect the reason why you get that
 

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.420
might expect the reason why you get that
that value to come down is because

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:08.430
that value to come down is because
 

01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:10.970
that value to come down is because
there's just no activity well in fact

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980
there's just no activity well in fact
 

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.250
there's just no activity well in fact
the opposite was true the injured ones

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.260
the opposite was true the injured ones
 

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:15.560
the opposite was true the injured ones
that had no coordinated firing were

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:15.570
that had no coordinated firing were
 

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:17.570
that had no coordinated firing were
actually firing more but it was

01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:17.580
actually firing more but it was
 

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:27.350
actually firing more but it was
uncoordinated so that's how we do can

01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:27.360
uncoordinated so that's how we do can
 

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.960
uncoordinated so that's how we do can
you talk about the difference between

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:28.970
you talk about the difference between
 

01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:31.610
you talk about the difference between
violent impact over a short period of

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:31.620
violent impact over a short period of
 

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:35.870
violent impact over a short period of
time versus very very mild impact over a

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880
time versus very very mild impact over a
 

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.370
time versus very very mild impact over a
long period of time and I'm thinking

01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:37.380
long period of time and I'm thinking
 

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:40.880
long period of time and I'm thinking
about sports soccer for example hitting

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:40.890
about sports soccer for example hitting
 

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:43.730
about sports soccer for example hitting
the pole with your head that was never

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740
the pole with your head that was never
 

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.530
the pole with your head that was never
considered a problem before but now

01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540
considered a problem before but now
 

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.870
considered a problem before but now
people start talking about it yeah

01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880
people start talking about it yeah
 

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.510
people start talking about it yeah
it's a good question so the soccer in

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520
it's a good question so the soccer in
 

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.990
it's a good question so the soccer in
particular so studies have been done

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000
particular so studies have been done
 

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.420
particular so studies have been done
doing sort of neuro psych evaluations of

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:56.430
doing sort of neuro psych evaluations of
 

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:59.990
doing sort of neuro psych evaluations of
soccer players over long term compared

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000
soccer players over long term compared
 

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.110
soccer players over long term compared
to non soccer players athletes and and

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:03.120
to non soccer players athletes and and
 

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.840
to non soccer players athletes and and
they do see some deficits and the soccer

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:05.850
they do see some deficits and the soccer
 

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:11.120
they do see some deficits and the soccer
players again the the physical forces of

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:11.130
players again the the physical forces of
 

01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:14.390
players again the the physical forces of
heading a ball aren't really high enough

01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400
heading a ball aren't really high enough
 

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:18.230
heading a ball aren't really high enough
and and I think playing soccer and then

01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240
and and I think playing soccer and then
 

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.880
and and I think playing soccer and then
there is a correlation between the

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:19.890
there is a correlation between the
 

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:22.220
there is a correlation between the
players who head the ball more often and

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:22.230
players who head the ball more often and
 

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:24.530
players who head the ball more often and
the deficits so at first you might think

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:24.540
the deficits so at first you might think
 

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.390
the deficits so at first you might think
it's the amount of heading that you do

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400
it's the amount of heading that you do
 

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.930
it's the amount of heading that you do
but but it's really from head to head

01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:29.940
but but it's really from head to head
 

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.420
but but it's really from head to head
collisions you're hitting the ball more

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:32.430
collisions you're hitting the ball more
 

01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:34.820
collisions you're hitting the ball more
often you're getting more head to head

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:34.830
often you're getting more head to head
 

01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:37.610
often you're getting more head to head
collisions and so you know causation

01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:37.620
collisions and so you know causation
 

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.320
collisions and so you know causation
doesn't mean that correlation doesn't

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:39.330
doesn't mean that correlation doesn't
 

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:41.780
doesn't mean that correlation doesn't
mean causation but I think in that case

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:41.790
mean causation but I think in that case
 

01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:44.570
mean causation but I think in that case
in the specific case of soccer those

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:44.580
in the specific case of soccer those
 

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.890
in the specific case of soccer those
deficits are from head to head

01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:45.900
deficits are from head to head
 

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.310
deficits are from head to head
collisions and not from hitting the ball

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:48.320
collisions and not from hitting the ball
 

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.410
collisions and not from hitting the ball
the the the g's from heading the ball

01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420
the the the g's from heading the ball
 

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:54.320
the the the g's from heading the ball
are right around the cheese from a

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:54.330
are right around the cheese from a
 

01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:58.940
are right around the cheese from a
roller coaster so it's okay to play

01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:58.950
roller coaster so it's okay to play
 

01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:00.630
roller coaster so it's okay to play
soccer
