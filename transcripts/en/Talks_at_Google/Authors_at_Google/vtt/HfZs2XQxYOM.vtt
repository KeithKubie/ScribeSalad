LODRO RINZLER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.300
How are you?

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.833
It's Monday, we're at
work, and you're good?

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:16.332
Good.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.330
It's funny.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.467
I haven't walked in here
and I saw the big screen

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:26.300
of The Buddha Walks
into the Office up there

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.660
and I thought, if
I were you, I would

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.460
think I was going to talk
about how meditation is going

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.310
to help me be better at work.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.350
Is that what you
guys are thinking?

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.584
OK, we're not going to do that.

00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:40.750
And I totally understand
where you might think that.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.230
And it does help you.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.779
It helps you in many ways.

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:45.320
There are all these
studies that have

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.850
been done in terms
of people who've only

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.440
done about eight
weeks of meditation--

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.950
just little bits
of it every day--

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.071
and over that period
of those eight weeks,

00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:56.070
they actually were testing
their brain activity,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.100
and they saw more
activity in the ACC, which

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.350
is the segment of the
brain that really regulates

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.630
self-regulation-- so taking
away our knee jerk reactions,

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.770
slimming those down.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.810
Increased gray matter
in the hippocampus,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.450
which means that they were more
resilient, that they had better

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.440
memory, that they were more
focused, that they had reduced

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.170
stress.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.924
So these things are, at this
point, scientifically proven.

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:24.590
I come from a Buddhist
background that's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.506
been saying, yeah, we've
been telling you guys

00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:27.795
this for 2,600 years.

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:29.920
It's great that you did a
study a couple years ago.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.620
One of my favorite words
within the Buddhist tradition

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.680
is gom-- g-o-m.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.550
Very simple word.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.770
Often it's translated
as meditation.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.490
The more exact translation
would be familiarization

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.630
or becoming familiar with.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.780
Meditation is a way to become
more familiar with who you are.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.950
That's what I want to
talk to you about today.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.480
Yes, meditation can help
you get better at work,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.681
but frankly, that just
means you're doing more work

00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:07.680
and you're better at it.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.650
What I'd like to
talk to you about

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.960
is how meditation
is actually going

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.251
to change the way that we
work overall, the way that we

00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:14.240
view our work, the
way that we consider

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.892
what is meaningful work.

00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:18.350
Now that meditation
and mindfulness

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.480
have become such buzz words
and such activity-- that's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.796
even here in your office.

00:02:23.796 --> 00:02:26.840
I was at Indiegogo
a couple months ago.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.602
They have a zen room there.

00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:31.060
Apparently, that's where people
go for private phone calls.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.894
When they asked me, where can
we go to meditate in our office?

00:02:33.894 --> 00:02:35.060
I said, you have a zen room.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.320
I'm sitting right next to it.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.182
What do you do there?

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:40.390
Now that it has become so
prevalent that we literally

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.676
have rooms dedicated to it in
big corporate institutions,

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:47.050
I think it's going to be very
tempting for us to say, oh,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.766
it's just about me becoming
less stressed, which is fine.

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.140
I'm a firm believer
that whatever

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.980
motivates you to begin a
meditation practice, it's good.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.150
Less stress, I want to work
with my strong emotions,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.790
I'm going through difficult
time, I think this could help.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.667
But the more we
meditate, the more

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:04.250
we realize it's a
practice of becoming

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.730
familiar with who we are, both
the amazing and scary parts

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.150
of our mind.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.930
So how does this actually
affect the way we work?

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.140
This is a big question.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.670
Little bit about me.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.940
I was raised within the
Shambhala Buddhist tradition.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.705
I started meditating
when I was six.

00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:24.270
I started doing meditation
retreats when I was 11, then 17

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.090
ran off to the monastery in
Nova Scotia-- shaved my head,

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.780
took the robes, the
whole nine yards.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.830
Came back, went to
college next year,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.590
and my primary meditation
mudra in those initial weeks

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.740
of college was the
keg stand mudra.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.160
Maybe you've heard of
it where you literally

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.620
have your hands on the keg and
you're drinking upside down.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.940
So I had this like
moment of really

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.790
having to find my particular
balance between what

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.880
at the time was work-- school
work-- and also going out

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.950
and all of these things.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.120
And meditation was the
through line for me in terms

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.650
of finding that balance,
finding what we often

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.770
casually refer to as the middle
way within the Buddhist world.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.915
Between going to the extreme
of going out all the time

00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:14.020
and really getting stressed
out about work and all

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.200
these things, I was able
to find a sense of balance

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.230
through the meditation practice.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.160
And it was years
later that I picked up

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.320
a book by Pema Chodron.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.570
She's a very well-known
Buddhist teacher.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.270
She's a nun within my
particular tradition.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.610
And in the opening chapters
of "When Things Fall Apart,"

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.190
one of her earlier
works, she talks

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.920
about coming home and
finding that her husband was

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.900
leaving her and that she
had to get a divorce.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.030
I was going through a
heartbreak at the time.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.660
I really was at this
interesting crossroads.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.410
I had been meditating
for some time,

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.280
so put a lot of my stock--
my happiness stock--

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.800
in a relationship
and it fell through.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.190
So I felt that heartbreak.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.586
I could empathize with that, and
her teachings were so helpful.

00:04:59.586 --> 00:05:00.960
In re-reading this
for what might

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.350
have been the millionth
time, I thought,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.010
I haven't gone through
a divorce, though.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.640
So who's writing about
that first big breakup?

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.920
Who's not writing about
the midlife crisis

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.720
but that quarter
life crisis of I

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.120
don't know what I want
to do with my life?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.560
Who is writing about going out
with friends on Friday night?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.450
And the more I explored,
the less I could find.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.900
And I ended up writing my
first book, which is called

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.460
"The Buddha Walks Into a Bar."

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.210
And I think what I
discovered in that process

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.210
was that I wasn't alone.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.695
There were a lot of
people of all ages

00:05:36.695 --> 00:05:39.600
that wanted to talk about how
could we apply the meditation

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.950
practice to all the
areas of our life?

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.370
An interesting
thing happens when

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.746
you write a book called "The
Buddha Walks Into a Bar."

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:47.874
I went to 36 cities
for that tour.

00:05:47.874 --> 00:05:49.040
I would never do that again.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.167
It's exhausting.

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:52.750
If you ever write a book, don't
go to 36 cities in two months.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.350
It's really too much.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.320
But it was also wonderful.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.070
I met a lot of new friends.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.160
I saw a lot of old friends.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.710
And they would come
to these events,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.810
and when you write a book called
"The Buddha Walks Into a Bar,"

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.275
right afterwards, you're ready
to collapse and go to sleep.

00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:09.400
And they say, you know what
we should do right now?

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.180
We should go to a bar.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.364
Funny thing happens when you
go to a bar with friends.

00:06:15.364 --> 00:06:16.780
For some of the
younger friends, I

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.080
found that we quickly started
talking about that balance.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.810
I'm trying to explore
what I want to do,

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.872
what's personally
meaningful for me in work.

00:06:23.872 --> 00:06:26.330
And for older friends who are
a little bit more established

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.820
in their careers, it's how
do I cultivate the qualities

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.300
that one actually cultivate in
meditation in the workplace?

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.840
So as soon as we got to the
bar, it all became about work.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.580
And that's how "The Buddha Walks
Into the Office" came about.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.160
Specifically, I was
traveling, and I was not

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.910
too far from here.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.490
I was giving a talk at Yale.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.260
And I was met by
a student who was

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.370
part of the meditation group.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.540
She's showing me around
campus, and we popped off

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.980
for some coffee at Starbucks.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.902
And it came out this she
was about to graduate.

00:06:58.902 --> 00:07:00.360
I'm always very
careful with people

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.615
who are about to graduate.

00:07:01.615 --> 00:07:04.360
Instead of being like, what are
you going to do with your life,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.310
I think I said
something like have

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.809
you thought about where you
want to live in a couple months?

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:10.560
Are you going to go home or
are you going to move somewhere

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.150
and are there friends you're
going to move in with?

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.816
She said, it's so funny that you
ask me these sorts of questions

00:07:15.816 --> 00:07:17.640
here at a Starbucks
because I want

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.200
to be the CMO--
the chief marketing

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.565
officer-- of Starbucks.

00:07:21.565 --> 00:07:24.868
Oh, that's very specific.

00:07:24.868 --> 00:07:26.830
I asked her a bunch of
questions about that.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.820
I was very curious.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.530
It was really interesting
to see how she got to that.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.610
And then we'll call her Jessica.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.920
Jessica escorted me
back to the talk.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.160
Gave the talk.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.694
Afterwards, signing books
and talking to people,

00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:41.860
another woman approached me.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.901
Also, right about to
graduate in a couple months.

00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:44.790
Same question.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.970
Have you thought about where
you might want to live?

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.920
Well, I have a couple
ideas where I want to live.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.110
I have no idea what I want
to do, and it terrifies me.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.605
And I think that's OK, right?

00:07:56.605 --> 00:07:57.730
I said, well, tell me more.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.423
She said, well, all I know
is I want to help people.

00:08:00.423 --> 00:08:02.200
And I said that's great.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.680
That's a really
good starting point.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.394
So I left that university campus
and I thought, how interesting

00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:10.060
these people were in
the same graduating

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.464
class at the same school--
such different views of what

00:08:13.464 --> 00:08:14.380
they were going to do.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.030
And I started
thinking about this.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.883
OK, if we're going to talk about
personally-meaningful work--

00:08:19.883 --> 00:08:22.060
and these are two people
who are meditating.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.518
They're going to
sit there, they're

00:08:23.518 --> 00:08:25.510
going become more
familiar with who they are

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.260
and more familiar with
what I would say is

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.750
their intention for their work.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.049
And we'll come back
to that in a bit.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:37.030
But we have Jessica who
is going to go out there

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.080
and maybe she'll find a good
job in marketing after college

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.059
and she'll keep rising
in the ranks there.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.280
And then she'll move over maybe
somewhere within the coffee

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.860
industry-- maybe even
straight to Starbucks

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.910
but eventually she'll get there.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.960
And she keeps rising in
the ranks of marketing

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.140
at Starbucks.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.710
And all along she's saying,
this is what the goal is.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.715
My sense of happiness comes
from this role-- chief marketing

00:08:56.715 --> 00:08:57.590
officer of Starbucks.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.680
Now, two things can happen here.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.740
One she gets the job.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.270
Or two, she doesn't get the job.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.930
So option one-- she
gets the CMO job

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.320
after decades of
striving for it.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.680
And what happens when we
get our wish fulfilled

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.782
in these sorts of ways?

00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:19.740
She might look over her
shoulder and say, oh, I

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.490
didn't spend a lot of
time with my family.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.580
I was working so hard.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.160
I wish I'd done more of that.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.310
Or maybe I didn't start a
family of my own along the way.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:31.179
Or maybe it's not paying me
what I thought I would get paid.

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:32.220
I'm worth more than this.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.861
Or maybe I'm working too much.

00:09:33.861 --> 00:09:35.860
This is too many hours,
too much responsibility.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.234
I didn't think
it'd be like this.

00:09:37.234 --> 00:09:41.105
Or maybe she gets the
CMO job and she realizes

00:09:41.105 --> 00:09:42.230
she doesn't want to be CMO.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.780
She wants to be CEO.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.720
There are lots of
ways that she could

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.150
get that particular job title
and still not feel fulfilled.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.940
And then option two,
she doesn't get it.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.650
She spends decades striving
for this particular role,

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.470
and it doesn't happen.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.720
And I thought this is not
a great roadmap for success

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.160
if we're going to define
success as actually

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.410
finding a sense of happiness
or contentment in our work.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.150
We can contrast
this with Christine.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.310
Christine, no clue
what she's doing.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.180
Totally terrified.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.830
But she knows she
wants to help people.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.340
There's 1,000 options for her.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.090
She could go become a teacher.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.960
She could become
a social worker.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.600
She could run a nonprofit.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.490
She could work here.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.200
She could work in
a giant company

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.195
but be the person that's always
sticking up for the little guy.

00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:33.570
There is any number
of things she

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.972
could do if she wants to
be of benefit to others.

00:10:35.972 --> 00:10:38.430
If that is what's going to
bring her a sense of contentment

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.070
or happiness in her work,
there's so many options

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.030
available to her.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.850
That roadmap seems
very joyous to me.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.380
So as I start contemplating
these things--

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.796
and as I start contemplating
this whole "Buddha Walks Into

00:10:53.796 --> 00:10:56.280
the Office" thing--
I thought, maybe

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.340
the question of what we
want to do when we grow,

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.079
maybe that's outdated.

00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:04.120
Did anyone get that question
when you were a kid?

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.282
What do you want to
do when you grow up?

00:11:05.282 --> 00:11:06.240
What do you want to be?

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.289
I think a lot of us did.

00:11:11.289 --> 00:11:12.830
What you want to do
when you grow up?

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:13.630
Maybe that's outdated.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.505
Maybe the better question
today is who do you

00:11:15.505 --> 00:11:18.182
want to be when you grow up?

00:11:20.954 --> 00:11:22.810
And I should qualify this.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.000
I don't think at a certain
point we just hit a state

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.845
and we're like,
now I'm a grownup.

00:11:26.845 --> 00:11:30.690
I think we just continue to
grow up and our idea of what

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.540
or who we want to be shifts.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.320
As Ben Franklin is
famous for saying,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.549
"when you're finished
changing, you're finished."

00:11:40.549 --> 00:11:41.590
So we continue to evolve.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.850
We continue to change.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.560
Our whole understanding
of who we are

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.649
can continue to adapt
as we go through life.

00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:52.190
But the point of it is can we
bring a sense of intentionality

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.240
to our work?

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.880
Can we bring a sense
of a singular purpose,

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.707
if even for today?

00:11:59.707 --> 00:12:01.915
I'm a firm believer that we
always have an intention.

00:12:04.449 --> 00:12:06.240
And the question is
are we familiar with it

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.830
or not-- to come back
to that term "goal?"

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.760
So if you are going out with
friends on a Friday night,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.982
what's your intention
for meeting up with them?

00:12:16.982 --> 00:12:18.940
Is it because you haven't
seen them for awhile?

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.590
You want to connect?

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:20.756
You want to share good news?

00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:22.320
You want to hear their bad news?

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.850
What's the intention behind
going out on a Friday night?

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.330
Or is it you had
a really hard week

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.440
and you want to just get
drunk and forget about it?

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.580
Because a shot of tequila
is not good or bad,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.700
but thinking makes it so.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.940
So if we have that shot, it
might muddy our brain a little.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.930
But if we're doing it
to connect with friends,

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.390
et cetera, that takes
us down one road

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.390
if we're clear about
our intention-- have

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.720
a few drinks with friends,
reconnect with them--

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.370
as opposed to I don't
know what I'm doing.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.170
I'm just going to go
out and get drunk.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.930
That takes us down a very
different road where we wake up

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.530
hungover, not clear what we
did, who we made out with,

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:09.310
what we did, what we said wrong,
open our phone, who did I text?

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.785
It's a different road if we're
clear about our intention

00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:14.200
and clear about why
we do what we do.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.822
And that's a silly
example, right-- shot

00:13:16.822 --> 00:13:18.030
of tequila on a Friday night?

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.160
But if we're going
to take a job here

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.490
at Google, why are we here?

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.820
Why are we doing this work?

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.054
It's long hours.

00:13:28.054 --> 00:13:29.470
We're here in the
New York office,

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.740
and I have a particular
belief that New Yorkers like

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.030
to work longer than just
about anywhere else.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.640
So we work long hours-- why?

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.790
What's our motivation?

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:45.340
The why shouldn't be because
I have this job title.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.882
The why is because
fill in the blank.

00:13:50.882 --> 00:13:53.465
We shouldn't have to build their
career out around what we are

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.060
and what our particular role is.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.810
That might change.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.080
In fact, it probably
will change.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.720
If we can build it out
around who we want to be,

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.040
the qualities we want
to cultivate day in

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.205
and day out, then we can live
a life that's actually happier

00:14:06.205 --> 00:14:09.442
and probably is a benefit
to lots of people.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.340
One of the things
I often encourage

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:22.780
people who are contemplating
this sort of work-life balance

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.420
is when you wake
up in the morning,

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.240
before you even get out of
bed, just lay there and think,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.530
what do I have to do?

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.180
Before you go into the stress
of getting nitty gritty

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.100
about your schedule,
say, oh, I'm

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.530
meeting with these
sorts of people,

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.550
seeing this sort
of friend after.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.370
And then you say, what's
my intention for today?

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.040
What quality do I want
to cultivate today?

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.610
Is it patience because the
people that you're meeting with

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.850
are very grating?

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.390
Is it presence
because you actually

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.056
just want to show up
and appreciate them

00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:56.346
for who they are?

00:14:56.346 --> 00:14:58.040
Is it gentleness
because you feel

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.220
like you've been beating
yourself up and manifesting

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.850
in how you interact with others?

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:07.620
What is the quality you want to
cultivate throughout the day?

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.940
You could even have
it as the background

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.040
of your phone or your
computer, put it on a post-it,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.244
put it up in the office.

00:15:14.244 --> 00:15:16.410
And remind yourself, oh,
right-- today, I'm actually

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.404
just trying to be gentle.

00:15:18.404 --> 00:15:21.070
That would be really significant
if I could just be gentle today

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.960
to myself and others.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.480
Today I'm trying to be patient.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.600
Just reminding ourselves
slowly throughout the day.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.670
And then at the end of the day
as we're brushing our teeth--

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.749
I often say brushing our
teeth because we often

00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:36.290
remember to do that and if we
can associate it with something

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.081
we already remember to
do it becomes easier

00:15:38.081 --> 00:15:41.390
to do-- we can actually
reflect on how we did today.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.954
Oh, I meant to be patient today.

00:15:42.954 --> 00:15:43.620
Did that happen?

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.161
Probably not.

00:15:44.161 --> 00:15:45.840
OK.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.100
If it didn't happen,
tomorrow is a new day.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.642
New intention, maybe
the same intention.

00:15:50.642 --> 00:15:52.350
If it didn't happen,
we should celebrate.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:53.474
We should acknowledge that.

00:15:53.474 --> 00:15:56.900
We should just have a moment
appreciation for the fact

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.100
that we're cultivating the
qualities that we would

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.940
normally cultivate on
the meditation cushion

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.660
in the rest of our life.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.670
This is really for me the beauty
of the meditation practice.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.870
Because we are becoming
more familiar with who

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.080
we are as we meditate,
we become more

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.200
familiar with both the
aspects of our life

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.540
so we want to cultivate
and the aspects of our life

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.706
that we might actually need
to cut out a little bit.

00:16:21.706 --> 00:16:23.800
And we can have the
discipline to follow through

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.850
in our day-to-day life.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.330
I'd like to actually
do a meditation

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.424
and exercise with you
all if you'll indulge me.

00:16:33.424 --> 00:16:35.340
At this point, there are
a lot of people here.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.739
So we have note
pads in the center,

00:16:37.739 --> 00:16:39.530
but maybe not everyone
can have a note pad.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.932
Maybe we can take pieces
of paper and pass it on.

00:16:42.932 --> 00:16:44.640
This is one of those
places that everyone

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.345
comes in with their laptop
but no one has pen and paper.

00:16:47.345 --> 00:16:49.650
So we have pen
and paper for you.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.450
And as those pass through, I'll
just a little bit about what

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.080
we're going to do together.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:01.320
So everyone just grab at least
one piece of paper and a pen.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.340
We're going to
engage in an exercise

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.470
that we commonly do at
the nonprofit I founded

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.584
a few years ago-- the Institute
for Compassionate Leadership.

00:17:09.584 --> 00:17:11.750
So the Institute for
Compassionate Leadership or ICL

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.740
as we call it is a six
month training program

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.950
for these sorts of
people-- the sort of people

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.200
that say I want to go out
and I want to help the world

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.190
and I have no f-ing
clue what that means.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.380
So we put them
through program where

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:31.210
they receive meditation
training and related

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.551
exercises like deep
listening, empathy training.

00:17:35.551 --> 00:17:37.550
We match that with community
organizing training

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.040
so that when they get off
the meditation cushion

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.620
they can go into
their communities

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.837
and effectively empower and
work with others and just

00:17:43.837 --> 00:17:46.420
practical leadership skills that
aren't taught in universities

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.615
these days like
how to fundraise,

00:17:47.615 --> 00:17:49.739
how to negotiate, how to
give and receive feedback,

00:17:49.739 --> 00:17:51.690
how to run a meeting.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.502
And over the six month
part-time program

00:17:54.502 --> 00:17:56.710
with the Institute of
Compassionate Leadership people

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.410
get very clear on how they're
going to help the world, what

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.035
that career decision
really looks like,

00:18:02.035 --> 00:18:03.701
and they actually
develop the confidence

00:18:03.701 --> 00:18:05.830
that they have everything
both within the tools we

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:10.250
give them but also internally
to go out and do that work.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.220
This is the first
exercise we do with them.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.570
I'm going to lead us through it.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.630
This is the way that we
actually map out our intention.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.230
So we'll begin
with a few minutes

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:25.910
of what is called Shamatha
or calm abiding meditation.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.330
And then I'll move us through
a guided contemplation.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.510
And we'll do it somewhat
quickly because I

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.240
want to allow some time
for Q&amp;A. But for people

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.065
who may be watching
this as a recording,

00:18:36.065 --> 00:18:37.940
you could even take
longer for the Shamatha--

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.460
the calm abiding
meditation-- longer

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.550
for some of the exercises,
and it could last a full 45

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.480
minutes on its own.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.240
So let's begin.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.720
For those of you who
are seated in a chair.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.720
You can just sit
a little bit away

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.480
from the back of the chair with
your feet firmly on the ground.

00:19:00.692 --> 00:19:02.150
And for those of
you on the ground,

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.960
you can sit with your
legs loosely crossed.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.800
For those of you
standing, you can just

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.690
do what I'm doing, which is
slightly bend your knees.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.310
But in all these cases,
we make a firm connection

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.100
with the earth underneath us,
giving our [INAUDIBLE] bones

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.570
digging into the chair or
the floor or our feet digging

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.210
into the earth.

00:19:41.449 --> 00:19:42.990
And from the strong
base, we actually

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.494
elongate upward
through the spine.

00:19:45.494 --> 00:19:47.160
So don't lift up
through your shoulders.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.960
Literally feel as
if there is a string

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.260
at the top of your head
pulling you straight up.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.760
So the spine can actually be
like stack of quarters, one

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.720
on top of the other.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.905
Relaxing the muscles in our
shoulders and in our back.

00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:08.715
If you're standing, you can
just let your hands fall

00:20:08.715 --> 00:20:10.090
at your sides.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.780
If you are seated, you can
pick them up at the elbows

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.240
and drop them palms
down on the thighs.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.110
This is to promote
resting energy

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.229
and it also provides extra
support for our back.

00:20:23.229 --> 00:20:24.895
For many of us, we're
used to slouching.

00:20:27.887 --> 00:20:30.470
So hopefully this will give you
a little bit of extra support.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.612
The chin just rests at
the top of the spine,

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.510
tucking the chin
ever so slightly.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.240
And bring a sense of relaxation
to the muscles in your face.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:03.990
Relaxing the jaw.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.290
So the jaw hangs open.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.350
You can place your tongue
up against the roof

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.270
of your mouth, which slows down
the swallowing process, which

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.180
can be distracting.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.735
It allows for clear breathing.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.700
This particular practice
is one within which

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.330
we wake up to what is going
on in this very moment.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.290
We wake up to the
present moment.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.700
So let's actually
keep our eyes open

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.990
since we are
attempting to wake up.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.520
You can rest of your gaze
two to four feet ahead of you

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.680
on the ground in a loose
and unfocused manner.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:37.780
The object or meditation
is the breath,

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.330
both the physical
sensation of the out breath

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.917
and the in breath.

00:22:46.482 --> 00:22:48.940
So you don't need to change or
alter your breathing at all,

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.005
just allow it to occur
as it always does.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.270
In fact, the only
difference between now

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.670
and the rest of our
day is that we're

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.200
paying full attention to it.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.450
So just feel the breath as
it cycles through your body.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.880
And when you notice that
your mind drifts off

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.940
into thinking about the past--
perhaps a conversation you had

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.550
earlier in the day-- or the
future-- plans for tonight,

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:04.110
things you need to accomplish--
just come back to the breath.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.800
Let it anchor you
in the present.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.524
The breath is always fresh.

00:24:11.524 --> 00:24:13.190
It is always what is
going on right now.

00:24:19.586 --> 00:24:22.270
If it's helpful, you
could even gently

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.145
say "thinking" to yourself.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:34.067
When a big thought comes
up, we just acknowledge it.

00:24:34.067 --> 00:24:36.025
We don't say it's a good
thought or bad though.

00:24:36.025 --> 00:24:42.447
We just say thinking and
return our focus to the breath.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.260
Now, I would like
to ask that we shift

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.700
our focus to a contemplation.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.730
We'll just hold a
simple question in mind

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.130
and come back to it
in the same manner

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:15.800
that we are coming
back to the breath.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.080
What quality would I like
to cultivate in my life?

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.372
Just notice whatever
responses may come up

00:26:24.372 --> 00:26:25.330
to the simple question.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.056
Let them wash over
you like a wave.

00:26:34.732 --> 00:26:37.350
And when you notice you've got
distracted from the question,

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.240
come back to it.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.280
What quality would I like
to cultivate in my life?

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.860
What quality would I like
to cultivate in my life?

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.320
OK, you can raise your gaze.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.080
And what I'd like to
ask at this point is

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.300
in the corner of
your paper, just

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.060
jot down a few of
those responses

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.106
that came up-- those qualities.

00:27:56.106 --> 00:27:59.340
No one will see this but
you, unless you upload it

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:03.053
to Google, in which case I feel
like everyone could see it.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:08.130
Just a few will do.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:16.780
And now I'm going
to ask you to draw

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:21.320
in the entirety of your page a
series of concentric circles--

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.190
four or five will do.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:27.870
So one in the center and
then another one around it

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.832
and another one around that
and then one more around that.

00:28:31.832 --> 00:28:32.540
So just a series.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.562
It looks like almost
a bullseye-- bullseye

00:28:35.562 --> 00:28:36.270
with a dartboard.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.084
Can I borrow your
piece of paper?

00:28:45.084 --> 00:28:45.709
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.520
LODRO RINZLER: So for those of
you who are visual learners,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.780
this is a perfect example--
she gets an A-- of what

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.643
I'm talking about.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.400
Within the Buddhist
tradition, there

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.097
is something called a mandala.

00:29:10.097 --> 00:29:11.430
And people may have heard of it.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.640
If you're "House of
Cards" fans, people

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.690
saw the sand mandala--
very elaborate.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.800
Went on for weeks or months
and then they tossed it.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:27.030
Often these are depicted
in lasting form in what are

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:30.440
known as Thangkas-- paintings.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.390
And in the center, there is
a central deity or lineage

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.660
figure, and then
in the next circle

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.870
out, there are various
manifestations of that deity

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.530
or lineage figure--
different parts

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:44.100
of their life, different
aspects of who they are.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.510
And it continues on and on
until all sentient beings

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.470
are represented.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.970
Particularly, I like to use the
example of the wheel of life

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.500
because it has
passion, aggression,

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.760
ignorance at the
center and then there's

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.426
different ways that
our ego plays it out

00:29:56.426 --> 00:29:58.134
and the different
realms we're said to be

00:29:58.134 --> 00:29:59.600
born in and so on and so forth.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.665
So it gets very vast
at a certain point.

00:30:01.665 --> 00:30:04.500
But there's always
something at the center.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.060
Our lives are a mandala,
and there's always

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.880
something at the center.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.870
And we are either
consciously aware of it

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.171
or we are unconsciously
living it.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.756
It could be our job title.

00:30:18.756 --> 00:30:20.514
A lot of times, it
is our job title.

00:30:20.514 --> 00:30:22.930
If we're just going through
life not paying much attention

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:28.700
to our intentions, it might
be our specific role-- author,

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.260
nonprofit directory, whatever.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.260
And then you build your
life out around that

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:37.600
because that's the primary
way that you spend your hours.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.835
CMO of Starbucks, and then you
build your life out around it.

00:30:40.835 --> 00:30:43.460
What I'd like to ask is that you
look at that list of qualities

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:49.680
that you just jotted down and
see if one of them stands out.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.380
And when it does, write that
at the center of the Mandala.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.190
Now I'd like to invite
you to contemplate

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:12.750
all the other
amazing things that

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:18.500
are in your life-- your family,
your friends, your work.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.750
Your work can certainly
be part of this.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.280
Your extracurricular
activities--

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.330
do you like to read, do you go
to museums, do you sing opera,

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.735
do you go to the ballet,
do you run, do you do yoga,

00:31:29.735 --> 00:31:31.330
do you meditate?

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:36.580
And however significant these
things are to you in your life,

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.190
the closer they are to the
center of that mandala.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.780
So if you're very
close with your mom,

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.210
she's in that next circle out.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.340
If you're not very close with
your mom, she's farther out.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:53.170
As you jot down and start
free associating with some

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:54.835
of these things,
there's someone that

00:31:54.835 --> 00:31:56.210
is in your life--
a good friend--

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:57.270
but you haven't
seen them forever.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.906
Maybe they're further
out right now.

00:31:58.906 --> 00:32:01.030
We're not evaluating where
we think they should be.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:03.550
We're just looking at the
reality of our situation.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.820
Where are the beings and
the activities in our life?

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.290
Just jotting down a whole
bunch-- maybe even 10 to 20

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:11.970
would do.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:13.365
Just real free association.

00:32:17.349 --> 00:32:19.140
If you're having trouble,
you can even just

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.430
think about the
people and things

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:21.640
that you've done the last week.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.890
That's often a good indicator.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.660
So the more significant
they are to you,

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.810
the closer they
are to the center.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:33.137
The less significant
they are, further out.

00:32:33.137 --> 00:32:34.220
We're not trying to judge.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.540
If your mother is in your third
circle, I'm not going to know.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.100
Just you.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.894
It's fine.

00:32:40.894 --> 00:32:41.794
Do you have pets?

00:32:41.794 --> 00:32:42.960
You could put pets in there.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.640
Volunteer activities
you might be engaged in.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.723
You can put that in there.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.510
Do you go biking?

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.360
Do you run?

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.140
Do you have an eccentric hobby?

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.520
And then when
you're ready, I want

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.880
to invite you to
draw a thin line

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:41.020
from the center of that
mandala out to those things

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.480
that you just wrote down.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.150
Just a very thin line.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:50.035
So if you have kindness at
the center of your mandala,

00:33:50.035 --> 00:33:54.000
you just draw a small
line out to your mother,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.590
to running, to
your close friend.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:08.110
So as we map out this
mandala of our life

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:11.380
with a quality that we want to
cultivate at the center of it,

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.880
what shifts?

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.750
What changes?

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.560
So if you were to infuse-- I'll
continue with the example I

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.230
gave-- kindness into these
various areas of your life,

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.909
what would that look like?

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.080
So in the example of drawing
that line from kindness

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.230
to my mother, it means
that when my mother calls,

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.723
I should pick up.

00:34:35.723 --> 00:34:37.750
That would be good of me.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.290
I shouldn't just put it off
for when I feel it's best.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.540
It's kind to actually pick up.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.710
I'm available.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.870
So whatever comes to mind.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.310
Just starting to map out.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.560
You could just jot it down.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.018
I realize that your mandala is
about to become very crowded

00:34:49.018 --> 00:34:50.370
with all these long phrases.

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.600
But just little notes.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.639
Pick up phone.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:59.020
What does kindness mean injected
into your exercise schedule?

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.780
What does kindness mean in
relationship to those friends

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.260
that you have mapped out?

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.460
What does kindness
mean in relationship

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.910
to how you take care of
your body or how you eat?

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:10.770
Whatever's on the piece
of paper right now,

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.040
just making a
simple note of ways

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.850
that you would inject your
quality at the center-- not

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:17.390
kindness if it's not kindness.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.930
Gentleness, patience,
generosity--

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.940
whatever you have
written down, how

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.900
do you inject that into
that relationship more

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.750
than you already have?

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.430
How can you go further
with cultivating

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:33.344
that quality in relationship to
all these things in your life?

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.260
When you're ready,
I'd like to invite

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.740
you to return to the
basic shamatha practice

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.220
that we were doing before.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.280
You don't have to rush
if you're still writing.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.830
But when you are done writing,
reconnecting to that meditation

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:27.987
posture that we reviewed
before and then reconnecting

00:37:27.987 --> 00:37:29.484
to the breath.

00:39:15.209 --> 00:39:16.583
You can raise your
gaze once more

00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:17.708
and come back to the group.

00:39:20.396 --> 00:39:23.670
In the Tibetan tradition,
we say many short sessions

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.740
within the day.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.696
That's the way to enlightenment.

00:39:26.696 --> 00:39:28.893
So lots of little
periods of meditation.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.770
The more we start to
build our life out

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:38.650
around the qualities we want
to cultivate in our life,

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.690
the more contentment
we will find.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:42.710
The more we're actually
just tuning into what

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.950
we actually see as the
source of happiness.

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:51.000
And we're less directed by
just the external factors

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.150
that exist in our world.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.691
We're not putting those in the
center of the mandala-- my job

00:39:54.691 --> 00:39:55.674
title.

00:39:55.674 --> 00:39:58.340
We're actually building our life
out around something that feels

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.840
personally meaningful to us.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.810
And this is how meditation
will actually help

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:04.481
us discover who we want to be.

00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:06.360
We'll become
familiar with who we

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.240
want to be as opposed
to just what we

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.390
want to do-- the activity
that busies our life.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.820
That way we could collect
garbage for a living or we

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.000
could run a hedge
fund, but we are being

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.960
who we want to be at work.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.940
We always have that opportunity
to cultivate the qualities

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:31.320
that we want to see in ourselves
and in the world and our life.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.940
So thank you so much for
joining with me for the Buddha

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.810
Walks Into the Office
and experimenting

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.914
with this contemplation
that we do

00:40:38.914 --> 00:40:40.830
at the Institute for
Compassionate Leadership.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.440
I'd love to hear what
questions or reflections

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.974
you may have on that.

00:40:53.406 --> 00:40:54.322
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.666
LODRO RINZLER: So
what's your name?

00:41:07.666 --> 00:41:08.414
AUDIENCE: Olivia.

00:41:08.414 --> 00:41:09.330
LODRO RINZLER: Olivia.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.329
So a beautiful question.

00:41:10.329 --> 00:41:12.480
It's like, OK, this
is fine and good,

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.590
but my life is
really f-ing busy.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:17.080
So my theory is
holding weight, right?

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.100
We are actually very busy.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.510
We do work long hours here.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.550
I remember years ago my
teacher Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.520
he was giving a very
traditional Buddhist talk

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.770
and then he started talking
about the power of prayer.

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:32.920
And I was like, what
is going on here?

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.990
This just became very
Christian for me.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:38.185
And I started getting
really inquisitive.

00:41:38.185 --> 00:41:39.560
And what I realized
he was saying

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.710
is sometimes the most
powerful thing we can do

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:46.710
is to voice an aspiration--
to actually just give voice

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:51.340
to I want to be kind,
I want to be patient,

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.100
I want to do that today.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.680
And just saying it-- or in
our case, what we just did

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.192
is actually writing it out.

00:41:58.192 --> 00:42:00.400
Not just writing it out,
but writing out all the ways

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.480
we could do it reminds us
that we can do it differently

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.820
than we normally do.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.300
This is us literally
mapping out different things

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.910
we could do within one given
day to cultivate that quality we

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:13.950
want to cultivate.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:15.600
And as I mentioned,
there are many ways

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.490
we could reminder
ourselves beyond this.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:20.590
If you wanted, you could pin
this to your desk or something

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.180
like that.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.990
But you could also write out the
quality you want to cultivate.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:27.120
You could have it pop up as
a reminder on your calendar.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.100
You could have a timer on your
phone go off to remind you.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.650
One of the things
I do when I notice

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:35.230
I'm working on one project for
a really long period of time

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:37.490
is I set a timer on
the phone to go off.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.630
And I'll work away if I'm
writing a book or something

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:43.280
and the timer goes off
and I close the laptop

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.400
and I raise my gaze and I
just reconnect to the breath.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:53.970
I cut through the habitual speed
of the day-to-day momentum,

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:57.976
reconnect, then after
30 seconds or a minute,

00:42:57.976 --> 00:42:59.530
I notice I start to get busy.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:00.130
I should get back to work.

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:00.930
I open the laptop.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.970
I reset the phone an hour
later, I do it again.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:06.609
And that way, I actually
slowed down in little ways

00:43:06.609 --> 00:43:07.400
throughout the day.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.010
And that helps me remember
why I'm doing what I'm doing.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.820
Is that helpful?

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.290
It's worth experimenting with.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.910
We can get very
tricky with ourselves.

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:18.243
Because our mind is very tricky.

00:43:18.243 --> 00:43:20.420
It wants to speed up and
get distracted and do

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.400
all sorts of things.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.607
We can get tricky with
how we focus it, too.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:28.180
Other questions or comments?

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.615
AUDIENCE: So I get this idea
of cultivating the quality

00:43:30.615 --> 00:43:32.870
in your life over a
longer period of time,

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.563
but can you talk
more about how you

00:43:34.563 --> 00:43:36.813
can cultivate those qualities--
like daily qualities--

00:43:36.813 --> 00:43:39.662
and do you recommend
trying new things?

00:43:39.662 --> 00:43:41.245
I want to practice
being patient today

00:43:41.245 --> 00:43:43.950
even if it deviates
from the longer term

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:45.755
quality I'm cultivating.

00:43:45.755 --> 00:43:47.880
LODRO RINZLER: This exercise
we do, as I mentioned,

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.560
I do at the beginning
of the six month program

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.850
for the Institute for
Compassionate Leadership.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.349
I also often do it around
New Year's because people

00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:54.390
want to set a resolution.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:57.060
It's always like lose
weight-- not gain weight.

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.820
I don't think many
people have that one.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.090
Lose weight.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:02.382
But that's actually part
of a larger motivation

00:44:02.382 --> 00:44:04.840
for what we want to do in terms
of taking care of ourselves

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.030
and et cetera, et cetera.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:09.100
So sometimes we put the
cart before the horse.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.876
We could do this exercise
even on a daily basis

00:44:11.876 --> 00:44:13.500
or we could just wake
up in the morning

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.210
and say, all right,
what's coming up for me?

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:19.270
How can I bring out
the things I need

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.110
to bring out today in myself?

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:24.930
The Buddhist point of view
is that we actually have

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.560
everything we need within us.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.880
So the Buddha was a human
being like you and me.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.500
And he came from a
life of a lot of luxury

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.916
and then once he
realized that there

00:44:37.916 --> 00:44:40.456
was suffering in the world,
he was very cloistered,

00:44:40.456 --> 00:44:41.080
very sheltered.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.130
He didn't realize that.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:43.588
So once he realized
it, he actually

00:44:43.588 --> 00:44:45.180
went to the opposite
extreme-- a life

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.470
of real asceticism--
literally torturing himself

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:48.880
in the name of spirituality.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.559
And as I mentioned
earlier, he gradually

00:44:50.559 --> 00:44:52.100
found a middle way
between those two.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:45:01.785
And when he did that, he
discovered that he was awake--

00:45:01.785 --> 00:45:03.910
not that he could be awake,
it's that he was awake.

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.790
And he was confused but
then he can actually

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:11.676
discover and have confidence
in his natural wakefulness.

00:45:11.676 --> 00:45:13.550
So it said that we all
possess the same thing

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:16.250
that he did-- what we
would call Tathagatagarbha,

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.720
which is Buddha nature.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.172
We all possess Buddha nature.

00:45:20.172 --> 00:45:22.630
It's not like he was better
than us or something like that.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:24.495
It's just he
discovered it and then

00:45:24.495 --> 00:45:26.890
he laid out this path
and this practice.

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.710
The practice he
did 2,600 years ago

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:32.120
is the same practice we
started off with today.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.250
So we can go through
this practice of becoming

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.640
familiar with who we are.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.364
The more we look,
the more we discover

00:45:39.364 --> 00:45:41.780
that there's some sense of
peace-- some semblance of peace

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.360
right at the center
of who we are--

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.060
beyond all of the confusion and
distraction and the busyness

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:50.609
and all of the things that get
in our head throughout the day.

00:45:50.609 --> 00:45:52.400
Within the Shambhala
tradition we sometimes

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:56.465
call this that we're
basically good.

00:45:56.465 --> 00:45:57.340
We're basically wise.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.130
We're basically kind.

00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:59.088
We're basically strong.

00:45:59.088 --> 00:46:00.110
We're basically capable.

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:01.068
We're basically worthy.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:08.970
We're basically able
to accommodate whatever

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:11.670
vicissitudes life throws at us.

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:14.020
So sometimes it's a little
overwhelming to say,

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.790
oh, I wake up, I
want to be patient,

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:18.550
and then I go into my
day and act like a jerk.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:20.640
But we have this
wellspring within us

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.112
that we can always
touch in with.

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:23.570
So the more we
meditate, the easier

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:27.520
it becomes to just come back to
the sense of peaceful abiding--

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.340
the calm abiding,
which is literally

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.682
the name of the meditation
practice we were doing.

00:46:31.682 --> 00:46:33.390
So the more we discover
that, the more we

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.940
can have confidence
in that, the more

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.960
we can actually bring it
out in our day-to-day life.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.876
And that's how we make
these intentions really

00:46:38.876 --> 00:46:40.730
strong and powerful.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:41.770
So that's my advice.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:45.430
It's a long winded way saying we
should probably meditate more.

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:46.870
No surprise there
coming from me.

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.588
Thank you for that
question, though.

00:46:49.588 --> 00:46:50.502
Others?

00:46:50.502 --> 00:46:51.873
Yeah.

00:46:51.873 --> 00:46:54.075
AUDIENCE: Meditation
helps for work for sure,

00:46:54.075 --> 00:46:58.870
but on the other hand,
when you do meditate a lot,

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:03.170
it also conflicts with
craving for success,

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:08.270
going higher,
competing with others.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:14.340
And those are the things that
big companies need these days

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.480
for bigger achievements.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.330
So you need to be
hungry for success,

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:22.470
hungry for going higher.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.530
So that conflicts with
meditation, right?

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.220
LODRO RINZLER: So the question
is meditation meditation,

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.710
all nice and good in the
workplace, but at some point

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:36.220
we're not sitting here talking
about ambition-- achieving

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.321
more, doing more, creating more
so that the business thrives,

00:47:40.321 --> 00:47:40.820
et cetera.

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.850
So isn't there a conflict here?

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:44.310
And it's a really good question.

00:47:47.011 --> 00:47:50.140
I have a few answers.

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.810
The first is whatever
our version of more

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:56.300
is, there's always going
to be more above that.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:59.580
So in the example of our friend,
Jessica, she becomes CMO.

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:00.940
She's become very ambitious.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.570
She gets that great title.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.330
There's going to be
more that she wants.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.410
This is just the
nature of what we

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:10.070
would call within Buddhism the
cycle of suffering-- samsara.

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:11.990
There's always going to be more.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:16.340
So what I'm asking us to
do is to consider success,

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.950
even at a corporate
level, as something

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:22.340
other than getting bigger.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:27.570
I mean, we have this
society that says,

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:30.097
well, you should
always be doing more.

00:48:30.097 --> 00:48:31.930
It's not good enough
that you have this job.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:33.800
You should have another
job that's better.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.240
It's not good enough that
you have the iPhone five,

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.180
you should have an
iPhone 6 at this point.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.470
There's always going to be
something more that we can get,

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:46.095
and then when we get it,
we'll want something else.

00:48:46.095 --> 00:48:47.897
So that's suffering.

00:48:47.897 --> 00:48:50.230
That's the very nature of
suffering we're talking about.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:53.070
So is this expected
in us for business?

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:54.300
Yes and no.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.055
I have a theory I'd
like to present today

00:48:57.055 --> 00:49:00.504
that I've just been recently
contemplating that--

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:02.920
and it's based on something
that my teacher Sakyong Mipham

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:03.680
Rinpoche said.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.710
He said sometimes when
we talk about society,

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:07.920
we can get easily
overwhelmed because we

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.070
are talking about
I'm here in New York,

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.960
there is suffering because
of the earthquake in Nepal

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.530
and there's suffering
in Baltimore

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:18.529
and there's all these
things, and I'm not there.

00:49:18.529 --> 00:49:19.240
What can I do?

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.340
And we become disheartened.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.740
And he said society
could actually just

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.230
be two people sitting
down having tea.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:30.580
That's a society right there.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.334
So if you and I had tea and
we had an hour together,

00:49:33.334 --> 00:49:35.500
we sipped our tea, we were
actually present with it,

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.458
and we talked about things
that really mattered

00:49:37.458 --> 00:49:39.200
to us, that would be
one type of society

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.640
that you and I
created for an hour.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:45.029
Or we could sit down and get
distracted on our phones,

00:49:45.029 --> 00:49:47.570
not really pay attention to the
tea, and occasionally look up

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.280
and talk poorly about others
and slander them and say what

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.214
a jerk they are.

00:49:51.214 --> 00:49:52.880
And that's a whole
other type of society

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.490
that you and I
create for one hour.

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:57.140
We were always creating society.

00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.340
This is my theory.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.570
So if society can just be two
people sitting down having tea,

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:07.410
we have 50% stakeholder
in that society.

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:10.220
I work with a lot of
meditation students one-on-one.

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:15.220
And there's a woman who is a
nurse practitioner in Minnesota

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.880
and her name is Nicole.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:21.204
And Nicole is 1/10 of
her private practice.

00:50:21.204 --> 00:50:22.620
There's 10 people
that work there.

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.880
So I said you are
1/10 of this society.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.280
So sometimes when
we go to work--

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.007
and I don't mean
to pick on Nicole.

00:50:29.007 --> 00:50:31.340
She's a wonderful human being
and an excellent meditator

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.010
and all these things.

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:35.120
Sometimes when we
go to work we say,

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.620
this is the way things are.

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.784
How do I put up with it?

00:50:40.784 --> 00:50:42.450
How do I put up with
the ambition thing?

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.129
How do I put up with
the speed thing?

00:50:44.129 --> 00:50:46.420
That thing that people are
always expecting more of me,

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.170
people want me to work longer
hours, whatever it might be.

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:52.190
And instead of saying, how do
I put up with this society?

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:55.570
I'd like to ask, how do
you create that society?

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:59.010
So in Nicole's case,
she's 1/10 of it.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.010
So she sits down with
one person and says,

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:02.880
you know, it seems
like we all continue

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.182
to email each other after
10 o'clock at night.

00:51:06.182 --> 00:51:06.890
Do you like that?

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:07.830
I don't like that.

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:09.954
And that person says, no,
I don't like that either.

00:51:09.954 --> 00:51:11.640
All of a sudden,
20% of that society

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.960
wants to put down their
email after a certain hour.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.710
And then maybe they
talk to a third person

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.600
and 30% of that society
doesn't want to do it.

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:22.690
And this is how we actually
create change within cultures--

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:24.460
through conversation,
through genuinely

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:27.270
showing up with someone and
sharing our heart in that way.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:31.720
This is counter to what a
lot of our corporate society

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.320
encourages.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.670
But I think in a
company like this,

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:37.070
it would be understood
and respected

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:40.990
that we could show up and
voice how we would like

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:42.656
to see a society like this run.

00:51:42.656 --> 00:51:44.600
Because Google is a society.

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.710
You guys know this.

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:48.590
And you wield incredible
power in society overall.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:51.800
So even just starting with a
conversation with a coworker

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.734
could have tremendous
results worldwide.

00:51:54.734 --> 00:51:56.275
We live in an
interconnected society,

00:51:56.275 --> 00:51:58.296
and you guys know
this very well.

00:51:58.296 --> 00:51:59.670
I'm not telling
you guys anything

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:02.030
that you don't already know.

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:04.931
In fact, if I had to define
the job description of Buddhist

00:52:04.931 --> 00:52:06.680
meditation teachers,
telling people things

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.052
they already know.

00:52:08.052 --> 00:52:10.510
Oh, I can just meditate and be
present, that's interesting.

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:15.730
But I digress.

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:19.770
You guys have an amazing ability
to connect with many people,

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:25.120
even within today,
even within this room.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:30.360
We can start here and say
maybe my version of ambition

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.600
is to create a
culture of kindness.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.900
Maybe my version of
ambition is to have us all

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:39.410
be very gentle with each
other-- to encourage patience.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:42.170
And then even within
the one meeting

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:44.450
we run every week, that
starts to ripple out

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:46.960
and other people say
I want to do that too.

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.673
And then that influences
Google as a company

00:52:49.673 --> 00:52:52.900
and it influences
people in their homes.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:56.350
And the way I pulled
this from is a story

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:58.520
at the time of the Buddha.

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.062
And I guess I'll end on this
one in looking at our time.

00:53:01.062 --> 00:53:02.770
There's a story at
the time of the Buddha

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:06.730
that there is a king
known as Dawa Sangpo.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:10.130
And he heard tell of the Buddha.

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:12.580
I don't know how people heard
of each other in those days.

00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.430
Maybe he saw his
video on YouTube.

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:16.530
Who's to say.

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:18.880
But he decides that
he needs to study

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.610
with this great
meditation master.

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:24.169
So he travels a great
distance, and when he arrives,

00:53:24.169 --> 00:53:25.710
he's a little
disheartened because he

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:27.543
realizes that all the
Buddha's followers are

00:53:27.543 --> 00:53:29.502
monastics at that time.

00:53:29.502 --> 00:53:30.749
And he can't do it.

00:53:30.749 --> 00:53:32.290
So he goes to the
Buddha and he says,

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:36.420
I have this entire kingdom
of people relying on me.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:37.004
What can I do?

00:53:37.004 --> 00:53:39.294
I can't become a monk, but
I want to receive teachings.

00:53:39.294 --> 00:53:41.780
And the Buddha asked all
of this monastic followers

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.620
to leave the room
and imparted what's

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.900
known now as Kalachakra
Chandra on King Dawa Sangpo.

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:51.752
These are teachings of
mindfulness and compassion.

00:53:51.752 --> 00:53:53.710
So the same teachings we
offer at the Institute

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:55.869
for Compassionate Leadership.

00:53:55.869 --> 00:53:58.410
And it is said that King Dawa
Sangpo went back to his kingdom

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.352
and he started talking to people
and he started meditating.

00:54:01.352 --> 00:54:06.440
And he would be in a meeting
with his ministers of education

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.794
and he would say,
how can we get people

00:54:08.794 --> 00:54:11.327
to be more present in
our education system?

00:54:11.327 --> 00:54:13.160
And they'd all say, oh,
this is interesting.

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.105
They'd have that
sort of conversation.

00:54:15.105 --> 00:54:17.230
And then ultimately, the
more they talked about it,

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:19.360
the larger the
ramifications were.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.340
Because in the schools
of that kingdom,

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.631
people were actually starting
to talk about mindfulness

00:54:23.631 --> 00:54:24.614
and compassion.

00:54:24.614 --> 00:54:26.280
And then he would
meet with his generals

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:30.180
and he would say, OK, how can
we take care of our troops?

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.439
How can we support them best?

00:54:31.439 --> 00:54:33.355
And it was just such a
different question then

00:54:33.355 --> 00:54:34.770
what they might
have already had.

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:36.436
There would be
conversations around that

00:54:36.436 --> 00:54:38.020
and that would affect
the whole army.

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:43.351
And then he would have questions
around the major doctors

00:54:43.351 --> 00:54:43.850
an area.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:45.420
He would gather them
together and talk to them

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:47.084
and all of a sudden
the medical system

00:54:47.084 --> 00:54:48.500
would be transformed
with the idea

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:52.190
of deep care for the patients.

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:53.330
And yes, he was a King.

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:56.050
But it's said that just
through conversation,

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:58.400
he was able to influence
this giant kingdom.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.860
It's not like he came in and
said, we're now a Buddhist .

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:02.660
Kingdom.

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.450
No.

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:04.700
It wasn't this top-down thing.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.570
It was organic.

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:08.710
It was conversations
amongst people.

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:12.739
And this is a kingdom, and it's
legendary and may or may not

00:55:12.739 --> 00:55:13.280
have existed.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.884
But it was known as Shambhala.

00:55:15.884 --> 00:55:18.300
So that's the template from
which this particular Buddhist

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.510
tradition I practice
in flourishes.

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:22.980
We come from the
tradition of maybe

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:27.165
if we can show up one-on-one
and just be with people,

00:55:27.165 --> 00:55:31.880
be authentic with them
and share our heart,

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.022
maybe real change can
be created in our world.

00:55:35.022 --> 00:55:36.730
So thank you very much
for your question,

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:40.390
and thank you all so much
for having me here at Google.
