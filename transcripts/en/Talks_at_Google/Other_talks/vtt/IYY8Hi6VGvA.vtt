00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:03.290
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hell, everyone.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.850
It's my pleasure to introduce
Pat Gelsinger, our speaker

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.680
today.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.930
Pat started his career at Intel.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.150
He was recruited to be a
technician in the beginning.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.920
And then as he was
working full time,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.510
he got his bachelor's degree
in double E at Santa Clara.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.840
And then he went on to
get his master's degree

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.450
in double E and computer
science at Stanford.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.780
At age 31 he was the youngest
vice president at Intel,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.735
and then he became the
first CTO at Intel.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.530
In 2010 he was recruited by
EMC in Boston to be the COO.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:01.950
And then in 2012 he was the
CEO of VMware in the Bay Area.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.210
Pat and his wife Linda
have four children.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.370
And today, he is going
to speak about his book,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.630
"The Juggling Act,
Bringing Balance

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.230
to Your Faith,
Family, and Work."

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.420
Please welcome Pat Gelsinger.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.745
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:23.120
PAT GELSINGER:
Thank you, Petula.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.790
Great to be here with you today.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.270
I'll cover a little
bit about my story.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.840
As we go along, we'll
dig into this subject

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.570
of juggling a little bit.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.100
I didn't try to embarrass
myself with the juggling balls,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.360
but maybe afterward I will.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.380
We'll see.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.630
And then a little bit
about being a Christian

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.810
both in the workplace
and in the Bay Area.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.150
And then we'll open up for
Q&amp;A and talk about whatever

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.730
else you feel like as well.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.410
So be informal and interactive.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.270
So a little bit about my story.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.780
I was born and raised
in Pennsylvania.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.860
And if you've ever been
to the Amish Country

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.680
in Pennsylvania, the
ultra, ultra conservatives,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.880
the Amish-- they haven't
accepted any new technology

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.080
since 1869.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.960
And then there's
the Mennonites who

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.714
are, like, really conservative,
but less so than the Amish.

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:13.380
And then there's the
Pennsylvania Dutch.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.650
And that's what
I was growing up.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.010
So compared to the Amish
we were really liberal.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.190
But by all means very, very
conservative farm community.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.100
My dad was eighth
of nine children.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.830
So son number one had
a farm, son number two,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.410
daughter number one-- it
got down to at number eight,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.312
and my grandfather said, we
have enough farms in the family.

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:37.520
Just work with your brothers.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.660
Otherwise I'd be a farm
boy in Pennsylvania today.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.340
And when I came out to
Intel I knew a lot more

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.760
about cow chips than
computer chips at the time.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.720
At six days old I was baptized
with full knowledge of what

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.620
I was doing in our
church, and became

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.710
president of the youth
group at 12 years old,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.880
and those types of things.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.171
And I thought I was a Christian
just because I was born

00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:05.110
and raised in that environment.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.200
There was one good
reason to go to church.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.430
That was to meet girls
or impress their mothers

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.930
or grandmothers.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.930
And other than that, I was
just rotten the other 6 and 1/2

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.810
days of the week.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.490
I ended up skipping my
last year of high school.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.130
I accidentally took
a scholarship exam

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.810
to get a tech degree.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.580
So I ended up skipping my
last year of high school,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.910
getting my associate's degree.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.570
So literally, I graduated from
high school with my tech degree

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.020
in the summer of a
'79 at 18 years old.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.830
And Intel came recruiting.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.810
So there was sort of an
industry-wide shortage

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.520
of technicians.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.480
So Intel came from
the West Coast

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.730
to recruit and invite me on
a trip to come to California.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.250
And the guy who
was interviewing,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.889
Ron Smith was his name, he
interviewed 12 people that day.

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.930
And any of you who've done
a lot of interviewing,

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.170
you know at about number
six, you sort of lose

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.420
track of John versus Joe.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.010
And about number nine, you
lose track of Jane versus John.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.730
And I was number 12
on his interview list.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.350
And this is what he wrote
about me after the interview.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.150
He said, smart,
aggressive, arrogant.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.090
He'll fit right in.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.089
So I got invited to come
to interview with Intel.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.649
18 years old and I had
never been on an airplane.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.110
At 18 years old, you're
getting invited for free trip

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.120
to California.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.910
And they even through in I
could stay for the weekend.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.970
So how long you think it took
me to decide to take the trip?

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.020
About a nanosecond.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.909
Yeah, sure.

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:34.450
I'm taking a free
trip to California.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.810
First time an airplane.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.180
But I promised my
mom before I left,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.190
no way am I moving
to California.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.500
I mean, they're crazy out there.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.210
Earthquakes and cults and stuff.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.400
I'm a farm boy in Pennsylvania.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.610
No problem.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.010
I'm staying here.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.200
But after I came and
interviewed with Intel,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.645
they made me a job offer.

00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:56.770
And the thing that convinced
me to go to Intel more

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.700
than anything else
as a technician,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.810
I wanted to be the engineer
on the other side of the table

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.150
telling the tech what to do.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.481
That was my whole
career ambition

00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:07.480
summed up the one thing.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.270
| want to sit on that
side of the table.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.500
And they had a tuition
reimbursement program.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.560
So as long as I was working
30 hours a week or more

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.330
and getting passing grades, they
would pay for all my school.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.130
So I got my bachelor's
at Santa Clara,

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.660
did my master's at Stanford,
was working on my Ph.D.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.277
At Stanford-- all of
that paid for by Intel.

00:05:26.277 --> 00:05:28.360
And I was a poor farm boy,
so this is pretty good.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.120
So I took the job
with Intel, moved out

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.720
here at the ripe old
age of 18, and then

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.910
started working full time and
going to school full time.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.780
And light-weight programs
like Santa Clara, no problem.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.810
Graduate programs like
Stanford while you're

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.670
working full time, no problem.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.040
Ph.D.-- so this
is pretty intense.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.610
Working full time, going
to school full time,

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.990
but I loved it.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.220
The first time I ever had a
computer architecture class,

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.010
it was like, that's what I want
to do for the rest of my life.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.940
I was one of those
kids you didn't want

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.460
to be in the class with me.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.840
I had my first computer
architecture class.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.490
I found out what
the textbook was.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.630
Over the summer, I read
the entire textbook,

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.730
finished every problem
in the textbook,

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.620
and showed up on the
first day of class

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.840
having done the entire syllabus
for computer architecture.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.510
Yeah.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.980
The professor-- it
was a new textbook

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.600
on computer architecture,
Tenenbaum's computer textbook

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.710
at the time-- he,
the professor hadn't

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.419
done past the second
chapter yet in the class.

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.210
So my notes became the
notes for the class.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.240
But I was sort of manic
about it in that way.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.240
I also-- when I
came to California

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.750
I thought I was a Christian.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.740
And I showed up, went to church
on Sunday for what purpose?

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.280
Meet girls and impress their
mothers and grandmothers.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.240
It's that simple.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.382
So what did I do when
I got to California?

00:06:46.382 --> 00:06:48.590
Went to church to meet girls
and impress their mother

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.298
and grandmothers.

00:06:49.298 --> 00:06:52.225
So walked down the street to
Santa Clara Christian Church,

00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:54.230
and sure enough that
first Sunday met

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.240
Linda, who you'll
meet in a little bit.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.230
I'll show a picture
of her in a second.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.630
And she asked me early
in our relationship

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.860
if I was a Christian.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.690
And my answer was yes.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.396
I was baptized when
I was six days old,

00:07:08.396 --> 00:07:10.770
president of the youth group,
went to church every Sunday

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.400
to meet girls.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.330
Of course I'm a Christian.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.030
And as we got to
know each other,

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.100
the church adopted me and
it quickly became apparent

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.680
that I was, at best
case, a Sunday Christian,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.510
and a lot worse than that
most other days of the week.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.270
And the sermon topic in February
of 1980 was based on Revelation

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.700
3:15-16. .

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.730
"I know your deeds, that you
are neither hot nor cold.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.470
I wish you were
one of the other.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.310
But since you're neither
cold or hot but lukewarm,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.850
I'm about to spit
you out of my mouth."

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.200
And that verse cut
me to the heart

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.090
because there I was, I like to
feign Christianity on the one

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.000
side, looking good.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.400
And on the other side
was living my own life.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.980
And I came to that moment of
crisis of my personal faith

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.670
and said, I have
to make a decision.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.750
And I was really
challenged in that.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.560
And in February of 1980 made
the decision to be hot for God,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.570
and made the decision to
be a full-time Christian.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.320
And absolutely at
that point made

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.490
this fundamental, life
changing decision.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.630
I'm going to be hot
for God and live

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.620
my life as a Christian in
the workplace and what I do.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.560
So that's February of 1980.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.236
Just a couple of
months later-- so I'm

00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:29.360
a baby Christian
at this point, sort

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.429
of figuring out what it
really means to read the word,

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.299
be in fellowship, all the other
things associated with that--

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.960
and God puts on my heart
in a deep and profound way,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.260
become a minister.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.110
And I'm like, I don't
want to be a minister.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.750
I'm loving this tech stuff,
computer architecture,

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.890
knocking it out of
the park at my job.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.400
That's the last
thing I want to do.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.070
And I just wrestled with God
for months about the idea

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.080
of becoming a minister.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.010
It's like I don't want
to be like-- just nothing

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:01.960
about it attracted me.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.490
So I just wrestled with God,
argued with him about it

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.640
as I was praying.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.320
And after doing that
for a couple of months,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.190
just couldn't let up in my
heart and in the soul about it,

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.930
and finally said,
OK, God, I give up.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.050
If this happens, and I laid
a-- you know, in the Bible

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.270
they had a story where Gideon
lays the fleece before God.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.060
The ground is dry,
the fleece is wet.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.210
The next day the fleece
is wet, the ground is dry.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.100
And I laid a fleece before
God and said, if this happens,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.680
I will go into
full-time ministry.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.710
And it was just finally
giving up before God.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.940
And after laying that
fleece before him,

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.780
as soon as I did it,
he came back and said,

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.630
the workplace is your ministry.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.980
And then since
that point in time,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:50.169
and my life verse at that point
became Colossians 3:23-24.

00:09:50.169 --> 00:09:52.210
"Whatever you do, work at
it with all your heart,

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.225
as working for the Lord,
not for human masters,

00:09:54.225 --> 00:09:56.350
since you know that you
will receive an inheritance

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.060
from the Lord as a reward.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.130
It is the Lord Christ
you are serving."

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.030
And that's become my life view.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.430
I'm in the workplace.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.070
And whether I'm a
low-level technician,

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:11.320
a medium-level engineer, now
CEO of a great software company,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.080
I'm working for the Lord Jesus
Christ as my full-time CEO.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.604
It's great that I get us
a paycheck from VMware.

00:10:18.604 --> 00:10:20.270
And You go online,
you can check out-- I

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.040
make too much money as a CEO.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.614
That's really cool.

00:10:24.614 --> 00:10:26.280
And I have a board
of directors as well.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.690
You can check out all
them online as well.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.540
But my full-time CEO is
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.210
And my job, the platform,
everything I'm given,

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.730
is to be a workplace minister.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:42.100
And there's a few who are
called to vocational ministry.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.710
But all of us who claim
the name of Jesus Christ

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.240
are called to be
full-time ministers.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.740
In the workplace, in the home
place, in the marketplace,

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.960
in the school place, or
wherever we are as Christians,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.560
we are called to be
full-time ministers.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.080
It is the Lord Christ
you are serving.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.540
Now, also I do want to just
emphasize a little bit that

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.630
being a Christian
and an engineer

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.945
is often seen as contradictory.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.630
I believe in the
scientific method.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.740
I have now four degrees,
and absolutely committed

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:22.060
to deep technical pursuit,
data-driven capabilities.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.950
And I am a full-time
believer in the word of God

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.460
and in the Christian
truths that come with it.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.660
I do not believe those are
in disharmony whatsoever.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.140
Areas of good debate, areas of
good discussion inside of that.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.960
But the Bible is not meant
as a scientific textbook.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.270
It's meant as a love story
that demands faith for people

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.150
to come to know him.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:48.040
And if it was an unequivocal,
immutable truth that

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.590
was there that could not be
denied by any scientific method

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.450
it wouldn't require faith.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.460
But God says, you will
take a step of faith

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.560
to come into a
relationship with me.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.690
I believe I have a very
credible, reasonable faith

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.260
with good scientific
data that supports it.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.700
But the last step is
always a step of faith.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.110
And you cannot come all the way
to God just based on scientific

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.610
method.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.240
Cannot be done.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.180
And he wouldn't allow
that to be the case.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.910
He demands that you
make a step of faith.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.850
But I am absolutely
confident, and I'll

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.040
debate any miracle the
Bible that's talked about,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.290
any other factual science.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.930
We'll have fun
debate about that.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.950
But at the end of it,
I cannot prove it.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.810
I give you good scientific
method behind it,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.280
but it requires a step
the faith to fully accept

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.160
and belief and live for him.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.160
So continuing into the
juggling discussion.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.980
As I mentioned this young lady,
Linda-- so I started at Intel,

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.530
was working for 30,
40, 70 hours a week

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.430
depending on school
workloads and so on,

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.300
the project I was on.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.730
I'm sure all of you
work a nice 30 or 40

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.310
hours a week here at Google.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.360
Just crazy work
schedule sometimes.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.530
So working full time,
going to school full time,

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.050
light weight-program, Santa
Clara, Stanford, et cetera.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.310
And then I met this
young lady named Linda.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.500
And Linda and I-- she
invited me over-- so this

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.960
is Christmas of 1979.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.110
So she invites me to have
Christmas dinner with her mom

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.880
and grandmother.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.070
Remember this meeting
mothers and grandmothers?

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.750
The formula's working great.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.790
So Linda with two generations--
mom and grandma are there.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.870
They invite me over
for Christmas dinner.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.930
Now, I'm a poor orphan
on the West Coast.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.850
I had neither money nor vacation
to go back East for Christmas.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.300
So I had dinner with Linda
and her mom and grandmother.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.700
And at the end of
the evening, we just

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.930
had a great evening together.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.500
In particular grandma
and I hit it off great.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.840
You know, play this
card, and so on.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.280
Grandma closes the door
at the end of the night

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.370
and turns to Linda on the first
time she ever met me, never met

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.880
me before, she turns to
Linda and says, he's the one.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.630
And then Linda
starts to describe

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.309
all of my failings,
which are numerous.

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:03.350
All these kind of things.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.766
We weren't dating
yet or anything.

00:14:04.766 --> 00:14:06.860
It was just a friendship
at that point.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.360
Two months later, Linda's mom
says to her, he's the one.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.860
We still hadn't
even gone on a date.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.540
I got both generations
in my favor.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.850
This is cool.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.050
And then we started dating a
couple of months after that.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.629
But I was on the slow
boat to matrimony.

00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:23.920
I was going to finish my
bachelor's, finish my masters,

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.357
do Ph.D. And probably
post-doc work

00:14:26.357 --> 00:14:27.940
before thinking about
getting married.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.120
So I had sort of a 10-year
plan until matrimony.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.960
And God had a very
different plan.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.680
And Linda, after a dating
for about a year and a half,

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.900
she was diagnosed with
endometriosis, a disorder

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.120
of the reproductive system.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.240
Had surgery-- one ovary removed,
part of the second one removed.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.600
And the doctor said to
her, kids now or never.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.820
Remember, we're just dating.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.560
I told her.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.520
She knew my plan.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.140
I was on the 10-year
plan to matrimony.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.150
And she comes to me--
one of our date nights,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.150
she comes to me with an
armful of medical books.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.566
And if a woman
ever approaches you

00:14:58.566 --> 00:15:02.700
with an armful of medical
books, you're in trouble.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.740
And she explains to
me what's going on

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.660
and what's going to happen, and
the doctor says, now or never.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.140
Wrestle over that for a while
and we decide to get married.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.200
So we got married
the following summer.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.080
And again, the doctor
said, kids maybe never.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.680
You got one ovary removed,
part of the second one removed.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.920
And we began our family.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.630
And that part of
one ovary did OK.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.680
So this is our
oldest, Elizabeth.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.134
Elizabeth is named after the
mother of John the Baptist.

00:15:32.134 --> 00:15:32.800
She's our older.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.520
She's 31 years old now.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.800
Here's our son
Josiah, is number two.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.250
And he works at Seagate.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.930
He's in the M&amp;A
department at Seagate now.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:47.010
And his wife Carly, and
our first granddaughter.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.470
Grandbabies are wonderful.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.130
Skip kids.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.207
Go straight to grandkids,
just for advice.

00:15:51.207 --> 00:15:52.290
It's much better that way.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.940
You enjoy them twice--
once when they show up,

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:54.870
once when they leave.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.240
It's really good.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.260
And then our third is
Nathan-- he lives in Oregon--

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.780
and his wife Rachel, and our
second granddaughter, Alice.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.440
And he's a youth minister
at a church up there.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.340
And our son Micah is the
last of our tribe here.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.310
And if we have time I'll
tell you a story about Micah

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.310
or so as we go.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:23.790
But now I'm working full time,
I'm going to school full time,

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.750
and having a family full time.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.710
And this is what I call
the juggling years.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.670
How do you make it all fit?

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.040
How do you possibly deal
with all the challenges

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:35.910
that you have?

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:40.330
All of the issues that
are pounding upon you?

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:48.070
And if you think about this
period of your life, with it--

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.440
the normal priorities that
we want to work for-- I mean,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.530
you're here developing
your career.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.510
How successful do you
want to be in your job?

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.650
Very.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.060
And if you're good and
capable, how much of the job

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.829
do they want of you?

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.770
As much as you give it.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:13.180
Your ego and your job
are in perfect harmony.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.050
All of you.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.390
Work more, harder-- you
want to be successful,

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.950
you want to be promoted,
you want to make more money.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.410
And all of those are in perfect
harmony with each other.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.630
So you know what happens at that
phase is your priorities ending

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:33.000
up being work, family, God.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.550
And work just wants
to consume it all.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.430
And you want to be
successful, reinforced.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.400
What are the God
given priorities?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.290
God, family, work.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.350
So we live our
lives almost exactly

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.330
inverted to the priorities
that God has set.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.580
So how do you make things fit?

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.240
How do you live in
this period of life

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.320
when you're just being
pressed on all sides-- family

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.180
responsibilities,
school responsibilities,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.580
other personal
objectives that you have?

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.840
And in this period
of time-- and this

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.320
is sort of the
topic of the book,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.320
and most of the learnings
out of that sort of

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.250
came from this
15-year period where

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.950
it's full-time work, a
full-time job, full-time school,

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.160
full time family, and
how to make it fit.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.500
So just a couple of things.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.160
And you can read more about
in the book and Q&amp;A session.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.250
But the first is a
mission statement.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.610
I had gotten to be 31 years old.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.700
At that point, I had a couple
of chips that I had finished.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.040
I had gotten my first
patent from Intel.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.130
I'm an inventor.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.115
I mean, that was cool.

00:18:38.115 --> 00:18:39.240
You get your second patent.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.130
I'm still inventor.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.088
You get your third one.

00:18:41.088 --> 00:18:44.440
Well OK, I'm still an inventor--
but written my first book.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.080
How many of you
read my first book?

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.580
You did?

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.346
So anyway, it's a thriller.

00:18:50.346 --> 00:18:53.010
"Programming the 80386."

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.680
You get to last chapter
and you turn paging on.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.720
Yeah.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.164
This is exciting stuff.

00:18:58.164 --> 00:19:00.330
Yeah, to a Google audience,
you guys would get that.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.540
I mean, this is when
segmentation and small address

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.230
spaces were a problem, and
the first fully flat 32-bit.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.030
I mean, this was
cool stuff, man.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.870
So I'd written my first
book, my first patent.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.180
I became the youngest
vice president at Intel

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.250
at 31 years old.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.740
All this is cool and great.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.210
But all of a sudden
it's like, what

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.760
do I want to do with
the rest of my life?

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.810
What are my priorities?

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.470
What are my objectives?

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.440
And out of that came
writing a mission statement.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.360
And in this period of life I
said, just being very, very

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.570
thoughtful about
what you want to do

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.670
with the rest of your
life because you're

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.700
being faced with too many
things are demanding your time.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.370
How do you decide
what you want to do?

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.760
And out of that, being
very clear about what

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.020
your goals are.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.210
And I developed mine.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:47.250
You can look at it
in the book, you

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.700
can look at it on
my website as well.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.658
Let's just say the three
elements of my mission

00:19:50.658 --> 00:19:53.620
statement, my personal
mission, first is my mission.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.730
I will be a Christian husband,
family man, and businessman.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.830
I will use every
resource God has

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.610
given me to carry out his work
on earth as set forth below.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:06.134
So that's what I want my
epitaph to read on my tombstone.

00:20:06.134 --> 00:20:07.300
That's what I want it to be.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.880
And then are my values.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.967
And things like work
hard in all I do,

00:20:10.967 --> 00:20:12.800
be open to the direction
of the Holy Spirit,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.344
enthusiastically approach--
those are the values.

00:20:15.344 --> 00:20:16.760
And when you say,
what's Pat like?

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.020
That's what I want you to
say-- you know, personality.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.810
And then finally,
specific goals.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.924
And some of my goals-- make
my marriage an example of that

00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:26.673
laid out in scriptures,
encourage all four

00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:31.470
of our children into Christ,
become for the CEO of Intel

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.300
Corporation, visitor 50
country-- I wrote that

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.950
about being the CEO of Intel
when I was 31 years old.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:41.650
What a precocious little brat
I was when I first wrote that.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.170
But audacious with
some of the goals.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.360
Some can be long,
some come short.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.570
Talk about physical
exercise, about how

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.540
we're going to use our
finances and wealth,

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.680
and supporting
charities and so on.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.290
But my specific goals--
every year I grade our goals.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.350
I do it tax time.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.240
I'm already depressed,
so it's a great time

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.680
to come back to the
goals and do it.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.980
But grading myself, and how am I
doing against the things I say?

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.010
It also allows you, as
things come up in your life,

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.025
to say no, not in my goals.

00:21:11.025 --> 00:21:12.650
No, I don't want to
spend time on that.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.490
That's not consistent with who
I am and what I want to be.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.030
So it helps you say no.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.297
It also helps you say
yes and develop the areas

00:21:19.297 --> 00:21:20.130
that you want to be.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.010
So developing a personal
mission statement or maybe

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.030
a family mission
statement to help

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.630
guide you to set the
direction that you want to go

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.550
and invest in and
pursue those directions.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:36.460
So first the juggling act
rules is a mission statement.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.590
Second, priorities.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.960
And we talked about this God,
family, work versus work,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.700
family, God.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.050
And how do you live
every day-- because it's

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.270
easy to sit some weekend
and write your priorities,

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.420
and then life hits
Monday morning.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.500
And how do you keep
them firmly in place?

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.150
And just a few things
from how I've learned

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.360
to manage those over time.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.470
And trust me, a CEO job
doesn't make it any easier.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.360
As you get higher in the ranks
it gets worse as you go along.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.560
One of those is beginning
the day in scripture,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.690
in the word every day.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.810
And I set as my priority that
I started reading the "Wall

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.700
Street Journal" very early.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.950
Like, 21 years old, I read
the "Wall Street Journal"

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:19.290
every day.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.810
But I don't read
the business bible

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.430
before I read God's Bible.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.680
It's just one of those things.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.790
And maybe before your
first cup of coffee, just

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.290
finding ways to put God
on the throne every day

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.500
and starting with
him as a priority.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.920
Making sure you're in
regular fellowship in church,

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.920
and making those clear priority
decisions in your life.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.857
So putting God on
that throne every day.

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.190
And that's one of my priorities.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.510
And I have to live that way
to keep myself balanced.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.680
He is my CEO.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.230
He is the person that I
want to be accountable to

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.390
at the end of my life.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.330
And the second
priority is family.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.070
Now, how many of you find it
easy to be home every night

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.370
in time for your family?

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.130
Nobody, huh?

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:57.980
OK.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.020
Oh, you're lying.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.020
OK.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.860
Now, imagine the conversations
that Linda and I would have.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.910
Remember, my work
objectives are exactly

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.979
aligned with my ego objectives.

00:23:08.979 --> 00:23:10.520
I want to be successful
at work-- you

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.320
remember how that spiral goes.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.310
So I'd have a
conversation with Linda.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.950
So imagine, she would
approach me and she'd say,

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.290
you haven't been
home much lately.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.617
And my response would be,
no that's not really true.

00:23:21.617 --> 00:23:23.450
I've been home more the
last couple of weeks

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:24.166
than before that.

00:23:24.166 --> 00:23:24.790
No you haven't.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:25.373
Yes, you have.

00:23:25.373 --> 00:23:27.097
No, you haven't.

00:23:27.097 --> 00:23:28.930
So you're just in the
middle of an argument.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.380
So we started keeping score.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.760
So we set up at home chart.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.360
And on the at home chart,
if I was home by 6:15,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.640
that was one point.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.830
If I was home by 5 o'clock,
that was two points.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.330
After 6:15 was zero.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.410
Weekend days were negative
points if I was gone.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.170
That's the numerator
and the denominator

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.330
was the number of workdays.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.640
We set a goal on the at
home chart of having 70%.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.340
And my secretary
produced a spreadsheet

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.240
that she sent to my
wife and I every month.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.700
We have almost 30 years
of the mean, the median,

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.075
the 12-month running average,
the skew, the kurtosis.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.157
Now we sit down, now
we have the data.

00:24:11.157 --> 00:24:12.740
Now we have the
discussion on my time.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.110
And you say, you haven't
been home much lately.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.700
But look at the graph, and it
was like, oh, you're right.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.640
I haven't been home much lately.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.850
Or no, I have been home more.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.519
I haven't felt like
you've been home more.

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:25.560
That's totally different.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.140
But keeping score,
setting goals.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.210
And most of us in positions
in the tech industry

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.670
and at Google, I mean,
we're goal-oriented.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.070
We want to be successful.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.610
Some days I'll be at
the end of our driveway,

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.690
sitting on the
cellphone at 6:12.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.760
6:13-- sorry, got to go.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.060
I'm getting a point tonight.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.560
Done.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.120
In the garage on time.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.950
I'm not gonna lose a
point over a minute

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.530
or two of a stupid meeting.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:58.060
So keeping score and keeping
things in balance that way.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.000
And also things like
dating our kids.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.700
One of the things
I started early,

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.980
every week I took one of
them out for breakfast.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.040
Four kids, once a
month, dating my kids.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.290
Dating Linda-- twice a month,
we go on dates together.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.917
Twice a year, we take long
weekends or trips, just

00:25:10.917 --> 00:25:11.500
the two of us.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.390
Finding ways to
live that priority

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.640
that family is more important.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.680
I was given the opportunity
to become Andy Gross'

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.060
technical assistant.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.710
Now, at Intel this
was the marquee--

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.680
this was like becoming
Larry and Sergey's

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.770
personal second-in-command
at Intel.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.950
So it was the marquee
development position

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.550
in the company.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.670
Two of the last three CEOs
had that role at Intel.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.480
So I was offered that job.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.280
I turned it down.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.890
Everybody in the company
was like, what an idiot you

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.680
are for turning down that job.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.410
But I knew I
couldn't do that job

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.760
and keep my priorities of
God, family, work at the time.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.120
Sometimes those
decisions are hard.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.400
But being clear about what your
goals are, your priorities are,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.930
and then living
according to them.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:04.870
Third tool for your journey
as a juggler, mentors.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:11.420
Now, I was in charge-- this
about, I'm 23 years old,

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.810
something like that--
and I was in charge

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.000
of taping out the 80386.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.420
How many of you
remember the 80386?

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.060
Just humor me.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.740
A few of you, right?

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.715
But it was a big, big deal.

00:26:22.715 --> 00:26:24.590
It was probably the most
important chip going

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.000
on in the industry at the time.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.500
And I was in charge
of assembling

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.170
the database of
the chip to prepare

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.540
it to send off to go to fab.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.440
That was my job.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.010
And I was working 20 hours
a day getting the chip done.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:40.740
And we had a design review
with executive staff of Intel.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:45.130
So Andy Grove is in
the audience-- founder,

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:48.310
"Time Magazine" Man of the Year,
one of the most powerful people

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.720
in Silicon Valley the time.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.590
Next to him was Robert Noyce,
the Nobel Prize winning

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.740
inventor of the
integrated circuit.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.210
Next to him was Gordon
Moore-- Moore's law.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.450
I mean, I got the gods
of the industry here,

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.086
and I'm giving an update
on taping out the 386.

00:27:03.086 --> 00:27:05.960
And basically, I
chewed them out.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.169
The computers weren't stable.

00:27:07.169 --> 00:27:07.960
They were crashing.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.040
And I'm not going
to get my chip done

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:15.140
if you don't fix these-- I mean,
what a precocious brat I was.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.740
23-year-old, the guy-- so on.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.210
But just really, really
aggressive in their face

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:19.760
about this.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.700
A couple of days
later, I'm sitting

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.665
in my office working
like crazy on the chip

00:27:25.665 --> 00:27:28.670
and assembly, and design rule
checks and that other kind

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:29.610
of stuff.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.900
The phone rings.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.500
Who is it?

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.910
I didn't want to be interrupted.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.340
It's when phones really rang.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.740
They weren't in your pocket.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:45.960
And the voice comes
back, Andy-- Andy who?

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.840
And I respond, and the voice
comes back, Andy Grove.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:55.532
I'm dweeb, and he--
way up here, president,

00:27:55.532 --> 00:27:56.490
founder of the company.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.580
And I'm just so beside
myself, out of my stupor.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.350
And he starts shelling
me with questions.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.010
What are you reading?

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.450
What are you studying?

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:06.990
What are your career objectives?

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:11.920
What are your development
plan-- so just and I'm like, uh!

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.760
After a few minutes
of that, I'm just, uh!

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.784
And he says, those
are lousy answers.

00:28:16.784 --> 00:28:17.450
Yeah, they were.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:18.283
I could barely talk.

00:28:18.283 --> 00:28:22.550
He says, be in my office
in a week with better ones.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.830
Wow, the president and COO says
to be in his office in a week,

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.845
you got two choices-- leave
the country or show up.

00:28:28.845 --> 00:28:29.760
It's pretty simple.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.260
So I showed up, and that
began a mentoring relationship

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.270
with Andy Grove that literally
lasted til just a couple

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.800
of years ago.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.490
And the only reason I'm in
a position like I'm in today

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.700
is because I've had people like
Andy Grove making me better.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.840
Now, mentoring with Andy Grove,
it's like going to the dentist

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.900
without Novocaine.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.690
He's not a nice guy.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:56.760
If you're mostly right and a
little bit wrong, your wrong.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.450
One time I came
into his office--

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.350
just to let you know
how blunt this guy was--

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.662
I came into his office
and I had grown a beard

00:29:02.662 --> 00:29:04.120
since the last time
he had seen me.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.390
He looks at me.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.140
I can tell he's sort
of checking this out.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.160
He says, that's ugly.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:08.970
Shave it off.

00:29:12.295 --> 00:29:13.670
But that was Andy.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:17.394
Just blunt, direct,
and making you better.

00:29:17.394 --> 00:29:19.560
And I just say, for everybody
in this phase of life,

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.730
both keeping you accountable,
helping you along the way,

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.510
do you have people like an
Andy Grove in your life?

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.310
People who are just
making you better?

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.370
Who are challenging you?

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:31.410
And in scriptural
terms I've called it--

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:35.180
it's three strands, a Paul,
a Barnabas, a Timothy.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.440
Somebody who's breathing
into your life,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.420
somebody who's a partner on the
way, a buddy on the journey,

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.510
and then somebody whose life
you're breathing into as well.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:47.540
And to be able to have those
kind of mentoring relationships

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.850
to help you as you're
developing, and in your career,

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.590
and learning or
along this journey,

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.320
and how to keep balance
in all the things

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.420
that you're off
to do that you've

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.759
said in the Mission statement.

00:29:57.759 --> 00:29:59.300
Keeping you accountable
against that.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.580
So three-- there's a number
of others in the book,

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.570
but maybe some ideas.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:06.040
And in the Q&amp;A time we can
talk about that a bit more.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.140
But some thoughts on how to
manage through the juggling

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:09.940
act.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.990
Now, when I was
asked to come back

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.650
to be the CEO of VMware-- I
mean, that's a pretty good job,

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.735
don't you think?

00:30:18.735 --> 00:30:22.220
Yeah, a lot worse jobs
than being CEO of VMware.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.780
We're a $6 billion
software company.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.790
I know that's small
by Google terms.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.680
But in software
terms, that makes us

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.310
the number five software
company in the world today.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.710
So hey, we're not
bad at that level.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.210
We crossed 6 billion.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.940
I got 19,000 employees now
working for me-- Bay Area.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.960
I mean, this is OK.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.020
But when we left the Bay Area--
Linda I were here 10 years,

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.240
then we moved to Oregon, then
I became president and CEO

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.640
at Intel in Boston, and then
coming back to the Bay Area.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.190
And when we left the
Bay Area 25 years ago,

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.972
Linda said, we're
never coming back.

00:31:00.972 --> 00:31:03.470
We wanted to raise our
kids in a different area,

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:05.640
different lifestyle, et cetera.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.910
The busyness, the craziness
of the Bay Area-- we're never

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.220
coming back was what she said.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.850
And just never say never to God.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:13.957
He has different plans.

00:31:13.957 --> 00:31:16.040
And so we're invited back
to come to the Bay Area,

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.510
she really struggled.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.997
Again, I was all in.

00:31:18.997 --> 00:31:19.830
We've made our home.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:22.520
We still have a home
in Oregon for 25 years.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.020
That's what we
really consider home.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.770
So the idea of coming
back to the Bay Area

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.204
was, OK, God, what
are you up to?

00:31:28.204 --> 00:31:29.370
What do you want to do here?

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.700
And this big platform
called being CEO.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.390
And with thatt-- a few
things about the Bay Area.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:39.690
It's a very geographically
diverse area, very ethnically

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.040
diverse area, highly affluent.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.330
You now live in the
richest area on earth.

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:47.540
Highest per capita
income-- Bay Area.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.270
We've crossed all the
others on the earth.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.490
Innovative and
influential-- Googles,

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:55.900
Amazons, Microsofts, VMware,
Facebooks, et cetera--

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.880
we changed the world
from the Bay Area.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.430
Highly innovative
and influential.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:06.470
But one of the lowest areas
of philanthropy in the nation.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.270
Can you believe that?

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.540
Some of the highest income
and lowest philanthropy.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.930
If you go to the census data
that show philanthropy rates,

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.750
there are poor
counties in Arkansas

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.850
that have higher per capita
giving rates than the Bay Area.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:26.230
It's like we're like 310 out
of 348 different census zones

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.180
that they have.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.300
Pitiful.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:33.150
And some of the lowest church
areas in the nation as well.

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:37.720
So as I view it, my mission
field now, my area of ministry

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.000
is to rich,
influential, miserly,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.650
pagans in the Bay Area.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.200
Yeah, that's my neighbors.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.570
That's your neighbors as well.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.970
And out of that,
I've helped to start

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.267
an organization called
TBC, called Transforming

00:32:53.267 --> 00:32:54.100
the Bay with Christ.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.308
And we said, there's three
things that we want to do.

00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:59.220
One is unify the
Christian leadership

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.680
across the Bay-- pastors,
parachurch leaders, et cetera,

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.240
to bring them into
relationship with each other.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.810
Nationally known leaders in
the Bay Area-- Chip Ingrams,

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:15.505
Francis Chans, John Ortbergs and
others don't know each other.

00:33:15.505 --> 00:33:16.880
Just bring them
together and say,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.030
let's get to know each
other and work together.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.794
Second is amplify.

00:33:20.794 --> 00:33:24.640
Amplify what God is doing
through works of service.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.290
And the church has become
known for what we're against,

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.910
not what we do.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.840
And Matthew in 5:16,
it's listed here.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.380
"In the same way let your
light shine before others

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.010
that they might
see your good deeds

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.890
and glorify your
Father in Heaven."

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.190
It's not by our superior
intellectual position,

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.880
buy our superior
political position,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.455
it's by our good deeds
that we should glorify.

00:33:46.455 --> 00:33:50.290
And we've gotten so confused
as a church to lose focus

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.640
on love and good deeds for it.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.710
So it's to really amplify works
of service throughout the Bay.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:58.780
And the church largely seen
today as one of two things,

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.660
and particularly
so in the Bay Area.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.400
It's either any
evolutionary leftover

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.170
that I as an intelligent
being have no purpose for,

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.900
or it's a tool of
the political right.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.520
And either one of those is
not interesting to me as well

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.440
95% of the Bay Area population.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.670
So how can we make the
church appealing again?

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.949
And then finally bringing
about multiplication,

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:21.610
expanding churches
throughout the day to grow,

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:28.110
expand, to become that social
influence for the long term

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:28.940
in the Bay Area.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.230
So we've launched the TBC.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:36.360
You can go look at it, TBC.city,
and potentially participate,

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.679
or with your church
join in working

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:41.239
with us to help influence
the Bay for Christ

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.570
for the long term.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.389
So with that, I'll pause
and we'll take questions

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.380
on any subject all.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.620
AUDIENCE: My question is
about, I guess, the role

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.810
as a Christian in technology
and just-- not just

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.500
in the workplace, but just in
the work that I actually do.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.042
Sometimes I feel
like the work that I

00:34:57.042 --> 00:34:58.499
do and the work
that people work on

00:34:58.499 --> 00:34:59.985
is so-- we focus
so much on the how

00:34:59.985 --> 00:35:02.595
and the what that we
forget the who and the why.

00:35:02.595 --> 00:35:04.820
And it gets kind of
depressing sometimes

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.820
to not see the connection
between the thing

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.170
that I'm actually building
and how God can use that.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.880
So I was wondering if you
have any advice for that?

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.817
PAT GELSINGER: Yeah, and I
say, let me tell you-- here.

00:35:15.817 --> 00:35:16.650
Good job, thank you.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:23.320
I sort of set this as sort
of my personal, professional

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.540
objective many,
many, many years ago.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.490
I said, I want to work on
a piece of technology that

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.090
touches every
human on the planet

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:37.890
in every modality of life--
work, home, and play.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.220
And that's my
objective in my career

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.740
so that I might both improve
their lives and quality of life

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.000
as well as hasten the
day of Christ coming.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.020
So that's my-- what I'm
trying to do professionally.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.750
And if any of you have used the
personal computer-- any of you

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:54.250
use that?

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:55.340
Any of you use a Mac
or anything like that?

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.760
OK, you've worked on a
piece of my technology.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.310
Have any of you used USB?

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:00.470
OK, I did that.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:01.360
Did you use Wi-Fi?

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.020
OK, I worked on that.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.870
I mean, and now with cloud, I'd
say with Google-- I mean, think

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.900
about the bigger objective of
the work that you're in today

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.321
and always keep that in mind.

00:36:11.321 --> 00:36:13.070
Because you do, you
just get down here way

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.690
in the minutia of the stuff.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.170
So there is just
a bigger purpose

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.720
that we're out to change lives,
improve the world, et cetera.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.510
Also, in the workplace
it is so easy

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:24.590
to get so consumed
by what you're doing,

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.700
you lose track of
the bigger picture.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.840
The most important thing to
me is-- we'll get back here

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:37.930
to this picture.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.710
I started my leadership
event this year

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.330
and I showed off pictures of
my two-year-old grandchildren

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:45.910
and told stories about them.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:49.710
Because hey, all the stuff,
the projects and so on,

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:53.350
the lives that we touch--
I spent the first 20

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:56.260
years of my career and I talked
about this, relationships

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.040
are more important than results.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.826
And it wasn't that I didn't
care about other people.

00:37:00.826 --> 00:37:02.700
But you were sort of
generally a distraction.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.660
If you weren't helping
me get my project done,

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.480
you were generally
a distraction.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.950
So get out of my road.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.310
Either help or get out
of my-- kind of thing.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:12.740
And over the last 10
years of my career,

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.060
I start every
meeting, how are you?

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.040
Today I had one of the guys
in my office who just got back

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.900
from a trip through Europe.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.810
How was the trip?

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.520
How's your family
doing, and so on.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.050
And to really shift the focus.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:25.920
Not to ever lose
sight of the-- I

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.750
mean you have a
fiduciary responsibility

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.440
to be a great employee.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.422
Not a good one, not a
mediocre one, a great one.

00:37:32.422 --> 00:37:34.130
If we're Christians,
we should absolutely

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.080
be the best employees
because we're working

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.600
for a much higher calling.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.620
But in that, find ways to be
able to build relationships,

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.780
focus on the higher purpose
and calling that we have.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:51.960
And find ways to be able to
be salt and light as it says

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.840
in scripture in the every day.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.024
How can I pray for you?

00:37:55.024 --> 00:37:56.440
What things are
going on your life

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.260
that I can really be
uniquely connecting with you

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.020
and supporting?

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.900
And even-- I've
asked that question

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.270
to thousands of
people-- the most

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:07.800
atheist, agnostic,
other people, nobody

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.390
has ever denied me praying
for their sick relatives.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:11.010
Never once.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:11.912
Can you believe that?

00:38:11.912 --> 00:38:12.870
Hey, you're an atheist.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.453
You don't even believe
there is a God.

00:38:14.453 --> 00:38:18.290
Why will you let me pray
for-- so never once.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:20.211
It just changes the
relationship that you have

00:38:20.211 --> 00:38:21.710
and the potential
role that you have

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:25.057
with your peers and
colleagues in the workplace.

00:38:25.057 --> 00:38:26.390
AUDIENCE: Hi, just to follow up.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:32.260
Can you elaborate on what you
mean by to be a great employee,

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.890
or to be, say, the
best that you can be?

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:39.530
Especially in light of
a lot of your discussion

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:44.580
seems to be about how to juggle
by, say, making time for family

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:49.630
or by considering
relationships to be important.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.860
PAT GELSINGER: Yup, yup.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.280
So a couple thoughts on that.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.530
One is, sometimes-- and I want
this to be very-- every once

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.110
in a while, you just gotta walk
home, tell your spouse, hey,

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:01.970
for the next 30 days, I'm gone.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:04.310
The project demands
it, and so on.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:07.382
You are just going to do what
it takes to get the job done.

00:39:07.382 --> 00:39:09.590
But then the next 30 days
after that, you better say,

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.044
oh, this is how I'm going
to keep balance as well.

00:39:12.044 --> 00:39:14.460
And if you can't keep some
reasonable balance while you're

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.420
being a great employee,
getting the job done,

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.111
doing the projects and so on,
then find a different job.

00:39:21.111 --> 00:39:23.360
Because you have to be able
to live by your priorities

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.450
and live for the
long term as well.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:27.040
But you know hey
when I'm taping out

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.440
a chip when I was
at Intel, now when

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.270
I'm getting ready for
earnings calls no,

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:35.760
or other big-- we have VMworld
coming up, 25,000 people.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.450
I can promise you
I will not be home

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:40.270
for dinner for a number of
nights the week beforehand.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.449
But then also balance
it by, OK, here's

00:39:42.449 --> 00:39:43.490
when I'm taking vacation.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:48.330
The first 10 years at
Intel, I took no vacation.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:50.230
Can you believe--
why I take vacation?

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.340
I love what I'm doing.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.790
Why stop?

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:53.550
It was just great.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.660
And then Linda came to
me one day and she says,

00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.240
you might not need
vacation, but your family

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.550
needs you on vacation.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:03.440
Oh.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.540
Changed my perspective entirely.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.430
It sounds so stupid
when I say it now.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:11.200
But that's-- and since then
I take every day vacation

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.300
I'm entitled to at that point,
and really making it a good.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.960
You can be on vacation
and not on vacation.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.990
But really finding ways.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.247
And hey, as a CEO it's
really hard to do this now.

00:40:21.247 --> 00:40:23.580
But honey, just giving me an
hour or two in the morning,

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.455
and then I can feel good
the rest of the day.

00:40:25.455 --> 00:40:28.130
OK, so I get up early,
clean out the inbox,

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:29.396
handle the crisis, and so on.

00:40:29.396 --> 00:40:31.270
OK, now we can have a
great day and we can go

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.530
bike riding and all the stuff.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.410
We just had a long
a 4th of July.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:37.340
So part of it is doing the job.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.860
Also, when you're
doing the job one

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.818
of the things as a
Christian that you get to do

00:40:40.818 --> 00:40:44.300
is you realize there's a
much higher purpose in mind.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.420
It changes your attitude and
perspective on everything.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:52.180
And there's-- does Google
have any interwork politics?

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.490
Any large organization does.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:56.720
But as a Christian, you
can look past that so

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.120
much more easily as well.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.860
And just say, I didn't
get the promotion.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.742
God be praised.

00:41:01.742 --> 00:41:03.450
I wasn't ready for it
for whatever reason

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:03.950
may be the case.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:04.783
I got the promotion.

00:41:04.783 --> 00:41:07.180
God be praised for it as well.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.850
And you can improve
your work attitude,

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.290
your team attitude
so much if you

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:16.000
take on that higher perspective
of what you're off to do,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.125
the lives you're off
to change and so on.

00:41:18.125 --> 00:41:20.250
I remember at one will
point in my career at Intel,

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:21.790
I was so furious.

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:23.166
I was a vice president.

00:41:23.166 --> 00:41:24.790
There was another
vice president, Mike.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.760
He got promoted to a senior
vice president before me.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.410
I mean, he was nowhere
near producing what I was.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:34.820
I was so torqued.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.120
What a criminal
injustice of the universe

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.760
that he was promoted before me.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.550
And in retrospect, hey, my
career's done just fine.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:46.950
But being able to keep that
balance to realize that,

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.030
hey, I am going to be
the best employee even

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.570
if a fundamental
injustice of the universe

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:53.640
just occurred with
that promotion.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.352
I'm just going to continue
to be doing my job,

00:41:56.352 --> 00:41:57.810
to never get caught
up in politics,

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:01.720
to absolutely be doing the
right thing for the company,

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.120
for the customer with the
highest integrity, et cetera.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.500
And of course,
sometimes you just

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.520
got to do what it takes to
get the project done as well.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.850
And that's what I mean by
being a great employee.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:13.030
And if you're great
employee, I call it

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.960
like this invisible
bank account that you're

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.010
making deposits into.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.770
Because someday stuff
happens, bad stuff happens.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:22.950
But they sort of come and look
and say, oh, no, she's great.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:24.380
She's been such a team player.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.100
She's got so many good things.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.190
You survive some of
those bad situations

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:32.250
because they will inevitably
arise at different times.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
Karen is asking,

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:38.450
do you have any specific advice
for women who are balancing

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:40.660
work, family, and faith?

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:44.290
PAT GELSINGER: Yeah,
unfortunately women

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:47.560
in technology-- it's
a terrible situation.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.990
And it begins with a lousy
raw material in the sense

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:57.690
that old 18% of incoming
technical STEM are females.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.730
I mean, that number's
got to get fixed.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:03.230
Because there's just such--
it's all male dominated,

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:06.600
and then technology is
so much more so that way.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.170
So to me, the most
important things-- and we're

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:12.280
hosting a Girls Who Code at our
campus in a couple of weeks,

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.790
and those kind of things.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.830
We really just got to get
those numbers just way up.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:19.860
It should be 50-50, right?

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.640
And we're nowhere near
that at that level.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.010
And then what happens
is females generally--

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.640
because there aren't
good role models,

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.390
there aren't good
systems to support them,

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.500
micro-inequities inside
of the environment.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.560
They generally get promoted
less, they get lower raises,

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.869
they don't have a good
role model-- statistically,

00:43:37.869 --> 00:43:38.660
it's the way it is.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.640
So we have to fight those
things very aggressively just

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.410
like any other situation.

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:44.790
We're doing things at VMware.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:47.200
I'm sure Google is doing
those things as well.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.520
But it's one of
those hard things

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.260
that's just going to take a
long time to really turn around.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:57.840
And we are starting to see
the STEM rates into STEM

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.220
fields starting to rise now.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.790
So it's an encouraging
environment that we're in.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:04.160
And obviously companies--
we have policies,

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.680
and again, I'm sure that Google
does as well-- with regard

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.610
to, often women fallout of the
technical fields in the child

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:12.140
bearing years.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.640
They drop out, they
don't come back.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.473
How can we make that
more effective for them

00:44:15.473 --> 00:44:18.500
to come back and return and
participate-- job sharing,

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.480
other things like
that to make that

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.040
more effective in that
environment-- strong mentoring

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:24.832
programs and so on.

00:44:24.832 --> 00:44:26.248
So there's a lot
of things that we

00:44:26.248 --> 00:44:27.550
need to do to make it better.

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:30.370
And obviously, for
women proper, being

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.700
able to be successful in a
male-dominated environment

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:34.690
is hard.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:36.780
And finding good
mentors, people who

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.730
are your champions
along the way are

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:40.650
some of the most
valuable things that

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.680
can be done in that respect.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.760
But we have a long, long
way to go unfortunately.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.320
I remember I was the champion
of the senior technical females

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.240
at Intel.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.940
After five years, we made
no statistical progress.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.170
None.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:58.580
After five years, we started to
move the needle on the program.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.280
And to me it was so frustrating.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.330
I don't take on projects to
not succeed after five years.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:05.500
I mean, I was
embarrassed for it.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.730
It's just slow, hard,
and deeply ingrained,

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:09.926
and takes a while
to move the needle.

00:45:09.926 --> 00:45:11.550
AUDIENCE: My question
goes to in regard

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.550
to you're mission statement.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:15.002
So at some point,
I guess you just

00:45:15.002 --> 00:45:16.960
decided that you were
taking on too many things

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.376
and so you decided to be build
up a mission statement that

00:45:19.376 --> 00:45:21.130
would affect your whole life?

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:24.560
So I guess, where do you get the
insight to build such a mission

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.530
statement?

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:27.980
PAT GELSINGER:
Yeah, for me, I got

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.870
to this period of
sort of aimlessness

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:31.580
in life which sort
of drove me to it.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.580
I wasn't sure what
I wanted to do next.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.839
I wanted to be a VP.

00:45:34.839 --> 00:45:35.880
I wanted to write a book.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.400
I did that.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.057
I got patent.

00:45:37.057 --> 00:45:38.640
It was sort of like,
OK, now that I've

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.473
sort of done the things
that I had in mind I

00:45:40.473 --> 00:45:43.004
wanted to get done, it was like
this period of aimlessness.

00:45:43.004 --> 00:45:44.670
So it's really sort
of a year of sojourn

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.310
and wandering
until I really read

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.870
a few books and other
things to get to that point.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.680
The way to write, to me--
writing a mission statement,

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.819
you can look at mine
online or in the book.

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:56.860
You could look at others.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.510
There's a few books that
talk about that subject

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:01.960
as well that might give
you other models for it.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.190
Talk with your mentors about
it, significant others, spouses,

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:09.870
et cetera, are very helpful to
help you shape the thinking.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:12.790
And writing a mission statement,
generally write down the things

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:15.680
that you have in mind,
revise it a few times,

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.420
and then stick it in the
drawer for a couple of months.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.240
And then take it out,
and look at it again.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:25.400
Is that really who you want to
be 10, 20, 30 years from now?

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.560
Tear it up, do it again.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.060
And then put it in
the drawer again.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.480
And then finally about
the third major revision,

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.730
it's probably getting
to be pretty close.

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:36.190
And then take it to mentors and
another significant influences

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:40.140
your life and say, is what
you think Pat should be?

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.170
Does this resonate with
you and who you see me

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:46.330
being, as well as what you think
I should aspire to be as well?

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:47.610
And it's a hard process.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:51.200
It took me about a year to write
the first, what I considered,

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.600
finished version of
my mission statement.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:59.290
Now I think I'm on version
6Ba, I think is what I'm on

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:00.250
or something like that.

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.900
But it hasn't
changed a whole lot

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.070
since that first version at 31.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.310
But I've revised it sort of
for the major epics of life.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:11.460
When we were in the major
child rearing years,

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.340
sort of one epic of life.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:16.590
I did a major revision after
we empty nested because that's

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:18.630
a very different phase
of life and the role

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:19.520
that you're in there.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.960
And I think sort of
as you go into sort

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.550
of the twilight
years of your career

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.467
may be the next epic as well.

00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:26.050
But as you write it,
it should be good

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:29.480
for, like, the next 10
or 20 years of your life,

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.210
and as the things
you want to get done.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.610
And maybe some
short-term agendas.

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.650
I want to exercise
this many days a week,

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.512
or stuff like that.

00:47:36.512 --> 00:47:38.470
But some also sort of
saying, hey, in 10 years,

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.132
where do you want
your career to be?

00:47:40.132 --> 00:47:41.090
What do you want to be?

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:44.050
And then what are you doing
today to help you get there?

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:45.550
What are you doing
right now to help

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:47.390
you prepare for
those next major jobs

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.149
that you would want in
your career in the future?

00:47:50.149 --> 00:47:51.690
And if you're not
doing those things,

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:53.990
then that's really not
what you want to do.

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.670
You're kidding yourself if
you can start pointing it back

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:59.524
to things you're really
underway today with.

00:47:59.524 --> 00:48:01.190
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned several times

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:04.030
about work and ego
being very aligned.

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:08.380
And I was wondering if you have
any thoughts on, rather than

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.840
individual responsibility
for that decision,

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.790
if you have any thoughts
on kind of pushing

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:15.850
from the top of the
company in changing

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:18.590
the culture around work?

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.640
PAT GELSINGER: Well, a
handful of thoughts there.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:25.860
Because clearly, if I
look at my job as CEO now,

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.880
how successful do I
want VMware to be?

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.090
Very successful.

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:33.130
But we've also been
very thoughtful.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:35.400
And let me just-- I
think I have them here.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.740
These are the VMware values.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.006
And also saying,
these are the values--

00:48:47.006 --> 00:48:48.380
it's not just
about projects that

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.050
were getting done-- but we say,
execution, passion, integrity,

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:53.852
customer, and community.

00:48:53.852 --> 00:48:55.060
And we talk a lot about that.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:59.600
And then the community It's not
just the social community we're

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.260
in, but also the community
of our people, the employees,

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.110
and the families as well.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.650
So we clearly
emphasize that as part

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:09.190
of the values of
our company as well.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:10.940
And yeah, we got
projects to get done,

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.960
we have schedules
to keep and so on.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.522
But we do a lot.

00:49:14.522 --> 00:49:16.230
And my role-- I mean,
we help to do this.

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:19.450
We're an epic company, with epic
values, with epic customers,

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:20.930
with epic products.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:24.180
CRM The whole thing works
pretty nicely that way.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.890
But clearly, I mean like
we have-- on our campus

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:29.600
we hold a Halloween celebration.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.130
This last year we had
Ariana Grande as our singer

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:35.210
for-- we had, I
think, 6,000 people

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:38.220
on campus for our
Halloween celebration.

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.840
4,000 of them, or
5,000 kids-- can you

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.730
imagine 5,000 sugar
infested, crazy

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:46.000
dressed kids running around?

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.780
I mean, it was chaos.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.232
But again, it's reinforcing
the family, the balance.

00:49:50.232 --> 00:49:52.690
And again, I know Google does
those kind of things as well.

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.160
But clearly, I got to
reinforce it from the top,

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.270
otherwise we turn into
a sweatshop as well.

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:01.980
And we're here for the long term
to build families, communities,

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.780
relationships for the long term.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.820
And a lot I do, as I
reinforce these values, it's

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.910
critical to reinforce
that from the top

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:10.787
even as bottoms-up
decisions are made.

00:50:10.787 --> 00:50:13.120
And every once in a while,
yep, I'm going to come to you

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.426
and say, sorry, I need
to work this weekend.

00:50:16.426 --> 00:50:18.050
But then I have to
be able to also say,

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:19.960
and maybe at the
end of the month,

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.700
you need to take a few extra
days off, and balance as well.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.410
And creating a culture
that allows that to occur.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:28.180
I just had dinner last
night with one of our guys,

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.350
and we gave him what
we call a take three.

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:32.480
We give people the opportunity
after so many years

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.990
of service to take three
months to go do something else.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:37.690
And that could be nothing.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:39.760
And in his case, he's
been bike riding.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.880
He says he does a three-hour
bike ride every day.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.290
He's lost 20 pounds.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:46.250
And he just had done a big
vSphere release for us.

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.740
And he says, I just
needed a break.

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:51.430
And he was so grateful just
to give him that chance

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:54.020
to reset everything.

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.910
And we're talking
about what project

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.810
he's going to do as he
re-enters the company and so on.

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:00.540
So it really is
that mix of things

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.960
of working hard, being
proud of what you do,

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.677
passionate for the projects.

00:51:04.677 --> 00:51:07.010
But also saying, yeah, we
have to keep things in balance

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:10.030
because my grandkids
are way more important

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.907
than the next earnings
call for a VMware.

00:51:12.907 --> 00:51:14.490
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you to go

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:16.799
into more detail in
that period of your life

00:51:16.799 --> 00:51:18.590
where you're trying to
grow as a Christian?

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:20.631
Because you said you were,
like a baby Christian,

00:51:20.631 --> 00:51:25.020
and then you were working
long hours, building a family,

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.057
going to school.

00:51:26.057 --> 00:51:27.140
PAT GELSINGER: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:31.320
Yeah, and it was, at
that point in my life,

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:34.330
it was just this
frenetic period.

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:37.150
And I'm growing as a Christian,
and trying to figure out

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:38.839
what that was like.

00:51:38.839 --> 00:51:41.130
At the various-- soon after
I became a Christian-- just

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:42.490
tell you a little story.

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:43.960
I walking down the
halls of Intel.

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.482
This was like a week after
I became a Christian.

00:51:46.482 --> 00:51:48.440
And this guy comes up to
me, and you could tell

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.740
he was sort of checking me out.

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.470
And I couldn't quite--
didn't know him at all.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.710
And he comes up, and
he says, hi, I'm Bob.

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:55.852
Are you Pat?

00:51:55.852 --> 00:51:56.560
And I said, yeah.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.080
Again, this is sort of weird.

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.255
And he says, God told me
I should be your roommate.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.800
God's talking to you about me?

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:10.570
I mean, we became roommates for
the couple of years until Linda

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:12.770
and I got married.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:14.920
And I'll just tell
you, he was just

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.590
this perfect, mature
Christian that

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.080
sort of helped lead me through
some of those early phases.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.530
He was like the first
spiritual mentor

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:26.870
I had in my life-- people
helping you in those.

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:29.040
After Linda and I
got married, we've

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.030
had Bible studies
in our home now

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:33.260
for probably 25 of
the last 30 years

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.800
that I've been leading us well.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.900
The best way you want
to mature as a Christian

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.920
is to teach other people.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.430
And that's one for me,
I find that to be very

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:43.370
challenging in that respect.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:46.630
And that journey as
you're going through it,

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:49.440
good church, good leaders,
good teaching, spending

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:53.470
time in the Bible and prayer
yourself-- all those things--

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:58.260
just the good diet of a
young Christian experience.

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:02.520
But my case, Bob was extremely
critical and influential

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.460
in those early Christian years.

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.020
And I think everybody
in that phase of life

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.880
need that kind of
influence for it as well.

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.694
So hey, I am so grateful to be
able to spend time with you.

00:53:12.694 --> 00:53:14.610
I'll be hanging around
a little bit afterward.

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:16.157
And I'd love to chat some more.

00:53:16.157 --> 00:53:16.990
Thank you very much.

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:18.840
God bless. [APPLAUSE]
