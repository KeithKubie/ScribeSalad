00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:12.490
 Yes My name is Kon'nichiwaetto google the wait for home android today 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.969
 With the title of app ui ux design thing beginning 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.509
 I would like to talk about the user interface design of the android app 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:23.529
 I think again I am google android where 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.810
 I'm in charge of development and ok. 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.609
 Ok 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:35.000
 Thank you in advance. Thank you in advance. 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:40.880
 By the way, juniors have also started, but it is 8 today 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.550
 It's about ui ux about android apps 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:51.890
 In concrete terms, on making the app of Ekko 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:55.020
 App that is easy to use at the moment of the user 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.710
 Well if you can on ux ui 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.480
 In the place where why there is a bit dug today and say 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.190
 Let's talk about what kind of android ui is today 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:13.330
 It sounds like a banna 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:14.620
 The attraction of the terminal itself is very directly linked to the attraction of the app. 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.380
 Already each other 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:25.000
 I think that there is a deep relationship between each other and one egg in that house 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.180
 If you are making a look, you can make an app or order an app 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.230
 Are good 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:35.450
 I think there are many people you say, so by all means 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:37.090
 I would like to offer a nice ui in the app. 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.170
 Please 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:47.340
 I can see the slide right now 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:53.770
 There is a recommendation or something not recommended ui ux while sliding 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:57.080
 Specifically, it's hard to use, but it's an app that's hard to use but it's ui. 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.610
 I feel like there is a lot of saying 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.750
 I think I'm writing, but it seems to be like vertical scrolling correction like the web 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.830
 There is 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.340
 It's all about it here, isn't it? 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.540
 To scroll 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:16.980
 I'm not asking for much as an app experience, but this is hmmm 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:23.900
 That's right 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:28.790
 Vertical scrolling is a natural experience with the web 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:34.370
 In the case of an app, for example, well this is not limited to android 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:39.829
 That application that is operation to switch various screens or button 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:43.549
 The ui element that is necessary to use is almost nothing if the pad launches the app 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.890
 One idea that it should be displayed without touching 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.290
 strong 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.620
 I think so much 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:53.850
 Among them, for example, important buttons and important menus 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.319
 It will not come out without scrolling 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.849
 That is fine 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:06.889
 Well, it's a bit painful as an app experience 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.950
 There are so many users who are frustrated by that 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:14.410
 I think 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:20.110
 It seems that the reverse is also good in the last web, so you download that until you eat that capacity 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:22.450
 It's also a story like I guess it's okay with the last f, that's all that recently 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.819
 I see it in the Google Play 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.049
 Kana- 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.489
 I do not want to download it on the web because I have this 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.799
 Say that 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:39.840
 The voice of the user is also actually seen, so here is the app rally 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:42.200
 App citing app ui ux 3 c I would like to ask for your consideration 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.200
 say 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:54.030
 So there is also a part that specifically what to expect from the app 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.540
 First of all, what is called as roid of android as a base 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.870
 There 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:04.769
 It seems like a cloud crane where you want to talk about something 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.769
 Rice very much 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:14.860
 There are various ways to say ui base and that 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:21.130
 It's great 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:24.730
 It is distinctive that u &amp; Wade have 3 buttons at the bottom. 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:31.210
 Thank you for speaking from long rain 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:34.880
 A Building First That First And Then That Android's Os Bath Scene That That 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:39.680
 android design guide and a little more choker 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:43.160
 I would like to introduce you a little smoother about the general theory of broadening my legs 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.860
 Well then it looks like the design of os 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.750
 Hmmm 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.750
 Seems to introduce you 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:59.080
 It looks like it looks like 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.940
 That first android is that May 2010 &amp; Rooney try offers 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.850
 Since it was started 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:09.820
 It is android 2.3 woman char plate in December, 2010 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:12.060
 Android 3 on February 22, 2011 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:19.980
 This is Haniko 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:25.410
 Is the first of the biggest changes in this Android 3 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.010
 This is a very big development point in the sense of the evolution of ui 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.260
 was 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:32.050
 What happened at this time? The follow theme and the action bar 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.050
 Standard a 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.319
 pi 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:45.800
 It's just about this Android 3 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:49.610
 It was provided as a tablet-only OS, so it was relatively popular among many 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:53.569
 I think I did not have the opportunity to touch 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:58.639
 Android 4 in October 2011 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:06:05.599
 Ice cream sandwich It is announced that this is that big mobile 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:07.370
 It has the meaning of integrating os and tablet os. 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.630
 It is a in the middle 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:15.480
 Yeah it looks like the picture below 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:16.960
 That's the movie ice cream sandwich ui under that middle right now at this time 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.370
 This is the first time 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:27.639
 Well the theme "follow" started to be offered anew on android 3 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:30.160
 It is a state of visual with a little futuristic atmosphere, but this is a mobile phone 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:34.000
 Now also be provided 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.950
 That android 4 points 1 in June 2012 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.910
 We announced Julie flight, but this is the whole inside 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:45.950
 Ring and this nexus 7 announcement 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:53.840
 The announcement of a tablet device has a big meaning, but the basic ui's 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:56.969
 Please understand that the way of thinking has not changed much with the ics era. 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:00.770
 I think it is necessary to wish 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:05.330
 It is all right specifically 8 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:11.630
 The current distribution of os was just during the slide, right? 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:17.770
 Still the main is the distribution of 2.3 Una 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:24.729
 Well so 2.3 is now 60% This is the figure as of August 1 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:27.879
 On the other hand, 4.0 or more is growing so rapidly that as of August 1st 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:32.200
 16.7% of global tactics 

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:35.740
 Would be the numbers 4.0 and 4.1 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:43.810
 On the other hand, 2.2 is gradually decreasing gradually 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:44.170
 2.1 So 2.1 or less is that global at 4.9% is the current figure 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:50.200
 is 

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:52.190
 Because it is the situation that 2.22 is decreasing at 15.5% 

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:58.190
 It looks like 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:59.510
 When you design that love to the public in general, you will be conscious of that type 2 truly 

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:05.810
 I need to 

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:06.630
 It seems like it would be nice to have an application based on the 4 types of basics 

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.889
 think 

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:13.530
 Says 

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:20.760
 On the other hand, it's almost time for this 2.1 and 3. 

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:28.620
 I think so I think the situation is so minor as soon as it is less 

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:29.490
 Yes, children's unrolled design guidelines were released in January 2012 

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:36.000
 Was 

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:39.150
 Here are various standard ui ux of android os 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.750
 Because the way of thinking is described 

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.630
 If you haven't seen it yet 

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:49.900
 Someone see this by all means 

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:52.120
 It seems that there is a way of thinking as a Japanese-like android communication 

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:57.880
 Well that's this 

00:08:52.120 --> 00:09:03.040
 Whenever I design an app with no limitation to that android 

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:08.180
 Interaction design, etc. Navigation of various operations of the user 

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:12.520
 It is very important how to design it 

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:17.059
 Starting from the basic idea of ​​this android 

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:21.289
 It's a big ui pattern navigation 

00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:22.729
 At the same time with such popular patterns Ann and various swipe views 

00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:27.649
 I want to be visual 

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:33.949
 For example, a pin to indicate how this appearance should be, but to apply an icon brother gradation 

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:37.050
 Some kind of kind of joy Various guidelines are provided in such details. 

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:42.660
 It seems to be various materials at the same time being done 

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:47.740
 Because you can download it for free, by all means there are always 3 types after this site 

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:53.200
 What kind of action part you've met in a while 

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:54.130
 It seems to be how to use the khan action bar and the expected behavior with the bag button 

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.390
 It is said that 

00:09:54.130 --> 00:10:01.880
 It is true that there is actually written in 

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:06.560
 I have spent time on the screen now 

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:10.140
 Well this is the new funeral of android design guidelines 

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.529
 Yes you are becoming a jelly bean 

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.520
 so 

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:17.360
 For example, here 

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:22.760
 Action part 

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.209
 There is an item to say, and here the application bar is like this in the first place 

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.930
 When 

00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:29.570
 so 

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:32.480
 Let's go along with the frets and mons that have changed in various ways depending on the orientation of the screen 

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:38.420
 I will do it while designing 

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:41.379
 It is explained that at the same time this application structure 

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:45.999
 Is a common app positive 

00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:50.700
 If various architectures will surely be this way then 

00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:57.570
 The approximate guidelines for let's express are described here too 

00:10:50.700 --> 00:11:02.370
 I think this is a very confident and worthwhile content to choose, so by all means 

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:07.470
 It's pretty weird if you can see through it, google offers 

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:14.100
 The application you are doing has the guidelines as described here 

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:17.040
 It seems that it follows that all of Google's apps are made now according to these guidelines. 

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.700
 Google plus firmly youtube gmail 

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.490
 Tightly 

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:29.779
 google maps It seems like you play well Prime 

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:35.480
 On the other hand, make your own design that is too far from this guideline 

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:38.259
 The situation that the user is confused will increase from now on, so why is that? 

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:42.069
 Is it confused? Os 

00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:46.720
 While using the app of 

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:49.749
 It is google play that was the level until it is the app and the app that you are familiar with until now 

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:54.160
 I think I would like to use other applications 

00:11:49.749 --> 00:11:57.549
 Because it will be lost if it is completely different when it will be a third party application 

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.279
 That's right, that's why 

00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:03.860
 os 

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:04.150
 I think that there are many places where one volume should have a volume for a dog and an app experience. 

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:10.870
 so 

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:16.450
 As a result, while the user is less confused while referring to this, it is 

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:22.060
 For example, if there is a sky leading to high evaluation in Google Play 

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:24.140
 It is highly rated as high as it has finished with 4 egg-shaped top total wrestlings, ie in Google Play 

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.010
 Kamibayashi ranking 

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:31.550
 Can go 

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:36.089
 I think that there are merits of love, please by all means 3 years old 

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:40.920
 Yes it sounds so right 

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:45.569
 Let's go with work that time is limited so much 

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:47.990
 Well I can't talk a lot too much 

00:12:45.569 --> 00:12:47.990
 I mean 

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.540
 Indoor slurry 

00:12:54.810 --> 00:13:04.800
 Oh, well, that generally 

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:06.330
 Various categories of ui design such as ui design are in the world 

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.660
 I think it exists 

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:13.160
 pc desktop gui design 

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:20.629
 This dates back to about 1973 

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:22.880
 The story is then the design of general web ui ux until this is around 93 

00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:25.340
 Began to evolve from 

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.910
 I think it's a ui story 

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:35.090
 And followed by mobile web and mobile apps 

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:41.290
 In 1999, when I started to evolve almost at the same time, 

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:46.149
 i-mode It's time when the service began to come 

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:50.949
 Well Aichi body mail based web ui and its java based mobile 

00:13:46.149 --> 00:13:52.270
 It seems that the evolution of the app ui has started especially in Japan 

00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:58.840
 To be 

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:59.270
 I have these I have traced different evolution until now but one big one 

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:05.960
 this 

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:06.860
 I understand that there is a difference between border web and apps 

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.270
 not to mention 

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:13.310
 In the case of that web this is common where platform os was here 

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:16.850
 Experience is expected 

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:19.290
 On the other hand if it's an app 

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:21.660
 Users per platform 

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:25.830
 expect 

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:32.100
 Oh yeah, today is the co-investigator different? 

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:37.890
 I say five times in a word, in that sense that mobile app is 

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:40.930
 I wonder if that tax and pc are close to the app on the curtain desktop 

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.940
 So i understand 

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:46.480
 Is 

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:50.800
 The story that this later says 

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:53.830
 I want to touch the same as the sentence 

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:59.800
 The google love that took place the other day 

00:14:53.830 --> 00:15:02.960
 It is announcement of June Yes about this basic way of thinking among these 

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:06.980
 That has been touched for quite some time 

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:12.560
 So I would like to introduce you to the flight 

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:14.570
 So this is the slide on the screen right now android design 

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.860
 for success 

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:21.110
 Presentation 

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:24.529
 It's especially up, isn't it? 

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:32.600
 Not only that you say Lloyd 

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:35.880
 The idea including the Babe is already told to the very first one, so one right upper right 

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.430
 I'm participatory I'm out of this 

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.030
 Hmm 

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.120
 here 

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.520
 That being said 

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:47.170
 First of all, the app is 

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:55.510
 Whether it is convenient or not 

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:56.080
 The talk of good navigation is a story that is more fundamental than the story of the brand 

00:15:55.510 --> 00:16:01.540
 When 

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:02.510
 Well, there is a side that orders the app that there is a common failure 

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:08.690
 That brand 

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:13.640
 Please express in this way If you order, especially in the basic part 

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:15.970
 It seems that it seems like you put the com function which is often not detailed 

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:20.230
 So if i get on 

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:25.660
 I'll accept that for cleaning purposes 

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:30.100
 That's exactly what that developer or production person is 

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:35.990
 Only branding, ignoring the platform altogether 

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:40.270
 Or you can reproduce only yesterday's list faithfully or often it is faithfully reproduced 

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:44.770
 It is often a disappointing result 

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:50.770
 It is an important idea to avoid it 

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:52.660
 It is explained in the session of io, so you can refer to it by all means 

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:56.590
 The session of 

00:16:52.660 --> 00:17:00.259
 The side who is inside is angry or ordering 

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:04.760
 If you actually make an app that you make it look better 

00:17:00.259 --> 00:17:08.120
 That's more about making comfort women's applications 

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:14.029
 It's all about being connected to good quality, isn't it? 

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:17.539
 Going ships with punks if I raise some of my hand here 

00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:23.140
 of Check 2 &amp; Action Without 

00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:24.120
 The title slide is introduced and what does this mean? 

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:28.020
 that 

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:31.380
 What are the big objects offered to the user 

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:38.640
 What is the action associated with each object in 

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:44.110
 In what would be the relationship of those objects in this very abstract level analysis 

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:47.980
 It is the first easy-to-understand navigation through such analysis 

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:51.790
 It seems to be easy to understand. 

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:57.280
 That kind of basic that 

00:17:51.790 --> 00:18:02.900
 In this session of the google io guidance app design as an example 

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:07.220
 I think that you can refer to it by all means because I explain that 

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:11.840
 And in the second navigation Androider this is standard on android 

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:17.780
 It is the story of the upload turn or the up button 

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:19.040
 In fact, it is always said that the back button of android is linked to the application 

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.049
 Nice fast man 

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:27.679
 I will do it too 

00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:32.179
 That's especially easy to forget if you're new to knitting on android. 

00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:37.850
 The back button is standardly passed on all terminals 

00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:41.070
 That back in the original screen and say that back and Khan special 

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:43.350
 I'm wrestling but I'm sorry I'm sorry 

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:49.320
 That's right 

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:52.740
 It is often redundant and the back button and the button on the back screen have different movements 

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:55.480
 Because it is very confusing 

00:18:52.740 --> 00:19:01.510
 The basics of that kind of navigation 

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:06.550
 I think that you could get an understanding of the topic in these sessions. 

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:07.870
 And at the same time I would like to introduce another one of these 10 things games 

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:11.740
 Developer and Season 

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:15.470
 This water session is towards the protection of the game pulley 

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:17.920
 The session that I applied to the table is a stand at ui ux 

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:24.460
 It is use that is back button 

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:28.960
 In the case of the floor button line game of that game, how should I cope with the back button? 

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:32.240
 It was difficult for all the children to come by the scene. 

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:36.140
 That return book somehow 

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:40.460
 If there is nothing wrong with it, there is something like that, but there is a dialog 

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:42.860
 It seems to meet what kind of joint when back button is pushed when coming up 

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:47.330
 There are places where you are quite concerned 

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:50.690
 Well, for example, while playing the game, it was a shooting game 

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:52.230
 Well what should happen if you press the back button 

00:19:50.690 --> 00:20:00.480
 That my fear 

00:19:52.230 --> 00:20:10.169
 Good if it was Gudoo Pattern 4 day or add 

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:12.250
 I wonder if the game will be over Guda I wonder if it had dried up in this session 

00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:13.460
 You can press the back button twice 

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:17.960
 On this 

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:21.260
 In the middle of the game, press the back button in the middle of the game, get something out of the pack and try the bag again 

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.410
 If you defeat, you should probably return to the game 

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:28.110
 Back 

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:30.130
 The right brain seems to cancel the dial again in the bag, that is to say back to the name 

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:35.290
 I agree 

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:36.340
 Hmmm I'm talking about it, for example, it is the same as the end, but it is wrong if I press it twice 

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:39.460
 It looks like 

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:44.590
 I will throw it when finished 

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:47.010
 Oh, oh, I think that the game player would rather cry 

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:51.060
 Of 

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:55.980
 Well that depending on the genre of that game 

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:58.080
 Or expected depending on which screen and scene in the game the user is 

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:03.750
 I think it will change jointly but 

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:07.030
 There are a lot of ways to end the game without thinking about anything. 

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:08.510
 It is Potch that Japanese movie number 0 par is made 

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:12.380
 And spoon 

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:13.830
 Is it OK to finish the game? 

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.340
 Come 

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:18.750
 Yeah, with a painted man without going back 

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:23.880
 that 

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:25.920
 With the back button standard back button, users will have it with certain expectations 

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:31.910
 I often use it 

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:38.050
 Even if it is in the game, it returns to the previous screen as much as possible 

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:38.050
 I think you can say that you can express the feeling of operation Yes 

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:45.780
 why 

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.780
 2 eh 

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:55.799
 Yes, that's the one from here that moves 

00:21:51.389 --> 00:21:57.049
 I want to love some jumpy villagers introduced in android design 

00:21:55.799 --> 00:22:03.590
 I think 

00:21:57.049 --> 00:22:06.860
 First action bar This ui is so important that you must understand it 

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:09.220
 So the display on the screen is basic 

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:14.169
 Is 

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:21.039
 Need to be combined with the tab with letters Why this can be combined with the tab here 

00:22:14.169 --> 00:22:24.580
 If you say important, there are people who want to put tabs at the bottom of the screen 

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:29.210
 There are a lot of by buttons b will be passed side by side 

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:33.710
 If you try to press a button, you can play Mac 

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:37.620
 I have pressed the General Affairs button when I pressed the button, and there is art &amp; Kun 

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:43.200
 That's right that kind of that 

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:45.299
 It also means to avoid mistakes. 

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:48.470
 I agree 

00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:53.390
 How should I explain high school 

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:55.420
 Basically in Android and standard ui is on the screen 

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:58.930
 Or to the left 

00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:01.850
 The navigation of the main Alcyon 

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:05.799
 Navigation is the transition of the screen 

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:07.100
 At the right end of the screen or below 

00:23:05.799 --> 00:23:10.370
 action 

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:13.170
 The action of putting is what it means to execute a command 

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:16.680
 Navigation left 

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:24.660
 Top or left and the action was to see or 

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:29.550
 The principle is that many of Google's apps are designed to 

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:33.159
 There is a tab, so it is a bit different from the standard that this navigation was done 

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:36.159
 So it's a confusing first 

00:23:33.159 --> 00:23:40.509
 It's easy to be easy 

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:46.269
 I have said that I made a mistake from Yoshitsune and I have to say 

00:23:40.509 --> 00:23:52.000
 At the same time this android has terminals of various screen sizes 

00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:57.220
 The arrangement of the buttons is a killer that is difficult to respond to changes in screen size 

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.820
 If the screen gets bigger, maybe a little small button in the group after all 

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.500
 And 

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:05.910
 Because of the cost of production cost 

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:09.990
 Make another child's child with another one's crawl 

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:15.480
 Porting android If you talk about things like that would be more 

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:18.210
 I'll listen to it so often I won't wake up or talk other than navigation 

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:21.610
 I often encounter you 

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:28.570
 So this is already from the beginning 

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:31.000
 It is not a story that makes a big difference if you consider it at the planning stage. 

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:37.450
 I think so by all means &amp; Ruud 

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:41.600
 I almost want to use the tab bar for the Rabi processing experience 

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:45.740
 4 s navigation on top of each s 

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:47.929
 Standard tab scroll scroller this is google play 

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:51.590
 It is used 

00:24:47.929 --> 00:24:55.549
 Each tab evaluation and fade out to the left and right respectively 

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:58.500
 Ruskin is yes Nest expresses what can be done 

00:24:55.549 --> 00:25:03.330
 Insurance such as leaf vegetables that become such expression 

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:07.470
 The difference between debug taps is that this is repeated, but back is small 

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:14.190
 Back means back in time series 

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:15.810
 In the up indicates the left end of the action bar earlier This is logical turn up and 

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:20.340
 It means that 

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:23.790
 Well, that's what I'm saying is bag backup up again and again and again 

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:30.660
 Confused app hides you in the middle of the night 

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:32.250
 Unfortunately there is a situation to say here, and by all means refer to these guidelines by all means 

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.800
 Easy to understand 

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:38.410
 You can see the navigation that seems like an android 

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:40.300
 I love you 

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.710
 And 

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:46.390
 fragment 

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:47.440
 Oh this is the name of api but basically it's an android app 

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:51.549
 That 

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:55.840
 It is a tablet or a portable terminal 

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:59.770
 One apk as possible even if that screen size is large 

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.700
 Recommended to be provided 

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:05.059
 The technique that can be used for that 

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:08.690
 One is that it is a fragment 

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:13.940
 From now on we are google or that or 

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:16.659
 Not only google, but various terminal makers are more and more wonderful tablet terminals 

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:21.149
 As we are going to put out 

00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:26.399
 Make it look cool on such new terminals 

00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:28.419
 Please take care of these changes in screen size or tapio 

00:26:26.399 --> 00:26:30.679
 I want to ask 

00:26:28.419 --> 00:26:34.850
 I think yes 

00:26:30.679 --> 00:26:39.140
 The topic of angled design continues in, but list cure 

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:44.990
 I see it often, but the color list expression is that this 

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:50.580
 In the case of the standard expression of android, please reduce the hardship as much as possible. 

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:53.320
 And instead of using lots of hardships, border farmers use space well 

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.170
 Please express beautifully 

00:26:53.320 --> 00:27:00.210
 Is 

00:26:55.170 --> 00:27:02.340
 Another important thing is that the repetition of the media mark is so much android 

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:06.540
 Not recommended 

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:09.270
 They are very popular with their friends and com 

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:12.600
 Because it is also a redundant expression, this is 

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:18.990
 It has not been adopted by android os anymore 

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:22.440
 But of course that part of it is definitely part of me I just want you to see Taylor's highlight show 

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:26.809
 Of course there is no problem when I want to emphasize 

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:29.840
 Ummm, those who lined up with cranes are already 

00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:32.490
 If you're all passionate 

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:36.300
 It means there will be no meaning 

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:38.370
 It is a guideline of that rock 

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:44.250
 Yes and 

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:45.920
 icon icon This app's inside app and talk of that action bar 

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:50.030
 Leftmost icon 

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:55.430
 It is a little exception that after all pillar is icon of application 

00:27:50.030 --> 00:28:01.370
 Well, the left end of that action bar is an important icon that expresses the brand 

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:04.490
 Therefore, it is recommended that you put that color or gradation good here 

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:05.940
 It is an icon other than that 

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:11.039
 Aiko of the general president 

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:16.830
 The icon that appeared on the right side of the action bar was flat already 

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:18.559
 We recommend that you design with no gradation or no shading 

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:23.179
 Is out 

00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:28.399
 This is also the material, so the design seems so 

00:28:23.179 --> 00:28:35.509
 You can download this address Abe Residue or Tang San Aya for free and so this material 

00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:36.980
 Please take advantage of the availability as it is. 

00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:38.550
 As it is until bitmap 

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.659
 Bring up to pixels 

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:43.049
 Please do not 

00:28:40.659 --> 00:28:43.049
 And 

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:50.950
 This is true without the icon on that imme screen 

00:28:48.679 --> 00:28:50.950
 that 

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:58.610
 That home screen comes back with various wallpapers or black it r android live 

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:05.150
 I'm taking a wallpaper-like Kon 

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:10.490
 A wall like a wall What kind of money will you like? 

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:15.770
 Please make sure the phone screen is not recessed for easy viewing 

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:17.630
 And if you say that this is not necessarily that you should use this color 

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:22.640
 There is no 

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:26.300
 Generally two types of android follow that hollow follow yarn 

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:33.320
 It seems that two are using this as rice bran color 

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:37.620
 That Google app is all about design based on this 

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.690
 It is not necessary to match the color with this, but such 

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:43.100
 Food 

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:47.470
 It is better if you give some reference to the nuances of 

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:50.490
 Well yes google app os from the standard app 

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:57.900
 In that now numbered app 

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:59.350
 Even if the screen is lined, the user can operate smoother 

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:05.230
 I wonder what 

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:08.530
 And there is a lot of use in the address is sitting swipe view ui 

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:11.260
 Well this is that in Google Play 

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:18.850
 It is ranking or that 

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:24.130
 Various list displays are divided into various parts and displayed on the left and right 

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:25.480
 Tabs fade out to the left or right to indicate that you can wrap 

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:30.850
 Follow 

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:31.809
 I'm connected to the previous story, but that's right, I'll swipe to the button side of the taboo 

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:38.110
 One is 

00:30:31.809 --> 00:30:42.410
 I could save a lot of areas as an area of ​​a lot and I could draw a lot of the actual content 

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:47.240
 Well, I guess that's a lot of confusion 

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:52.180
 Well that's right, the way of this child is very 

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.180
 It is intuitively easy for users to understand 

00:30:53.030 --> 00:31:02.300
 Because it is also a very smart phone-like expression 

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:06.400
 Please use the tab swipe to make the most of it. App-like 

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.400
 It will be something else, while using this 

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:19.720
 And I would like to touch on the home screen expression of the app a little 

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:21.660
 It's quite recent now or until a while ago, just a feature icon on the app's home screen 

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:26.940
 Only with 

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:32.820
 There was a sound screen so often and this is an example of the upper left in the slide 

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:34.509
 Ueno as soon as the old version of Google Plus is launched is the screen or not 

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:38.470
 I agree 

00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:42.820
 In 8 it is 

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:46.050
 It is the home of the version scale version of Wright Tin 

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:49.110
 Well of the action bar on the top left of the screen 

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:53.970
 If you tap the up icon Yes 

00:31:49.110 --> 00:32:00.360
 In the form that the navigation menu comes out there 

00:31:53.970 --> 00:32:04.680
 Well Google + youtube has been changed, so even other companies' apps 

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:09.600
 Here in the lower right is the unusual issue evernote Yes Yes Yes I'm an application 

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:13.960
 That's more than just icons 

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:18.360
 In other words, if there is something feed on the right end 

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:23.580
 And that so-called book screen went back a bit 

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:29.430
 It looks like fun and it sounds like you played it, and the icons are lined up there 

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:33.780
 It seems that Spanish content is good from a bright Lotte. 

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:34.820
 Of course there is no need to see the back button back button 

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:40.970
 that 

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:43.669
 It seems like this is what kind of application this screen is, and many users 

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:48.450
 Because it is the first screen to see 

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:51.100
 I want you to express it on the home screen of the most wonderful moment 

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:53.720
 I think yes 

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:59.150
 And it's worth it 

00:32:53.720 --> 00:33:01.580
 2 That's about it This is a guide in the sense that please avoid the complaint of 

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:05.030
 The noisy one is ng 

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.770
 It's not an art when it's side by side with health 

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.210
 That this is 

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.600
 Really this 

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:13.320
 that 

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:17.100
 Well annoying app is disliked in the first place disliked by the user 

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:20.160
 Do you notice it will be one that gets installed 

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:25.900
 Well that's fine but 

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:30.190
 Please ask this to be available for dreams that day or heights 

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:34.520
 That's why I briefly introduced the topic from that android design 

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:36.770
 It is point, but to here that 

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:41.540
 I agree 

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:46.580
 Well what a nice app or something like that for making an android-like app 

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:51.070
 It is said that it is easy to become a better app if careful tips 

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.070
 It seems that you have been introduced 

00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:56.669
 There 

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:58.610
 Where should I pay particular attention 

00:33:56.669 --> 00:34:01.520
 Oh dear 

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:06.560
 As a ward, there is a button to go back 

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:07.730
 If you say that kana boon overwhelming is an app with many scrolls 

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:12.050
 Is 

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:15.340
 Usually I am quite as a user 

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:18.280
 It will be my mother because 

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:22.960
 I'm tired after all. 

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:25.319
 I think it's kind of hard if you have to go to the bottom of the button 

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:28.739
 Yummy 

00:34:25.319 --> 00:34:33.330
 Soft or increase quite pat 3 p app 

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:38.010
 It is fine that I said that Pattern 3 was something different 

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:40.680
 If you look at the app quite, there are also things that have changed, and that two 

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:45.900
 I think that it occupies a quite big place 

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:49.440
 I will say that I will make a back button and create it, so today is a topic in particular. 

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:53.319
 Without sharing the app other than that game 

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:56.940
 I'm mainly introducing the game app 

00:34:53.319 --> 00:35:04.500
 Do you think there will be the next time mainly with case and not 

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:10.710
 The game also has a bit of a view of the world 

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:16.030
 I think it is necessary to come along with its own unique view of the world or ui 

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:19.270
 In the case of games, those guidelines can apply a little 

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:25.300
 I think if there are a lot of missing phases 

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:28.870
 Just like that, for example, the button is too small. 

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:33.790
 I'm very free about the game just put on 

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:36.190
 ui I think it's interesting to have a cold, but I'm back button 

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:39.580
 Is his son while 

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:44.980
 I would like you to come to the game screen 

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:45.910
 Yes I want a vertical scroll is a bit more painful if you go back even in the game 

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.240
 Yes 

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:52.759
 By all means 

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:56.029
 On the other hand in general tool-based app sa mace-based communication app 

00:35:52.759 --> 00:36:00.740
 The more you use these everyday apps, the better 

00:35:56.029 --> 00:36:06.500
 Since it is very important if it is easy to operate after introducing it today, it is very important. 

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:08.210
 That I am not a particular ui expert in particular 

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:14.750
 Android design 

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:20.730
 Or it goes back more than that-It has been cultivated from the age of pc web 

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:25.920
 As a professional who already has the know-how of so-called various ui design 

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:26.580
 I think there are many people in the world who can express properly, so it is ordered 

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:32.490
 When 

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:33.810
 When you order an app, or when you are considering developing it yourself 

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:39.070
 I agree 

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:43.670
 If the professional is the designer If the professional designer is closer 

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:46.470
 Let's recommend that you work well together 

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:51.869
 It looks good if you have Ryokane 

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:53.970
 The time has been lost for a long time, but now I have it in my knees, in the form of questions and answers 

00:36:51.869 --> 00:37:00.330
 Asked questions move 

00:36:53.970 --> 00:37:03.420
 I'm answering a few places where time is not a failure East can answer Yes I will read ah 

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:08.190
 Thank you brothers and sisters, thank you also to Limes 

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:09.880
 Teach me some notes on migrating ui created in ics environment to jelly bean 

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:15.670
 please 

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:16.990
 Even if you use the api configuration with nothing to go away in the future or something a bit unrecommended 

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:19.030
 Action is possible 

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:21.860
 Yes 

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:23.490
 How is this? 

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:27.960
 Wintering 

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:34.980
 For ui created in the ics environment that 

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:36.020
 It is almost the same time, and if you are able to know the Mariko to Pogery Bi 

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.470
 Yeah yeah 

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:40.500
 Roti is one of the apis that has been enhanced to become a jelly bean 

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:45.570
 General 

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:49.860
 It is said that the expression of arrangement has come to live, so the opposite 

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:50.680
 Well, if you haven't used it until now in the notification, that one 

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:55.960
 Oh dear 

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:56.830
 I do not want to be annoying but I hope you use this instruction well 

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:01.750
 More 

00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:08.000
 More detailed screens are now visible to the user in the notification 

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:12.470
 That's right I think that the contents of the club come out and some examples are made 

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.170
 Or something that is not recommended or will not be understood in advance 

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.980
 Do you do this 

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:18.299
 I guess that 

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:24.239
 If you say one 

00:38:18.299 --> 00:38:28.140
 If you are using the api of the day boundary of the hidden api display group in the web view 

00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:33.039
 I heard that there are quite a lot 

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:37.550
 Well ics jelly bean and go on to the next 

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:42.140
 Private api is likely to stop working 

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:48.080
 Because it collapses, I love Hilme Pia and it is awful gp ya 

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:49.680
 I can access that, but don't worry about the api 

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:55.710
 By all means 

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:56.940
 The part that I want to ask you to avoid it is likely to disappear in the future 

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:58.730
 Eat so much 

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:02.309
 It is so expensive 

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:03.490
 Yes next 8 is next 

00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:08.320
 8 

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:10.750
 Support from the old apra terminal to the latest terminal with the same code base 

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.380
 It is serious Yes that 

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:14.289
 Preferences 

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:17.670
 Fragment is 

00:39:14.289 --> 00:39:19.990
 What is the reason why it is not provided as a convergence library 

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:22.200
 Let's not beat the way to deal with 

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:24.380
 You're a low floor frog 

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:29.240
 8 

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:31.900
 Well, the name of that compatibility library is officially supported 

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:37.180
 It has been renamed to the library 

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:42.190
 Is the reason why preference fragments are not provided 

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:47.020
 There is no reason not to do this, but every time on our priority list 

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:49.029
 We still have something to do that ahead of us 

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:52.079
 Is getting full 

00:39:49.029 --> 00:39:54.500
 The action bar is at the top of the list right now 

00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:57.050
 Library supporting red well 

00:39:54.500 --> 00:40:02.000
 Last night 9 somehow somehow 

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:02.910
 Is the work going on? Compared with that, the preference fragment is a priority female doctor 

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.410
 Coming up 

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:10.920
 I see 

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:18.210
 For now, I'm going to talk about it again as a valuable opinion 

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:20.650
 It is certainly not that easy to support that German code base 

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:25.329
 This is that 

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:31.200
 2.2 or more now at this point but say more than 2.2 

00:40:25.329 --> 00:40:32.590
 I think it's worth it to support that 

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:37.450
 Oh dear 

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:39.850
 Now that there is no such thing as open source in the api 

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:45.230
 While using it well 

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:46.650
 We hope you will experience the excellent ui experience temple for many &amp; logic users. 

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:52.830
 Please 

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:55.590
 Yes, next time on the question I posted on my own, the action bar is fine 

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:59.040
 Can I use Android platform with awe-inspiring platform i 

00:40:55.590 --> 00:41:03.210
 Well, this does not exist as api to the field 

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:05.039
 It is not included in the motion support library. 

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:10.289
 But 

00:41:05.039 --> 00:41:11.890
 You can make it yourself, or open source level action bar 

00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:19.040
 Placing a person 

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:24.110
 There is a fact that this is actually very well done. 

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:28.730
 While using such a library, it works well in android 

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:33.380
 It's probably a good idea to have an action bar expression 

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:36.660
 As I mentioned, I can not put an action bar into the support library 

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:41.339
 Whether ready now 1 yes yes 

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:42.430
 That's what ics answered earlier 

00:41:41.339 --> 00:41:46.809
 Haina 

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:48.820
 There is a plan for Japanese android design site but there is no plan 

00:41:46.809 --> 00:41:50.580
 I see 

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:53.809
 This is probably me 

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:57.090
 I am considering theft 

00:41:53.809 --> 00:41:59.340
 It's okay or reduced by 10% 

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:03.160
 Constitution is likely to be scattered 

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:06.880
 A lot of that color 

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:10.869
 I'm getting Japanese, I guess it's going to be like that. 

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:19.210
 Yeah we are considering it 

00:42:10.869 --> 00:42:26.049
 This is really a budget talk, I wonder if Mr. Hayashi and the budget spend more in Japan than in Japan 

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:26.870
 As we can be said, we have something good and we will come to say we can strongly say 

00:42:26.049 --> 00:42:28.610
 That's great 

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:31.150
 Thank you in advance 

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:33.180
 It's so colorful 

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:37.740
 In winter 

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:42.350
 I'm thinking of speeding up ui to boost ux of web beads 

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:44.040
 In the case of a native app that does not use j-mail etc. 

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:48.990
 It will be good after all 

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:52.200
 Eh this is first of all that profiling is important after all 

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:58.230
 Web view html 

00:42:52.200 --> 00:43:01.680
 So even if you have an app that looks like that, just write it normally with a job 

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:05.760
 There are quite a few things that move quickly 

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:11.520
 Let's tune it further 

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:15.140
 If you touch the user, it will react within 50 ms or something like that 

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:19.760
 I want you to increase more and more 

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:25.190
 Profiler that you achieve this that profiler 

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:29.960
 &amp; sdk are also included and new versions of sdk 

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:31.559
 Note that tools have been added for level professional gearing. 

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.700
 Profiling 

00:43:31.559 --> 00:43:35.160
 Please consider Yes 

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.400
 so 

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.400
 Eh 

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:55.310
 Booby offers ui's gk Do you like it? 

00:43:57.029 --> 00:44:01.660
 Physical button is used back 

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.710
 Where to buy 

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:07.060
 high noon 

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:07.060
 Speaking of ui 

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:14.119
 I agree 

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:14.119
 First the target sdk version is 

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:17.490
 Well old 

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:20.270
 To be exact 

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:22.510
 Ms. android 

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:27.670
 If it is after that 

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:28.290
 The menu button will automatically appear in the upper right of the action bar 

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:32.280
 From 

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:37.710
 If that is not the case for the old version old target old sdk version app 

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:38.960
 There is a point of protection at the right end of this system bar. 

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:44.270
 It's a substitute 

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:48.350
 It is the difference of such a menu button 

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:50.910
 You need to be careful about what it means by the version of os 

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:53.310
 With the story that it changes 

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:56.400
 After the back button 

00:44:53.310 --> 00:45:02.850
 The version changes so much with the back button 

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:06.070
 That's-it's totally the same, so it's just expressed by that terminal and 

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:09.630
 A hardware group like the Ardley family 

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:11.710
 It is the difference of thunder, so the back button is in a sense 

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:16.300
 Do you live in Kansai two rooms? 

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:19.550
 Well that's the point of care that you want to make software hardware move when it comes 

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:22.400
 It looks like this is about this 

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:25.580
 Especially that way 

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:28.110
 Well system professor's system bradaron 

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:32.940
 Application that does processing such as not displaying 

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:34.460
 Something strange will not happen 

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.349
 With a woman 

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.480
 Menu button compatible flower 

00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:39.069
 1 

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.600
 Hmm 

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:42.880
 Screen size 

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:46.690
 Screen size is well 

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:52.599
 You're in it, and you'll see a lot of it. 

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:58.710
 However, generally speaking that such a button is more than a story of hiring a jockey 

00:45:52.599 --> 00:46:01.940
 Because it is a story that risk can be avoided if you try it on a business trip with that model too, conversely 

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:03.480
 It's easy to see differences between models 

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:07.650
 What 

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:13.410
 Can I use the open gully 

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:14.580
 So the gpu is different little by little the movement is easy to come out of class 

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:17.060
 open gl 

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:20.280
 Garibari new car Luca + 

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:24.060
 It is easy to come out If not so 

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:27.060
 I use cameras in dangerous places, or key points to hardware 

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:27.500
 I was very close to hard error 

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.990
 Program 

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:34.700
 If you are off 

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:37.760
 The basic behavior of other general action bars 

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:44.000
 It's like scrolling in listview 

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:48.260
 There is almost no concern about compatibility with such partial functions. 

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:52.340
 On the other hand, the scroll performance of listview changes much in the artificial hand 

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:58.010
 I often hear that story 

00:46:52.340 --> 00:47:02.240
 If it is possible for a while to see if it can not be used on a slow model 

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:03.740
 On the other hand you can scroll fast with quick characters and listview 

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.780
 Such part 

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:08.700
 Especially 

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:16.140
 I think like I said a little bit this time also today 

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:23.190
 I'm sorry I'm sorry I came, but I'm sorry I have one last time 

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:27.750
 It looks like a corner, so I would like to ask for that pet time for a moment 

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:32.280
 Something else that left me sad because of the border crossing 

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:34.560
 Is there such a thing on the right? I want to say one more time the back button 

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:39.840
 Content of the part firmly 

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:45.350
 I want you to accept the content drawing firmly and want you to make it 

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:48.570
 I think now Back button Back button is not important I wonder 

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:49.890
 Puma Somewhat of course it's a delusion according to today 

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:55.260
 Ummm 

00:47:49.890 --> 00:48:00.690
 The right of the back button or the action bar on the action bar is on the left 

00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:08.100
 It is so where the button with the role which is not in the android standard is arranged where 

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:10.500
 uui unfortunately still has a lot of stuff right side is complete or it's done undo 

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:17.530
 It is hard to be born Completed 

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:19.059
 Here's a window with a child out there and you'll see a list like a colleague or an archer 

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:28.780
 A little more 

00:48:19.059 --> 00:48:29.900
 Oh, Giant Day The app here to reduce your confusion 

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:33.710
 Thank you for your cooperation 

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:37.040
 I think I want to do that by all means 

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:40.610
 We will continue to develop android-like ui apps 

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:44.750
 That's right, thank you, so this week 

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:47.950
 I think yes again next time again next time 

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:47.950
 Thank you very much
