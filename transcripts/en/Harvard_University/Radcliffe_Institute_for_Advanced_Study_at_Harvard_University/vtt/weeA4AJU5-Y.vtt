00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.740
- OK, welcome to the second
of our lectures in the Ocean

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.510
Lecture Series
here at Radcliffe.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.230
So just for those
of you for new here,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.340
we have a theme for the science
portion of the Radcliffe

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.710
Institute for Advanced
Study this year,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.250
which is on oceans and
various aspects of oceans.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.520
Our first lecture
in the series was

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.370
about adapting to
hurricane risks.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.220
We had a science
symposium, which

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.570
was talking about the
origins of life in the oceans

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.280
and also the role
that the oceans

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.590
play in climate
and the pressures

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.360
that we are putting
on the ocean.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.570
So today we have two speakers,
from the local Boston

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.840
sector in District One
from the Coast Guard,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
to talk about two particular
aspects of the Coast Guard's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.000
missions but let me give
you some background.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.730
I teach a course at
Harvard in navigation,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.390
which came as a result
of a kayak accident

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.360
that I was in
close proximity to.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.270
And a book emerged from that.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.780
One of the members of the Coast
Guard from the Boston sector

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.060
approached me and
asked me to give a talk

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.860
to the officers about that.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.100
And we started to form
something of a loose relation

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.950
and discussion, in part
because I'm a sea kayaker.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.980
We carry around little
VHF transceivers

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.800
and listen to the Coast Guard
and listen to their advice

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.550
about how to stay
alive out there.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.040
And recently I was given a tour
of their facilities in Boston.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.050
About two years ago, we had a
science symposium on navigation

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.890
where we had an expert on
land-based search and rescues.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.040
And I've always been
curious about how

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.370
search and rescues
are done near shore

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.500
waters and offshore waters.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.449
And so that was
one of the themes

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.780
that I was hoping to
explore a bit here.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.230
And the other theme has
to do with the stresses

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.540
that we humans are
putting on the oceans.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.220
We seem to sometimes think of
it as an infinite resource,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.410
but on the other
hand it's really

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.080
turning into a very
finite resource in terms

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.040
of the fisheries, the amount
of plastics in the ocean,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.840
this kind of thing.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.120
And the Coast Guard
is on the front lines

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.840
of trying to protect
that resource locally.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.780
So I wanted to explore
both of these items

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.730
in a talk which we're
going to be splitting.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.667
So we have here today
Captain Claudia Gelzer, who

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.750
will be talking about the
environmental protection

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.910
aspect, and Commander
Lee Titus, who

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.850
will be talking about the
search and rescue aspect.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.590
So without any
further ado, Claudia,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.340
can you introduce the topic?

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.328
Thank you.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.329
- Well, thank you so
much, Professor Huth.

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.620
It's really truly an honor
to be here with you tonight.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.420
And I'm in awe of
everyone coming out.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.300
It's a very Coast
Guard night for you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.150
to come out and thank you
for weathering the storm.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.880
We feel at home in this weather.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.480
As you heard, I'm
Claudia Gelzer.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.540
I am the local Operational
Commander for the Coast Guard

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.250
in Boston and Massachusetts.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.104
And I'm here with my
colleague, Lee Titus.

00:03:34.104 --> 00:03:36.270
And we're really grateful
to the Radcliffe Institute

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.190
and Professor Huth
for including us

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.170
in this important
discussion on the health

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.810
and protection of our oceans.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.130
The Coast Guard has a
huge interest and stake

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.780
in many of the issues that have
been explored over the past,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.260
or for the next
couple months that

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.302
are going on, and certainly
at the Ocean Symposium.

00:03:52.302 --> 00:03:53.760
And I thought it
would be good if I

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.030
could begin with some broad
context just about the Coast

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.530
Guard.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.190
Which I feel is-- we're
right in your backyard,

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.080
and yet I still feel
we're a service that's

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.910
a bit mysterious to some.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.860
And so it all began in 1790
as a vision of our founder

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.320
and one of the nation's
founding fathers.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.970
He's someone who
is finally getting

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.339
some of the
well-deserved recognition

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.649
in the musical
Hamilton, although some

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.370
say it's overrated.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.910
Alexander Hamilton proposed the
precursor to the Coast Guard,

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.390
saying a few armed
vessels, judiciously

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.700
stationed at the
entrances of our ports,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.630
might at a small expense be
useful sentinels of the law.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.810
And that is how it began with
the Revenue Cutter Service,

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.810
comprised of just 10 ships
keeping watch along the East

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.420
Coast to enforce tariff laws.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.930
From those days, our service
has evolved enormously.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.140
Created by fusing the Revenue
Cutter Service, the Lifesaving

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.590
Service, the Lighthouse Service,
the Bureau of Navigation,

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.630
and the Steamboat
Inspection Service

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.010
to officially form what was
called, starting in 1940,

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.880
the United States Coast Guard.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.240
And just like the Revenue
Cutter Service, to this day

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.460
we stand guard in
our ports executing

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.410
a variety of maritime
missions that

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.860
uphold safety, security,
and environmental protection

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.850
at sea.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.926
And I would argue-- still at
a relatively small expense.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.920
So this is kind of depicting
the variety of missions.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.460
And really I've kind
of divided into when

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.057
we're protecting
people from the ocean

00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:31.390
and when we are trying to
protect the ocean from people.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.150
So again, you know privileged
to be part of this Ocean Lecture

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.130
series.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.164
Your Coast Guard is usually
invested in activities at sea,

00:05:42.164 --> 00:05:44.330
but I want to stress that
those activities span well

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.710
beyond the oceans.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.330
While we have a considerable
presence on the East, West,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.810
and Gulf Coast, we also
protect the Great Lakes,

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.990
the mighty inland rivers,
and waters in US territories.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.170
And for the first time,
we're encountering new oceans

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.500
as melting ice opens
up the Arctic region.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.320
The Coast Guard is unique,
as it is simultaneously

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.560
a military force and a federal
law enforcement agency.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.310
No other DOD service
can claim that.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.190
We protect and defend more than
100,000 miles of US coastline

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.960
and navigable
rivers and safeguard

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.020
the largest exclusive economic
zone in the world, a zone

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.130
200 nautical miles out to
sea, 4.5 million square miles

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.020
stretching from north
of the Arctic Circle

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.150
to south of the equator,
from Puerto Rico

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.562
to Guam, encompassing
nine time zones--

00:06:30.562 --> 00:06:33.020
all with a force about the size
of the New York City Police

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.040
Department.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.010
The Coast Guard numbers
just about 56,000,

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.870
including our civilian force.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.410
We're a fraction of the size
of any other DOD service,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.350
living on a budget of
about $10 billion a year.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.300
That's just under
the price of one

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.700
naval aircraft carrier
battle group, not

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.710
a bad value to the taxpayer.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.350
The fifth armed service
and only military branch

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.641
in the Department of Homeland
Security, the Coast Guard

00:06:56.641 --> 00:06:58.310
has served in every
war in US history.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.740
Moreover, the Coast Guard
is a first responder

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.750
and humanitarian service.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.270
We render aid to people
in trouble at sea

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.290
or impacted by man
and natural disasters.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.510
The Coast Guard also inspects
all commercial vessels

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.110
for safety.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.870
We investigate accidents on
ships operating in our waters,

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.600
as well as on any US
vessel operating anywhere

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.020
in the world.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.020
We have a presence in
Europe and the Far East,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.870
conducting international port
security assessments, all

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.720
of this to ensure the integrity
of our maritime transportation

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.310
system.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.840
Right here in
Massachusetts, there

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.406
are about 1,200
Coast Guard members

00:07:31.406 --> 00:07:32.780
manning shore
units that regulate

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.410
industry, mark channels
with aids and navigation,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.900
working on patrol boats,
search and rescue stations,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.300
and at an air
station on Cape Cod.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.250
By law, the Coast Guard's
responsible for 11

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.359
distinct maritime missions.

00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:47.400
But without running down
that list, which I find.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.602
People tend to forget,
I'll quote a politician

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:51.560
who captured the breath
of our responsibilities

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.840
when he said, quote,
"the Coast Guard is

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.125
Congress's favorite manservant
for every problem that's wet".

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:00.500
While conducting
law enforcement,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.150
rescue and regulatory
activities,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.880
one underlying focus prevails--
the Coast Guard's duty

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.160
to facilitate maritime
commerce and protect

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.530
the vital maritime
transportation system.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.320
That system moves critical
cargoes to our waters.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.990
Here in Boston that
means heating oil,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.359
cars, building materials,
salt for the roads,

00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:19.400
intermodal containers
filled with food, clothing,

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.060
electronics.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.260
That's just the
tip of the iceberg.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.970
The port of Boston
contributes $4.6

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.300
million-- billion dollars--
I'm sorry, with a B--

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.310
a year to the economy.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.580
11.6 million metric tons of
cargo arrive here by ship.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.950
More than 100 cruise ships
called at the sea port

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.870
last year.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.370
We're supposed to get
150 in the coming year.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.280
And 5,000 commuters crisscross
Massachusetts Bay each day

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.450
on ferries.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.340
24/7, the Coast
Guard's monitoring,

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.390
regulating, and enforcing
safety and security requirements

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.770
aboard all foreign and
domestic commercial ships,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.510
including fishing
vessels that bring

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.740
in seafood into our state, with
a value second only to Alaska.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.360
So that's your
context on the Coast

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.860
Guard for tonight's discussion.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.320
We're here to focus exclusively
on two of the Coast Guard's

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.740
maritime missions.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.490
The first, and perhaps our
most famous, search and rescue,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.170
has deep roots in the
treacherous waters

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.010
of New England.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.230
The second, marine
environmental response

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.870
and prevention and
protection is a high priority

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.910
in New England's pristine
and productive waters

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.650
both for marine
life and recreation.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.900
I'm happy now to introduce
my colleague, Commander Lee

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.270
Titus, who is a
chief of response

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.889
operations at the Sector, what
we call the Sector, in Boston.

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:25.430
And that means both
search and rescue

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.069
and marine
environmental response.

00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:29.360
And he's also our search and
rescue mission coordinator

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.318
for the Coast Guard in
Boston, Commander Titus.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.800
- Thank you, Captain,
and good evening.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.120
Again, I'm Commander Lee
Titus, Chief of Response

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.600
to US Coast Guard
here in Boston.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.030
As we said, working
for Captain Gelzer,

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:51.110
I'm responsible for coordinating
all maritime law enforcement,

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.020
security, environmental
response, again, oil spill,

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.770
and search and rescue operation
from New Hampshire to Plymouth.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.620
While the Coast Guard
has 11 official missions,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.710
search and rescue
remains the primary.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.680
Probably nowhere else
in the Coast Guard

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.230
is this SAR legacy more
firmly rooted than right

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.980
here in Massachusetts, with
the first Revenue Cutter, built

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.740
in Newburyport, just
north of here in 1791

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.320
and the birthplace of Joshua
James, our most iconic

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.550
lifesaver, just down
the road in Hull.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.650
For me personally,
search and rescue

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.330
has always been near
and dear and has

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.900
consumed the majority of
my professional career

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.160
over the past 16 years.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.870
In that time I've
had the opportunity,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.290
or I suppose the misfortune,
to experience search and rescue

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:41.170
from the execution side while
at command of cutters at sea,

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.870
and also from the planning
side, in rescue coordination

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.950
centers in Seattle,
in Boston, and now I'm

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.850
the SAR Mission Coordinator
here in Massachusetts.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.570
Now before I begin to
discuss our SAR work,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.820
as we try to save
us from the ocean,

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.000
I'll say up front that the
case that I plan to present

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.760
was only the search
and regrettably

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.745
never ended in a rescue.

00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:07.870
But I hope it will illustrate
the complexity of how

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.860
we respond to distress
in the deep ocean.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.890
Even over my short career,
advances in technology

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.970
have made boating many times
safer for the general public.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.980
Electronics that
were only in reach

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.840
of the military or commercial
vessels 15 years ago,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.710
such as advanced navigation
systems, radar, real time

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.070
weather reporting, satellite
communications and survival

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.610
equipment are now commonplace
on most oceangoing

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.960
recreational boats.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.530
For example, emergency position
indicating radio beacons

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.700
or EPIRBs, as most people know
of them, now are $300 to $500

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.584
and fit in the back
pocket at times.

00:11:45.584 --> 00:11:47.500
Advanced boatbuilding
materials and techniques

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.980
have also greatly enhanced the
durability and seaworthiness

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.660
of the vessels.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.570
But every year around the
world, hundreds of vessels

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.630
are lost at sea often taking
thousands of crew members

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.670
to the bottom.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.940
For some perspective, just
within the nation in 2015,

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.660
the Coast Guard responded to
over 16,000 search and rescue

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.220
cases, saving 3,536 lives.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.680
Here within our area
of responsibility,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:20.200
we responded to 373 cases
with 88 lives saved.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.360
I don't offer these
stats to tout our work,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.010
but rather to show
that we will never

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.780
be ahead of this SAR mission.

00:12:29.212 --> 00:12:30.670
And it's hard to
understand or even

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.520
try to explain what
drives SAR cases.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.760
But from my experience,
most cases almost always

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.120
are a result of dynamic
marine conditions

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.640
or equipment
malfunctions or failures

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.550
that are then compounded
by sea and heavy weather.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.470
Also and probably the most
prevalent reasons for distress,

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.500
are that many boaters
simply underestimate

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.395
the power of the sea
or overestimate their

00:12:56.395 --> 00:12:58.064
or their vessel's capabilities.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.570
But I'll say, if you must
get into trouble at sea,

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.300
I ask you to please do so
within the coastal region,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.730
within Captain's region
here, out about 20

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.254
to 30 nautical miles.

00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:13.420
And there are plenty of
people getting into distress

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.200
within the zone each year.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.290
However, within
this coastal area,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.190
I can dispatch multiple ships
and boats, helicopters, planes

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.790
to arrive with under an
hour to the distress.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.580
Additionally, our VHF
radio communications

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.470
are highly effective
in the region,

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.690
often providing
near instantaneous

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.905
location of the distress.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.520
But I ask you-- what if the
distress call comes from here,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.670
1,100 nautical miles at sea?

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.430
This falls within our
larger district boundary,

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.040
running from the Canadian
border to Northern New Jersey

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.660
and out to sea,
1,300 nautical miles.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.140
Following is a case that I
coordinated with my District

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.860
Command Center
team back in 2013,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.480
which highlights the
complexity of offshore searches

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.500
and will allow me to show
some of the tools we rely on

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.530
for planning and execution.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.540
On May 4th, 2013, the 40 foot
sailing vessel Cheeki Rafiki

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.810
departed Antigua en
route to the Azores

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.900
with a crew of four
men aged 25 to 50.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.270
Two of the crew were highly
experienced in ocean crossings.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.180
And I'll show you,
this is a typical route

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.460
there on the right.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.910
And notably, not a straight
line to the Azores,

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.610
but rather well north
to just below the ice

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.650
fields, but where
they're able to pick up

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.720
westerly consistent winds.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.610
Similar routes have
been used really

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.480
since Columbus began
sailing here and back.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.500
Now for the first 10 days, the
trip was relatively uneventful,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.930
until they began to
enter a late season storm

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.260
system on the 14th.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.920
You can see the relatively
rapid track north of the Cheeki

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.960
Rafiki, then the
slower advances as they

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.640
shift to the east, the red dots
there, on the 14th and 15th,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.970
and began to encounter
a massive weather system

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.950
with increasing winds and seas.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.950
And even if you're not familiar
with offshore weather maps,

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.660
one can innately
understand that this is

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.920
a bad situation for the vessel.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.780
Late Thursday evening, 15 May,
Boston Rescue Coordination

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.580
Center received
an initial report

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.872
from the coordination
center in England,

00:15:26.872 --> 00:15:28.330
that they had a
report of a sailing

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.740
vessel taking on some water.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.210
But they were
keeping up with it,

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.620
and were not
requesting assistance.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.880
Four hours later, early
morning on Friday England

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.530
passed an email from
the sailing vessel

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.900
stating that the
flooding was worse.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.070
And they were unsure
of the source.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.460
We immediately tried
their satellite phone

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.960
with no response.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.770
And then launched a C-130
long range rescue aircraft

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.020
from Elizabeth City,
North Carolina,

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.820
which had about a five hour
estimated time of arrival

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.660
to 1100 nautical miles at sea.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.320
Minutes later,
our command center

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.870
received the first personal
locator beacon or appeal being

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.320
transmitted via satellite.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.282
That's like the EPIRB,
but a manual one.

00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:11.740
Within, the command
center received

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.030
the visual icon and
position of the PLB

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.470
that had been activated.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.070
Much like what you
would think, it

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.600
comes up on the screen with
an alarming, horrible alarm

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.500
as well.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.600
Unlike an emergency
position indicating

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.440
beacon that is
installed in vessel

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.110
which automatically deploys, a
PLB must be manually activated.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.460
And that's key.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:36.060
A second PLB began transmitting
several hours after the first.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.120
Notably the sailing
vessel's larger EPIRB

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.346
was never deployed.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.870
Distance and time to the scene
of our fixed wing air asset

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.750
was about four to six hours
through the whole search,

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.210
leaving only about three to
four hours of search time.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.220
Also unlike our
helicopter assets,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.720
fixed wing aircraft have limited
direct rescue capabilities.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.170
They can drop a life
raft, radios, then

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.260
must wait for a surface
vessel to arrive.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.839
In the deep ocean, we often rely
on a system of cargo vessels

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.650
that are willing to divert and
assist mariners in distress.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.994
Most vessels are often 10 to 15
or more hours from the scene,

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:18.410
and often must
wait for conditions

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.560
to improve to effect rescue.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.220
Mid-morning on Friday,
the C-130 arrived on scene

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.680
and reported 15 to 20 foot
seas, 50 knot winds or 60 miles

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.820
per hour, which is just
below the hurricane force.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.590
Water temps were reading
55 and air temp was 50.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.000
I'd say at sea,
the Cheeki Rafiki

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.760
would have been
completely lost from view

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.490
in the trough of the
waves, except for the mast.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.150
For someone in the water,
the wind and sea noise

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.790
would have been deafening.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.879
The tops of the waves would
be torn in sheets by the wind,

00:17:52.879 --> 00:17:54.420
and the person would
struggle to keep

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.220
from drowning from the force
of the sea spray alone.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.790
Now I know when I first
started my career running cases

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.510
at sea on the patrol boats,
I had a misguided idea

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.810
that just about
anything incongruent

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.710
from the vast blue sea would
immediately be seen and pop out

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.020
to searchers.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.930
I soon realized how wrong I was.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.120
And when I flip
to the next slide,

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.022
I would like the first person
that sees and identifies

00:18:21.022 --> 00:18:23.480
the object the Coast Guard and
Navy boats are searching for

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.420
to raise their hand.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.878
You have an advantage
in the front.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.400
Any guesses?

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.678
- Mid right?

00:18:40.678 --> 00:18:41.928
- Let's see what we have here.

00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:47.750
The Coast Guard actually knew
the vessel was there and were

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.070
just preparing to board.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.526
I like to think that the Navy
may still have been looking.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.380
Now granted, these men were
trying to evade and hide.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.410
But this was a 35 foot go fast,
with four men, fuel barrels,

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.472
a 1,000 kilograms of cocaine.

00:19:08.472 --> 00:19:09.930
And I ask you, how
difficult do you

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.530
think it would be to spot a
person in the water in 20 foot

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.470
waves and 50 knot winds?

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.810
How about if just the
head of the survivor

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:18.877
were above the water?

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.300
So again, our first search
assets arrived on scene.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.930
Nothing was located.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:29.810
Multiple locator beacon
hits in the area,

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.240
but no signs of survivors.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.460
And we began to saturate the
area with both air and surface

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.410
assets.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.360
The yellow icons represent
separate signals and position

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.320
reports received from the
first and then the second PLB,

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.350
the locator beacon, over
the first day of searching.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.380
The series of black triangles
are the fixed search patterns

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.270
the aircraft used to quickly
scan the area upon arrival.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.730
As noted, we had lost
already five hours just

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:00.980
getting to the scene.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.940
But in those harsh
conditions, we

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.150
were working fast against the
survivability clock for someone

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.610
in the water, or
even in a life raft.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.760
Getting an accurate
estimate of survivability

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.760
is absolutely essential
in our planning

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.500
and eventually when
we may need to be

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.560
forced to call off a search.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.970
Since the end of World
War II, the Coast Guard

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.680
has continually refined and
adapted cold water models

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.880
and currently we
use a probability

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:32.080
of survival decision
or PSDA model, which

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.770
is a cold water and
immersion survival

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.380
calculator which predicts
heat loss and dehydration.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.530
Two key core temperature
points are calculated.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.280
First is functional
at 93 degrees

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.830
Fahrenheit, then survival
at 82 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.180
The functional
point is critical,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.290
as it basically means that
someone could self-rescue

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.060
and most importantly,
actively keep their face out

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.710
of the water.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.340
The PSD model is based on
extensive Canadian and US

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.600
military cold water
immersion experiments.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.460
And yes, the military
has immersed thousands

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.690
of volunteers as well as from
survival de-brief data starting

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.960
with sailors and pilots
from World War I.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.030
It's important to note that
this model is based primarily

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.570
on empirical data, while
cold water survival

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.150
depends on hundreds of
environmental and physiological

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:25.970
variables.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.280
For example, scientists
simply cannot quantify a will

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.940
to survive.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.100
That said, in the end, the body
can only retain heat so long

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.390
and the physics of
cold water immersion

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.610
will eventually take over.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.819
To give you an idea of
the relentless physics

00:21:43.819 --> 00:21:45.610
of cold water immersion,
I want to show you

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.955
an example of how this
works, even close to shore.

00:21:47.955 --> 00:21:50.530
And John, it's good to know
that you're a kayaker as well.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.890
So I've asked the model to
simulate an average middle age

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.740
male in relatively benign
late winter weather.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.890
46 degree air temperature
may seem brisk right now,

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.490
but after a long hard
New England winter,

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.050
this is almost balmy.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.530
And we see kayakers hit the
water in these late winter,

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.040
early spring conditions.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.230
So this gentleman
rolled over one mile

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.830
from shore, with no life jacket.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.790
In under two hours,
the man would no longer

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.680
be able to actively keep
his head out of the water.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.990
And in seven hours,
he would be dead.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.720
The physics are
unrelenting and brutal.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.640
For the crew of four
on the sailing vessel,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.380
we conservatively
calculated that they

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.822
would have all made
it into the life raft,

00:22:35.822 --> 00:22:37.530
and they would reach
the functional point

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:41.860
at 16 hours and survival at 20.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.050
Remember, it took us six hours
for the first asset to arrive.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.920
For our calculations,
we use the air temp

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.140
as I mentioned 50, and water
temp of 55, windspeed of 50,

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.010
and an average victim,
much like our kayaker.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.230
Immersed in water to the
waist-- now this immersion

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.450
is designed to simulate being
in a raft in heavy weather

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.370
conditions, where it's
impossible to keep

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.900
the raft clear of water and they
would be immersed to the waist

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.230
during the rough water.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.970
According to our
calculations, the crew

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:16.740
reached functional time
on Saturday around 4:00

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.360
in the afternoon, then
survival around 8:00 PM.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:26.090
And this is really where the
arts and science of search

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.890
and rescue planning begins.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.740
The art of search planning
relates to the assumptions.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.650
We are often forced to make
hundreds, if not thousands,

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.200
of assumptions over a case,
because we simply never

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.200
have all of the facts of
the boat, the scenario,

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.330
or the crew.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:45.080
In this case, no
vessel was sighted.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.810
They must be in the
water or in the raft.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.670
Did they stay with the vessel?

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.620
Were they separated?

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.310
Did they even make it out alive?

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.440
We simply did not know.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.940
Not to diminish
the important work

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.530
you mentioned of
our counterparts

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.480
running land searches
because they are not easy.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.992
But on land, there
are certain constants.

00:24:05.992 --> 00:24:07.950
Meaning there's an average
distance that can be

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.340
walked generally in an hour.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.970
Or victims generally
head down hill,

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.610
they then follow
water, et cetera.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.860
At sea, environmental
weather factors

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.320
can change by the minute.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.140
Currents can run with or
opposed to prevailing winds.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.810
Most importantly, every
boat or object in the water

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:29.490
drifts uniquely based on shape
and its gear configuration.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.330
Finally, each of these
uniquely drifting objects

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.340
are subject to
divergence, which means,

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.835
depending on the angle of the
object to the seas and winds,

00:24:38.835 --> 00:24:41.060
it can drift along
two vectors which

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.130
can offset up to 90 degrees.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.890
For years, search planners
relied on static drift data

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.160
from a few objects
and observed weather

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.080
to calculate the possible drift.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.010
And we certainly located
many people in those years.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.350
I began my career
drawing the drift factors

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.040
on vectors on paper charts.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.970
But now thinking back, there
was a lot more art of SAR

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.980
I think involved
in those searches.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.120
As of the late '90s, Coast
Guard began developing and using

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.180
complex computer modeling
programs that calculate drift

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.210
based on historical current
and predicted weather,

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.000
with pre-determined, detailed
drift characteristics

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.266
on multiple objects.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.640
Currently US Coast Guard uses
the latest generation modeling

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.140
called Search and Rescue Optimal
Planning System or SAR OPS.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.210
This system pulls
highly accurate wind

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.870
and current conditions from
Navy and NOAA weather databases.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.210
Then uses the data to
theoretically drift

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.150
5,000 objects in the water
to establish the most

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.730
probable areas to search.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.440
Just please excuse
the simplicity

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.880
of the following analogy.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.150
But it's how the program was
originally described to me.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:54.560
Imagine releasing 5,000
rubber ducks all set

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.410
with the mathematical
characteristics of a 40 foot

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.110
sailing vessel, life raft
or someone in the water,

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.900
and see how they move over time.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.360
Now this dull shot, and
it is horribly dull,

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.670
shows a point off of
Cape Ann near Gloucester

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:12.320
in which I had the system drop
2,500 particles with the drift

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.690
characteristics of
a life raft and 25

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.760
designed to drift like
a person in the water.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.500
So this same 5,000 particles
drifted over 12 hours, 20 knot

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.030
winds, and moderate seas.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.270
You'll see that the pink number
ones-- the pink number ones are

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:30.010
the life raft particles,
and the brown number twos

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.750
are drifting like a
person in the water.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.640
This looked fairly
compact, I know.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.230
But in 12 hours,
the search area has

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.320
stretched to almost 20
miles by 10 miles wide,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.080
200 square nautical miles.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.020
Time is not just against
us in surviving cold water,

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.520
but also area to cover.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.940
As we return back to the
case, during the first three

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.610
critical days-- remember
the survival clock--

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:56.300
we called in a C-130 aircraft
from Canada, Elizabeth City,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.940
North Carolina, all the way
from Air Force in Georgia,

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.800
refueling on the way.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.990
More than 10 commercial
and private vessels

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.670
crisscross the area.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.800
The weather improved and
we saturated the area,

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:12.200
searching more than 4,200
square nautical miles of ocean.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.150
The colored blocks
are representing

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.240
the drifted particles
instead of the ones and twos,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.370
with the black lines
depicting the various surface

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.860
and air search patterns
for those first three days

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.400
that we saturated.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.830
On Sunday, a vessel
spotted the overturned haul

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.767
in the search area.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:35.540
We continued to search initially
until early Monday morning then

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.690
initially called off the
search almost 30 hours

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.915
beyond survival, or as we say
suspended active searching

00:27:42.915 --> 00:27:43.415
or access.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.200
Then with considerable
cross-Atlantic governmental

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.950
pressure, we reopened
the search on Tuesday,

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.650
then continued to search
for another four days,

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.010
calling on air assets from
England, the Azores, US

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.770
and Canada, as well as
multiple Coast Guard and Navy

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.140
ships and helicopters
to finally search

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:08.015
more than 25,000 square
miles spread over 225 miles.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.520
As we were completing our
final searches on Friday,

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.480
seven days into the search
before recommending calling off

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.550
the search a second time,
a Navy ship and helicopter

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:25.610
relocated the hull
in the drifted area.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:28.501
We were in luck that there
was a giant circular current

00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:29.750
in the middle of the Atlantic.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.380
The life raft-- we
sent a diver down.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.640
The life raft was confirmed to
be still stowed on the boat.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.260
All four sailors were
presumed lost at sea.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.410
We will simply
never know for sure

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.060
what happened in the
last several hours

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.550
before we lost contact
with the vessel.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.250
But the keel had been
torn from the hull.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.430
And this is my opinion, I
believe the flooding was coming

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.390
from damaged bolts
holding the keel on,

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:02.060
once the keel broke
free, the vessel

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.390
would have violently rolled
multiple times within minutes.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.430
Some of the crew may have
been thrown overboard.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.880
We mentioned the PLBs being
activated, while some of them

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.760
may never have made
it out of the cabin.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.180
The accident was dynamic,
rapid with almost no time

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.420
to react or prepare.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.420
The case was tragic and like
all the unresolved cases

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.390
in my career, still
haunts me to this day.

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.940
But during the week
before and then

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.810
two weeks after this accident,
several strong, unexpected, low

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.210
pressure systems ripped
through the same transit zone,

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:39.410
and we successfully
located and rescued crews

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.507
from three other sailboats
in the same region.

00:29:42.507 --> 00:29:44.840
I don't understand what caused
the series of late season

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.360
weather systems to
push through that year.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.650
But as the sea temperatures
rise and currents shift,

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.230
the weather patterns
and sea routes

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.271
that sailors have relied
on for hundreds of years

00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:56.750
will also change.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.870
And already we see, as sea
ice recedes further north,

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:01.610
some cross-Atlantic
vessels are pushing

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:05.930
north into colder waters
with more consistent wind,

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:09.680
but of course, farther and
farther from rescue assets.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.320
I do know, however,
that as mariners adapt,

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.680
we too will continue to work
to save them from our oceans.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.472
Thank you.

00:30:16.472 --> 00:30:26.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.720
- All right.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.545
It's easy for me.

00:30:29.545 --> 00:30:34.540
He is one of my-- best part
of my team there in Boston.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.614
And I thought that
was really well done.

00:30:36.614 --> 00:30:37.780
I know I shouldn't say that.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:41.590
But I only will say
that, for anyone here who

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.270
is venturing out
into the water, you

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:47.510
should know that this is the guy
that is managing that search.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.160
And he's the guy who takes the
calls at 3:00 in the morning

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.830
and really doesn't
rest until we have

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:57.850
found somebody and hopefully
brought them home safely.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.600
And he made it very clear,
we're going to shift gears now.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.780
The ocean is a dangerous
place for people.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.560
And that case is a really
good example of that.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:14.560
But I believe that it is
equally vulnerable from man.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.050
And for thousands
of years, people

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.240
have used the ocean as a
medium for transportation

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.760
and the movement of
critical commodities.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.470
Billions and billions
of gallons of oil

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.100
are transported by
sea via tankship.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.760
And while sea transportation
remains by far the safest

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.660
mode over truck,
pipeline, and rail, when

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.420
spills occur in the ocean the
consequences are very high.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.360
So today I'll talk
about the system

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.570
we've developed to protect
the ocean from people,

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.460
and specifically the
challenging scenario

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.095
when oil spills at sea.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.910
So I like to start
with this photo

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.905
when I'm explaining the purpose
and the goal of the Coast

00:31:54.905 --> 00:31:56.530
Guard's marine
environmental protection

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.640
mission and our national
contingency plan for spills.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.630
He's a little
alarming, isn't he?

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.130
It's a very young pelican,
four weeks old to be exact.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.440
And I use this very photo
to try and inspire my team,

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.850
during the Coast
Guard's response

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.920
to the largest marine oil spill
in history, Deepwater Horizon.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.700
I had never seen a
baby brown pelican

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.460
before I was deployed
to Venice, Louisiana,

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:23.290
for that entire summer
beginning in the spring of 2010.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:28.450
I had actually never
been really to the Gulf.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.885
And that spill, of
course, was the result

00:32:30.885 --> 00:32:33.010
of the catastrophic explosion
and loss of the drill

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.970
rig named Deepwater Horizon.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.390
And we should never talk
about this epic oil spill

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.390
without mentioning first the
tragic loss of 11 drill workers

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.450
who were killed that day.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.190
Most Coast Guard
cases include several

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:47.560
of our maritime missions
that bleed into one another

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.500
during a large scale response.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.020
That event began with a
desperate mayday call,

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.120
and an immense search
and rescue response

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.730
that I won't talk about today.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.460
But it ultimately morphed into
a massive oil spill response

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.870
and accident investigation.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:05.080
And all, simultaneously,
these were

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.500
responsibilities and
priorities for the Coast Guard.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.050
It was estimated that more
than 200 million gallons of oil

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:15.460
spilled before BP was able to
cap the well after 87 days.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.130
It was an operation unlike
any we had ever seen.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.980
Back to our baby
pelican on his nest

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.420
in the mangroves
of Breton Island

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.520
off the coast of Louisiana.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.280
I remember tacking this
photo up in the command post,

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.840
and it prompted my
operations section

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:34.090
chief to walk over and say,
that's one ugly bird, ma'am.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.650
It looks like pteradactyl
ghost from Scooby Doo.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.230
But if that's what we're here
to protect, then I'm on it.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:44.050
You see Coasties are life savers
by nature, even when we're

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:46.030
talking about pelican lives.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.940
Our mission that summer
was sobering-- to protect

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:52.000
Plaquemines Parish, the
closest point of land

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.490
to the oil spill 40 miles away.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:57.490
It's home to the Delta
National Wildlife Refuge.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.950
Plaquemines is comprised
of 40,000 acres

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:03.160
of highly sensitive marsh, home
to countless species of fish,

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.800
waterfowl, marine
reptiles, and mammals

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.880
and nursery for their offspring.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.900
I was Incident
Commander for that area,

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.820
with a team of 800 responders
including 150 Coast Guard

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.690
Members.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:16.520
The stakes were very high.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.520
One of our many marine
environmentally sensitive

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:23.080
areas, amidst that entire
sensitive marshland,

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.560
was Breton Island, home
to this pelican chick

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.650
who was born after the spill
as the oil was spreading out

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:33.948
across the water and
threatening the island.

00:34:33.948 --> 00:34:35.739
It was our job to
protect him and thousands

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:37.449
of pelicans and
other bird species

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.850
that made that precious
habitat their home.

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.810
So I'm going to come back
to him a little bit later.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:47.480
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill
was unique in many respects,

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.460
including the source of the
spill from an offshore rig.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.980
We were used to ships
being the source of spill.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.590
The challenge in
securing that source--

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.170
it's always our first
priority, secure the source.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:03.210
We could not secure the source,
an unimaginable volume of oil

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:06.744
from a well with a seemingly
unlimited capacity.

00:35:06.744 --> 00:35:08.410
The timing of the
spill was particularly

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.710
problematic in regard
to wildlife impacts,

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.920
during the vibrant spring
season in the Gulf.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.840
It was hard from every
perspective-- scientifically,

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.020
politically, and psychologically
to the people of the Gulf,

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.560
who had suffered greatly
from Hurricane Katrina.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.400
However, this catastrophe
showed that the nation's system

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.690
of preparing for and
responding to oil spills

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.730
is ultimately sound, even under
the most extreme circumstances.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.320
And it's designed to optimize
the devastating impacts

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.000
of any spill.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.210
That's not to say there weren't
lasting impacts of this spill

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.440
or any oil spill
for that matter.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.090
Once oil spills into the water,
we are in a losing proposition,

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:48.790
so I won't sugarcoat it.

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:50.980
Just one example,
Audubon estimates

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.540
that a million
coastal birds died

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.520
as a result of the
Deepwater Horizon spill.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.830
There were many, many
other catastrophic effects.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.270
That's just one.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:01.302
Prevention is the only true
answer to an oil spill.

00:36:01.302 --> 00:36:03.760
And this is one in which the
Coast Guard is highly invested

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.384
in intensive regulation
of the shipping

00:36:05.384 --> 00:36:07.090
industry and its safety.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.490
But as long as oil is
our primary energy source

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:12.430
and human factors exist,
accidents will happen

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:16.030
and even if less
frequently, oil will spill.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:17.740
Without the system
in place to respond

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.830
to spills that has existed
for the past 25 years,

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:25.720
I submit that the outcome
would have been a lot worse.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.260
Deepwater Horizon drew a
grand total of 47,000 federal,

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.930
state, and local responders,
including 68 Coast Guard

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:35.680
personnel and dozens of Coast
Guard aircraft and cutters,

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.400
and many other agency aircraft
and National Guardsmen.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.470
Across the five Gulf
states that were impacted,

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.450
responders recovered
35 million gallons

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.940
of oil, millions of
pounds of oil debris

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.650
from 900 miles of
beach, and deployed

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:52.810
2,000 miles of containment boom
to protect sensitive habitat.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.090
The spill redefined every
measure of our nation's

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.590
response capability.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.440
And yet its impact on
our national system

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.650
was not as profound as
a much smaller spill,

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:06.650
still groundbreaking, that
had occurred 20 years before.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.610
And many of you know this,
the Exxon Valdez in 1989

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.130
at the very beginning of
my Coast Guard career.

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.350
Although 20 times
smaller than Deepwater,

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.690
it insured the creation
of a system that

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.450
was absolutely critical to
managing the massive Gulf Coast

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.414
disaster.

00:37:21.414 --> 00:37:23.080
To fully grasp the
Coast Guard's efforts

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.074
to protect the ocean
from oil spills and man,

00:37:26.074 --> 00:37:28.240
you have to understand the
significance of the Exxon

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.830
Valdez event.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.690
After running
aground on Bligh Reef

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:33.700
and spilling 11 million
gallons of heavy crude

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:38.980
into Alaska's pristine
Prince William Sound in 1989,

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.560
a slow and challenged
response was the catalyst

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.350
for creating stricter
and a systematic approach

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:46.390
to environmental disasters.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:48.130
For the nation and
the Coast Guard,

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:50.590
it served as a basis for the
emergence of a stronger regime

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.834
to drastically improve
the shipment of oil

00:37:52.834 --> 00:37:55.000
and the way oil spills are
handled both on the water

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.950
and in the courtroom.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:00.460
18 months after the
event, in August of 1990,

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.960
Congress amended
the Clean Water Act

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.540
by passing the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.250
This changed the
way we did business,

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:09.010
creating a comprehensive
prevention, response,

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.110
liability, and
compensation regime

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:13.690
to deal with spills from
ships and facilities

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:16.155
into the navigable US waters.

00:38:16.155 --> 00:38:18.280
The Oil Pollution Act
brought significant advances,

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.240
such as setting new requirements
for vessel construction, crew

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.740
licensing, and manning.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.070
Most notably, it
mandated double hulls

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.530
for oil tank ships,
a second wall

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.960
with a buffer encapsulating
the cargo to prevent damage

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.150
from collision or grounding.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.660
The latest-- I'm sorry,
the last single hull ship

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.970
were phased out of
operation just last year,

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.737
25 years after the
milestone spill.

00:38:42.737 --> 00:38:45.070
The law significantly broadened
financial responsibility

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.000
requirements.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.490
It specified that the
spiller would pay.

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:50.350
It seems obvious, right?

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.000
Now companies would
be required to pay

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.560
for cleanup and
compensation, all

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.910
liable for costs and damages.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.090
It imposed stiffer civil
and criminal penalties,

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.520
and even jail time
for certain spills.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.040
The regulations tightened
the authority of the federal

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.130
on scene coordinator to oversee
spill response and preparedness

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.785
activities at the local level.

00:39:07.785 --> 00:39:09.910
The Coast Guard is the
federal on scene coordinator

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:13.990
in the coastal zone, the
EPA in the inland zone.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.700
This approach in and of itself
was well ahead of its time

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.310
and remains a model
for integrating

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:21.520
all involved parties into
the response organization.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.800
As federal on scene
coordinator, the Coast Guard

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.020
acts as that honest
broker, bringing together

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.870
all the stakeholders
with different skill sets

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:31.810
to solve this
unsolvable problem.

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:33.310
And this happens
before the spill,

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.830
which is critical during
the preparedness piece.

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:40.210
This ensures a viable plan
for oil spill response.

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:43.090
That includes frequent
exercises to enhance readiness

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.200
for a spill.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.780
In each port, the Coast
Guard shares something

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.340
called the area committee.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.840
The co-chair comes
from the state,

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.840
in this case the Mass
Environmental Department.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.670
Committee members
include federal, state,

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.950
and local environmental
agencies, and importantly,

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.770
the maritime industry is on
the hot seat, particularly

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.780
oil companies and transporters.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.770
It also includes non-government
organizations, nonprofits,

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.990
scientists from academia
and from industry,

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:10.390
as well as tribal reps
that all come to the table

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.612
to plan ahead for a spill.

00:40:12.612 --> 00:40:14.320
If a spill actually
occurs, these players

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.700
come together, but now with
some familiarity, and a plan.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.900
The Coast Guard, the state,
and the responsible party

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.850
form a unified
command in the event

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.080
of a spill, where
the Coast Guard holds

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.310
51% of the vote on
response decisions.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.790
But it takes full advantage of
the spiller's typically vast

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.190
resources to resolve the issue.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.840
They write the checks.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.970
Again, oil spills
are messy events.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:43.120
But there is a way to
optimize the outcome

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.030
and best mitigate
environmental damage.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.220
If we get to that
point, we are positioned

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.620
to do that, having
prepared in advance

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.840
and educated the industry
on the expectation

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.990
for an aggressive response.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:58.150
As a rule, most members
of the Coast Guard

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.240
do not have extensive training
in the science of oil spills.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.550
What we do have is military
training-- training

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.970
to lead in crisis, training
to bring order to chaos.

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:08.650
As the federal on
scene coordinator,

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.110
I don't have to be the
smartest person in the room,

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.670
and that's lucky for all of you.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:15.460
What I do need to do is know
how to find the smartest person

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.359
and bring them to the table.

00:41:17.359 --> 00:41:19.150
And we have a good
track record of bringing

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.240
similar and disparate groups
together and drawing out

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.050
the most positive solutions.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:25.900
It's not about command control.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.630
You do need command control when
you're doing law enforcement

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:30.850
or when you're conducting
military operations.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.450
But it doesn't works for
environmental response.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.560
There we work to build
trust and consensus,

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.600
to break down stovepipes
and parochialisms,

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.240
to maintain the big picture.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.040
The Coast Guard
has a similar role

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.170
facilitating research
and development efforts

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.360
across the interagency
for oil spills response,

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.730
again not being a scientist.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:52.060
We have a voice as well in
the international regime,

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.160
bringing together
and cultivating

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.364
mature relationships
via long agreements

00:41:56.364 --> 00:41:58.780
that we've had to coordinate
planning, training exercises,

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.340
and spill response
with our neighbors

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.740
to the north in
Canada and in Mexico.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:06.370
And now, a big focus with
Russia in the Arctic,

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:08.920
because of all the oil moving
through the very sensitive

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.740
Arctic, and in the Caribbean
and with the Panama Canal

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.210
authority.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:14.597
All of these
efforts are integral

00:42:14.597 --> 00:42:16.930
to a marine environmental
protection program and process

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.210
that combines proactive
planning, disciplined

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:21.220
exercising, and
collaborative response

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.850
as well as rigorous study and
resolution of lessons learned.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:27.370
We try to take every
spill and learn

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.890
from where we made mistakes.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.900
And the greatest
challenge is to balance

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.570
all of that and the work
to protect the environment

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.390
with balance of the
facilitation of commerce,

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:41.140
which is absolutely something
we have to do in this country.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.270
The marine transportation
system is the lifeblood

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:44.860
of our national economy.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.680
More than 2 billion gallons of
oil and liquified natural gas

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.800
come by ship into the
port of Boston every year.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.700
Those tank ships transit
across Stellwagen Bank, an 800

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.310
plus square mile marine
sanctuary and feeding grounds

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.370
for whales just 25
miles east of Boston.

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:03.940
All the jet fuel for Logan
Airport comes right into Boston

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.820
through its very rigid
navigable channels

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:12.190
and delivered to Sunoco on
the very narrow Chelsea Creek.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.179
Oil spills remain
a daily threat,

00:43:14.179 --> 00:43:15.970
but our prevention and
preparedness efforts

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.500
have reduced the
risk considerably.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.220
We continue to work together,
the public and private sectors

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.390
and academia.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.925
Partnerships are paramount.

00:43:23.925 --> 00:43:26.050
Through these efforts,
we've seen a marked decrease

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:28.240
in the annual number of spills.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.090
We have less than a third of the
number of spills we experienced

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:33.490
in the mid-'90s, and spill
quantities have dropped

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:37.900
considerably, with the exception
of a few really big ones.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.940
From the early '90s
to present, an average

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.440
of three gallons
of oil were spilled

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.710
for every 1 million
gallons of oil transported.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:46.600
Fewer spills means
fewer opportunities

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.860
to train and refine our response
practices during actual spills.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.670
So that's a downside,
but those are

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.650
good tradeoffs in my opinion.

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.380
So that makes exercising
even more important than ever

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.180
to keep sharp and ready.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.580
This past summer, we held
one of our area committee

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.860
meetings and a tabletop
exercise to test

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.620
our response to a spill
in Stellwagen Bank

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:06.730
during the whale season.

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:07.570
It's unthinkable.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:10.570
It raised innumerable
concerns and conversations

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:13.060
about tradeoffs that
we continue to tackle.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.040
We must continuously
question our techniques

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.590
to push for continued
improvements in R&amp;D for spill

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:20.110
response technologies
and to unfailingly

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:21.730
invest in partnerships.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.450
Our goal is to ensure we retain
the expertise to prevent,

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:27.835
prepare for, and
respond when necessary,

00:44:27.835 --> 00:44:30.790
so we can recover from future
incidents in an increasingly

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:33.820
complex national and global
operating environment.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:39.550
So let's return to the pelican
chicks on Black Breton Island.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:42.010
In our command post,
around the table

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:45.220
I had every federal
agency that might

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:49.600
have a stake in the spill--
EPA, US Fish and Wildlife,

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.280
the National Guard.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.190
I had the parish
representatives.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:55.450
I had the State of Louisiana.

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:57.100
Everyone's around the table.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.347
Everyone's raising their issues.

00:44:59.347 --> 00:45:01.180
The representative from
US Fish and Wildlife

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.730
was responsible for the island
and the National Wildlife

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:04.900
Refuge.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.480
As incident
commander, he asked me

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.360
to prioritize the island
and its protection,

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.940
as it was anticipated that
oil would be washing ashore

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.051
in the coming days during these
absolutely critical point.

00:45:16.051 --> 00:45:17.800
And there were frankly
too many priorities

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.900
to balance, but his
voice at the table

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.930
and what was at stake compelled
us to redouble our efforts.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:25.270
With three layers of containment
boom and near 24 hour

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:27.550
monitoring due to the
dynamic environment there,

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:28.932
we did just that.

00:45:28.932 --> 00:45:31.390
And while there were reports
of pelicans on the island that

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.370
had been oiled, it
was actually limited

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:35.380
to those that had
flown off shore to feed

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.234
and had returned contaminated.

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:38.650
Because of our
collective efforts,

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:41.310
oil did not reach the shores
of Breton Island or the pelican

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.510
nests in a detrimental way.

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:46.360
In the bottom photo you
can see just how many

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.989
birds inhabit this island.

00:45:48.989 --> 00:45:50.530
I mean that's just
one stretch of it.

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:53.590
There are pelicans,
sandwich terns, gulls.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:56.170
If birds freak you out, this
is not where you want to be.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:58.900
But it was absolutely
fascinating.

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.890
And in the background, you can
barely see this black stretch

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:05.680
is our oil containment
boom, one layer of it.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.360
It was a very large
Navy boom that

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.675
was part of our tiered
protection system.

00:46:10.675 --> 00:46:12.550
So that summer, the Fish
and Wildlife Service

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:15.250
had planned to cancel the annual
banding of juvenile pelicans,

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:17.140
fearing the added stress
on top of the spill

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.240
would be catastrophic
to the colony.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.842
But because the island
remained protected in the end,

00:46:21.842 --> 00:46:23.800
they were able to reschedule
the banding, which

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.620
would prove critical and
provide data in the coming years

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.250
that they absolutely needed.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:30.880
I got the unique chance to
step out of the command post

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.320
and assist in banding.

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.030
And it was a prime
opportunity to reflect

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:35.296
on the reason we were there.

00:46:35.296 --> 00:46:36.670
My partner from
Fish and Wildlife

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.010
invited me to come along and
it changed my perspective

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:40.720
inordinately.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.682
There were many failures
during the spill,

00:46:42.682 --> 00:46:44.890
volumes of lessons learned
from our response efforts.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:47.140
But we did enjoy
some small successes.

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.870
Despite the heavy wildlife
losses since that time,

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:51.550
Fish and Wildlife
report some good news

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:54.409
regarding breeding
birds on Breton Island.

00:46:54.409 --> 00:46:56.950
The number of colonial nesting
seabirds nesting on the island

00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:58.810
has generally increased.

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:02.400
In the year following the spill,
over 8,500 brown pelican nests

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.020
and over 120,000 tern
nests were documented

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.760
on the refuge, which represents
the largest number of pelican

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.600
nests recorded since Hurricane
Katrina, and the largest number

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.730
of tern nests in over a decade.

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:14.410
This is just a small
example of how much

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:16.989
we have at stake in protecting
our oceans from people.

00:47:16.989 --> 00:47:19.030
The Coast Guard will remain
committed and focused

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:22.300
on this important mission
and priority for our nation.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.890
Thank you for being here today.

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:25.480
It represents the
commitment that you

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.640
show for protecting our oceans.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.284
And we would love to answer any
questions that you have now.

00:47:30.284 --> 00:47:39.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:42.540
- So thank you, Claudia
and Captain Gelzer

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.850
and Commander Titus.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:47.100
So we have a microphone here.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.890
We're actually
recording this live.

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:52.020
So if you have a
question, raise your hand,

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:57.360
and we'll pass around
the microphone.

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.550
Actually I have,
OK, here's one here.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:01.380
Let me ask one question
first, since I get

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.150
the prerogative of doing that.

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:07.860
So I understand the
SAR models for drift.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:11.340
But I was kind of curious for
the oil spill-- predicting

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:14.610
where the oil might go
and spread-- are there

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:16.120
any models for this?

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.250
- Yeah, we're fortunate.

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:19.110
The Coast Guard
has a relationship

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:22.140
with NOAA, the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.370
Administration.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:27.420
And every Coast Guard
area, every district,

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.280
like Lee explained,
from Maine to New York

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.380
has a NOAA scientific
support coordinator

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.630
that is assigned to us,
because we're not scientists,

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.070
as our science adviser.

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:37.740
And NOAA has highly
sophisticated models that they

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.900
run on spill trajectories.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:43.222
And we've had great success
trying to anticipate

00:48:43.222 --> 00:48:44.430
where things are going to go.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.800
- OK, so as a
follow up question,

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.150
this is partly because
of the course I teach.

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:53.490
I teach my students
about ocean currents.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:56.070
And so there are a
lot of simulations

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:57.490
and actually tracking data.

00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:59.940
So I see the Atlantic
currents, there's

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.010
like a loop that goes
through the Gulf Stream.

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:05.760
Or that goes through the Gulf
and then out around Florida.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.360
Was there a thought or a concern
that there was a possibility

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.990
that the Deepwater Horizon
oil might have gotten

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.710
caught in one of those vortices?

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.500
- That was a huge concern.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.750
And we had, at the
national level,

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.869
we had all the agencies
sit around the table

00:49:20.869 --> 00:49:22.410
and the National
Response Team, which

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:24.990
is made up of all the federal
agencies with a stake.

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:26.430
And NOAA is a big voice on that.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.770
And that concern of
catching in a loop current.

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:31.680
They anticipated that it could
go up as far as North Carolina

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.200
and beyond.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.610
And so they kept
watching that, and they

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:38.647
had a plan for how to mitigate.

00:49:38.647 --> 00:49:39.980
But it didn't end up doing that.

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.767
- No, good.

00:49:41.767 --> 00:49:43.100
So we have a question over here.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.290
- Great, thank you.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.830
A compliment and a question,
or a thanks and a question.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:50.760
My wife and I actually
traveled down to the Gulf

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:54.000
during the spill as
part of a task force

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.600
from the New England Aquarium,
observing what was going on.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.740
And we were on Grand Isle.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.890
I just have to say
that what we observed

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:04.680
in terms of the efforts on
the part of the people there

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.470
and the cleanup coordinated
by you was really tremendous.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:10.530
It was like a war zone.

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:14.070
And an amazing amount of
work was getting done.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:16.530
So thank you for
your efforts on that.

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.310
- Do you think you could write
a letter to Anderson Cooper?

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:20.976
- I'm happy to write
a letter to whoever

00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:23.340
you think ought to get one.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.640
Secondly, I'm worried
about the Arctic.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.930
And I wonder what sort
of international rapid--

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:34.560
because you know, it's a
complicated sovereignty issue--

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.260
what kind of rapid
response assets

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.420
are in place for a spill.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.540
And I understand the Coast Guard
is somewhat shy on icebreakers.

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.871
Could you comment?

00:50:43.871 --> 00:50:44.370
- Sure.

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:46.710
And we are.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:50.040
We have one ice
breaker, and we are

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.350
hoping to have more
in the coming decade.

00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:55.710
But there's been
a tremendous focus

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:58.840
on planning for
Arctic spill response.

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.100
And as you know, there
have been efforts and hopes

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.140
and plans to drill
in the Arctic.

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.600
And having worked at our
national level program,

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.940
I'm here to tell
you that responding

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.930
to a spill in the Arctic is
like responding on the moon.

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:16.260
And it is really the tyranny of
the distance and the weather,

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.770
the dynamic weather, and
the cold water temperatures.

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.260
And that is not to say
that we are not continually

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:25.110
looking and working on
research and development

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:28.980
and working with our partner
agencies and the Bureau

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.980
of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement, which

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:36.150
looks at whether or not to
issue the permits to drill.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:38.430
We've done a number
of exercises,

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:40.410
bringing together the
Alaskan government.

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:43.650
And we are working with
other Arctic nations

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.320
on these really tough questions.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.540
And there are plans in place.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:50.820
And we really look
to the industry

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.950
to provide the
response capability.

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:55.129
And if they want
to be able to do it

00:51:55.129 --> 00:51:56.670
and they get the
permission to do it,

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:57.930
then the onus is on them.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:59.550
But so much of
the infrastructure

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:01.980
doesn't even exist, to
bring the materials in

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.050
or to bring the people
and the responders in.

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:06.210
So tons of tough
questions on that.

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:07.950
And you know it's
really something

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:13.260
to keep a close eye on
and to watch and monitor.

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:18.689
And I think it's one of those
very, very, very tough things.

00:52:18.689 --> 00:52:20.730
Because responding to an
oil spill under the best

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:22.890
of conditions is really hard.

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:25.410
So we continue to
grapple with that.

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:27.630
And we work very hard
on the prevention piece

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:30.600
and making sure that we're
doing these inspections

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.720
and making sure ships are safe.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.980
And so that's really what
we're very, very much

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.380
focused on and continue to
work on the other piece.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:41.370
But there's a lot of study
and good work going on.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:42.750
Thank you.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:44.540
- Chris?

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.610
- Hi, thank you for those
very nice presentations.

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:53.550
My question is how much
drones, unmanned drones may be

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:58.180
changing your own operations?

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:01.380
Are they, you know, likely to
be game changers in the way

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:05.430
that you do things, or
are they just not going

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.445
to be very useful in
the kinds of weather

00:53:07.445 --> 00:53:10.290
that you often
have to deal with?

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:13.530
- Well, I think they actually
would be very useful just

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:16.440
to be able to have
consistent presence watching

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.820
both from environmental response
as well as search and rescue.

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.160
It's really the
issue of time that we

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.130
can stay on scene
maintaining communications,

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.110
maintaining visibility.

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.600
To be completely
honest, at this point

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:36.116
we are not allowed to
use unmanned aircraft.

00:53:36.116 --> 00:53:38.490
It's a regulatory issue at
this point for the government.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.470
So I hope that--

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:45.300
- And that's something I think
the Coast Guard is working on,

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.950
to try to get through that.

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.350
Because this is technology
that we should be fully taking

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:49.980
advantage of.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.620
And from the oil
spill response part,

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.500
on the ice breaker that we
have that we put scientists

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.570
on going up in the Arctic,
they are experimenting

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:01.410
with the use of drones and
for our spill response, which

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:04.562
would be phenomenal considering
the risks of putting aircraft

00:54:04.562 --> 00:54:05.520
up in that environment.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.890
So there's certainly
some testing going on.

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:11.900
And I know the industry is
also putting a lot of emphasis

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.867
on those capabilities.

00:54:16.356 --> 00:54:17.730
- Actually, it's
sort of related.

00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:19.372
I'm really curious
about sort of some

00:54:19.372 --> 00:54:21.330
of your favorite interesting
research projects.

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:23.700
Whether that's with groups
around here or in Woods Hole.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.241
Do you have any sort
of favorite ones

00:54:25.241 --> 00:54:27.960
that you want to highlight?

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.359
- In regard to search
and rescue or--

00:54:30.359 --> 00:54:31.150
- Sort of anything.

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:35.280
I have no idea what the Coast
Guard does research into.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.546
More along the
lines of sort of I

00:54:37.546 --> 00:54:39.045
guess very low level
basic research.

00:54:39.045 --> 00:54:40.520
Do you know what I mean?

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.820
- So one that I would say
I think is we have a number

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.340
of partnerships with partner
agencies who also have a stake

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:51.600
in spill response--
EPA and BSEE.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:57.120
And BSEE manages a burn
pan down in Alabama

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.740
that we're working
to test you know

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:02.220
how to more effectively burn
oil, which has tradeoffs

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.030
as well, air tradeoffs.

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:07.050
But that's one big project.

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:09.630
Our R&amp;D center is in
Groton, Connecticut,

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:13.320
and having a two
years out of the job

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.820
where I was really
focused on that.

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:19.236
But it might be that I need
to get back get back to you

00:55:19.236 --> 00:55:21.360
on sort of what the latest
and greatest is in terms

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.820
of what they're looking at.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:26.130
But burning oil and obviously
looking really closely

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:28.507
at the impacts of
using dispersants.

00:55:32.403 --> 00:55:35.920
- There's one back here
and then one up here.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.630
- This is about rescue.

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:39.310
I'm just curious.

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:42.700
You've pointed out
rescue operations

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.250
where people who seem to
know what they're doing

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:46.510
get in trouble.

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:50.530
And on land, with hiking
and mountaineering and stuff

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:55.390
like that, there's just a
lot of very careless stuff--

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:57.670
that the people don't
prepare properly.

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:00.340
They run out in
sneakers and stuff.

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:02.590
And then, the next thing
you know they're in trouble.

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:06.380
But they also risk the
lives of the rescuers.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.340
Can you give us an
idea of proportion?

00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:11.505
Do you get a lot of
that stuff on sea?

00:56:11.505 --> 00:56:14.150
Do you see what I mean?

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:15.450
It's a little cynical.

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:18.360
- I mean I've got my
thoughts, but you--

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.360
- I'll be honest,
it's just so dynamic,

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.620
the weather conditions.

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.780
And if we just take
our region here.

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.530
I mean even on a
beautiful summer day.

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:30.030
I mean it can be
gorgeous all day long.

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:33.420
And then we get a we get
a fast cell come through,

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:36.660
and we have five, six
boats going aground.

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.330
Or we have somebody
taking on water,

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:41.130
but the weather's been
perfect all day long.

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:42.840
So I'm not going
to call that person

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.150
was due to their inexperience.

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:48.360
I think people just
get caught unaware.

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:53.550
I think that the conditions
overwhelm people so quickly.

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:55.340
Captain, go ahead.

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:57.420
- So that I think
that's very much true

00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:00.120
and we've had marine events
where we have big kayak

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.490
or stand up paddle races.

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:04.350
And without any warning the
storm system will change

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:07.630
and suddenly we've got
40 people in the water.

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:09.955
And so you know that can happen.

00:57:09.955 --> 00:57:12.330
What I think we experience
that I think most people don't

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:15.300
realize is this is
obviously a beautiful area

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.360
with wonderful summers and
lots of recreational kayakers

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:24.030
and stand up paddlers
and really what we end up

00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:26.820
doing is we end up
looking for everyone

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.950
that ends up being a mystery.

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:33.260
If your kayak blows
off of your dock,

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:37.950
and you don't know it-- so
you're just out at the mall--

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:42.380
the Coast Guard is going to look
for you for days potentially.

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:46.160
And so we are always
pushing for-- just realize,

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.030
we always assume the worst.

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:49.280
And we have our calculation.

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.730
And we will run
our drift models.

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:53.100
And it doesn't matter
what, day time or how long.

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.760
And we're going to look
until we get an answer.

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.100
And it's hard on the kayaks,
because with boats, small boats

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.242
that have hull numbers.

00:58:00.242 --> 00:58:01.700
We can figure out
who the owner is.

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.110
But if you don't put your
name and number on your kayak,

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.680
then there's a lot of
assets and resources

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.550
and aircraft and people
risking their lives

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:10.527
to look for somebody
who's not even in trouble.

00:58:10.527 --> 00:58:12.610
So that's the only other
thing I'd say about that.

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:14.610
But we do have people who
I think really greatly

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.180
underestimate the
power of this area

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:19.650
and how treacherous
the waters are,

00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:22.200
and they're just not
necessarily loaded for bear

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.430
when they go out there.

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:24.390
- I'd say that's right.

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:28.160
- I'll attest, may
I give a personal?

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:35.100
So in 2003, I was paddling in
Nantucket Sound, sunny skies.

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:37.620
It was October, so
the water temperature

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.960
was about 53 degrees.

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:44.660
I did notice it and I put
on a wetsuit to go out.

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:47.130
I was paddling,
about half an hour

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:51.720
later huge fog bank comes in
and basically just blank out,

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.920
can't see a darn thing.

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.450
I noticed the wind
direction, so I

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:56.310
used that as kind
of a natural compass

00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:57.620
and found my way back to shore.

00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:02.280
But the next day I went out
paddling and the harbor master

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:06.030
stopped me and asked if I'd
seen two young women in kayaks.

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:08.070
And they had launched
exactly the same time

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:10.860
I'd launched in sunny weather.

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:12.900
They were wearing bathing
suits and t-shirts

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.890
in relational kayaks.

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:15.390
They told their
boyfriends they were

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:17.070
going to be back in 10 minutes.

00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:20.920
After 45, 50 minutes,
they didn't return.

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.820
This was when the
fog was really thick.

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:26.660
And then a massive search
and rescue was triggered.

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.010
Everybody with a boat was
out there in the water.

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:31.755
And that day I saw a
Coast Guard helicopter

00:59:31.755 --> 00:59:34.320
was going up and
down, presumably

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.680
using the drift models to
figure out where to search.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:42.320
And they found the two
kayaks tied together.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.079
No women.

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:45.120
And then the next day,
they found the body of one

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.480
of the young women, never
found the body of the other.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:52.470
That was a case where, if the
fog hadn't rolled in suddenly,

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:54.360
they probably would
have been just fine.

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.120
But not being
dressed for immersion

00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.600
was clearly a contributory
factor, and the swift change

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.460
in conditions.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.360
And so it was basically
sort of two things

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.120
that compounded themselves.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.960
So that's my own
personal experience.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.870
And then I went to town with
safety equipment and everything

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:16.220
at that point, because
I escaped with my life.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.260
And you know I wasn't
going to risk it again.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.225
So that's my own
personal anecdote.

01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:21.450
We had a question up here.

01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:27.840
- You talked about the
fortunately relatively few

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.360
incidents you have
to train against.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.550
To what extent are you
using simulation technology.

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:35.200
I mean I certainly
know that aircrews

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:42.140
do, but in a more, in a
larger more macro sense.

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.160
- For oil spills?

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.465
- Yeah.

01:00:45.465 --> 01:00:48.550
- We're limited on what we
can actually put in the water,

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:51.110
if you mean like physically.

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:54.340
We do some simulation.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.590
But at the national
level, they're

01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:59.590
really trying to get
permission in certain areas

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:02.380
to actually spill
oil, so that we

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:05.405
can practice responding
to it in the safest

01:01:05.405 --> 01:01:06.280
possible environment.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.780
They do this in other countries.

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.310
And we really need
to do it in order

01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:11.995
to be able to-- in
New Jersey, there's

01:01:11.995 --> 01:01:14.680
a really cool oil
spill facility that's

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.690
a big pool that's run by BSEE.

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:18.455
And we do a lot
of work with them

01:01:18.455 --> 01:01:20.830
to try to figure out which
technologies and skimmers work

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:22.030
the best.

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:23.980
But for small spills,
even locally, we

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.850
might simulate just so that
when we're testing industry,

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.350
because that's what we do, we
go out to industry and we say,

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:29.850
guess what?

01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:32.650
You have an unscheduled drill.

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:35.820
You just spilled 2,100
gallons, Exxon, go.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.770
And so sometimes we'll pour
peat moss or something in there

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:41.170
so they can actually be
chasing something in reality.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:44.050
But you know we're
somewhat limited on how

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:45.084
we simulate spills.

01:01:45.084 --> 01:01:46.500
- What about digital
technologies?

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.182
- And I'd say that our NOAA
scientific support coordinator

01:01:49.182 --> 01:01:50.890
can help us with that
because they always

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:53.740
do provide these trajectories
about where the oil might go.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.500
And so we definitely take
full advantage of the digital

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.624
and the scientific
way of doing it.

01:01:59.624 --> 01:02:00.890
- Question right there, yeah.

01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:01.974
Can you just pass it over?

01:02:01.974 --> 01:02:02.473
Yeah.

01:02:02.473 --> 01:02:04.510
- I just had a question
about other contaminants

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:05.080
in the water.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.004
So my specific idea was
maybe fracking contaminants.

01:02:08.004 --> 01:02:09.920
And you know that hasn't
really hit the oceans

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.660
as far as I know.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.080
It's relatively new.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.640
What are you guys-- are
you planning for that?

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.280
Or is that not really
on your radar at all?

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.360
- Right, so all of that kind of
change in how we're extracting

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.630
oil-- it isn't really impacting
Massachusetts so much.

01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:28.750
But a lot of those oils
are being carried by rail.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:31.360
So even in New York on the
Hudson there's threats.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.890
And there's lots of focus.

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:36.220
And we have really
changed our response plans

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:40.087
to try to ensure that we know--
because those materials they

01:02:40.087 --> 01:02:41.920
react a little bit
differently on the water.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.780
And they're a little
higher volatility.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:46.510
And so that has absolutely
been looked at nationwide

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:47.230
and continues.

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.420
We have a continued
challenge there

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:52.780
because we had a lot of rail
accidents there for a while.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.100
And a lot of times
they go over the water.

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.040
And so that's
definitely something

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.340
we look at and in
fact, it just happens

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.690
that right now those
commodities are not

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:04.860
coming through our area.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.030
But some chemicals
are going by rail,

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.760
and so we also
look in those areas

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.489
where they come over waterways.

01:03:11.489 --> 01:03:13.780
And we have chemical response
techniques and procedures

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.154
that we're constantly
working on.

01:03:15.154 --> 01:03:16.780
But the fracking
oil is something

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:21.120
that we're absolutely focused
on the last three years.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.219
- Do you have time for one
last, well, two last questions.

01:03:24.219 --> 01:03:24.760
Two hands up.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.300
So let's go with those.

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.250
- This is for Captain Gelzer.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:32.770
So obviously you
mentioned that prevention

01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:37.540
is the best strategy of all.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.990
And you mentioned that we
were successful in going

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:44.650
from single hulled to
double hulled vessels.

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:48.880
But since Deepwater
Horizon, I understand

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.920
that before Deepwater
Horizon, there

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.110
was a requirement in
many other countries

01:03:53.110 --> 01:03:56.680
to provide a relief well.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.880
Have we implemented
mandatory relief wells

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.460
in the United States?

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:07.870
- So that again is
the BSEE, the agency

01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:09.760
that was Minerals
Management Service that

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.250
was split back off
so there wouldn't

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:16.180
be a conflict between
the agency that

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.430
sold the leases and the
agency that enforced

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:20.470
the response, that
is an issue, that

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:22.840
is their responsibility
and their issue.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.670
And I think they
are in fact working

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:27.370
on that and in this case
I think, as you know,

01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:29.770
they believed that
that was the case.

01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:30.790
But it wasn't in fact.

01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:33.220
But all of those issues
are being worked.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.590
I mean the Coast
Guard, that is--

01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:38.260
we don't have that oversight.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.000
We do inspect the drill rig.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.220
But we don't inspect any of
the under sea and under water,

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:51.580
but BSEE is-- and it's the
Bureau of Ocean Enforcement

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:55.270
Management, BOEM, is the other
part of that split off that are

01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:56.350
looking at those issues.

01:04:56.350 --> 01:05:00.400
So I mean those are really
important, critical issues.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.200
And they're doing more
exercises and making sure

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.800
that they test
those capabilities.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.730
- I was just curious
about how involved

01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:16.690
the Coast Guard is with global
climate change, sea level rise?

01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:20.570
Is How do you get
involved with that?

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:23.110
And then, what is the
voice that the Coast

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:28.862
Guard has at the federal
level about your concerns?

01:05:28.862 --> 01:05:31.880
- [INAUDIBLE] Do
you have an answer?

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.717
Yes, so.

01:05:33.717 --> 01:05:35.050
- Locally, we won't [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:35.549
- Right.

01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:38.200
And we're at the
local level working

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.210
on all sorts of
emergency response plans.

01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:41.770
And we are working
with the state

01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:45.160
and the local
municipalities to make sure

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.550
that we would combine
forces for response

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:51.010
to ocean level
rising, floodings.

01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:53.110
You know we're always
in the game on that.

01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:55.720
We also have a seat at
the ocean planning table,

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.600
but it's more of the coastal
zone management planners

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.030
and it falls a little
bit out of our purview.

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:06.790
We don't have the key
voice in that conversation.

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:11.500
We're responders
and we're planners.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:16.360
But you know we're definitely
at the table and very involved

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.030
in any emergency
response-type planning.

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:21.220
But you know there's
big, big issues that

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:25.450
are facing any coastal
area, and certainly Boston

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:28.960
has huge challenges.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.030
- OK, so let's thank the
Captain and Commander again.
