00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:24.891 size:78% position:61%
Has an adult asked you,
"What do you want to be?"

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:28.661 align:start position:0%
That's a really tough question.
I'm only in middle school.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.997
Each of us have strengths.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:34.934
Superpowers help find out
what is important to us.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.702
So what are they?

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:39.639
And how do kids
find a career?

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:42.308 align:start size:69% position:31%
We'll help you explore
those superpowers.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:46.812 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you use them every day,
work might not seem like work.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:51.050
Let's meet people at Qualcomm's
World of Work and get started.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.319
Take it away, Team!

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.221 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> (woman)
 Good morning, good morning.</i>

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.190
<i> Welcome to Qualcomm.</i>

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.226 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> (man)
 We're in
 the World of Work room.</i>

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.728 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> All students start
 their experience here</i>

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.296
<i> at the Thinkabit Lab.</i>

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:07.233 align:start position:0%
Essentially,
it's a place for kids

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:11.937 align:start position:0%
to learn about work and all
the careers we have at Qualcomm.

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:15.541
<i> Who would know that there are
 engineers, marketers, lawyers,</i>

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.810 size:81% position:41%
<i>and people who work in HR.</i>

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
<i>There's people
that work in facilities,</i>

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.015 align:start position:0%
<i>plumbers, electricians,
all kinds of different jobs.</i>

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:26.385 align:start position:0%
<i>So how do you find out
about those careers?</i>

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:29.389 align:start position:0%
<i>You come to
the World of Work room.</i>

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.128 align:start position:0%
People, as they get older,
they want great jobs.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:38.130 align:start position:0%
They want to be excited
about their work.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
You're going to work,
on average,

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.768 align:start position:0%
60,000 hours
in your lifetime.

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:46.506 align:start position:0%
That's a long time.
Let's do some simple math.

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:50.376 align:start position:0%
<i>The average individual works
2,080 hours a year,</i>

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:53.746 align:start position:0%
<i>and you're probably
going to work for 30 years.</i>

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.382 align:start position:0%
<i>Right there,
you get 60,000 hours.</i>

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.852 align:start position:0%
<i>So if you start
thinking about it earlier,</i>

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:04.157 size:88% position:44%
<i>you may have a better chance
of finding that sweet job,</i>

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.426
<i>the thing that really fits you.</i>

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:12.265 align:start size:88% position:13%
We do an exercise on various
careers here at Qualcomm,

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.934 align:start size:56% position:44%
but you can also
find these careers

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:18.671 size:78% position:61%
at large tech companies
all throughout the world.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:22.742 align:start size:59% position:41%
<i> So they'll get
 a ring of careers.</i>

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.344 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> They'll look
 at these careers.</i>

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:27.980 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> They might identify
 with the career title.</i>

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.118 align:start position:0%
<i>(Ed)
When you go from
the job title on the front</i>

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
<i>and look on the back,</i>

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.889 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>you're going to see
a job description</i>

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.059 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>that tells you about
what they would do,</i>

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.528 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>wages, how much
these people make,</i>

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.830 line:0%
<i>like what do these people earn.</i>

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.833 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>Is that job expected
to be in demand?</i>

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:50.469 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>What kind of degree
do I need?</i>

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.974 line:0%
<i>Do I need a four-year degree,
a master's, or maybe a PhD?</i>

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:58.344 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>Do I want to be
in school that long?</i>

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:01.548 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>That's a question
you need to ask yourself.</i>

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.419 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> (Jennifer)
 I'm going to read
 statements, okay?</i>

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.523 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> If feel like, "Yeah,
 that sounds like me,"</i>

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:11.824 align:start size:63% position:38%
<i> then stay standing.</i>

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.827 align:start size:72% position:28%
If you're like,
"No, that's not for me,

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:18.531 align:start size:69% position:31%
I'm not interested,"
then just take a seat.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:23.970 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> Once you've taken a seat,
 you can't stand back up, okay?</i>

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.407 align:start position:0%
<i>(Ed)
The stand-up exercise
is something we do every day.</i>

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:33.011 align:start position:0%
As you're seeing people at work
performing their jobs,

00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
you might want
to be thinking,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.751 align:start position:0%
"Is this a stand-up
or sit-down for me?"

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:43.056 align:start position:0%
<i>(Jennifer)
"I see myself wearing a uniform
every day to work."</i>

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:51.730 align:start size:63% position:38%
"I like that I'll be
walking and standing

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.700 size:84% position:58%
throughout my day at work."

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:57.936 align:start size:31% position:69% line:0%
"I am okay

00:03:57.936 --> 00:04:03.175 size:84% position:58% line:0%
with having to work nights,
weekends, and holidays."

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:07.780
[laughter]

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.815 align:start size:56% position:44% line:0%
"I can make
critical decisions

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:12.652 align:start size:63% position:38% line:0%
if someone's life
is depending on me."

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:15.221 align:start size:63% position:38% line:0%
And the last prompt,

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:19.859 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
"I can handle seeing someone
if they're in pain."

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.928 align:start size:56% position:44%
[laughs]
So the two
that are standing,

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:26.298 align:start size:84% position:16%
what do you think
potentially this career is?

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:30.002 align:start size:91% position:9%
Like a doctor
or a hospital medic.

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:31.336 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> Excellent, excellent.</i>

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:34.340 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> It is a critical care nurse.
 Great job.</i>

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.343 align:start position:0%
The world of work
is all around you.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
How do we notice
what's happening around us?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.549 align:start position:0%
And you can be
asking yourself,

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
"Is this a stand-up for me
or a sit-down?"

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.188
It's always okay to sit down.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:52.191 align:start position:0%
It's always okay
to sit on the sidelines.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:55.961 align:start position:0%
But it's important to
put yourself out on the field

00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
and stand up and say,
"That's for me."

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:07.606 align:start position:0%
On your whiteboard,
make three different categories.

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:11.010 align:start size:91% position:9%
It's going to be strengths,
interests, and values.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.979 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> If there was a career
 or opportunity</i>

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.615
<i> that you might be
 interested in now,</i>

00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:20.386
<i> if you had to get a job today,</i>

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:24.290
what might be some things
that would interest you?

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.060 align:start size:91% position:9%
When I say<i> strengths,</i>
it's what are you good at.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.763 align:start size:81% position:19%
What are you good at?
Be selfish.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:34.433 line:78%
Really dream big.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:34.433 align:start position:0%
<i>(Ed)
Strengths are found in all.</i>

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:38.604 align:start position:0%
Sometimes it's hard to
figure out what we are good at.

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:40.473 size:84% position:42%
Are people telling us that?

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:44.243 align:start position:0%
Know what you do well.
That's what a strength is.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:48.914
Make a list, maybe like three
or four different strengths.

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:51.417
I have over here
some examples.

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:54.053 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you're an achiever--
you make lists

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:57.423
and talk about things
you want to aspire to--

00:05:57.423 --> 00:06:00.859
you're probably categorized as
someone who likes to achieve.

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:03.596
If responsibility is
very important to you,

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:05.097
you follow the rules

00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:08.934 align:start size:88% position:13%
or make sure that
we're all taken care of,

00:06:08.934 --> 00:06:11.570 align:start size:78% position:22%
that might be
a strength of yours

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.774 align:start size:63% position:38%
that makes you maybe
a little bit unique.

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:18.010 size:78% position:61%
<i> It could be something
 you've done really well,</i>

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.013 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> whether it's in school,
 with your family,</i>

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:23.548 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> whether it's with
 your friends,</i>

00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:26.918 align:start size:50% position:50%
<i> it's with
 your community.</i>

00:06:26.918 --> 00:06:29.322
What's one of your strengths?

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:30.957 align:start size:44% position:56% line:78%
Yeah.

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:30.957 size:84% position:58%
Math.

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:33.359 align:start size:66% position:34%
You enjoy math.
Excellent, excellent.

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:36.028 align:start size:91% position:9% line:71%
Quick thinking

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:36.028 align:start size:72% position:28%
You're a sharp thinker.
Great.

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:38.097 align:start position:0% line:78%
Risk taking.

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:38.097 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> Taking risks.</i>

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:39.432 align:start size:81% position:19%
Research.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.033 align:start size:47% position:53%
Doing research.
Okay.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:44.537 align:start position:0%
Interests are things we love,
things we care about.

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:48.374 align:start position:0%
Do we like working with animals,
with people, with numbers?

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:51.911 align:start position:0%
Those are the questions
you should be asking yourself.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.547 align:start position:0%
What do I find myself
doing regularly?

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:57.216 align:start position:0%
Do I take things apart,
like machines?

00:06:57.216 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0% line:0%
Do I like math? Do I like
baking, cooking, or dancing?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.158 align:start position:0% line:0%
Those are clues to things
we want to do later in life.

00:07:06.158 --> 00:07:09.996 align:start size:81% position:19%
If you could give me three
or four various interests,

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:12.698 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> in a career lens,</i>

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:19.204 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> if you thought of a job,
 what might that be?</i>

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:21.607
What are your interests? Yeah.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.008 align:start size:50% position:50% line:78%
Engineering.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.008 align:start size:66% position:34%
Engineering, okay.

00:07:23.008 --> 00:07:24.877 align:start size:47% position:53% line:78%
Yeah.

00:07:23.008 --> 00:07:24.877 size:81% position:41%
Coast Guard or Navy.

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:26.879 align:start size:53% position:47%
You're interested
in the Navy.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.447 size:75% position:38%
Programming or hardware.

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:31.184 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> Programming or interested
 in working with hardware.</i>

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:34.687 size:78% position:39% line:78%
Marine biology.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:34.687 align:start size:59% position:41%
Marine biology.

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:37.723 align:start size:59% position:41% line:71%
Military and vet.

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:37.723 align:start size:66% position:34%
Military and
being a veterinarian.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:40.393 align:start size:88% position:13%
These are your interests.
They might change.

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:43.662 align:start size:66% position:34%
And the last category
is values, okay?

00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:45.931
This is what's important to you.

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:47.900
What's like a deal breaker?

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.870 align:start size:91% position:9%
When I said working nights,
weekends, and holidays,

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.573
some of you sat down
immediately, right?

00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:58.243
That might be flexible
and might not bother you.

00:07:58.243 --> 00:08:04.050
Maybe you want to do nights
and weekends for double pay.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start size:88% position:13%
Everyone's going to have
different values.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.386 align:start size:81% position:19%
If work-life balance
is important

00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:10.823
or spending time with family,

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:13.893
write down some of
your personal values.

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:18.397 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is in a lens of a career.
Values in a career.

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:23.368 align:start position:0%
Maybe you want to work for
a company that makes an impact.

00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:28.274
It is doing good in the world.
Something that's a value to you.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:33.278
Values are those nonnegotiables
that we have sometimes in life,

00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:36.782 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have to

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:39.819 align:start position:0%
give up things
that are important to us.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:42.888 align:start position:0%
Knowing how you're wired
around your values

00:08:42.888 --> 00:08:44.790 size:78% position:39%
also gives you some clues

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.993 align:start position:0%
to what job
might be right for you.

00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:50.596
Each of you have
different values.

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:53.298 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> Give me two or three
 different values</i>

00:08:53.298 --> 00:08:56.468 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> that would be
 very important to you</i>

00:08:56.468 --> 00:08:59.572 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> at your job
 or at your career.</i>

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:06.712 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> All right, looks like
 we've got a great long list.</i>

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.247
What are some values?

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:11.883 align:start position:0%
If needed,
take risks for others.

00:09:11.883 --> 00:09:13.386 align:start size:56% position:44%
Okay, in the back.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:17.322 align:start size:91% position:9%
How about getting
the same pay as men?

00:09:17.322 --> 00:09:20.392 align:start size:81% position:19%
All right, that's a value.
Excellent.

00:09:20.392 --> 00:09:23.028 align:start size:81% position:19% line:71%
Teamwork?

00:09:20.392 --> 00:09:23.028 size:84% position:58%
Teamwork.
Excellent

00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:26.231 size:81% position:41% line:78%
Making people happy.

00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:26.231 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> Making people happy.</i>

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:28.167 align:start size:81% position:19%
You have three
distinct categories.

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.203 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is you right now.
It might change.

00:09:31.203 --> 00:09:34.773 align:start size:91% position:9%
I can guarantee
when you're in high school,

00:09:34.773 --> 00:09:37.043
it might change,
and that's okay.

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:40.813
The whole goal of this is
to take a self-assessment

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:43.982 align:start size:78% position:22%
of who you are now
and see like,

00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:45.850
"This is important to me.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.487
"This is a career I aspire to.

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:51.857 align:start size:97% position:3%
"This is something I'm good at
and confident in.

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start size:84% position:16%
Someone's told me that.
It feels right."

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.364 align:start position:0%
The big takeaway is that
this could be a reality for you.

00:09:59.364 --> 00:10:02.367
When you're in your
dream job or career,

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:04.837 align:start size:88% position:13%
not looking at the watch,
feeling like,

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:08.740
"When do I get to go home?"
and you're just being you,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.376
that's when you've aligned
your strengths, interests,

00:10:11.376 --> 00:10:12.811
and values.

00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:14.713
That should be the goal.

00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:16.982
You've worked hard
on your education

00:10:16.982 --> 00:10:20.018
to deploy those talents,
to express your interests,

00:10:20.018 --> 00:10:23.388 align:start size:94% position:6%
and to make sure your values
are being matched

00:10:23.388 --> 00:10:25.424
wherever you're working.

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:31.964 align:start position:0%
Whether we're out at
a restaurant or sporting event,

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:36.201 size:84% position:42%
somebody is working there
as part of that experience.

00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
So we've learned to take note.
Who's doing what?

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:42.107
Who's doing what really well?

00:10:42.107 --> 00:10:46.645 align:start position:0%
Is there anything that someone's
doing that might interest me?

00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:51.049 size:88% position:44%
Anytime you leave your front
door, keep your eyes open,

00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:54.186 align:start position:0%
and you might find a job
that's interesting.

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:57.890 align:start size:88% position:13%
When you're going throughout
your day observing,

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.859 align:start size:81% position:19%
whether it's your teacher,
family member,

00:11:00.859 --> 00:11:02.928 align:start size:81% position:19%
when you're out and about,

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:07.132 align:start position:0%
when you someone happy, joyful,
and engaged in their work,

00:11:07.132 --> 00:11:10.903 align:start size:94% position:6%
it's important to take note of
and what is it.

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:14.272 align:start size:78% position:22%
Why are they engaged?
What makes them so happy?

00:11:14.272 --> 00:11:17.276 align:start position:0%
If you want to know
about a career

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
and want to ask an adult,
just ask politely.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:23.015 size:75% position:38%
An adult is just waiting

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:27.953 align:start position:0%
to be able to answer
a question about their career.

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:30.355 align:start position:0%
As a student,
you're missing opportunities

00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:34.526 size:88% position:44%
if you're not willing to ask
a teacher or your principal,

00:11:34.526 --> 00:11:38.664 align:start position:0%
maybe a friend of your mom
and dad or your family,

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:43.802 align:start position:0%
ask them, "Do you like your job?
How did you get your job?

00:11:43.802 --> 00:11:46.438 align:start position:0%
"What do you hate
about your job?

00:11:46.438 --> 00:11:50.209 align:start position:0%
"If there was one thing
you hate about your job,

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.710 align:start position:0%
what would it be?"

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.981 align:start position:0%
You want to learn all about
the good and the bad.

00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:59.818 align:start position:0%
Adults are waiting to get
that question from a student.

00:11:59.818 --> 00:12:04.389 align:start size:50% position:50% line:71%
Thanks, Team.

00:11:59.818 --> 00:12:04.389 align:start position:0%
Thanks for hanging out with us
to learn about careers.

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:07.426 align:start size:94% position:6%
Hopefully you learned simple
things to help decide

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:09.695 align:start size:78% position:22%
your direction
in the work world.

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:13.098 align:start size:88% position:13%
When someone asks,
"What do you want to be?"

00:12:13.098 --> 00:12:16.868
you'll have tools to use
to help figure it out.

00:12:16.868 --> 00:12:18.537 align:start size:56% position:44%
See you next time.
