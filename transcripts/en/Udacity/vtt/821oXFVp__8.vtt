00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.300
We just used one method for factoring this polynomial right here, 5x squared

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.759
minus 28x minus 12. And because I know that factoring polynomials that don't

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.175
have leading coefficient of 1 is a little bit tricky, I want to take a second to

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:17.384
go more in-depth into the logic of figuring out what numbers belong in our

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:21.641
linear factors. Saying that a polynomial like this one, of degree 2, is

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:26.162
factorable, it means that we can write it in this form. As two linear factors,

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:30.592
or factors with an x to the first power in them, multiplied together. And the

00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:35.060
general form of a linear factor is just like this. You have some coefficient

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.545
times x plus some constant term, what we've been talking about is how to figure

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:43.893
out what numbers belong here. Now, of course, one way to do this is to factor by

00:00:43.893 --> 00:00:48.117
grouping like we have been that entailed expanding this middle term into two

00:00:48.117 --> 00:00:52.539
terms that added together to equal it and then grouping pairs of terms together,

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.631
so considering this first pair as a chunk, and the second pair as a separate

00:00:56.631 --> 00:01:00.855
chunk, and pulling the greatest common factor that we can out of either those

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:05.233
pairs. This is why we call this factoring by grouping, because we're grouping

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:09.332
these terms and grouping these terms. We can use a slightly different kind of

00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:13.451
logic though, to get to the same answer. If we've already written out the form

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:17.050
that we want the equation to end up in, we can look directly at what we might

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.062
want from these different coefficients and constant terms based on what we start

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:24.751
out with. We know that the way we end up with this x squared term here is by

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.680
multiplying the term with an x to the first power from each binomial in it. So,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.392
that means that whatever the coefficient is here, multiplied by this

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:36.717
coefficient, must equal 5. We can write out all the different factors of 5, we

00:01:36.717 --> 00:01:40.924
can either have 1 times 5 or we could have negative 1 times negative 5. Now,

00:01:40.924 --> 00:01:45.279
another thing we know is that the two constant terms multiplied together, equal

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:49.786
the constant term in the original expression. So, we can think about the factors

00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:54.090
of negative 12 as well. There are a ton of different ones here. I guess I will

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.608
write them all out though just for your pleasure, and voila, there we go. I hope

00:01:58.608 --> 00:02:02.361
I didn't miss any. Now we know that the way we get this negative 28, the

00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:06.585
coefficient of the middle term here, is by multiplying whatever this number is

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:11.215
times this number. And then, adding that to this number times this number. That

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:15.759
means, we are going to have either 5 times some number plus 1 times some number

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.877
equals to negative 28 or for the other pair over here, negative 5 times

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:24.687
something minus 1 times something equals negative 28. Now, since I rather have

00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:29.712
two positive coefficients for x having the two negative ones, let's just select

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:34.112
to use 5 equals 1 time 5. This makes our job a lot easier because that only

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:38.731
leaves 1 combination of factors over here that we can plug in. You just have to

00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:42.591
figure out which one it is. And, of course, as we already saw in the previous

00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:46.262
quiz, we know that this has to be negative 6 and this has to be positive 2. I

00:02:46.262 --> 00:02:50.614
can fill in the coefficients in front of the x's, and then since I know that the

00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:55.170
two outer terms multiply when we're trying to find this middle coefficient, and

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.386
the negative 6 goes in this slot, and the 2 goes in this slot, since the inner

00:02:59.386 --> 00:03:01.694
terms are contributing to this as well.
