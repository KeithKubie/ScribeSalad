ya know what I mean so it could work but

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:33.980
ya know what I mean so it could work but
 

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.500
ya know what I mean so it could work but
I couldn't figure out a way to do it

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:35.510
I couldn't figure out a way to do it

and still don't kind of realize that -
 

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.299
and still don't kind of realize that -
that's why I went back to more

00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:40.309
that's why I went back to more
 

00:27:40.309 --> 00:27:43.060
that's why I went back to more
traditional formulaic tendencies with

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:43.070

that Rocky fans are used to and you can
still add a bunch of new things in there

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:51.470
still add a bunch of new things in there
 

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.770
still add a bunch of new things in there
but you have to kind of keep that step

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:53.780
but you have to kind of keep that step
 

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.980
but you have to kind of keep that step
by step thing going you know the time to

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:56.990
by step thing going you know the time to
 

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.870
by step thing going you know the time to
have done it without an actual fight

00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880

small window where it's it's like okay
 

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.669
small window where it's it's like okay
are we gonna change the formula or we

00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679
are we gonna change the formula or we
 

00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:07.870
are we gonna change the formula or we
gonna do the same thing again again and

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:07.880
gonna do the same thing again again and
 

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.460
gonna do the same thing again again and
what happens is they got pigeon-holed

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:09.470
what happens is they got pigeon-holed
 

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.590
what happens is they got pigeon-holed
where they did this one two three four

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600
where they did this one two three four
 

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.130
where they did this one two three four
times in a row yeah and and that's the

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:15.140
times in a row yeah and and that's the
 

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.220
times in a row yeah and and that's the
thing like the later ones

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:17.230
thing like the later ones
 

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:20.230
