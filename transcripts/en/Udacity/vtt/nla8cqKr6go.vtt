00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.226
Let's turn to our menu example. And some people think that McDowell's Mansion of

00:00:04.226 --> 00:00:08.034
Metameat is a fairly one dimensional restaurant, but they actually have not only

00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:11.945
main dishes. What we sometimes call entrees, although, that means entry in the

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.773
US, I guess because it comes before dessert or because Americans don't know how

00:00:15.773 --> 00:00:19.528
to eat. But in addition to main dishes, they have side dishes. So, this means we

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:23.730
want two different types. We want a type for representing a main dish and we

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.650
want a type for representing an appetizer. Whether or not you find Fried Python

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.900
appetizing is up to you. But the important differences are a main dish can have

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.450
sides, an appetizer doesn't have sides and a main dish is designed to serve one

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.813
person, whereas an appetizer may serve may people. That means, we want to have

00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:45.003
an attribute for an appetizer that indicates how many people it serves. We could

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.943
try to represent all of this with one dish type, but that could get kind of

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:51.177
unwieldy, we'd have lots of code doing different things, depending on whether

00:00:51.177 --> 00:00:54.330
its a main dish or appetizer. So, instead we're going to define separate

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.123
classes, one for representing a main dish and one for representing an appetizer.
