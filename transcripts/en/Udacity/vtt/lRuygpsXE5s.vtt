00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.810
Donald Wallace introduced the Hollywood Principle for

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.180
object oriented frameworks. These frameworks consist of a set of

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.300
abstract classes together with rules for the ways in which,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.660
their concrete subclasses may interact. These rules suggest that calls should be

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.290
made from the framework to client classes, rather than the other way around.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.580
The pattern of frameworks calling clients is the opposite of the situation where

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.500
normally a client would call the resources in a library. Hence the principle is

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.810
also called inversion of control. Wallace dubbed the principle the Hollywood

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.070
principle, after the supposed response by a Hollywood producer, to yet

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.790
another unsolicited screenplay. Don't call us, we'll call you.
