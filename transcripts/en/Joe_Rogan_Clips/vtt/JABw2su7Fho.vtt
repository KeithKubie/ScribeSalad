00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.720
It's,
that's what's so crazy is that things are so fucking blurry.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.390
It's hard to see the troll sometimes.
Oh yeah.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.610
And so there in lies the big problem.
I mean,

4
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:12.240
my brother might be one of the most notorious,

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.510
not notorious the wrong word,
because he,
he liked kind of hides in the shadows,

6
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:20.040
but he's done.
Some of my brother cloned a w,
I can't remember which website.

7
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.040
He cloned a website,
right?
The actually the,
yes man recently did this low,

8
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:25.860
I can post copied perfectly.

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.700
And he wrote an article about how a new strain of marijuana was discovered.

10
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:30.920
Cannabis Australia's.

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.190
He said that he was the dean at the University of Sydney or something like that.

12
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.850
Who was dating Popstar Meghan trainor.
Just the most ridiculous thing.

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.110
And that he said,
we need to find a female plant.
So far,
this what we have,

14
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:47.460
it's groundbreaking.
It's so,
so he did this very clever,
very clever thing.

15
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.820
He bought a domain name that was something like calm-guest.info.

16
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.300
That's the URL.
He then created a sub domain.
So it's like,
you know,

17
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:00.030
just hypothetically cnn.com dash gassed.

18
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.210
The average person just see cnn.com right.
They assume it's real.

19
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.790
I don't know how he shared it,
but he,
he makes this whole,

20
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.430
it's all ridiculous man.
I got to say if you thought it was real,

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.280
I got a bridge to sell you high times,
picked it up.

22
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.110
It got 50,000 shares.
Breakthrough new strain of marijuana.
Discovered.

23
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.410
My brother was just laughing the whole time and I was like,
what did you do?

24
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.900
Like my brothers,
like my opposite,
you know,

25
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:25.770
I try to be honest to the best of my ability I you can,
you know,
I think,

26
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.630
you know,
people accused me of being a liar.
That's not fair.

27
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:30.720
I could be wrong for sure,
but I try my best to be rational.

28
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.230
My brother on the other hand is like editing videos,

29
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:35.460
making them ridiculous as possible.

30
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:39.510
He made another video where it's crazy cause he tries to make sure people,

31
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.160
it's over the top.
He made a video where it's a van getting pulled over.

32
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.450
It looks like a police Dash Cam.
And then the cop walks up to the car,

33
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.370
checks the guy's license,
walks back,

34
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.660
and then the driver releases pot on a balloon and then an air points.

35
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:56.560
So it saying stash,
like he's disposing ms drugs with helium balloon.

36
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:59.640
So they fly away and then the cop runs up firing guns at it.

37
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.210
This thing got hundreds of millions of views.
It was on Facebook every other day.

38
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:04.020
It's,

39
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.190
it was like he made it four years ago or something and I saw it on Instagram

40
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.610
like two weeks ago and I was like,
dude.
And I showed him,
people think it's real.

41
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.700
Like it's,
it's the craziest,
but he,
he,
you know,
yeah.
I don't know.
So,

42
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.300
so much fucked up stuff that is real.
It's so hard to differentiate.
What I mean,

43
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.810
hold on.
Like let's,
let's throw some shade at high times.
Like when they did this,

44
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.850
you,
they said they,
they,

45
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:28.470
when they corrected the article and saying it was a hoax,

46
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.080
they said we wanted to call for a verification,

47
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:32.970
but we thought the story was too hot to pass up.
