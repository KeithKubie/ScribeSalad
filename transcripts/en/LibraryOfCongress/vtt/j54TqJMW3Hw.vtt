00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.420
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.050


00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.853
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and welcome
to the Fiction Pavilion.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.073
I suspect that welcome as
redundant 'cause I suspect many

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.343
of you have been glued
to your seats all day.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.576
My name is Jonathan Yardley.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.976
I'm the book critic

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.643
of the Washington Post
which is-- [Applause].

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.710


00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.343
Thank you very much.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.430
The Post has been, since
its inception in 19--

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.656
2001, the Post has been an avid
and very influential supporter

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.186
of the National Book Festival
and we'll continue to be as long

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.480
as the book festival exists, which
I suspect will be a very long time.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.496
Four years ago, in the course
of my reviewing duties,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.706
I stumbled across the bound
galley proofs of a book called,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.153
"The Dream Life of Sukhanov."

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
I have never heard of
its author, Olga Grushin

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.800
and I'm not particularly well versed
in contemporary fiction coming

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.443
out of what was until
recently the Soviet Union.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.093
But this looked like a particularly
interesting and provocative book.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.973
And it turned out to be really
one of the best works of fiction

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.920
that I have read in
a very long time.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.936
I ended up choosing it as one
of my best books of the year.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.256
And I can assure you that
come December of this year,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.196
I will be choosing Olga Grushin's
second novel, "The Line,"

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.600
as one of my best books of the year.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.236
It seems to-- she makes
me think of Joseph Conrad.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.716
She writes beautiful English in
what was not her native language.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.120
She was born in Moscow
and she, rather than I,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.096
is going to tell you a bit about
her absolutely fascinating life.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.650
Olga?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000


00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.150
[ Applause]

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.800
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.066
It's an honor to be here.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.333
Thank you so much for coming.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.933
And thank you so much for
this wonderful introduction.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.800
I feel that anything
that will follow

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.100
from you will probably
diminish my image as a writer

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.990
in everyone's eyes, so the best
thing to do probably is to just get

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.530
up and proceed to the signing.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.530
But, I'll try.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.040
[Laughter] I was born in Russia
and-- in a family of writers.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.366
So, I always knew that
I wanted to write.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.046
I come from 3 generations
of nonfictional writers,

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.143
journalists, and scholars.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.086
My first auditory memory
really was my father banging

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.720
on his manual typewriter and
my mother closing the door

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.746
to his study saying,
"Father is working."

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.430
And I knew from the time when I was
a baby that working meant writing.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.786
So for me, this was really
part of my genetic makeup.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.750
I learned to read and write
when I was very young, 4 or 5,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.533
mainly by pestering my much older
brother, then in high school,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.100
as he was trying to do his homework.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.986
And then, I proceeded to
write my first short stories

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.613
and fairy tales and poems.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640
And there is a well-acknowledged
tendency of first time novelist

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.686
to turn to autobiographical
material for their first novel.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.006
And my first novel, "The Dream
Life of Sukhanov" which came

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.633
out 4 years ago used
Moscow of the '80s which is

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.016
where I grew up as the background.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.673
But really, it didn't have any
other autobiographical similarities

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.760
with my life that protagonist is a
56-year-old artist, a man who gives

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.940
up his art to become an art
critic, a kind of a bureaucrat

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.973
from the arts under pressure.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.393
And people sometimes ask
me, "How did you manage

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.103
to avoid the whole autobiographical
impulse with your first book?"

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.830
Well the truth is I didn't.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.096
The really first book that I
wrote was published when I was 7.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.133
We had a family tradition.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.486
Every year, starting when I was 7,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.546
I would write a book
length work of fiction.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.440
And my father would
type it up and bind it.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.226
I would illustrate it.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.026
And we would give it to
my mother on her birthday.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.523
And that first story was called,
"The Tale of a Lazy Princess."

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.416
And in this story, there was a
princess who really didn't want

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.243
to learn how to make her bed and
how to cook her family breakfast.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.880
Until her father, who was a very
stern king, makes her do it.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.323
And then, later on she gets
kidnapped by a dragon who threatens

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.483
to eat her unless she
cooks his breakfast.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.910
And if she burns his omelet,
she will be in trouble.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.776
So, that stands her on good stead.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.576
So this was very autobiographical,
except for the dragon part.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.690
[Laughter] And everything
else was quite true.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.266
So, I always knew that
I wanted to write.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.893
What I did not know was that
I would write in English.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.733
And that came about
quite unexpectedly.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.553
After I graduated from high school,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.933
I enrolled at the Moscow
State University.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.200
Of course, at Journalism
Department which is what everyone

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.346
in my family-- literally everyone,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.480
father and mother,
brother, had done.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.300
But then, as was the height of
Perestroika, and it just so happened

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.736
that I was given a scholarship,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.533
or I was offered a
scholarship at Emory University.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.470
And this was in '89 and I would be
the first Soviet citizen to come

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.240
and get a 4-year American degree.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.223
And of course, it was an
opportunity that I couldn't refuse.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.610
So I came to America.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.543
And, then one thing led to another.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.330
I got a job.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.330
I got married.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.330
I had children.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.730
And throughout all these
time, I continued to write.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.730
Of course, it was a passion of mine.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.663
But I wrote in Russian and I wrote
as the Russian expression goes,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
into the drawer which basically
means for your own eyes only.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.383
And at some point, a couple
of years after graduation,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.613
it suddenly occurred to me that if
I really wanted to pursue my dream

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.866
and if I really wanted
to see myself published,

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.480
I would have to switch languages.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.280
And this came when I
was about 23 or 24.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.416
And then I started thinking about
what writing really meant to me

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.903
or what made a great work
of literature on my mind.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:52.280
And to me, there have
to be 2 things.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.390
One is a powerful story, and
by that, I don't mean a plot.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.863
A plot is very nice.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.120
It goes back to the whole
tradition of writer as entertainer.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.376
You know, people sitting around
the fire after a successful hunt,

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.433
eating their fresh burro,
whatever and listening to the tale

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.366
of [inaudible], The Mighty fighting
the giant or something like that

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.773
and wondering what bated breath if
the giant is gonna get [inaudible]

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.786
or [inaudible] is going
to get the giant.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.520
So, there is that and
it's important.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.653
But what I mean by story is not the
outward plot, but the inner story

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.633
which to me really means the
story of a human soul on trial,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.250
the search for a meaning
of life, if you will.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.630
And let's not settle for less.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.003
It's kind of what great literature
boils down to in my mind.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.443
But the other no-less
important aspect is language.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.536
I think language is the
way we organize our world.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.536
And if you as a writer are hoping
to create your own artistic world,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.203
you have to start with language.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.370
You have to reinvent
it, recreate it,

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.170
and come up with a
language uniquely your own.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.903
And at this point, I have
worked on precisely that,

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.653
crafting my own language
for almost 2 decades

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.670
but in a different
language, in Russian.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.036
And so it was quite
traumatic, and at first,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.106
devastating to suddenly give it up

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.996
and start literally
from scratch, from zero.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.346
But then, I felt this really
doesn't have to be a drawback.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.180
This does not have to
be an impoverishment.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.220
This could be a enrichment,
in a way.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.086
I could try to bring my Russian
culture and my Russian traditions

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.723
and the Russian language
into what I do in English.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.460
And I will say a couple of
words about my recent novel.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.690
My most recent novel
is called, "The Line."

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.830
It was published this year.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.726
And it was inspired
by a real life story.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.506
Both of my novels are set in Russia,
although this one is set in a kind

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.540
of a dream escape of
Russia in a way.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.096
I was actually working

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.430
on a different book as
things often happen.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.280
I was researching what I
thought would be my second novel.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.060
And in the course of doing research,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.633
I came across this
astonishing true story,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.146
the visit of Igor Stravinsky
to Russia in 1962.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.526
I've heard details of it of
course growing up in Russia.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:07.696
But this was the first time I
sort of saw this story in print.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.450
Igor Stravinsky left Russia
in 1912 before the revolution.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.873
And he never went back.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.006
He spent his whole life in exile in
France and Switzerland and America.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.573
And when he was 80 years old,
Russia was undergoing the process

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800
of liberalization [inaudible].

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.496
And Khrushchev invited him
back for a series of concerts

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:33.836
for the first time in 50 years.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.036
This was to be his sort
of triumphant return home.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.750
When people in Leningrad heard that
he was coming to this performance,

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.843
they lined up to buy
tickets to the performance.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.323
And they 0waited a
line for the tickets

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.366
for a whole year and
that's a true story.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.813
They really waited for a year
to buy tickets to one concert.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.833
And that line emerged
as a sort of evolved

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.230
into this very elaborate system of
lists and kind of its organization.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.120
It became its microcosm with its own
leaders and its whole relationships.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.030
And I thought, what an amazing--
what a fascinating story.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:11.546
It's such a metaphor of a power
of art in our lives in many ways.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.713
And it touched so many
things in me, the--

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.316
Stravinsky's music which I love
because I love that whole period,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:22.596
the early 20th century Russia war.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.696
There was such a blossoming across
the arts and art and music and dance

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.110
and literature, and such brightness
that just suddenly exploded.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:34.220
But also that very
image of the line,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:36.740
it touched something in my youth.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.020
I waited in many lines when
I was growing up in Russia.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.526
But they were not the
lines that people hear

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.016
about when they think
of Soviet lines.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:45.923
There were not lines for
bread and toilet paper.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.976
The lines that I waited in
were-- are Perestroika lines.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.453
And they were the lines-- precise I
like the lines for Stravinsky ticket

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.046
when suddenly, we started getting
artists we've never seen before

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.073
and musicians we've
never heard before.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.340
&gt;&gt; And people would line up to
buy tickets to these concerts.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.020
And the atmosphere in these lines
were-- I mean, it was amazing.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.193
It was so palpable, the feeling that
you are next to kindred spirits.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.413
People who have the same interests
as you do, who are willing to give

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.486
up hours if not days of their time

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.293
to see a performance,
to see paintings.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.640
You met people in those lines.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.906
You talk to people.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:27.840
There was this air of excitement.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.773
You made friends.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.906
I met my first boyfriend
in a line just like that.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.173
And it's sort of--
it touched something

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.640
in me on this very deep level.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.190
And then I abandoned
very shortly the novel

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:40.643
that I thought I was researching
because this book would not let me--

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.936
this image of the line
would not stop haunting me.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.723
And I wondered about people who
would give up not just some hours,

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.876
but who would literally give
up a year of their life,

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.823
was it just their love of music?

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.356
Was there something more?

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:57.823
And what did they get in return?

00:10:59.690 --> 00:10:59.956
What did the line become for them?

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:02.400
At what point did it stop being this
collection of anonymous strangers

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.913
and became a community and
with its own friendships

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.746
and its own relationships

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.080
and its own antagonism,
it's own little world.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.796
And so, what I wrote is
not a historical novel.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.516
It is not set in '62 and the
composer is not Stravinsky.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.290
My composer's name is Igor Selensky.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.956
And it's kind of almost
like a parallel Russia.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:31.616
Because what I wanted to tell
is really a fable about hope,

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.163
a fable about our human desires.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.423
And I wanted to borrow elements
of the dark '30s and Russia,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.823
Stalinist oppressions, but
also this hopeful excited--

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.523
exciting '60s and also more
sort of a stagnant '70s

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:49.900
and I borrowed these elements from
different periods to suit my story.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.826
And at the heart of-- at the book,
there lies this mysterious kiosk.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.003
There's a very much an element
of absurdity in the book, Kafka,

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:03.313
or if you know the wonderful
Russian Soviet writer,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.933
Daniil Kharms who is one
of my favorites or Ionesco

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.056
or Beckett, always good people.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.136
There is the kiosk
that never quite opens

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.023
and people don't know
what it's going to sell

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:18.690
and someone appears every
once in a while in the kiosk.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:20.970
And there are rumors flying about

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:23.836
but no one quite knows
what is going to happen.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.436
And yet, they still wait.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.236
And then the rumor slowly
spreads about this concert,

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.043
a performance to be given
by this returning artist,

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.230
as returning composer of brilliance.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:35.560
And at the heart of the
book is a family of 4.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.006
There is a mysterious
grandmother who is silent, except,

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.823
she suddenly speaks up to years
of silence to request for a reason

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.916
that no one knows at first a
ticket to this performance.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.956
And then, there are 3 other
family members who wait and shifts

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.686
at the kiosk ostensibly
on her behalf.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.956
Her daughter Anna, a schoolteacher,
her daughter's husband,

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.886
who is a tuba player in a state band
but dreams of hearing great music,

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.093
and their teenage son, who
turned on the course of the book.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.140
And these 3 people who wait in line,

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.636
they are ostensibly getting
the ticket for the grandmother,

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.883
but in the course of the book, they
start wanting the ticket for or--

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.453
or half from the very beginning,
wanted the ticket for themselves,

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.066
for reasons of their own.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.353
And these reasons sort of developed
and eventually it's these sort

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.913
of clashing desires that form
much of the conflict of the book.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.806
And I think I'd like
to take some questions,

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.733
what I'll do right before questions
is I'll read just a very short

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.610
segment, just one page to
give you a taste for the book

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.696
and to show you how I sort of
draw on my Russian traditions

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.816
and pay tribute to
the Russian greats.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.276
This is a segment from the
first part of the book.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.520
The narrative alternates
between 3 different voices.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.333
There is the mother
Anna, the husband--

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:02.500
I mean the wife, the
husband and their son,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.656
and then the grandmother's
voice, just sort of weaves in

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.516
and out of the narrative.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.270
This section is the
husband's section, Sergei.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.586
He's the one who is in
a way a failed composer.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:16.646
He had childhood dreams of
composing beautiful music.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.406
He ends up playing tuba
in a dismal state band.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.746
He dreams of playing and
possibly creating beautiful music.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:29.813
So for him, this concert
becomes this possibility--

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:32.960
this window into the world
of music and art and beauty.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.733
And at this point, he's
waiting at the kiosk.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.336
Nothing happens.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.736
The kiosk is not open.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.336
There's not of any sign over it
and he gets up and walks away.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.003
And this is the segment and
for those of you who've read,

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:49.416
"War and Peace," you'll
recognize the illusion.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:52.823
There's a famous scene of Andrew
in a battlefield when he falls

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.490
down wounded and he
sees the sky above him.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:14:59.963
And he ignores the battle raging
around him and he notices the sky

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:03.373
and what he sees on
the sky is silence.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:05.630
So this is sort of my
paraphrase of Tolstoy's scene.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.143
[Pause] Sergei was already
at the next intersection

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.333
when a small beat-up
van labored past him.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.656
His heart quickening, he turned,
followed it with his eyes.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.930
The van pulled up to
the curb by the kiosk.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.526
He swallowed an incoherent thwarted
gasp and just as the dented door

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:28.880
of the van began to jerk open,
dashed back and instantly tripped

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:32.636
over his shoelaces and started to
fall, but somehow righted himself,

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:37.426
and vaulting forward, slipped
on the ice and fell again.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:39.593
And this time kept falling,
skidding, sliding in a flurry

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.566
of snow, closing his eyes against
the dazzling what confusion,

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.100
fully sprawled in his
back now, coming at last

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.086
to a blind whirling stop.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.140
For a moment, he did not move.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:59.083
Then deciding that nothing
was broken, he opened his eyes

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.316
and was just attempting to
scramble up when he saw the sky.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.710
The sky was pale and empty and vast.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.610
And it appeared to float ever higher

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.050
in transparent layers gradually
bleached of all blue tints

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.970
and shadows until at some
vertiginous unimaginable height,

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:22.250
it seemed to him bled of all color,
of all confusion, intense and pure

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.606
like the essence of one
sustained crystal note.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.416
He lays still and looked at it.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.213
The van door slammed shut,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:31.953
and 2 pairs of legs crossed his
appended horizon at odd angles.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.673
The first pair ending
with black shoes,

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.320
possibly imported, stepped over him.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:40.590
The second, clumsy
in felt boots circled

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.050
around encumbered by a ladder.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.256
Sergei looked at the sky.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.126
From somewhere above drifted a
scraping of wood against metal,

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.710
a preemptory voice issuing
commands, "Move to the left,

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.796
make sure it's not crooked."

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.943
And after a minute,
the blows of a hammer.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.636
Winter muffled each harsh burst

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.280
and cold snowy pockets before the
sounds could quite take their jagged

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.133
crow-like flights skyward.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.746
The sky did not reverberate.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.363
For it was immensely distant
and filter the brim with its

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.330
so unclear silent infinite music.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.046
When the banging stopped,

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.403
the 2 pairs of legs
swerved back around them.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:23.380
The door moaned an opening
and barked in closing.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.666
The motor sneezed and
coughed and sped going past.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.746
Then all was quiet.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.546
A couple of people from
the line helped him up.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.976
There was now a large sign
nailed above the kiosk.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.790
It announced in bleached blue
letters, concert tickets,

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.283
too faded to have been
freshly painted,

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.883
a man in off at the door
noted with disapproval.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.286
They must've taken it from some
old kiosk no longer in operation.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.700
Thank you.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000


00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.200
[ Applause ]

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.106
&gt;&gt; People who have questions
should come to the microphones

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.000
that are in these 2 aisles.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:10.733
And I would like to
start the question.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.333
Olga, did you learn English in
school in Moscow and if you did,

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.076
how fluent was your English
when you came to Atlanta?

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.046
&gt;&gt; Well, I actually
started learning French.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.556
In my family, my father spoke
French and my mother spoke English.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.336
And we, early on, sort of
a family council decided

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.600
that French would be my language.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:36.430
But luckily for me, I think my
father was a very impatient teacher.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.073
And after a few sessions,
we decided that, "No, no,

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.526
I'll do English instead."

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.326
And my mother was a lot--
a lot more patient with me.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.193
So, there was a little bit at home.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.560
And then I started going to school
and we did have some English.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.230
But eventually, I ended up at a
wonderful sort of special school

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:58.633
with a concentration in English
and we had very intensive English.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.626
So, my English was fairly good.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.523
I would say by the time I
came, definitely not fluent.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:07.860
And I definitely struggled at first.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.986
And I mean, I could understand
everything but it was far

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.706
from being what I wanted it to be.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.173
And now when I reread my old college
papers, I am amazed with the amount

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.293
of basic grammar mistakes that
I made with those course, so.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.363
&gt;&gt; You said you were--
you went to speak--

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:28.140
you went to, you know,
start to write English.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:30.893
Now we're seeing a-- many
authors, they are being translated

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.343
from foreign languages into English,
have you ever thought instead

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.156
of changing English to start is just
translate some of your older books

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.543
or did you need to write with them?

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.323
&gt;&gt; You know, I thought about it.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.056
And actually that was
the first thing I did.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.190
I tried many different things.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.190
It was a very painful process.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.573
One of the things I did to switch to
English is I had this idea inspired

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.006
by Nabokov, learning the dictionary
from A to Z which is not a thing

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.753
to do and not recommended.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.353
&gt;&gt; He did it and I actually
made it through the Zs.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.483
And I always think if at any
point, anyone does a sort

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:10.286
of a scholarly study
of my vocabulary,

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.563
they will find an unusual
concentration

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.723
of obscure words starting with
As and Bs and maybe a little bit

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.763
of Cs and then it tapers off.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.103
[Laughter] So there was that
and then, what I did was,

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.793
yes I did take some of my early
writings which were Russian,

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.060
some short stories and I
translated them in English.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.473
And I even had a few
of them published.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:30.243
But it just did not
sound like English.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:33.706
It-- in fact, what I'm attempting to
do in my English is sort of use it

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.006
with the Russian intonation
and the paraphrases

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.740
of certain Russian
thought processes almost

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:43.566
and metaphors that are dear to me.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.433
But the way you should do it just
sort of directly from Russian

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.603
to English, it does not work.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.003
I have to think in English
in order for me to write

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.670
in English which is what I do.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:56.770
And then, I just try to
bring in my Russian half.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.770
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.020
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.020
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.903
&gt;&gt; My question is that, your
mother language is not English,

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.670
so how could you overcome
the difficulty

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.010
of a foreign language writing.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:11.143
Because I have the same problem.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.790
I'm from Iran and my
mother language is Farsi.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.030
So, I'm here, I really
want to do something

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:18.653
in English but it's very difficult.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.453
I mean, how could you
overcome the difficulties?

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.743
&gt;&gt; Well, I've just touched
on that a little bit.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.690
I think you know, living
in the country,

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.376
thinking in the language,
helps a lot.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.620
And I think that was really
the first step that, you know,

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.243
eventually, you-- and
sometimes I'm asked the question

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.590
that I always find very interesting,
what language do you dream in.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:38.686
And there comes a point
where you stop dreaming

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.770
in your native language and start
dreaming in your new language.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.563
And I think at that point,

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.963
it sort of becomes really
a part of who you are.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.896
And it's really just immersion.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.150
I mean, I-- and reading
a lot in the language,

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.803
and of course, experimenting.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:54.003
You know, I did a lot of writing

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.470
that was quite funky before
I think I reached the point

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:58.336
where I'm comfortable
with my English.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:00.870
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:03.870


00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.923
&gt;&gt; Yes, good afternoon.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.190
My name is Justin Williams and
I'm writing a horror novel.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.973
I just wanted to know, how
is it that I can go by--

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.453
getting my book and published

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.053
without knowing anyone
in the business?

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.283
&gt;&gt; Well you know, actually
that's what I did.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.956
I know it's-- there is
this belief or quite often,

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.150
I hear that it's impossible

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.986
to get published unless you
have a name in the industry.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.046
You have to know someone.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:32.713
Your-- I don't know, bestfriend has

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:34.846
to be married to an
agent or whatever.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.380
That was not the case with me.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.220
I never had taken a
single writing class ever.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.273
I haven't known a single
writer, actually.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:44.766
So, what I did is I got a
little thin book that said,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.546
"How to break into writing."

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.546
I always think this is the best
10 dollars I've ever spent.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.613
I think it's still available.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.480
It's just a little, you know,
how to publish your writing.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.003
And it tells you to double space
your manuscript and send it

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.010
out and-- which is what I did.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.476
It was a great advice.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.000
And after that, I got a few
credits publishing short stories.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.886
I'm a very organized person.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.886
I'm not a short story
writer by inclination.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.976
I'm a novel-- I always
wanted to be a novelist.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.430
I don't think I can ever fit what
I want to say into a short format

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:19.806
which I'm sure is a drawback
but-- and so-- but I told myself,

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:23.760
somehow 10 was the number for me,

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:25.850
that I will publish 10 short
stories just to publish them,

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.203
just to get my foot on the door.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.470
And then once I published
10 stories,

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.336
then I'll turn to writing a novel.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.670
And I knew what my
first novel would be.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.440
You have to have something
that, you know, you care about.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.900
And then, you just send it out and
hope for the best and you know--

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.630
it's worked for a lot of people
more than you would think.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.106
I love your work also.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.306
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you so much.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.240
&gt;&gt; You say you're very
organized person.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.973
So, my question is--

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.640
&gt;&gt; I lied but--

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.640
[ Laughter ]

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.173
&gt;&gt; Well my question for you
on that is that, you know,

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.973
your process for writing,
coming up with the ideas,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:06.773
you know, do you story board it?

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.240
Do you write an outline?

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.373
Do you write in the middle of
the night or early morning?

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.573
Do you have to be out of your
house in a different location?

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.773
&gt;&gt; That's-- yeah.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.306
Well, on the ideas, I do keep
a kind of a writer's diary

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.220
which is not a diary of my
life but I've always kept it

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:25.893
and I don't write down
things that happen to me.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.986
I write down ideas.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.920
And I frequently go back and look

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.156
through different jots
of-- you know, of ideas.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:40.296
And in fact, my idea for my first
novel, I went down through--

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.013
went through all-- when
I decided I was ready

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.840
to start writing my first novel,
I went back through by then,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:46.876
making 20 volumes of these little
notebooks and pulled all the ideas

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.563
that seemed novel worthy, and then,

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.373
just focus on what
drew me in the best.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.386
And then, yes, I do write an outline
at least for the first 2 books.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.893
I absolutely did.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.246
It's almost a chapter
by chapter outline.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.756
You know, some writer say they kind
of just start writing with an image

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.920
or a character, and then it
takes them wherever it takes them

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.070
and the character surprised
them by doing something.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:13.410
I think if my character
ever surprise me

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:15.210
by doing something
I didn't mean it--

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:17.190
him to do, I would be kind of upset.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.563
So for me, it's organized.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:21.300
But there is enough space and
enough air for it to breath.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.613
So, it's not so sad.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.880
It's not scene by scene.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.410
It's kind of more of direction
of things and then, sometimes,

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:31.756
it does take you in sort
of unexpected directions.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.850
And in the first book for instance,
there were a couple of chapters

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:36.956
that sort of popped out that
were not in the outline,

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:39.783
but just in a way, it
almost wrote themselves

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:41.200
and sometimes people say they
think these are the best chapters.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.863
And they do feel different
from the rest of the writings.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.433
So, from my second book, because of
that, I left a little more time--

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.690
I mean I left a little
more space in the outline.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.706
It was a little more spontaneous,
like sort of a little more air.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.260
So it's still-- you know,
maybe for the 3rd book,

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:58.353
I'm trying a different approach.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.153
So, it kind of it's evolving.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.220
&gt;&gt; It evolves.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.220
&gt;&gt; It evolves.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.220
So--

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.220
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:10.353
&gt;&gt; I think there's a lady there.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.620
&gt;&gt; Oh, sorry, I didn't
realize there was a mic here.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.486
&gt;&gt; You said you write in
English and then you work

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.486
in your Russian paraphrasing
and things like that,

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:18.510
do you ever find yourself either
consciously or unconsciously

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:22.620
as you go back and look
at your work later,

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.573
trying to correct misperceptions
or that kind of thing

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.830
about a different culture, a culture
that for a long time was in conflict

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.356
with the United States,
that kind of thing--

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.343
just kind of making it
humanizing that part of the world?

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.003
&gt;&gt; Well, I think, role of any writer
is to take something that they know

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:45.530
and bring it closer to other people.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.206
And you know, you have to
sympathize with your character

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.763
and hopefully the reader will
sympathize with the character.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:53.276
So, of course, I don't
do it consciously.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:58.076
I don't consciously set out
to correct misperceptions

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:02.096
or certainly not-- I don't
have any messages in my work.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:04.630
You know, I think that's more of the
domain of the nonfiction writers.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.683
You inhabit your own
artistic creative world.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:12.576
And you let your, sort
of fictional characters,

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:15.450
you know, do the talking for you.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.050
Really, there's no message.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.736
But certainly-- I mean, I
think that's a beautiful thing

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:25.763
about reading fiction is that, the
writer has a power to bring you

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.793
into his or her own world,
something that he or she knows

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.473
and that you will then, you
know, know better as well.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.906
So, that hopefully.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.640
&gt;&gt; It's up.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.640
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Olga.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640
Thank you.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.173
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:54.280
Thank you everyone for coming.
