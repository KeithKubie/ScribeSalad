00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.190
If you imagine your DNA right now. You’d
probably picture that double helix you learned

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.960
about in school at some point- hopefully.
But, it may actually look a lot different.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:19.800
Hey guys I’m Sapna here at DNews. That ladder
twisted on itself with bonds between 4 bases-

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.710
adenine guanine thymine and cytosine, that
is the DNA double helix. The thing you were

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.830
probably picturing in your head. But it’s
now thought DNA, at times, may have different

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.260
configurations. The helix can twist the other
way, have a couple extra strands- it can even

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.730
twist onto itself into some pretty cool shapes.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.820
There are 3 biologically active types of the
double helix- a , b and z. B-DNA is that recognizable

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.140
one, it has a right handed twist and it’s
the most common in living cells. *(it’s

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.990
in yours, dogs, flowers). A-DNA has a wider
spiral… and Z-DNA twists the other way,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.000
it’s a left handed double helix with a zig
zag structure. The biological purpose of Z-DNA

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.530
isn’t quite clear. Since it twists the other
way it’s thought to relieve some of the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.690
torsional stress on the structure. And some
research shows it may play a role in transcription-

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.150
where the genetic info is being copied.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.600
Beyond the double helix- new research says
DNA molecules may also coil into a range of

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.730
cool shapes called supercoils. Research published
in the journal Nature Communications last

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.400
October shows images of supercoiled DNA created
by cryo-electron tomography together with

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.680
supercomputer simulations. The scientists
wanted to know how all that DNA crams itself

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.270
into a tiny nucleus. So they tried to look
at it one twist and turn at a time. They found

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.490
sharp bends, figure 8s- even coils that looked
like handcuffs. Keep in mind this research-

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.060
like most of the research on DNA- is in vitro
or in the laboratory. But by using an enzyme

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.040
called human topoisomerase II alpha, they
did try to simulate conditions in the human

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.800
body to show that supercoiled DNA is possible.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.580
So your DNA may be backwards, or zig zagged
or even twisted. But, it might also have double

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.830
the strands!

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.269
Most DNA has 2 strands, but many people don’t
know it can also have 4. It’s called G-

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.900
Quadraplex DNA or G4 DNA. The "G" refers to
guanine, one of those four bases that holds

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.209
the DNA together and spells out our genetic
code. G4 DNA is a topic that scientists are

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.830
trying to learn more about, especially in
the last decade because it may hold the key

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.829
to some major medical breakthroughs.

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:39.189
Researchers in Sweden just recently discovered
G4 DNA in one species of yeast. They published

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.599
their findings in the journal Nucleic Acids
Research. Meanwhile a team led by Florida

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.090
State Researchers looked for and found G4
DNA in the genome of the maize, or corn, plant.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.671
And in 2012 Cambridge University researchers
claim they saw G4 DNA in human cells. Using

00:02:56.671 --> 00:03:01.930
a fluorscence biomarker, they tagged an antibody
they created to specifically look for the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.459
4 strand DNA in human cells and and bind to
it. They found that the G4 DNA seems to turn

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.909
up most often (during the S- phase*)… just
before cells are about to divide.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:19.129
Which brings us to the point of why we should
care about 4 stranded quadriplex G4 DNA? If

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.040
it plays a role in cell division, either speeding
it up or slowing it down. Scientists think

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.370
G4 DNA may play a role in causing cancer and
degenerative diseases in humans.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.659
So how do you turn it on or off? And is possible
to create a drug that targets 4 strand DNA

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.480
and… maybe.. stop cancer? We’re not there
yet but that is actually a goal and focus

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.140
for ongoing research.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.670
By the way have you ever heard someone say
“I love to travel! It’s in my DNA!”

00:03:45.670 --> 00:04:05.549
Is it true? Are some of us hardwired for wanderlust?
Watch this video by Julian to find out.

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.510
So what do you guys think about 4 strand DNA?
And do you have any other science questions

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.510
