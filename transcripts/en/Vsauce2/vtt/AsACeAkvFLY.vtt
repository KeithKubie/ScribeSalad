00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.630
Vsauce!

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.630
Kevin here.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:09.260
Until robots render me and everyone else with
a job obsolete… or make us more human than

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.110
we’ve ever been.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.250
Humans have been working for a long time.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.679
We work the soil, we work at jobs, we work
on homework, we hate going to work, but work

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.579
can also fulfill us.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.449
Some of us work to live and others of us live
to work.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.919
But should robots do all the work for us?

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.070
Where did the modern idea of work come from,
and is it natural?&nbsp;

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.020
In the Paleolithic era, our human ancestors
were hunters and gatherers.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.940
They roamed the world surviving on natural
resources for over two million years.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.460
Working to improve their lives, very slowly,
along the way.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.580
Like by cooking meat in a fire to make it
easier to chew and digest or observing time

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.970
by marking lunar movements on mammoth tusks.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.850
And the louse put effort in, too, by migrating
from people's heads into their newly-invented

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.260
clothes and evolving into the human body louse.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.659
Which tells us that clothing may be about
107,000 years old and that lice are great

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:08.840
history teachers.&nbsp;

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.490
When the population eventually blossomed to
the point of making the "happy hunting grounds"

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.920
lifestyle unsustainable, people needed to
settle down.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.549
We built simple homes instead of depending
on caves and started to plow the ground.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.229
We developed agriculture and animal husbandry
to take more control over feeding ourselves.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.859
Many a goat was consumed.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.109
This newfound permanence meant that we could
store food surpluses, support larger families

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.280
and develop communities.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.179
For the first time, a smaller number of people
could work to feed the population.

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.469
Neolithic humans could put some of their time
into new, productive pursuits.

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.100
Like move really, really big rocks.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.500
Humans began to realize the potential -- and
the necessity -- of working together.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.450
With each technological advance, we created
new types of work and relegated some tasks

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.420
to history… and that’s when it started
to become obvious that some work is better

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.649
than others.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.690
Proof of how much people like not having to
perform difficult, unpalatable professions

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.740
goes back almost four thousand years.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.380
The Instruction Of Dua-Khety, a Middle Kingdom
Egyptian text in the form of a letter from

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.430
a father to his son, extols the benefits of
being a scribe -- a new profession that rose

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.890
to prominence with the development of writing.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.780
The father disparages other, more physically-taxing
professions, while declaring that life as

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.420
a scribe was the best line of work.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.270
During the Ramesside Period of 1200 BC his
instruction became one of the most frequently

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.320
used practice texts for student scribes.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.690
Which means ancient civilization homework
was literally motivation for avoiding certain

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.690
jobs.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.660
Language evolved to describe professions and
work, but it wasn’t until the mid-1500’s

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.800
that we had the most recognizable word that
defines our role and participation in that

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.650
system: job.&nbsp;

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.450
“Jobben” in middle english meant to jab
or peck, a small action that’s part of a

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.620
larger effort -- which is why a job is just
a piece of the whole.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.020
That whole being work.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.190
Often someone else’s work.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.080
The word “employ” meant “entangle”.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.290
As an employee, you’re caught in the snare
of your job.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.290
&nbsp;

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.000
And it came to define who we were.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.330
Occupational last names like Carpenter, Baker,
Eisenhower and Cabrera identified a person’s

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.240
position in society by their profession.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.180
They did one job for so long that it permanently
branded their family.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.010
A job became a legacy that dictated your path
through life.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.540
Sometimes with heavy consequences.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.910
To ensure future work for their families,
metal grinders during the Industrial Revolution

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.320
denied safer working conditions because if
they lived longer, there’d be fewer job

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.650
openings for their sons.&nbsp;

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.620
Fear of other humans limiting job availability
soon gave way to the panic of machines eliminating

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.230
jobs altogether.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.739
The Spinning Jenny single-handedly wiped out
a job that had existed for thousands of years

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.750
- spinning thread.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.620
A job so ingrained in human culture that the
term “spinster” was coined to describe

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.509
a woman who spent her whole life spinning
thread without marrying.&nbsp;

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:22.210
Invented in 1764, the spinning jenny made
the weaving process so efficient that people

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.930
were afraid it’d take their jobs.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.150
Spinners broke into inventor James Hargreaves’
house and destroyed his equipment to try to

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.930
halt progress and protect their livelihoods.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.990
Decades later, English textile workers called
Luddites banded together to destroy labor-economizing

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.280
technology for fear of being forced out of
work.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.440
Economists now use the term Luddite Fallacy
to explain the fear that advances in technology

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.190
will lead to structural unemployment.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.500
What really happens is that technological
advancement causes industry-wide production

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.760
costs to fall, which lowers the competitive
price and increases the supply and, in theory,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.680
leads to more input.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.490
Labor that becomes irrelevant shifts into
new areas, and our goods get cheaper and better

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.290
as our standard of living rises.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:18.150
In 1973, it took the average American 97.1
hours of labor to afford a color TV - more

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.680
than two weeks of full-time work.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.700
By 2009, it took only two days to afford a
slimmer, lighter, more energy-efficient, High

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.110
Definition TV.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.740
We’re spending less time working to procure
food and meeting basic survival needs but

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.420
we haven't become lazy -- we've freed ourselves
up to solve other problems.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.840
We’re beating back Belphagor.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.130
The chief demon of sloth and one of the seven
princes of Hell, Belphegor was described by

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.960
16th century German witch-hunter Peter Binsfeld
as using the promise of innovation and ingenious

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.610
inventions to lure humans into laziness.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.710
The fear was that work-reducing technology
would free up too much time and allow evil

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.840
to creep into humanity.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.420
However, lifespans and standards of living
have consistently improved with each passing

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.180
generation — which means by today’s standards
Peter Binsfeld could have hunted witches more

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.630
efficiently and for longer.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.940
With the advancement of steam engines leading
to electricity leading to computers leading

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.790
to robots it’s leading to…?&nbsp;

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.410
The end of many jobs.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.800
A natural function of human progression that
has happened over and over.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.949
From the printing press eliminating scribes
to telephone switchboard operators being replaced

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.350
by complex telephone and data exchange systems.&nbsp;

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.620
Narrator: The equipment that makes this service
possible is among the most complex that man

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.830
has ever devised.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.090
Humanity needs technology because human labor
can only accomplish so much.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.610
It’s why large animals like horses were
first used to make up for the shortcomings

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.210
of human muscle.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.910
But all animals have limits -- as CGP Grey
illustrates in his Humans Need Not Apply video,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.160
the horse population plummeted after the advent
of machine power, but we still use the term

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.300
“horsepower” as a measurement of a machine’s
output.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.620
Narrator: The horsepower unit proved very
useful.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:18.920
Watt was able to tell mine owners and businessmen
exactly what size engine would be needed to

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.330
replace the horses they’d been using.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:27.490
Inventions help humans overcome our shortcomings,
writing was developed to make up for the limitations

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.830
of memory.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.100
And technological advances allow us to use
our labor more specifically.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.430
The industrial revolution marked the first
time in human history that the majority of

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.479
people were put to work doing specialized
jobs.

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:44.150
Prior to that, specialization was the work
of the elite.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.860
Scribes copying texts, architects hired for
public works projects, court jesters juggling

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.860
batons.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.120
Now, if you want to spend your life reviewing
seagull poop simulators, there’s a job for

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.120
that.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.800
But the reasons robots will replace humans
in many labor sectors are the same reasons

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.530
that Scottish engineer James Nasmyth preferred
self-acting machines and tools over skilled

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.919
workers in the 1800s.

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:14.070
They, “never got drunk; their hands never
shook from excess; they were never absent

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.490
from work; they did not strike for wages;
they were unfailing in their accuracy and

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.580
regularity.”

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.850
Machines are more dependable and consistent.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.850
But machines and robots aren’t human.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.350
And their continued implementation in the
workforce means our humanity may be the most

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.620
valuable attribute we have.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.349
When robots are performing mundane tasks,
more and more people will be involved in uniquely

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:40.039
human jobs.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:43.880
Markets built around human connection and
collective experiences.&nbsp;

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.480
We’re on that path right now.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.740
The amount of hours humans work per lifetime
are dramatically lower than ever, and a 2015

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.390
U.S. Department Of Labor report stated that
the average number of jobs held by a baby

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:59.730
boomer from age 18 to 48 was 11.7.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.890
Through most of human history, we worked constantly
at one thing -- and now we’re working less

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.410
and doing many different jobs with greater
flexibility.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.790
Increased opportunities to work from home
-- and work less -- have improved the family

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.420
dynamic by allowing parents to spend more
time raising their children.&nbsp;

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.240
If we automate the systems that fulfill our
most basic survival needs, will it finally

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:28.000
allow us the freedom to spend our time the
way we want?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.270
Studs Terkel’s landmark book Working includes
interviews with 130 people about their jobs.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.940
Many felt their work gave their lives daily
meaning to accompany the earned daily bread

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.120
-- but others felt trapped.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.570
“I’m a machine,” says the spot welder.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.060
“I’m caged,” says the bank teller.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.270
“I’m a mule,” says the steelworker.”

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.340
“A monkey can do what I do,” says the
receptionist.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.080
“I’m an object,” says the high-fashion
model.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:01.250
But from the upper crust white collar to the
lowest paying blue collar workers - one phrase

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.260
is used repeatedly.&nbsp;

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.550
“I’m a robot.”

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.460
And as always - thanks for watching.&nbsp;

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:28.160
Narrator: We know we are somewhere in the
middle of a period of unprecedented economic

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.160
change.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:35.060
For those of us who view history as a fascinating
spectacle, the prospect of the coming quarter

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.670
century is exhilarating.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:43.300
It is as if we were privileged not only to
see but to participate in centuries of development

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.260
telescoped into a brief span.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:54.960
It is not too early to train your sights on
this prospect right now.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:14.490
Man: Same old story all over again.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.490
No jobs.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.399
No luck.
