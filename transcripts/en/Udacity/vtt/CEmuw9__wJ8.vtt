00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
He, like a lot of other people in that period—1560s or 1570s—

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
had already come to question a number of the Aristotlean assumptions about things.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now according to the doctrine bodies fell with a speed according to their weight—

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
this is where Galileo starts.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Then he began wondering about, well, how do actually bodies move and can we tell.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I used to, in front of my class, take a couple of balls and drop them in front of the class.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I'd ask the members of the class, "What do you see?"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And most of the students coming from engineering or science said,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
"We see ball or bodies accelerating in free fall."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I would come back at them eventually and say,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
"Now, I didn't ask you what you were told you were ought to see. What do you actually see?"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And if you try it, you'll find that you don't see much.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You see the hands holding the ball.  You see the hands opening.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And you hear a thump or a couple of thumps on the floor, but you don't see anything.

00:01:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And this in part is one of the points that Galileo starts.
