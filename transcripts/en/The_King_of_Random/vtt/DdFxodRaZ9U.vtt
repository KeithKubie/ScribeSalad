00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.620
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
Today, we're going to use
this laminate flooring

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.380
to build ourselves a shield
that's both decorative and functional.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.309
[Music]

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.559
For this shield, we're going
to go with a classic circle shape,

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.410
so let's affix together several
of our planks so we can measure out

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.970
the exact size we want.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.160
The circle of our shield we're
going to make today is going to be

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.100
just under two feet in diameter,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.240
so four of our planks should be plenty.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.460
Let's start by fitting
our four planks together

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.180
so they form one smooth flat surface.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.280
With our two boards
roughly fit together,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.710
we now want to use a tapping block
to ensure that they're pressed together

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.080
as closely as possible,
and avoid damaging the edges.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.370
[Music]

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.140
Let's do the same exact
thing with our next two boards.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.420
[Music]

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.140
Fit the grooves in
together at an angle,

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.620
push them down in together
until it begins to lie flat.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.600
[Music]

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.450
With our four planks together,
you can see how they're already

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.680
strong enough that they
hold themselves together

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.120
as one cohesive board.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.200
At this point, we need
to draw on the shape

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.890
that we want our shield to be,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.180
and then we'll cut
that out using a jigsaw.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.620
Since this shield
is going to be a circle,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.520
let's use a piece of string,
a marker, and a piece of tape

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.350
to work as a compass to draw
out our shape on the surface.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.180
By letting the markers swivel
inside the loop on the string,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.300
we should be able to keep a
uniform length from our center point,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.380
instead of having the
string bind up around the pen.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.020
We're going for about a 23
inch diameter on our circle.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.580
So let's put our marker
at 11 and 1/2 inches,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.780
and then we'll attach our tape
at the other end of the string.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.600
Let's just fold the tape over,
and add another piece of tape.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.440
This will make sure that as we draw,
none of the string gets pulled through,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.380
and the size of our circle won't change.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.560
Let's trim off the extra string.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.399
At this point, we should now
have a compass that lets us draw

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.280
a perfect circle all
the way around on our flooring.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.960
[Music]

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.940
Beautiful.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.760
Look at that circle.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.140
That is a nice circle right there.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.880
[Music]

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.640
Now, we just need to cut the four
pieces out of our four planks,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.860
and then fit them back together.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.200
[Music]

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.280
Let's start by trimming off
the extra that we aren't going

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.760
to need on this plank.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:37.740
[Music]

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.460
There we have it.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.180
The four cutout planks that
will fit together to form

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.560
the circle of our shield.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.760
We can put it together the same way
we put our planks together the first time.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.140
[Music]

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.260
Alright, looking pretty good.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.960
We now have a circle of our
boards put together.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.540
This is already looking like a pretty
decent shield in my opinion.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.760
Now, even though the planks
of this flooring do hold

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.500
themselves together pretty easily,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.460
It is still possible to pop them apart
if we put them at the right angle.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.860
So we need to add some
support on to our shield

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.980
so that the planks can't bend in
the direction that pops them open.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.980
To reinforce our shield, let's take
a piece of this kitchen cabinet facing.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.960
I like this stuff because it is sturdy,
but it's also thin enough

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.800
that it won't add any
significant weight to our shield.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.580
To get our shape just right,
let's lay the back of the shield

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.720
in contact with the
white side of our board,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.209
and then trace that out with a marker

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.440
[Music]

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.160
Now, of course, we need to cut
this circle out of the board.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.920
[Music]

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.620
There we go.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.280
We've got our two circles.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.720
They line up nicely together.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.799
Now, we just need to
attach them to each other.

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.520
We'll use these screws and
washers to attach our thin panel

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.880
to the back of our flooring.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.700
We want to make sure that we're using
screws that are long enough that they'll

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.580
get through our laminate board
and into our flooring,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.060
but not so long that they will
stick out through the other side.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.920
To make sure that our back panel is
really well attached to our front panels,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.720
let's add one screw on
either end of each board,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.020
and then a couple more in the middle

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.240
just to make sure everything
is held sturdily together.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.680
We want to pre-drill our
screw holes, so that the screws

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.600
don't break the board apart.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.520
But we also want to make sure we
don't drill all the way through our

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.639
board into the other side.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.880
So, let's actually mark on our drill
bit about how far down we want to drill.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.760
This black stripe will be easily
visible even while our drill bit is spinning,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.840
and now we know not
to drill any deeper than that mark.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:51.580
[Music]

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.720
With the backing installed on the planks,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.000
the boards can no longer be flexed apart,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.240
and they hold themselves
together really well.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.420
With the body of the shield built,
let's add a handle and a strap

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.580
that add functionality, and let us wear it.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.540
We have a gate handle that will attach
onto the back of our board,

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.850
and this will be how we
hold on to our shield.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.060
Let's see.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.000
Trying to make sure that we
have this in just the right spot,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.260
I've got the shield balanced up on a table,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.280
and if I line my arm up right where
I want it to go when I'm using the shield,

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.440
it gives us a pretty good sense
of where to install the handle.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.800
That looks pretty good to me.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.960
[Music]

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.340
Just lay that down.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.800
[Music]

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.180
So that is where we want
our shield handle installed.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.080
Let's mark those points.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.520
[Music]

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.180
To install our handle, let's use
some slightly longer screws

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.080
since we need them
to fit through the hardware,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.660
and still get a good grip on
the wood of the shield below.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.720
For the handle, I'm using 5/8 inch screws.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:59.920
[Music]

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.960
Alright, at this point,
we have a handle attached.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.370
It makes it so we can hold our shield,
but it's pretty uncomfortable having

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.340
all of the weight of it just on our hand.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.300
So let's add a strap that will go
over our forearm that will help

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.060
us support a lot of the weight.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.220
To make a strap that's both
comfortable and adjustable,

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.960
I grabbed an old belt from a thrift store,
and we'll cut that up and attach it

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.180
to the back of our shield.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.740
The bottom of our belt will
attach somewhere down here,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.000
and the top will attach
somewhere up here.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.860
That way we can thread the belt
through the buckle as normal,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.580
and have an attached strap
that we can reach our arm through.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.520
Let's cut off the buckle end of our belt,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.310
giving ourselves about
6 inches extra space.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.639
By lining arm up on the shield again,
we can see the point where we want

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.720
the belt buckle to attach at the bottom.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.700
We'll drive a couple of screws
down through the leather

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.300
to hold our buckle right
in place where we want it.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.580
This piece of the belt is going to
be extra, so we can cut that off,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.930
leaving just enough of the leather
to fold over to give our screws

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.740
something to securely anchor into.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.460
[Music]

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.080
There we have it.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.100
One side of our strap securely attached.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.580
Let's add the other.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.660
We clearly have way more belt
on here than we need at the moment.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.879
So let's cut off some of the
extra just so we can measure

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.200
a little more accurately.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.840
There we go.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.560
That seems like it should be
a pretty good size right there.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.480
Now, we can trim off
the extra on this belt.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.840
[Music]

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.100
Alright, there we go.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.759
We've got both sides of our
belts securely attached.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:32.140
So now, if we thread
this through our belt loop.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.840
[Music]

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.400
We have a belt that securely
holds on to our forearm,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.780
taking off a lot of the weight,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.540
so we don't have to hold it
all with our hand on the handle.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.000
We've got our strap.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.860
We've got our handle.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.380
It all holds together well.

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:50.500
At this point, all our shield needs is
a metal band going around the outside

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.440
of it to really tie it all together.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.280
For simplicity's sake, we aren't
going to use a real metal band.

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:58.539
We're going to use this sheet
of craft foam cut, glued,

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:00.180
and painted to look like metal.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.940
To start, let's cut our foam
sheet into strips 2 inches wide.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.120
[Music]

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.540
Now, using some contact cement,
let's glue these strips of foam

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.020
around the edge of our shield,

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.849
folding it over onto both
the front and the back.

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:16.680
The foam is flexible enough that we
should be able to wrap it all the way

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.680
around the curve of the shield
without getting any folded

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.360
or doubled over spots.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:35.020
[Music]

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.090
To give the appearance of our metal
banding being attached to our wood

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.660
using some metal studs,

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.580
we've got these decorative little tacks,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.900
and we're going to cut off the
post on the bottom of them,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.400
and then glue them onto our
foam going around our shield.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:09:01.760
[Music]

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.000
With the foam and the studs added on,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.460
the last step is to mask off
our flooring and paint the edge

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.240
so it looks a little bit more like metal.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:23.400
[Music]

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.440
As we remove our masking, we
now have our completed shield.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.940
Now, let's take this outside,
and put it to some real-world tests.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:43.680
[Music]

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.820
[Music]

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.340
&gt;&gt; I think we got each other there.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:10:39.240
[Music]

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.220
&gt;&gt; That was hell.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.540
Yeah.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.520
&gt;&gt; As you can see, our shield
held up beautifully to every kind

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.160
of assault that we threw at it.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.540
It's very durable.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.660
It's wear resistant,
its water resistant,

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.980
and it works really well.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.860
Like it looks really good as a shield,
and it's very functional as a shield.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.700
That's everything we
could hope for out of it.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.210
