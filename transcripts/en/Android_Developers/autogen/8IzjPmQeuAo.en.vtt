without giving them at least getting
 

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.890
without giving them at least getting
game resources but you know some things

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:50.900

that some strategies that some companies

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640
that some strategies that some companies
 

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.160
that some strategies that some companies
that I've worked with have used is just

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.170
that I've worked with have used is just
 

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.170
that I've worked with have used is just
giving them a stock footage and then

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:56.180
giving them a stock footage and then
 

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.360
giving them a stock footage and then
allowing them to maybe play the game on

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:58.370
allowing them to maybe play the game on
 

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.400

an account that's progressed a little

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.410
an account that's progressed a little
 

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.380
an account that's progressed a little
bit further but not giving them that as

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:02.390
bit further but not giving them that as
 

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.170
bit further but not giving them that as
a resource because they I think valuing

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:05.180
a resource because they I think valuing
 

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.240

your own int games in-game economy to
 

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.440
your own int games in-game economy to
the fact that you just won't give it out

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:08.450
the fact that you just won't give it out
 

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.390
the fact that you just won't give it out
from people that promote you is is

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400
from people that promote you is is
 

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.160
from people that promote you is is
important but of course that's probably

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.170
important but of course that's probably
 

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.690
important but of course that's probably
an unpopular opinion because it's what

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:13.700
an unpopular opinion because it's what
 

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.980
an unpopular opinion because it's what
everybody does right now at least and

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:14.990
everybody does right now at least and
 

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:16.690
everybody does right now at least and
everybody you know might as well all my

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:16.700
everybody you know might as well all my
 

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.940
everybody you know might as well all my
emails are filled with you so I do think

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:18.950
emails are filled with you so I do think
 

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.150
emails are filled with you so I do think
that the missing link here is that you

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160
that the missing link here is that you
 

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.260
that the missing link here is that you
want people to cover your game

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:23.270
want people to cover your game
 

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.600
want people to cover your game

organically but they won't do that
 

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.280
organically but they won't do that
unless they get the views so how do you

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:27.290
unless they get the views so how do you
 

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.890
unless they get the views so how do you
kind of how do you kind of remedy that

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:29.900
kind of how do you kind of remedy that
 

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.470
kind of how do you kind of remedy that
yeah it's interesting kind of thing

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480
yeah it's interesting kind of thing
 

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.210
yeah it's interesting kind of thing
because you know like I noticed

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:34.220
because you know like I noticed
 

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.850
because you know like I noticed
especially to the amount of views

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:36.860
especially to the amount of views
 

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.040
especially to the amount of views
generated I think between the large

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.050

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520
to be created around right I think they
 

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.280
to be created around right I think they
they kind of touched on it before it's

lot of content but then when you also
think about the long term cycle of a

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.210
think about the long term cycle of a
 

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.150
think about the long term cycle of a
game what happens to you as a creator

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:55.160
game what happens to you as a creator
 

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.650
game what happens to you as a creator
when there isn't like how long would you

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:56.660
when there isn't like how long would you
 

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.880
when there isn't like how long would you
say that threshold is before you start

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:57.890
say that threshold is before you start
 

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.740

perspective just as a developer
 

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.009

a video daily I've have over almost

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.210
a video daily I've have over almost
 

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.470
a video daily I've have over almost
1,300 videos but you can only do videos

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480
1,300 videos but you can only do videos
 

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.330
1,300 videos but you can only do videos
daily on the game doing the same thing

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340
daily on the game doing the same thing
 

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.950
daily on the game doing the same thing
for so long unless you really have a

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960
for so long unless you really have a
 

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.649
for so long unless you really have a
unique set of something that you're

00:20:18.649 --> 00:20:18.659
unique set of something that you're
 

00:20:18.659 --> 00:20:20.600
unique set of something that you're
bringing to the table you know so I have

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:20.610
bringing to the table you know so I have
 

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.090

my own kind of flavor but you're right

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100
my own kind of flavor but you're right
 

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.529

we're always looking for that next game

00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:24.539
we're always looking for that next game
 

00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:26.899
we're always looking for that next game
that's going to take off and the problem

00:20:26.899 --> 00:20:26.909
that's going to take off and the problem
 

00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:28.460
that's going to take off and the problem
is that boxes out all the small games

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:28.470
is that boxes out all the small games
 

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.249
is that boxes out all the small games
that are worth looking into you know so

00:20:31.249 --> 00:20:31.259
that are worth looking into you know so
 

00:20:31.259 --> 00:20:33.860
that are worth looking into you know so
I don't know the perfect solution other

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:33.870
I don't know the perfect solution other
 

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.869
I don't know the perfect solution other
than almost like flip-flops where where

00:20:35.869 --> 00:20:35.879
than almost like flip-flops where where
 

00:20:35.879 --> 00:20:37.220
than almost like flip-flops where where
you said maybe some of the developers or

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:37.230
you said maybe some of the developers or
 

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.389
you said maybe some of the developers or
publishers should look at the middle

00:20:38.389 --> 00:20:38.399
publishers should look at the middle
 

00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:40.519
publishers should look at the middle
tier I think so creator is it's almost

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:40.529

like you you might be able to find a

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:41.970
like you you might be able to find a
 

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.340
like you you might be able to find a
niche by looking at some of them I think

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:43.350
niche by looking at some of them I think
 

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.690
niche by looking at some of them I think
so I think that if I was going to

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700
so I think that if I was going to
 

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.789
so I think that if I was going to
develop a game and I want to create it

00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799
develop a game and I want to create it
 

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:48.560
develop a game and I want to create it
give a great strategy for getting

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:48.570
give a great strategy for getting
 

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.590
give a great strategy for getting
content creators on board I would try to

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600

little bit of influence inside the
 

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.299
little bit of influence inside the
ecosystem and then have them almost

00:20:56.299 --> 00:20:56.309
ecosystem and then have them almost
 

00:20:56.309 --> 00:20:57.889

strategy or just instant downloads you
 

00:21:40.289 --> 00:21:43.279
strategy or just instant downloads you
know so moving on I think you know like

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:43.289
know so moving on I think you know like
 

00:21:43.289 --> 00:21:45.019

a big question there this is kind of a

00:21:45.019 --> 00:21:45.029
a big question there this is kind of a
 

00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:47.570
a big question there this is kind of a
loaded slide but like kind of what is in

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:47.580
loaded slide but like kind of what is in

your eyes the future of mobile gaming I
think when I look at each of these I

00:21:51.139 --> 00:21:51.149
think when I look at each of these I
 

00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:53.320
think when I look at each of these I
think of a new you know supermassive

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:53.330
think of a new you know supermassive
 

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.149

game IP deck that could horizon and have

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159
game IP deck that could horizon and have
 

00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:58.600
game IP deck that could horizon and have
huge implications in the West I think

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:58.610
huge implications in the West I think
 

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.399

there's an eSports aspect that to
 

00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:11.060
there's an eSports aspect that to
consider right as far as extending

mobile games IP with something like the

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:13.259
mobile games IP with something like the
 

00:22:13.259 --> 00:22:14.790
mobile games IP with something like the
crown championship and then

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:14.800
crown championship and then
 

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.410

lastly kind of talking about devices and
 

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.350
lastly kind of talking about devices and
hardware like you know phones that have

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360
hardware like you know phones that have
 

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.520
hardware like you know phones that have
better kind of built in both cameras and

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:23.530
better kind of built in both cameras and
 

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.890
better kind of built in both cameras and
and hardware and usability and screen

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:25.900
and hardware and usability and screen
 

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.600
and hardware and usability and screen
size and all these things and how do you

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:27.610
size and all these things and how do you
 

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.280
size and all these things and how do you
really you know you can jump into any

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:29.290
really you know you can jump into any
 

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.360
really you know you can jump into any
one of these like where do you really

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:30.370
one of these like where do you really
 

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.610
one of these like where do you really
see some of these futures going geez

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:32.620
see some of these futures going geez
 

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.320
see some of these futures going geez
like you said it is a big big question

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:34.330
like you said it is a big big question
 

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:38.070
like you said it is a big big question
but me personally I think that a lot of

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080
but me personally I think that a lot of
 

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.770
but me personally I think that a lot of
the the global market has been devalued

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:40.780
the the global market has been devalued
 

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.080
the the global market has been devalued
based on the advertising dollars or

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:43.090
based on the advertising dollars or
 

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.660
based on the advertising dollars or
various other factors but I think that

replayability the ability to kind of

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080
replayability the ability to kind of
 

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.810

like seed content so that there's always

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:33.820
like seed content so that there's always
 

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.510
like seed content so that there's always
freshness right and I think it's it's a

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:36.520
freshness right and I think it's it's a
 

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.250
freshness right and I think it's it's a
lot about kind of developing things

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:38.260
lot about kind of developing things
 

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.510

know institutionalized ways of thinking

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:45.070
know institutionalized ways of thinking
 

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.560
know institutionalized ways of thinking
of game modes that can be completely

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:46.570
of game modes that can be completely
 

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.870
of game modes that can be completely
reversed right I think different modes

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880
reversed right I think different modes
 

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.700
reversed right I think different modes
and using derivative IP and kind of

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:50.710
and using derivative IP and kind of
 

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:51.930

figuring out different ways to play with
 

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.299
figuring out different ways to play with
that I've noticed give

00:28:55.299 --> 00:28:55.309
that I've noticed give
 

00:28:55.309 --> 00:28:56.830
that I've noticed give
content creators a lot more to bite on

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840
content creators a lot more to bite on
 

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.370
content creators a lot more to bite on
and also modes which lead towards like

00:28:59.370 --> 00:28:59.380
and also modes which lead towards like
 

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.049
and also modes which lead towards like
unreachable goals or like really hard

00:29:02.049 --> 00:29:02.059
unreachable goals or like really hard
 

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:03.430
unreachable goals or like really hard
goal it's a good one that's a good one

person will play every single day and
 

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.130
person will play every single day and
also record every single day because I

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:18.140
also record every single day because I
