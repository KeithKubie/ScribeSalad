00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.120
Hey everybody, thanks for tuning in to DNews. I'm Trace.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.040
Today we're going to do something a little bit different,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.460
though you probably realized that already.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.200
We're going to talk about the science of fog, how it's formed

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.140
and why it is that San Francisco gets so much of it.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.120
We're also going to look at technologies designed to harness fog

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.180
and infrastructure that we built in order to deal with it

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.460
but to do that, we really probably have to go outside, it's a little foggy in here.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.700
San Francisco is sometimes known as "Fog City" and yeah, it gets foggy

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.940
but it's not really San Francisco's fault,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.900
it's the Pacific Ocean's fault.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.340
Fog forms over the ocean and then floats over the city

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.420
but it also floats over the nearby redwood forests, which might not exist without it.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.120
Here on Mount Tamalpais State Park, just north of San Francisco, are a number of redwood groves.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.800
California redwoods or Sequoia sempervirens have different leaves scattered throughout their structure.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.000
Pinnacle leaves near the top are actually better at absorbing water

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.740
than their relatives towards the base of the tree.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.460
This nourishes the massive tress,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.820
especially during the summer months when fog is the most prevalent.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.900
In fact, fog alone can provide up to 40 percent of redwood's moisture intake.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.580
Redwood trees' unique ability to ingest water higher in their canopy

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.220
may be why they can grow to such great heights in the more foggy areas of the Pacific Northwest

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.140
than they do further south where it's drier.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.100
Due to their size and color, redwood trees are almost unmistakable.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.080
In fact, redwood trees have even been used as navigation points for sailors in the San Francisco Bay.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.680
Until about 1851, sailors would use redwoods located in Oakland

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.000
as navigation trees to avoid striking the submerged blossom rock,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.160
a major hazard to the west of Yerba Buena Island in the San Francisco Bay.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.440
Redwoods aren't the only indicators used by mariners

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.120
to navigate the tricky Northern California coastlines through the fog.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.120
Lighthouses, such as the Point Bonita Lighthouse here,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.860
are a technologically primitive navigation tool by today's standards,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.940
but provide a failsafe should onboard GPS or radar equipment fail a captain at sea.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.960
Today, the Point Bonita Lighthouse uses both its light and foghorns

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.440
to warn nearby ships of the periphery of the Golden Gate Entrance.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.560
Just like these technologies have evolved to ensure the safety of marine vessels,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.000
so have technologies to study and harness the fog.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.580
Another iconic San Francisco landmark, mainly used to broadcast television, is Sutro Tower.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.860
You're now at the very top of Sutro Tower, dangling off one of the main catwalks.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.060
The tower is located just southwest of downtown San Francisco.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.260
This unique location as a midpoint between the warmer climate of the San Francisco Bay

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.520
and the cooler climate of the Pacific Ocean

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.240
makes it perfect for meteorologists hoping to find out how fog is formed along the California coastline.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.020
Scientists have used Sutro Tower to study how fog moves, take wind measurements,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.900
and reveal how these massive waves of moisture are put together.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.280
Even today, fog catching continues

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.580
with moisture from the fog trapped in small quantities for use at a local distillery.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.220
Although these fog catchers aren't very large and they don't capture much moisture,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.280
similar technology is used at larger installations in other parts of the world

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.760
such as the driest place on Earth, the Atacama Desert.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.980
There, researchers are hoping the fog captures can actually provide enough potable water

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.540
for local families in the near future.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.360
The scientists and inventors behind fog catchers may or may not have borrowed ideas from redwood trees

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.160
when coming up with new sources of harvesting water,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.620
but it illustrates how we can learn from these ancient flora

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.040
as we embark on a clearer path towards a new sustainable technology

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.500
and perhaps, if we do so, our future will be a little bit brighter.
