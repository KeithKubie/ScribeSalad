00:00:20.197 --> 00:00:22.697
(light music)

00:00:45.953 --> 00:00:47.930
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.001
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.480
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.030
Our guest today is Daniel B. Rodriguez

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.710
who is dean and Harold
Washington professor

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.460
at Northwestern Law School.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.700
Dean Rodriguez recently completed his term

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.910
as the 2014 president of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.610
the Association of American Law Schools.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.610
Dean Rodriguez is the 2015
Jefferson Lecturer at Berkeley.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240
Dan, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.289
- Glad to be here.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.290
- [Harry] Where were you born and raised?

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.920
- I was born about 500
miles south of here.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.010
Long Beach, California.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.070
A little bit south of Los Angeles.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.150
- And, looking back, how do
you think your parents shaped

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.860
your thinking about the world?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.693
- That's interesting.

00:01:35.693 --> 00:01:39.410
I grew up in lower to middle class family

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.400
and not a particularly academic family.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.580
Nonetheless, they encouraged me

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.300
in my own academic pursuits.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.590
And, if I had to summarize it,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.810
I would say that they taught
me the value of hard work

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.460
and persistence and so again,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.000
even though academic life

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.950
was remote from their own experience,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.220
they were very proud
of me and encouraged me

00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:02.460
to really work hard and to aspire.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.460
- And when did the idea of
possibly pursuing the law...

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.940
Did it germinate with the
family or did that come later?

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.968
- It came much later.

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:15.530
My own experience was a little unusual.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.670
I came out of high school
with no particular aspirations

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.880
to go to college, quite frankly,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.040
and began in community
college in Long Beach.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.480
And went from there to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.200
California State University at Long Beach.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.370
And, for basically 4/5 of
my time at Long Beach State,

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.930
I worked full-time and
went to school at night.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.140
So I was happy being
there and worked hard,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.650
but didn't have a particular
aspiration for graduate school,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.080
much less law school.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.160
If I had to source it, I would say

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.260
it was fairly late in my
time at Long Beach State

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.020
where the idea was planted
to go to law school.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.100
I really enjoyed studying the subjects

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.650
political science, economics.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.050
And I thought law school
would be a great aspiration,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.154
but it was a bit of a lark, quite frankly,

00:02:56.154 --> 00:02:58.330
to apply to law school at the time.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.600
- And, going back to
your earlier education,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.490
did you have mentors that
really pushed you along

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.190
with the importance of education

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.610
in the way your parents had?

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.730
- Yes, I had a number of
mentors at Long Beach State.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.980
Now, again, I wouldn't
diminish them by saying

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.850
that they didn't contribute a lot

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.720
to my development of my ideas.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.157
I wouldn't look back and say,

00:03:22.157 --> 00:03:23.599
"Oh, that professor or this professor

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.840
really gave me a way of shaping

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.300
my looking at the world."

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.950
But, on the other hand,
they encouraged me greatly

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.310
to aspire to go to get
additional education.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.330
And so it was really the
confidence that I built

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.900
from my time at Long Beach State

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.707
that gave me the confidence that

00:03:40.707 --> 00:03:43.910
I knew that I could really thrive

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.475
in a graduate school,
law school environment.

00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:48.080
- [Harry] And where did
you go to law school?

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.913
- I went to law school
at Harvard Law School.

00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:53.490
- And, at Harvard, what attracted you

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.950
in the subfields of law?

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.950
- Well, so, I loved law school, I confess,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.480
and particularly my first year,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.770
which, in law school,
is a three year program

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.724
is really your core year.

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:09.830
Subjects that I studied
and we studied at Harvard

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.150
were very much like the
subjects that law students

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.410
would study 100 years ago.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.750
It was really a core knowledge.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.219
So my first year was really
devoted to developing,

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:20.470
really, a background
and a base of knowledge

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.330
and way of thinking.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.950
What we sometimes call
thinking like a lawyer.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.170
It was really only when I got near the end

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.147
of my law school career

00:04:27.147 --> 00:04:29.180
and was taking more elective subjects

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.640
and working with some
terrific faculty members that

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.880
I really started to develop

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.520
and nurture my interest in public law.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.970
Which, in a nutshell, is
really about the relationship

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.380
between law and the government.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.040
About governance in the United States.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.130
And so the courses that I took,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.420
papers that I was doing,
my work on the Law Review

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.552
really kind of gelled to
develop my intellectual

00:04:48.552 --> 00:04:50.293
and academic interest in law.

00:04:52.706 --> 00:04:55.090
- Your interests came to be defined

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.606
and the research you later
pursued sort of emphasized

00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:03.480
the dynamic of federalism on the one hand,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.800
the relationship of local
government and state government,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.420
but also the way it's embedded
in the politics of the time.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.020
- Well, you put it very well and

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.220
would that I had such a clearly defined

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.400
research agenda in law school.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.460
I certainly didn't.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.293
But certainly...

00:05:18.293 --> 00:05:19.290
And that came later.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.270
But certainly that describes very well

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.730
what I was mostly taken with
when I was in law school.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.563
It interested me.

00:05:25.563 --> 00:05:28.675
So I did what is essentially
my master's thesis.

00:05:28.675 --> 00:05:30.910
What they call the third year paper.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.340
On federalism in the Republican tradition.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.480
And so, some of the themes
that you just mentioned.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.780
And really about the relationship

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.510
among structures of government

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.590
and national, state, and local governments

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.350
and just really how we govern
ourselves in a free society

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.270
really, again, grew out of
my intellectual interest.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.440
When I look back, by the way,
on what I wrote in law school,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.430
it's remarkably callow
and naive, I have to say.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.630
But, really, the germs of what

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.380
became my sort of academic projects

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.930
when I joined the faculty here.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.670
- And this must be a fertile time

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.400
for that kind of research,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.700
because the balance
seems to be tipping away

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.090
from the central government
and back to the states.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.290
Is that a fair assessment?

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.910
- It's an absolutely fair assessment.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.780
When I was coming out of law school

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.970
and, really, was beginning
my academic career,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.660
on the one hand, it was
then a fertile time,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.210
because many of these issues, of course,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.370
were very prominent in American politics.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.740
On the other hand, they
weren't particularly

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.840
fertile in American law.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.260
To make a long story short,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.667
the United States Supreme Court

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:33.750
had mostly absented themselves,

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.330
really, ever since the New Deal,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.720
from major disputes
involving the relationship

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.020
between the state and
national governments.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.310
You could count on one hand

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.470
the number of blockbuster
Supreme Court decisions

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.303
on that topic.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:46.310
And, moreover, local government law,

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.470
while very important to a handful

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.950
of distinguished political scientists,

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.000
including some at this
wonderful university,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.966
was not something that was
high on the priority list

00:06:53.966 --> 00:06:55.500
of academics.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.160
In fact, if I could tell
you just a short story,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.620
when I came to the dean of this law school

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.420
when I was a pre-tenured faculty member,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.070
I said I really wanted to teach a course

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.450
in state and local government law.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.797
And he sort of looked at me and said,

00:07:06.797 --> 00:07:09.170
"You know, we don't do that
sort of thing here at Berkeley.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.016
We're a national law school.

00:07:11.016 --> 00:07:11.849
And you might want to leave that

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:13.030
until after you get tenure."

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.350
That was sort of the
status of that subject

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.270
in American law schools when
I began my academic career.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.910
- And what drew you to the subject?

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.830
Was it anything in your background?

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.020
Or was it just you saw
it as a fallow field?

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.670
- You know, it was really the latter.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.118
As I started to really bear down

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.840
on very important issues of governance,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.680
read the literature,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.130
and look at what was going on in the world

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:39.963
in which I was living.

00:07:39.963 --> 00:07:41.780
Particularly in a place like California.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.990
In Northern California.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.972
I always came back to the phenomenon of

00:07:45.972 --> 00:07:48.490
of state and local governments.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.739
And particularly how
important and critical

00:07:50.739 --> 00:07:53.350
were issues of governance
at the local level.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.730
There was, as you probably recall,

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.170
quite a lot of conversation about

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.870
regionalism and regional governance.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.300
Particularly in this part of the world

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.740
where you have so many counties

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.930
sort of engaged and colliding in issues.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.710
There were so many
fertile topics of study.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.780
But, at the same time, not
that many law professors.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.500
Not that many public law scholars

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.412
who are really, really looking closely at

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:18.310
issues of state governance
and local governance.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.690
There was a sense that there's
not a lot in it for them.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.970
And none of us really
wanted to be specialists

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.680
in, say, California law
or Massachusetts law.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.718
So, I saw this area as an
area of enormous interest

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:34.150
and quite a lot of fertile topics.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.360
- And, since you were in law school,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.870
the time has come for that agenda,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.817
really, in a very pronounced way.

00:08:41.817 --> 00:08:45.340
As we see, for example, with Obamacare

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.300
where all the arguments are about

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.343
the relationship to the state,

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.180
for example with the
regard to the exchanges,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.770
and whether there should
be national exchanges

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.350
if there are no state exchanges.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.490
- Well, there's no question about that.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.730
I mentioned, a moment ago,

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.790
that it wasn't, when I
began my academic career,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.950
an extremely active time

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.580
in the adjudication and the
judicial process in federalism.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.880
Well, that changed quite a bit.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.240
It really changed, in large part,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.020
due to the innovations of the
so-called Rehnquist court.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.620
So, there was, over the
past, really, two decades,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.920
a greater amount of attention

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.180
on the part of the federal courts,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.610
particularly the Supreme Court,

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.890
on issues of federalism.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.723
At the same time...

00:09:27.723 --> 00:09:29.030
And you mentioned Obamacare.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.550
The last three or four
presidential administrations

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.690
have brought a number of just
fascinating, interesting,

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.830
novel experiments with
regard to the relationship

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.860
among the state and federal government.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.650
But also with regard to the relationship

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.680
between Congress and the presidency.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.238
So you have two fascinating

00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:48.890
sort of clusters of activities colliding.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.620
The greater innovation
and work done in the

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.840
political branches, in
the political process.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.060
But also a greater amount of attention

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.370
on the part of the Supreme Court

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.850
in these particular issues.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.010
- Did your background in
political science or whatever,

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.820
a continuing interest you have in politics

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.430
inform your legal research?

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.970
- You know, the answer is yes.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.340
But in a little incongruous way.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.852
So, again, my own experience in college

00:10:15.852 --> 00:10:17.590
is how I've described it.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.574
My experience in law school

00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:23.500
is as a hard-working law student,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.840
but it really began when
I began my academic career

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.930
here at Berkeley.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.330
And I had the wonderful opportunity

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.190
to learn from and study
with a number of colleagues.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.960
Both within the law
school here at Boalt Hall,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.840
but also a little more indirectly

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.920
with some terrific political scientists.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.490
The role, just for example,

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.950
of the Institute of Governmental
Studies here at Berkeley

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.269
was very important on me.

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:52.952
Unlike law professors these days

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:55.436
who tend to come to law teaching careers

00:10:55.436 --> 00:10:57.170
with another advanced degree.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.270
That's, by far, the most
common professional.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.240
I didn't.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.730
So, I came here, in some sense,

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.030
not being excessively humble,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.230
with no particular business

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.150
being a tenure-track faculty member.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.800
I didn't have another graduate degree.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.540
So much of my education was,

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.480
as they say, on-the-job training.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.440
So my first few years here at Berkeley

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.280
really developed a very strong interest in

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.220
and I think a lot of training
in political science,

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.820
some amount of political
theory, economics.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.970
That really helped
burnish my academic skills

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.680
- And so, in a way, the challenges

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.656
you confronted as an individual

00:11:33.656 --> 00:11:37.821
are comparable to the
challenges you confront

00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:42.821
as a law school dean in
rethinking law school curriculum.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.650
- You know, I hadn't really
thought about it that way,

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.040
but I find that quite insightful.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.360
You know, I wouldn't have
thought about that at the time

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.570
as I began my administrative career,

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.928
but, yes, in short, I think I brought

00:11:55.928 --> 00:11:58.130
both my training and my perspectives

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.937
as an on-the-job trainer in these

00:12:01.937 --> 00:12:03.603
to my administrative career.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.588
- I like to ask my guests about
the skills and temperament

00:12:09.588 --> 00:12:14.588
that are part of the profession or career

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.380
that you've chosen.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.000
And I know that that's changing,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.690
but let's talk about the
time when you were a student

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.180
and then we'll move to how
that might be changing.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.770
So, what are the skills that,

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.139
in your day, were seen as
important for a law student?

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:38.490
- Well, certainly, an
enormous amount of energy

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:43.330
and attention to the study
and into that process.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.450
My experience at Harvard,

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.076
and I have no reason to
believe it would be different

00:12:46.076 --> 00:12:49.110
at the other great American law schools,

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.540
was not exactly the Paper
Chase, if you recall that,

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.443
but it was not long after that.

00:12:54.443 --> 00:12:58.760
There was a hierarchy and
there was an expectation

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.400
that we were there to
study and learn the law

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.770
through the Socratic method

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.060
and through, really, old techniques.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.660
Rigor was very important.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.630
We felt like we knew a lot
from our undergraduate careers

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.240
and we were all very smart
and did well on tests.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.930
But the expectations that the faculty

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.940
had for us as law
students in terms of rigor

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.500
and explaining our arguments and analyzing

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.980
was really absolutely critical.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.410
For some of us, not so much
myself, but some of us,

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.618
we came into law school

00:13:28.618 --> 00:13:31.790
with an enormous
experience in that regard.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.380
For others, we developed that
while we were in law school.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.114
So I would say to have a
sense of just rigor and care,

00:13:39.114 --> 00:13:42.890
not only in the study, but in expression.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.540
We like to say, in the
practice of American law,

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.860
that the importance, particularly
in the United States,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.150
of written communication
is absolutely critical.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.337
You know, we watch on television

00:13:52.337 --> 00:13:54.900
the Perry Masons or the Law and Orders

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.630
or somebody arguing for the Supreme Court

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.585
and you get the sense that we're all

00:13:59.585 --> 00:14:01.520
a bunch of junior Daniel Websters.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.300
But the reality is most...

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.020
The bottom line is most
of the practice of law

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.110
and most of the process of advocacy

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.820
comes through written expression.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.590
So the ability to develop the skills

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.990
to express yourself in written form

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.580
is absolutely critical for a law student.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.580
- What about temperament?

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.440
- This might be a somewhat
surprising answer,

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.910
but I think humility is a big part of it.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.770
I think, as the old saying goes,

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.390
knowing what you don't know.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.360
Which, in the study of law
and the practice of law,

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.270
is a good deal, to put it mildly.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.268
So having the temperament
in which you have

00:14:34.268 --> 00:14:36.940
the kind of modesty or humility.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.800
I'll give you an example.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.350
One of our distinguished
graduates of the law school

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.110
that I'm the dean of

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.330
is a man who's argued
more Supreme Court cases

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.550
than any living lawyer, nearly 80.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.854
And so, I asked him one time,

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:50.543
"There's nothing you don't know.

00:14:50.543 --> 00:14:52.864
You've practiced before the
Supreme Court nearly 80 times.

00:14:52.864 --> 00:14:56.270
You must be so used to it."

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.380
And the answer he gave
was really surprising.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.460
He says, "I have humility
every single time.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.530
Not fear.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.220
But humility in terms of the temperament

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.920
that I bring to the process."

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.740
So I think that, among
the many lists of skills

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.500
that I think great law
students and lawyers have,

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.030
having that sense of
self-confidence on the one hand,

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.743
but a lack of hubris is a
big part of that temperament.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.170
- One of the things that I
want to talk to you about

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.020
is being dean and the transformations that

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.110
are occurring in the legal profession

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.420
and in law schools.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.430
But, before we get to that,

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.040
I want to ask something
about being a lawyer

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.700
as a cultural icon in the era

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.040
when you did your training.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.770
And, by that, I mean that,

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.610
on the one hand, the Perry Mason,

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.000
the Clarence Darrow, the Louis Brandeis,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.420
the Felix Frankfurter were seen as

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.160
people who one could
emulate to the extent that

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.410
you actually wanted to be them

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.350
or be one of the cohort
that they were part of.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.990
So that's one thing.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.520
The other thing a lawyer...

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.090
And this was less known.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.010
Was, in training to go to law school,

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.710
you were becoming part of a guild.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.370
Almost a medieval guild,

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.250
in the sense that you were
trained to learn a craft

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:28.060
and the guild limited the number of people

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.838
who were in the guild.

00:16:29.838 --> 00:16:34.400
And then, thirdly, law...

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.160
I'm not trying to make a speech here.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.873
- No, this is very helpful.

00:16:40.091 --> 00:16:41.670
- The law, as a career,

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.670
was a default choice for many students.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.410
I don't know what I want to
do, so I'll become a lawyer.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.948
So talk a little about
those three strands,

00:16:50.948 --> 00:16:55.060
especially in your time
when you were in law school.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.200
because that's changing.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.660
- So, it's a wonderful way to capture it.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.570
Let me touch on all three,

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.810
'cause I think all they all come together

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.300
and, indeed, it's a wonderful segue

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.840
to the challenges we're facing right now

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.320
in the practice and legal education.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.250
So, as to the first, yes, we put,

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.360
as I came to the law school,
myself and my classmates,

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.930
lawyers on an enormous pedestal.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.180
Now, quite frankly, some of that

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.313
might have to do with going to Harvard

00:17:17.313 --> 00:17:21.540
where there's such
distinguished careers of these

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.440
extraordinary graduates whose busts you

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.140
saw as you came to school,

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.670
but it really captured, in the
faculty and the curriculum,

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.590
the sense that we were entering
into a noble profession

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.360
and that maybe we would
have, as part of our careers,

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.070
arguing before the Supreme Court.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.860
Now, I will say that that
was an aspiration for

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.870
a number of my classmates.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.890
Elena Kagan was a classmate of
mine and a number of others.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.080
So, there was a sense that

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.280
we could really aspire to greatness.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.170
But the bottom line is we
saw the legal profession

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.460
as an extraordinary and
enormously important calling

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.190
and also with a real
sense of responsibility.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.320
Now, you mentioned the guild.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.320
And that's also had and
has a powerful force

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.290
on how we think about
the legal profession.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.200
And the contrast that
I would draw, if I may,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.260
is between entering the
guild of being a lawyer

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.680
or entering the guild of being a doctor

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.040
versus entering into a profession,

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.940
say, as a businessperson or others

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.760
where you don't really need
a particular credential

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.618
in order to be part of that.

00:18:25.618 --> 00:18:28.850
So, the notion behind entering this guild,

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.610
which is, of course, a
long-standing tradition,

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.750
is that you had to go to law school.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.340
Not just be educated in the law.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.390
You had to go to law school.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.050
And law school had to look
like a particular thing.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.000
Three year program with a set curriculum,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.800
taking a bar examination
after you graduate.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.410
All of that that led to
being part of a club,

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.750
you might say, guild.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:55.270
And, while that was probably
becoming anachronistic,

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.240
even when I was in law school,

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.490
we didn't have that sense.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.783
And our faculty at Harvard
really gave us a sense that

00:19:01.783 --> 00:19:05.150
they were giving us the training

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.250
that enabled us to be part
of this extraordinary club.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.290
Sort of secret knowledge or information.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.440
The last point that you touched on,

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.410
which is sort of the default issue,

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.080
is a really powerful one, as well.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.740
By contrast, to go into
medical school, for example,

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.880
where there's an enormous amount

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.450
of training and scaffolding that goes into

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:27.120
building your background
to go to medical school.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.130
You can sort of fall into law school.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.220
Take a law school admissions
test, do well in college.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.381
And so, there was a sense that

00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:38.650
among the tens of
thousands of law students

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.810
who were going to, at the time,

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:45.810
the 160 or so United States
law schools, only a handful...

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.340
Well, maybe more than a handful.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.520
That not a majority were folks that

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.570
really aspired to go to law school

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.130
because they loved studying the law

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.840
or really aspired to become a lawyer

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.120
because they saw it is a great calling.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.240
So, in some sense, it's
one of the deficits

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.800
of the fact that anyone
can go to law school.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.610
Nearly anyone can go to law school.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.400
In that there's not a
lot of background sorting

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.912
that really gives one a sense of

00:20:10.912 --> 00:20:14.590
what kind of career or
study they're entering into.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.180
- Before we talk about
the challenges of a dean,

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.430
let's talk about being a dean.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:24.007
What are the skills and temperament that

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.920
you think need to be
present if one, as a lawyer,

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.543
is also going to be dean of a law school?

00:20:33.543 --> 00:20:36.730
- Well, so, let me get at that answer by

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.791
beginning with what is, I think,

00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:42.710
hopefully a short sentence
of what the job entails.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:43.990
So, there's all these different parts.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.230
You could answer that question

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.440
by aggregating all the things that I do

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.610
in the course of my day.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.888
But the real summary is
you're really looking at

00:20:50.888 --> 00:20:55.240
360 degrees of the
entirety of the law school

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.372
as an organization.

00:20:56.372 --> 00:20:59.574
Very much unlike what you
do as a law professor,

00:20:59.574 --> 00:21:03.070
as a law student, or really
any other constituency group.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.220
I am responsible for the overall
management, organization,

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.470
and the leadership of a
medium-sized organization.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.407
I don't do it alone and
Lord knows I call upon

00:21:14.407 --> 00:21:16.530
an extraordinarily able administration.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.610
All of that's true.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.080
But I have to have and am responsible

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.460
for having the big picture.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.760
So, to the skillset.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.480
Certainly, some of the
obvious answers that question

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.260
is organizational skills,

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.970
a sense of some financial literacy,

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.370
since I'm, after all, managing
a fairly large budget.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.830
All of those skills are important.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.950
Being a people person,
if I can use that phrase,

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.880
in terms of interaction.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.420
But I would dig just a little bit deeper

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.300
and say that one of the
one of the skill sets

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.308
that's absolutely important

00:21:45.308 --> 00:21:47.791
is a sense of appreciation for

00:21:47.791 --> 00:21:50.470
the diversity and the breadth

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.400
of what we do in our particular schools.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.990
You have to be or you
ought to be as a dean

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.350
to have not only a knowledge
of, but an appreciation for,

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.440
the work of the faculty.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.300
The way in which faculty members balance

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.550
teaching and research,

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.090
for the aspirations and
objectives and goals

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.320
of your law students

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.060
and understanding what
they're going through.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.020
You certainly have to have

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.850
an appreciation for the
diversity and breadth

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.710
of experience of your alumni.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.760
Not only because you're
often in a position

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.850
of asking them for financial donations,

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.610
which we are, but also you're
really trying to capture

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.540
what their experiences
were in your law school.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.040
Whether they graduated one
year ago or fifty years ago.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.440
And that requires, I think,

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.680
the kind of breadth of experience that,

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.700
quite frankly, you don't
pick up in law school

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.700
or even as a tenured member
of a law school faculty.

00:22:41.613 --> 00:22:46.510
- Where did your organizational
background come from?

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.820
Was this something you picked up

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.880
in the course of your education

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.620
or is it something that comes naturally?

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.610
- Well, it certainly
doesn't come naturally.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.370
In all candor, I picked up...

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.970
Whatever skills I developed

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.980
in terms of organizational ability,

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.430
I began developing after
I was named as dean,

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.050
which is certainly not optimal.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.190
You have to understand that I became dean.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.810
Entered, in many respects,

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.670
the second part of my career
as an academic administrator

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.790
when I was 34 years old.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.500
When I'd been on the faculty
here at Berkeley for 10 years

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.460
without any particular knowable skillset

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:25.060
that would have trained me to
be an academic administrator.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.902
I'd never been an associate
dean, for example.

00:23:26.902 --> 00:23:29.430
I'm not trying to be excessively humble

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.810
saying I didn't have skills.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.330
But I didn't know whether I would have

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.330
the kind of skillset that would enable me

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:40.330
to lead a law school until I began

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.303
as dean at the University of San Diego.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.440
- So, in a way, as dean...

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:52.380
You mentioned some of the
constituencies that you have.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:57.380
So the political management
of those constituencies.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.280
And I don't use political...

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.594
I use it in a positive sense,
not in a pejorative sense.

00:24:04.594 --> 00:24:09.594
In addition, I guess, other
elements of the constituency

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:16.050
are law firms, state government,
and the Bar Association.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.480
The managers of the...

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.090
- Not to mention your university setting.

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.800
Because as one dean,
maybe of a law school,

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.550
maybe someone else, put it,

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.180
we're a number of things simultaneously.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.360
And one is we're middle level managers.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.740
We're not the provost

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.740
and we're not the
chancellor or the president.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.410
That's not to say that we don't have

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.270
an extraordinary realm of influence

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.520
or even power over our institutions.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.030
But we also have to navigate,

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.940
to come back to a
federalism theme, if I may,

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.200
vertical relationships,

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.330
in addition to horizontal relationships.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:53.330
- So in these times, there
are numerous challenges

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.710
that law schools are facing.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:03.710
So, managing the transition
in a time of great change

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.829
is important additional component

00:25:09.829 --> 00:25:13.993
of one's leadership as a dean.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:19.540
Let's talk about these
various constituencies and

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.870
how they're changing in

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.260
what their expectations are of law school.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:31.260
In one of your blog posts,
you mentioned the problems

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.640
being posed by state government,
in a way, in terms of,

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.713
at a time when you're trying
to rethink the curriculum,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.247
states of New York and
California are saying,

00:25:46.247 --> 00:25:48.400
"Well you should do this
or you should do..."

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.430
Talk a little about that,

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.430
because that's an important challenge.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.263
- I'm glad you raised it.

00:25:53.263 --> 00:25:54.280
It's very much on my mind.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.330
And, indeed, it's on the mind

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.220
of a number of law
school deans and leaders.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.700
There's a real paradox going on

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.141
or a real puzzle, you might say.

00:26:02.141 --> 00:26:04.553
And I think you described it well.

00:26:04.553 --> 00:26:07.120
On the one hand, this is a period of time

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.870
in which law schools are going
through an enormous amount

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:13.730
of innovation or needing to go
through a lot of innovation.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.855
They're innovating in
terms of the curriculum,

00:26:15.855 --> 00:26:19.900
at developing new modalities
of legal education,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.660
new techniques of legal education.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.930
Not unlike other parts of the university.

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:26.067
The role of technology and how we teach.

00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:29.180
The significant role of
experiential learning

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.480
to try to sort of navigate
the twin challenges

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.950
of developing more
interdisciplinary education,

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.740
which is vitally important
to the practice of law,

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.240
on the one hand, but, on the other,

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.440
developing the kind of skillset that

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.178
enables our students to
become practice proficient

00:26:44.178 --> 00:26:46.030
when the time they graduate.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.450
And any number of other innovations.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:48.283
So, there's a lot...

00:26:48.283 --> 00:26:50.440
Suffice to say, there's a lot going on.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.850
But, in order to...

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.480
And, at the same time, and
this is a very important point,

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.313
at the same time,

00:26:55.313 --> 00:26:58.090
the costs of legal education
have become astronomical.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.590
So all of us in American law schools,

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.150
even those of us who have the privilege

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.280
to lead elite American law schools,

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.780
have to be conscious of the high costs.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.740
So the challenges are very acute.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.337
And a number of law schools,

00:27:10.337 --> 00:27:12.258
indeed, I think the
majority of law schools,

00:27:12.258 --> 00:27:13.643
are rising to that challenge

00:27:13.643 --> 00:27:16.490
and are developing quite
a lot of innovations.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.860
Now, at the same time, one
of our constituency groups...

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.440
Very important that you mentioned.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.880
Which is the State Bar
Associations and state government

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.330
have in mind what, from my perspective

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.080
and I think from many perspectives,

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.380
are truncated and, in many respects,

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.300
fairly narrow view of the obligations

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.787
and the responsibilities of a law school.

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:37.990
And one of the ways in
which they're manifest,

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.709
as I've written about and spoken about,

00:27:39.709 --> 00:27:43.610
is the development of
additional core curriculum

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.923
that they are looking to insist upon

00:27:45.923 --> 00:27:48.220
at law schools within their states.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.220
Now, let's be clear.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.580
They have the right to do that.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.160
This is not an issue of prerogative

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.470
or freedom of law schools
to do whatever they do.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:55.630
Our law schools are accredited

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.400
by the American Bar Association.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.440
The students have a law degree,
can sit for the State Bar.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.750
So, it's within the prerogative
of the state judiciaries

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.430
or the State Bar Associations

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.660
to not only cajole law schools,

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.440
but to even impose requirements.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.892
The problem, though, is the imposition of

00:28:11.892 --> 00:28:16.892
these very specific,
practice-oriented legal requirements

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.020
impose significant costs
and burdens on law schools.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.347
Again, at a time in which law schools

00:28:22.347 --> 00:28:23.890
are needing to economize.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.871
And they also are trying to develop

00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:30.755
and aspire to develop a
one-size-fits-all paradigm

00:28:30.755 --> 00:28:33.510
on law schools, frustratingly,

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.500
just at the time that law
schools are innovating

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.530
in important ways to catch up to

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.140
the realities of legal practice.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.060
So, these dilemmas collide

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.690
and create an enormous amount
of burdens on law schools.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.370
And no one should weep about

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.180
the dilemma of law school deans.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.908
The burdens that they
impose on law schools

00:28:49.908 --> 00:28:52.940
are, of course, burdens
they impose on law students

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.930
and the ability of law schools

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.460
to really educate law students

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.719
for a very dynamic new economy.

00:28:58.719 --> 00:29:03.440
- Does this become a problem
of political education,

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.273
in a sense?

00:29:04.273 --> 00:29:08.370
In other words, the ability to communicate

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.727
with these various constituencies and say,

00:29:10.727 --> 00:29:12.990
"Hey, I hear what you're asking for,

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.020
but, you know, we've got other pressures.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.320
And you need to take that into..."

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.420
- You know, it's a great point.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.280
And I would even broaden
the point to say this.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.380
To bring it back to us.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.031
Because what I've just
said sort of seems to

00:29:22.031 --> 00:29:24.795
put the blame, as it were,

00:29:24.795 --> 00:29:26.930
on these other constituency groups.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.540
But let's face the law
school's responsibility.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.960
We have conducted ourselves,
in American legal education,

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.480
for decades now, with a
sense of leave us alone.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.830
We know what's best.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.420
We'll develop our curriculum.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.870
We'll hire a faculty.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.300
We'll develop our mission.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.060
And you guys just sort
of stay out of things.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.990
And so, I mean, once the law schools

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.870
are accredited by the
American Bar Association,

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.040
which is not that burdensome of a process,

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.364
we've mostly lived in our ivory towers.

00:29:53.364 --> 00:29:57.020
So, one of the fundamental
problems with that

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.210
is we have not done a very good job

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.190
over the course of the last many years

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.620
in communicating to
these constituency groups

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.720
why we're innovating, what
we're doing to innovate,

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.150
and what our missions are.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.700
So, we're now in a very
difficult political position.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.533
You mentioned political.

00:30:11.533 --> 00:30:12.670
I think it's the right way to put it.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.540
Where we're sort of
scrambling to articulate

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.535
a vision of what law
schools are looking to do

00:30:18.535 --> 00:30:21.320
when it might be, if not too late,

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.160
then sort of in the fourth quarter,

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.040
if I could use a football
analogy, of this debate.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.010
Then, we're in a position, again...

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.080
And I think political is the
right way to describe it.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.970
Of seeming defensive,
seeming antagonistic,

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.690
and seeming condescending

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:42.750
to a number of well-meaning
lawyers and judges

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.350
who have been working
to engage in a dialogue

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.300
with law schools for a great many years.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.847
So, I would just say that we
need to engage in a dialogue.

00:30:50.847 --> 00:30:54.097
Not push back in the
sense of basically saying,

00:30:54.097 --> 00:30:55.970
"Leave us alone to do
what we've been doing

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.370
for a number of decades."

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.220
But engage in a certain mea culpa

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.866
at the level of dialogue and
engage these stakeholders

00:31:03.866 --> 00:31:06.820
in a very important conversation about,

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.640
frankly, what the future
of legal education

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.117
is going to be like in the coming years.

00:31:11.117 --> 00:31:15.566
- In 2012, I guess the
ABA, the Bar Association,

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:17.729
did a report on law schools.

00:31:17.729 --> 00:31:22.729
I was reading an account of
that and of their conclusions.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.010
And one struck me, which was,

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.080
well, you might think about

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.100
not having tenure in law schools.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:36.100
Now, that strikes me as one
of those recommendations that,

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.920
really, in the context of a
university and its governance,

00:31:45.182 --> 00:31:47.426
is not very practical.

00:31:47.426 --> 00:31:49.592
- Right, well, there's two ways to...

00:31:49.592 --> 00:31:52.238
One doesn't want to
overread that sentence,

00:31:52.238 --> 00:31:54.510
which comes in the context of,

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.730
as you know if you read it,

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.270
an omnibus report that

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.940
sort of throws out a number of ideas.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.710
There was another part
of that report that says

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.464
law professors shouldn't think
that much about prestige.

00:32:03.464 --> 00:32:04.306
There's another.

00:32:04.306 --> 00:32:06.070
Law school should innovate more.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.430
So, one way to understand
that is a little bit of...

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:12.320
I mean, it's kind of a bomb
throwing line, you might say.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.500
But a bit of a maybe you
should think about that.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.850
The other way to think about it, though,

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.300
is in a moral alarmist sense,

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.740
which is what they're really
urging upon law schools.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.710
The vast majority of which
are part of universities.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:30.710
Is really to abandon this
extraordinary device that,

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:34.580
of course, has been part of universities,

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.830
if not forever, then
for quite a bit of time.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.820
That, of course, that reading presents an

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.730
enormous amount of controversy.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.010
I will just say this on the larger issue.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.480
There's two very different
dimensions of this debate

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.390
about job security and
tenure for law professors.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.240
One dimension that you just touched on

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.730
is whether it's a good
idea for law schools

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.034
to have essentially tenure
or tenure-like protections

00:32:56.034 --> 00:32:58.440
for their full-time faculty.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.250
That's a larger topic, I'll just say.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.290
As a sentence, I think it is a good idea

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.327
and I think law schools have developed,

00:33:04.327 --> 00:33:07.180
as part of universities,
extraordinary abilities.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.220
In no small part because of
having a full-time faculty

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.830
that's doing teaching and research.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.160
But I'll say the other dimension of that

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.110
is a very different one.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.190
And that is not so much a
counseling to law schools

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:18.640
to give up on tenure,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.490
but actually an exhortation to the ABA

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:22.620
in accrediting law schools,

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.850
the American Bar Association,

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:25.440
not to require tenure.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.850
And that's more of an
argument about innovation.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.400
Let a thousand flowers bloom.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.290
That is, let law schools experiment

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:34.870
with different modalities of organization.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:36.613
And, if a law school wants to develop

00:33:36.613 --> 00:33:40.810
a paradigm of different
kinds of teaching...

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.060
Maybe relying upon practicing
lawyers or adjunct faculty

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:49.060
or maybe having term contracts
or other sorts of devices.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.860
Maybe that would be a
good thing to try out.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.670
I'm much more sympathetic, I should say,

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.490
to that paradigm, because
that really gives us a sense

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:59.770
of the marketplace of ideas
and marketplace of innovation,

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.017
which I'm quite sympathetic to.

00:34:01.017 --> 00:34:05.160
- So, it becomes important
for all the players to,

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.480
on the one hand,

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.430
understand the problems of
particular constituencies,

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:13.850
but, on the other hand,
be open to innovation

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.100
wherever it's coming from.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.760
One of the other challenges...

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.390
I mentioned law firms.

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:23.870
There seems to be quite
an amazing transformation

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.114
occurring within firms,

00:34:26.114 --> 00:34:31.114
their hiring practices, the
whole nature of partnership,

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:36.360
and the building of an
entrenched hierarchy within firms

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.710
where the people at the very top

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:44.710
who've been in the firm a long
time are doing quite well,

00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:47.740
but this may not be true
of the younger lawyers.

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.820
- That's exactly right.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.190
There's extraordinary changes.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:53.710
A wide amount of changes going on

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.281
in our great American law firms.

00:34:55.281 --> 00:34:57.060
And, as in so many respects,

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.340
law schools are just
catching up to those changes.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.950
And, you know, without
providing a bullet point list,

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:06.465
the role of technology, it
has transformed law schools.

00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:09.350
Sorry, law firms in important ways

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.560
and reduced the need for
the kind of labor force

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.900
that was so characteristic
of these law firms

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.080
in the old firm where you'd have

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.320
a pyramid of law firm partners at the top

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.210
and this large army of associates

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.280
doing this extraordinary amount of work.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.320
Clients are pushing back against law firms

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.135
assigning first or second year associates

00:35:29.135 --> 00:35:32.980
who might bill at $500 or more an hour

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.760
to work on their particular cases.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.660
So, as a consequence, law firms are hiring

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.790
fewer law firm associates.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:40.360
There are issues of work-life balance

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.940
where a number of
lawyers, male and female,

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.900
are asking themselves, "Now, explain to me

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.566
why I'm spending 10 years
at the prime of my life

00:35:48.566 --> 00:35:53.050
working like a dog with
a fairly remote chance

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:53.910
of being a partner."

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.840
Globalization has had enormous impact.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.260
So these and other challenges are changing

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.388
the structure of American law firms

00:36:00.388 --> 00:36:02.430
in very significant ways.

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:04.970
One of the most profound impacts

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.060
on law schools and legal education

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.660
is, quite simply, fewer
positions as law firm associates

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:15.760
and thus fewer positions
with significant remuneration

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.710
for law students who are
coming out of law school

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.960
with extraordinary amount of debt.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.310
The larger question of
whether those law firms

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.080
will be permanently transformed

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.448
and the whole business model

00:36:25.448 --> 00:36:29.760
of the large American or
worldwide law firm will change,

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.210
too soon to tell.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.410
But I think the direction
is very much toward

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.750
fundamental structural
rather than cyclical change

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:37.890
in terms of the practice of law.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:40.730
- So, does this mean that, you as a dean,

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:44.513
that you tinker with the curriculum,

00:36:44.513 --> 00:36:47.678
but not make any drastic change

00:36:47.678 --> 00:36:52.570
until you are sure that
the environment out there

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.207
has really changed?

00:36:54.207 --> 00:36:56.350
- Well, you know, as a pundit once said,

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.647
a politician, I think,

00:36:57.647 --> 00:37:00.080
"Where you stand depends
on where you sit."

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.820
And that's true of American law school.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.770
So I think the challenge...

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.100
There are about 200 ABA
accredited law schools

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.470
and there's, of course,
quite a pecking order

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:07.830
in American law schools.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.870
Only a fraction of those 200 law schools

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:15.940
send a significant critical
mass of their students

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.500
to the largest law firms
in the United States.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.780
It doesn't mean that the other law schools

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.613
should go out of business.

00:37:20.613 --> 00:37:21.446
Far from it.

00:37:21.446 --> 00:37:24.460
It just means the vast majority
of American law schools

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.460
produce graduates who
go to smaller law firms.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.670
Maybe solo practitioners.

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:31.990
Go into the public sector.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.140
So, part of the challenge is

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.750
whether you tinker with the curriculum,

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.500
whether you develop different
modalities of instruction

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.000
depends on where you are in that ambit.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.120
So, to bring it back to my law school

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.550
or this law school here at
Berkeley, which I was a part,

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:48.750
where we do send so many of our
students to large law firms,

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:52.240
yes, we tinker or even make
more substantial changes

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.550
to our law school curriculum.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.950
If I had to say what the
major innovation that

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.620
the nation's great law schools
are doing, including mine,

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.260
it's developing more
interdisciplinary training

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.620
and multidisciplinary training.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.780
And what does that mean in practice?

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.410
It means developing the kinds
of skills in our students

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.800
so they can they can pivot
and be flexible in terms of

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.830
developing their skillset
and their careers.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:17.280
So, yes, all the traditional
body of knowledge,

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.700
the kind of information they need

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.550
to be practicing lawyers from day one.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:23.360
Yes, but also the development
of business skills,

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.510
the development exposure to technology,

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.250
the ability to read a spreadsheet,

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.010
to know something about coding,

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.090
to know something about
international initiatives.

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.880
There's just different kinds of skills

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.350
than the kinds of skills
that my law school,

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.522
when I went to law school,
really thought that

00:38:38.522 --> 00:38:42.570
it was responsible for in
training its law students.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:46.017
- So, a law student might
have to be thinking about,

00:38:46.017 --> 00:38:47.771
"Well, I'm not going to be in a law firm.

00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:52.590
I may actually be in a startup
or a number of startups.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:56.860
Advising them about patent infringement

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.890
or, you know, the legality..."

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:04.890
Well, think of Uber and
Lyft that essentially...

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:10.240
Well, what are the local
rules that apply to taxi cabs

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.570
that we're gonna have
to become involved in?

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:13.560
- Well, that's exactly right.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.130
And it's even more daunting than that,

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:18.687
because what a law student
now has to think of is,

00:39:18.687 --> 00:39:22.310
"I may be entering a profession in which

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.930
I need to know now

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:25.940
that I'm developing the kind of skills

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.990
to enter into an economy that will

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.680
change rapidly over the course
of my first 10 or 20 years

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.160
of the profession in ways that
I can't expect or predict."

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.570
Technology will change in important ways

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:40.360
that will change the
nature of the practice.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.740
The economic model of
legal practice will change.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.650
I may not even be a
so-called practicing lawyer

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:48.483
10 years from now.

00:39:48.483 --> 00:39:50.830
I may be a C-suite executive or

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:52.490
I may be an entrepreneur

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.170
or I might be working
in a university setting.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.010
So, there's always been
uncertainty, right?

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.990
No one can predict their entire careers

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.120
when they look at it ex-ante.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.360
But the kind of uncertainty and turbulence

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.260
that's happening in the profession now

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:09.830
is so striking that it
requires an enormous amount

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:14.830
of self-confidence and also
sort of risk-taking behavior

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.750
on the part of law students now

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:19.960
to know what they need to
develop the skills that

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.274
will enable them to
thrive in the new economy.

00:40:22.274 --> 00:40:25.030
- When one thinks of
university curriculums,

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:30.030
they're often unwilling to accept change.

00:40:30.208 --> 00:40:34.820
Faculty and sometimes the administrators

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.900
who are responding to the faculty.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:41.633
Does that pose a particular
dilemma for deans?

00:40:41.633 --> 00:40:43.690
- It poses a dilemma on steroids

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:46.268
and what I mean by that is
all of what you note about

00:40:46.268 --> 00:40:50.070
maybe the innate conservatism
of university culture

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:54.250
is a dilemma that we
face in our law schools.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.450
Added to that is the innate
conservatism of legal practice,

00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:59.650
to go back to the guild
that you mentioned before.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:01.930
You know, nothing succeeds like success

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.600
or if it ain't broke don't fix it.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.640
And the basic idea being that law school

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.730
has succeeded as a profession
and the law school curriculum

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:12.690
has looked mostly like it
has for 100 years or more.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:14.220
So, you contrast it with my colleagues

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.053
in the business school.

00:41:15.053 --> 00:41:17.000
Whatever one might say
about business schools...

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.197
And I don't want to sit here

00:41:18.197 --> 00:41:21.290
and valorize business
school education in America,

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:25.540
but the genius of business
schools in the last 50, 60 years

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.300
is they developed a market

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.960
for a Master of Business
Administration, an MBA,

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.050
that is not required by
any guild or any state.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.050
You don't need an MBA to do anything.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.910
So, what business goals...

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:37.890
And, if I sound jealous,

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:39.640
it's because I am a little bit jealous.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.560
The business schools
have been able to develop

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.440
is innovation that
comes from the fact that

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.890
they are developing a body
of curriculum and training

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:50.860
that is, almost by design, keeps up with

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.760
trends and developments
in the modern marketplace.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.813
Law schools could use some of that

00:41:55.813 --> 00:42:00.810
in more modesty, more
humility, and more innovation

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.310
in how they develop their curriculum.

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:05.227
So, I think getting out of the
mindset that basically says,

00:42:05.227 --> 00:42:06.585
"You know, what's good for law students

00:42:06.585 --> 00:42:09.480
in the two thousand teens
is basically what was

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.840
good for law students in the 1940s" would

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.978
be a big part of the
progress that we could make.

00:42:14.978 --> 00:42:19.978
- Another important
constituency is student alumni

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:24.003
and divide the Alumni category

00:42:24.003 --> 00:42:27.810
into recent alumni and older alumni.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:31.016
And I do that because the challenges

00:42:31.016 --> 00:42:35.090
of recent alumni are much greater

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.280
than you've ever seen before.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.820
And we should talk a little about that,

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.951
because tuition is going up,

00:42:41.951 --> 00:42:44.330
students leave with a lot of debt,

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.556
if they're not on on scholarship,

00:42:46.556 --> 00:42:49.480
and then they're not finding the job.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:54.330
So, for recent alumni,
they're in a real bind.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.183
- Oh, there's no question.

00:42:56.183 --> 00:42:57.890
So, just focusing on the recent alumni.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:00.860
It's a tale of two groups,
to oversimplify a bit.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.170
One group are the group of
students and recent alumni

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.530
who you described who
come out, in some cases,

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.780
with crushing debt, substantial debt.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:12.290
100,000, 200,000 is not that unusual.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:14.380
And they come out with...

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.370
While they don't necessarily have regrets

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:17.830
about their legal education,

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:20.419
they come out often with
a fair amount of cynicism

00:43:20.419 --> 00:43:23.501
and indeed stress that
comes from the fact that

00:43:23.501 --> 00:43:27.400
their career choices
are, in important ways,

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.540
distorted by the fact
that they're gonna spend

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.952
a good number of years
early in their careers

00:43:31.952 --> 00:43:35.350
paying off their student debt.

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:38.340
So, it doesn't mean that
they're hostile by any means.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.770
Indeed, I spend a lot of time
working with their alumni.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:43.180
But it's really a challenge keeping them

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.370
engaged with the law school

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.320
given the challenges they're
facing in the profession.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.340
That's not to mention social
media and all of these issues

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.020
that have spent now a number of years...

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.160
Folks have spent a number of years

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.467
ganging up on law schools.

00:43:54.467 --> 00:43:57.010
I said it's a tale of two alumni.

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.900
Another group of recent alumni

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.970
see the value of innovation

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.810
and greatly appreciate what law schools,

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:05.850
not only our law school,
but many law schools,

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:09.810
are doing to change the
playbook, to change the script.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:13.440
And they are greatly
appreciative of the law schools

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.300
acknowledging that we have
spent all of these years

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.420
raising tuition,

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.190
all of these years with
existing business models,

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:23.150
but are looking to those
alumni to make challenges.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:24.370
And I'll say the reason why

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:25.990
they're particularly appreciative of that

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:27.740
is they're in the real world.

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.310
They see the kinds of
changes that I'm describing.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.009
They see the need for developing

00:44:32.009 --> 00:44:34.930
different multidisciplinary
kinds of skills.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:37.690
They see the need to develop
so-called soft skills,

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.000
leadership skills and the like

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.330
and I find them enormously important,

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:43.070
this group of recent alumni,

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:47.160
in terms of helping us
engage our constituency group

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.520
of students and faculty to the changes

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.180
that are taking place in the marketplace.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:57.180
- Do you, in a way, almost
have to offer courses that

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:02.050
expose your students to
the changes in the world?

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:04.040
You mentioned globalization.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.030
You mentioned the way technology

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:09.250
is transforming the economy.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:11.300
Or are these courses that

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.630
should be offered in the law school

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.900
or should you send your students

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.220
to other courses on
whatever campus you're on

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.200
to learn about that,

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.950
because you can't give
them a map for their future

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.920
but you can give them tools

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.310
to think about mapping their future?

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:33.260
- I think it's a three pronged strategy.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.100
And some some might add prongs to that.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:40.100
One is certainly working
with folks across campus.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.840
One of the great...

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.130
We talked about the innate
conservatism of universities.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:45.240
The other side of that coin

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.700
is the enormous robust opportunities

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.470
presented by being part of
a major research university.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.750
So, we at Northwestern have,

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.290
as the students here at Berkeley have,

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:58.010
opportunities to work across
campus with our colleagues

00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:59.200
in the business school.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.680
In our case of our law school,

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.550
we're right next door
to the medical school.

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.587
We work closely with
the engineering school

00:46:04.587 --> 00:46:07.670
and other departments to
really develop a set of skills.

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:12.140
We started the first
three year JD-MBA program

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.370
about a dozen years ago

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.100
and we have now dozens and dozens

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.344
of graduates of that program

00:46:16.344 --> 00:46:18.460
who go on into law and business

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.590
with those sorts of skills.

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.180
So the one prong is really developing

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.890
these cross-campus
initiatives and alliances.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.530
The second is, you mentioned,

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:27.870
is courses within the law school.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:29.970
That, in some sense, is the new frontier,

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.927
which is developing alongside

00:46:31.927 --> 00:46:34.700
what I'll call the traditional
law school curriculum,

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.560
an enormous amount of skills.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.060
So I have some rather
off-the-wall ideas in that regard.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.870
I think our law students, for example,

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:43.540
should have exposure to coding.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.120
They're not going to
all be out go out there

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.170
and do computer coding,

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.520
but, just as law students
and undergraduates

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.090
are expected to learn another language

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:52.470
during their time of their
undergraduate experience,

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:53.580
it wouldn't hurt our students.

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.690
It would only help them to have
some exposure to technology.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.570
Some exposure to quantitative methods.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:01.380
So, yes, we need to bring those
courses into the curriculum.

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.295
Just as an aside, let me
say the challenge there

00:47:03.295 --> 00:47:06.320
is not so much student receptivity,

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.393
but faculty bandwidth and
that is to bring in courses

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:10.920
over to the law school,

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.450
it means to bring in a faculty

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:13.480
that can actually train them.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.750
I'll say, third and very briefly,

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.950
the third prong is lifelong
education and learning.

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:21.090
The notion that, in these
precious three years,

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:24.430
we can do all that's necessary
to train law students

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.250
to be able to aspire to leadership

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.680
in the new economy is naive.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.810
So, we need to engage our alumni,

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:35.380
recent alumni and not so recent alumni,

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:39.796
to really provide the kind
of training and education

00:47:39.796 --> 00:47:43.590
that begins in earnest once
they graduate from law school.

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.910
So, we're not just
sending off our students

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:47.390
into the brave new world,

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:48.800
but we're engaging with alumni

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.140
in terms of lifelong training.

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:51.720
So, such programs...

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.200
We have a corporate counsel institute

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.720
that helps young graduates

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.020
who are working in the corporate sector.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:56.900
There are many examples,

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.150
but I think that's very important.

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.230
- Is this an argument for

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:04.230
reducing the number of years in law school

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.010
and taking the third year

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.020
and sending them out into the world

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.260
or at least making the
third year more of a year

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:13.670
in which you go out,

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:15.720
the student goes out, into the world

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:20.720
and works in a startup,
whatever, in a hospital

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.250
to see what the issues are

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:24.730
in medical delivery services and so on?

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:25.866
- I'm smiling, because, of course,

00:48:25.866 --> 00:48:27.430
you put your finger on what's

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.792
an enormous, vigorous debate right now

00:48:29.792 --> 00:48:32.650
that's in the media and
certainly within law schools

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:35.550
about the famous question
of whether the third year

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:37.300
is or is not expendable.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.240
And there're very
different points of view.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.613
And I would summarize my
own thinking about that

00:48:41.613 --> 00:48:42.940
by saying this.

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.800
I don't think the third year
in law school is expendable

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.630
in the sense that what
we're basically doing

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:51.880
is either giving them a
taste of practical training

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.760
that they would be better suited to do

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.730
if they were actually
out into the practice

00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:00.300
nor do I think that
having advanced subjects,

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.480
what we used to call the law and subjects,

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.533
law and philosophy, law and
economics, law and business,

00:49:05.533 --> 00:49:08.500
is just window dressing.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.817
We only have them for three years.

00:49:09.817 --> 00:49:13.260
And the first year is really
a sort of foundational year.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.700
So, I think, at best,

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.120
the third year can build the bridges

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.050
between doing substantial academic work.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:21.090
Let's face it, this is probably

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:23.610
their last year of higher education.

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:26.280
But also significant practical work.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.790
It's, quite frankly, I think,

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:32.790
rather naive and misleading
to expect that the third year,

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:36.800
if replaced from law school,
could just be handed over to

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.370
large law firms or to
judges or to startups

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:43.270
to develop the kinds of
skills that students need.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:45.530
The economic model doesn't
really sustain that.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:48.090
The challenge, though, to
come back to the challenge,

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:51.560
is whether the third year
is justified by its cost,

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.393
because some of the attention,

00:49:52.393 --> 00:49:54.660
and President Obama referred to this,

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.140
I think, about a year and a half ago,

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.150
some of the tension about
this third year of law school

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:01.080
comes from the fact that students

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.330
are already facing an
enormous amount of debt.

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:04.790
They might have the skills to take

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:07.130
and pass a bar examination
after two years.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:11.310
So, what's the justification
to pay another $50,000

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:13.580
and another year out of the work force

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:16.470
in order to take all these
wonderful classes in law school?

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:19.750
- What happens to
affirmative action efforts

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:23.367
in the context of these great
transitions that are going on?

00:50:23.367 --> 00:50:24.710
- That's a great question.

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:26.930
I think that the larger question of

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:30.220
how we continue to commit to diversity

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:35.220
in our law schools in the
face of these challenges

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.110
is a very, very hard issue.

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.580
I don't mean it's hard in terms of

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.000
where our commitment should lie.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.300
I mean it's hard at the
level of implementation.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.300
So, in the era that we're in now

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.520
where all the challenges
that we've been talking about

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.950
are being faced and, in
addition to all of that,

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:53.460
there's this overlay of almost paranoia

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:54.940
about rankings of law school,

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:58.640
about making sure we can sort
of elbow our way to the top,

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.650
with all of those issues
that are being faced,

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:03.751
and included in that the decline
of law school applications,

00:51:03.751 --> 00:51:08.390
diversity and affirmative
action can often be

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:09.890
left by the side of the road

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:13.480
and that it can become,
as with law firm hiring,

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.550
an expendable objective and goal.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:18.130
Now, I don't think that that's warranted,

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:20.420
but I think that we need
to redouble our efforts

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.020
to make sure that we are not

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.270
cutting off our nose to spite our face.

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:27.090
- I have one question I want to ask you

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:30.110
about being president of the Association.

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:35.110
What sort of things did
you learn in that position

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.590
as you looked at other law schools,

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:40.350
that hadn't come to your attention

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:44.090
in being the leader of
Northwestern's law school?

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:46.220
- You know, it's a wonderful question.

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.437
Although there were days when I wondered,

00:51:48.437 --> 00:51:51.830
"Now, why exactly did I
undertake this particular hobby,

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:52.920
as it were?"

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:54.530
More are the days I really felt like

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.460
I learned an enormous amount

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.010
and hopefully contributed a bit.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.220
One of the things I learned is just

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:03.206
the enormous diversity of missions

00:52:03.206 --> 00:52:06.900
of so many of our American
law schools and of strategies.

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.260
I had a sense of what was going on

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:10.170
in a number of law schools

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:11.590
or thought I knew a great amount.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:13.040
I had been at a number of law schools.

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.210
I had led two.

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:16.360
But it was really only when I was visiting

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.630
with so many law schools
and working with the faculty

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:21.300
and the deans and undertaking
this leadership role

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:24.649
that I really had a sense
of the challenges faced by

00:52:24.649 --> 00:52:27.960
the wide range and scope of
public and private law schools.

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.330
Some that are freestanding.

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:31.821
Many that are in states that face

00:52:31.821 --> 00:52:33.740
enormous economic challenges.

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.910
Much worse than places like

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.770
California and Illinois and Texas.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.112
So, it gave me a sense of appreciation

00:52:39.112 --> 00:52:43.530
for how schools were facing
these particular challenges.

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:47.430
It also gave me a sense of the diversity

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.510
of faculties of these
particular institutions

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:51.710
of which we were a part.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:54.470
So, I had spent quite a lot
of time learning a lot more

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.250
about the changing role of

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:59.333
what I'll say the legal
professoriate is like.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.850
- So I guess my final question is

00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:09.370
will the image of the
lawyer remain the same,

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.220
the positive image?

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.530
There's also a negative image,

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:14.663
but let's talk about the positive image.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:19.520
In an address, I guess,
to a graduating class,

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.900
you summed up nicely.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:25.500
You said that is the ideal of the lawyer.

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:30.480
You said and where there
are small issues at stake...

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.441
That is, you're talking about

00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:34.127
the mission of the lawyer.

00:53:34.127 --> 00:53:38.460
And you said "Where there
are small issues at stake,

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.370
wrongdoing in government,

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:43.760
suffering of individuals
who require justice,

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.070
problem solving in the
corporate boardroom,

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:50.010
new exciting startup
businesses to be formed,

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:53.410
liberties to be protected,
and rights to be enforced,

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.270
we find that lawyers are there

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:59.120
and they are at the ready
to deploy their skills,

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.040
to render their advice,
to analyze and advocate,

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.120
to be the engineers of justice,

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:07.120
the protectors of the rule of law."

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.080
Will that...

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.964
It's a nice statement of the ideal.

00:54:09.964 --> 00:54:10.797
- A little long.

00:54:10.797 --> 00:54:11.630
I wish I had actually

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:13.610
broken into maybe three sentences.

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:14.820
- Maybe I didn't read it well,

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:19.767
but, the point is, do you
think that view of the law

00:54:19.767 --> 00:54:21.910
and the lawyer will endure?

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:23.210
- I'm cautiously optimistic.

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:24.300
Here's what I would say about that.

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.750
Certainly, in the
context of those remarks,

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:29.853
I was speaking to a graduating
class of law students.

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:34.690
All of whom I want them to feel that

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:36.690
they're entering into a
great and noble profession

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.670
and not have a sense to
come back to something that

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:41.670
you asked about at the beginning
that law is just a default.

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:43.370
That it's not only an important career,

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:44.490
but a noble career.

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:49.490
Having said that, my answer
to whether or not that is

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.036
still a worthwhile
description or depiction

00:54:52.036 --> 00:54:55.070
of the role of the lawyer is contingent.

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:58.370
That is I believe it ought to be the case

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:00.440
and I'm cautiously optimistic that it

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.040
will be the case on the
following condition.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.030
Is that, as we adapt...

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:07.910
We, in legal education
and in the profession,

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.980
adapt to the changes that we're facing.

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:13.600
Complacency is no longer justified.

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:17.090
The ordinary business model
of law schools and law firms

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:18.620
are no longer justified.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:22.765
Our ability to remain
in our rightful place,

00:55:22.765 --> 00:55:25.433
by which I don't mean our god-given place,

00:55:25.433 --> 00:55:27.710
I mean our rightful place as the guarantor

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:29.160
of individual liberty,

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.890
as the protector of the wise
constraints that make men free

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:37.682
and all of that will very much
be dependent on our ability

00:55:37.682 --> 00:55:40.690
to navigate some real challenges,

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:42.650
to work with other professions,

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:43.920
and to provide the kinds of

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.630
skills and training and education that

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:49.360
will enable young lawyers, in particular,

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.860
to be able to adapt to this
tsunami of changes that

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:58.330
are facing not only the legal
profession, but the economy.

00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:01.490
And, if we can do that, I'm quite bullish,

00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:04.766
as the saying goes, on the
ability of legal education

00:56:04.766 --> 00:56:07.780
to continue to work for another 100 years

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.680
as it has for the past 100 years

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:14.680
as, really, an ennobling
educational endeavor for folks

00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:18.370
in this new world.

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:20.130
- Well, on that positive note,

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.356
Dean Rodriguez, I want
to thank you very much

00:56:22.356 --> 00:56:25.350
for taking the time to be on our program.

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:26.183
- My pleasure.

00:56:26.183 --> 00:56:27.928
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:56:27.928 --> 00:56:30.732
for this Conversation with History.

00:56:30.732 --> 00:56:33.149
