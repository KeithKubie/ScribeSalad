SHYAMAL MEHTA: TechJini is
a multinational company.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.020
And the reason
TechJini exists is

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.650
to enable businesses to
leverage emerging technologies

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.922
to solve their problems.

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.380
AMIT RANA: The most
important thing

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.110
is to keep on learning
new technology, you know?

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.200
Be ready for what is
going to come next.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.060
So we heard about Google
Developers Agency program

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.714
from Android
company [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:29.380
We were pretty excited
to be part of it,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.500
because it opens a channel to
directly interact with Google

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.450
engineers.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.390
We have been developing for
Android since 2008, when

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.515
the first version came out.

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:40.431
We were sure that they'd
have a lot of input--

00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:41.300
we can give it back.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.883
And there were a lot
of learning which

00:00:42.883 --> 00:00:44.380
we can take from the program.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.801
So give it no second thought.

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.800
SHYAMAL MEHTA: There was
certain criteria for us

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.760
to fulfill to become a certified
Google Developers Agency.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.520
Luckily, we were able to fulfill
those because of our work

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.760
and because of our
association with Google

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.370
for almost a year before
the certification actually

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.666
happened.

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.290
DIVYARANI S: I was
looking at TechJini,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.230
and I used to rely on
my junior developers.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.330
I took [? a ?] [? maternity ?]
[? leave, ?] and my company

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.420
joined the Google
Developers Agency program.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.490
After a year when I
came back, everything

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.430
was different in a great way.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.950
I took my junior
developers' help

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.640
to train me on
those technologies.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.310
YOGESHWAR RAO:
Pepperfry.com is India's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.260
leading financial retailer.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.100
When we first started
working with them,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.320
they had a huge web presence.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.872
But they did not have
any mobile presence.

00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:34.830
SPEAKER 1: The challenge
with the Pepperfry app

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.310
was that it's a very
visually heavy application.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.560
So we worked hand-in-hand
with the Google team

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.020
to ensure that we give
a great user experience,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.029
whether they are on a fast
4G network or a 2G network.

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:49.320
YOGESHWAR RAO: Even after
following the best practices,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.840
we would hit a
performance roadblock.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.920
On those instances, we reached
out to the agency program,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.200
making sure that we are
rendering the images

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.470
in the highest quality possible
without affecting the user's

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.740
ability to infinitely scroll
through a lot of images.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.460
There were suggestions around
the data binding feature,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.230
along with libraries
such as glide.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.740
Overall when we made the switch
from Eclipse and [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.470
to Android Studio, coupled
with all these inputs

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.330
from the agency
program, I think it

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.425
helped us achieve really
fast development life cycles.

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:24.810
SHYAMAL MEHTA: The Google
Developers Agency program

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.690
has been beneficial to
us in multiple ways.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.760
And I think its been
a great association

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.690
to be able to qualify for
the certification criteria.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.580
AMIT RANA: It validates all
the good work we are doing.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.270
And it helps us make sure
we are always on the edge.
