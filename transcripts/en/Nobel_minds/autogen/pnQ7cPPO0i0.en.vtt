original thing and when a good science
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.780
original thing and when a good science
team is working it's kind of like a good

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
team is working it's kind of like a good
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.549

going on and right now that my lab has
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.630
going on and right now that my lab has
been so well tuned it feels like a
