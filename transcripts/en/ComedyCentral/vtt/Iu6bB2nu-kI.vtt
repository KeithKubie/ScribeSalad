00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.468
And now the man of the hour.

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:06.039
Justin Bieber,
you dainty wigger, you.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.640
Justin Bieber.
They say that you roast

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:10.143
the ones you love, but I don't
like you at all, man.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:15.148
I'm just here 'cause this is
a real good opportunity for me.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.817
Justin, oh, you gotta
give it up for Justin.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.523
He started from the bottom,
and he's still a bottom.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:27.326
I don't like your music, man.
I'm not a big fan of it.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.529
I listened to some of it.
I'm not a fan.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:32.098
I don't like your music.

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.167
I think it's bad.
I think it's bad, man.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.370
I don't like it.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:38.771
I hate your music, man.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:42.876
I hate your music more than
Bill Cosby hates my comedy.
