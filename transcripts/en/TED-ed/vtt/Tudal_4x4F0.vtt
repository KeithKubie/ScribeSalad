00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:14.455
Deep underground lies stores of once
inaccessible natural gas.

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:17.605
This gas was likely formed 
over millions of years

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:22.966
as layers of decaying organisms
were exposed to intense heat and pressure

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.645
under the Earth's crust.

00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:28.355
There's a technology called
hydraulic fracturing,

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:29.764
or fracking,

00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:32.467
that can extract this natural gas,

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:36.398
potentially powering us
for decades to come.

00:00:36.398 --> 00:00:38.148
So how does fracking work,

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:42.288
and why it is a source 
of such heated controversy?

00:00:42.288 --> 00:00:45.557
A fracking site can be anywhere
with natural gas,

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:46.837
from a remote desert

00:00:46.837 --> 00:00:50.236
to several hundred feet
from your backyard.

00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:54.548
It starts out with a long vertical hole
known as a wellbore

00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:57.927
drilled down through layers of sediment.

00:00:57.927 --> 00:01:03.428
When the well reaches 2500 - 3000 meters,
it's at its kickoff point

00:01:03.428 --> 00:01:07.430
where it can begin the process
of horizontal drilling.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.523
It turns 90 degrees and extends
horizontally for about 1.5 kilometers

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:18.969
through a compressed black layer
called the shale rock formation.

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.159
A specialized perforating gun
is then lowered and fired,

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.990
creating a series of small, 
inch-long holes

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.720
that burst through the well's casing
into the rock layer.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.668
About three to four months
after the initial drilling,

00:01:33.668 --> 00:01:37.112
the well is ready for fracking to begin.

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:41.128
Fracking fluid is pumped down
into the well at a pressure so high,

00:01:41.128 --> 00:01:43.390
it cracks the shale rock,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.526
creating fractures through which
the trapped gas and oil can escape.

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:52.052
The fluid itself is more than 90% water.

00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:55.680
The rest is made up of concentrated
chemical additives.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.000
These vary depending on the specific
characteristics of the fracking site,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.902
but usually fall into three categories:

00:02:02.902 --> 00:02:06.432
acids for clearing debris
and dissolving minerals,

00:02:06.432 --> 00:02:08.561
friction-reducing compounds to create

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:12.462
a slippery form of water 
known as slickwater,

00:02:12.462 --> 00:02:15.813
and disinfectant to prevent
bacteria growth.

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:20.694
Sand or clay is also mixed into
the water to prop open the fissures

00:02:20.694 --> 00:02:26.918
so the gas and oil can keep leaking out,
even after the pressure is released.

00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:30.444
It's estimated that all of fracking's
intense pumping and flushing

00:02:30.444 --> 00:02:35.993
uses an average of 3-6 million gallons
of water per well.

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:38.953
That's actually not a lot compared
to agriculture,

00:02:38.953 --> 00:02:40.073
power plants,

00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:42.673
or even golf course maintenance,

00:02:42.673 --> 00:02:47.092
but it can have a notable impact
on local water supply.

00:02:47.092 --> 00:02:50.805
And disposing of used fracking water
is also an issue.

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:53.574
Along with the trapped gas
that's pumped up to the surface,

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:58.934
millions of gallons of flow-back liquid
come gushing up.

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:02.264
This liquid containing contaminants
like radioactive material,

00:03:02.264 --> 00:03:03.235
salts,

00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:04.134
heavy metals,

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:05.604
and hydrocarbons,

00:03:05.604 --> 00:03:08.335
needs to be stored and disposed of.

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:11.974
That's usually done in pits on-site
in deep wells

00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:15.765
or off-site at water treatment facilities.

00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:19.045
Another option is to recycle
the flow-back liquid,

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:23.456
but the recycling process can actually
increase levels of contamination

00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:27.135
since the water is more toxic
with each use.

00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:30.273
Wells are typically encased 
in steel and cement

00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:33.366
to prevent contaminants from leaking
into groundwater.

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:36.507
But any negligence 
or fracking-related accidents

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:38.925
can have devastating effects.

00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:41.377
Fracturing directly 
into underground water

00:03:41.377 --> 00:03:43.996
hazardous underground 
seepage and leakage,

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:48.307
and inadequate treatment and disposal
of highly-toxic waste water

00:03:48.307 --> 00:03:52.517
can potentially contaminate
drinking water around a fracking site.

00:03:52.517 --> 00:03:55.520
There's also concern about
the threat of earthquakes

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.169
and damaged infrastructure

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.287
from pressure 
and waste water injection.

00:04:00.287 --> 00:04:03.628
Links between fracking
and increased seismic activity

00:04:03.628 --> 00:04:08.017
leave unresolved questions
about long-term pressure imbalances

00:04:08.017 --> 00:04:11.438
that might be happening
deep beneath our feet.

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:15.128
Fracking's biggest controversy, though,
is happening above the ground.

00:04:15.128 --> 00:04:19.908
The general consensus is that burning
natural gas is better for the environment

00:04:19.908 --> 00:04:21.639
than burning coal

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.411
since the gas collected from fracking

00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.670
emits only half 
the carbon dioxide as coal

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.960
per unit of energy.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.449
The pollution caused 
by the fracking itself, though,

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.079
isn't negligible.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:36.010
Methane that leaks out during the drilling
and pumping process

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.159
is many times more potent
than carbon dioxide

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.459
as a greenhouse gas.

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:44.781
Some scientists argue that methane
eventually dissipates,

00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:48.681
so has a relatively low long-term impact.

00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:51.280
But a greater question hangs in the air.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.989
Does fracking take time,
money, and research

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:58.960
away from the development
of cleaner renewable energy sources?

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.771
Natural gas is non-renewable,

00:05:00.771 --> 00:05:04.170
and the short-run economic interests
supporting fracking

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.879
may fall short in the face
of global climate change.

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.802
Experts are still examining
fracking's overarching effects.

00:05:11.802 --> 00:05:15.281
Although modern fracking has been
around since the 1940s,

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:17.722
it's boomed in the last few decades.

00:05:17.722 --> 00:05:22.690
As other sources of natural gas decrease,
the costs of non-renewable energies rise,

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.653
and cutting-edge technologies
make it so accessible.

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:29.723
But many countries and regions
have already banned fracking

00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:32.573
in response to environmental concerns.

00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:37.183
It's undeniable that fracking has reshaped
the energy landscape around the world,

00:05:37.183 --> 00:05:41.122
but for what long-term benefit
and at what cost?
