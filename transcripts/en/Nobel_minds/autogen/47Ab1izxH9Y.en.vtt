I'm going to make an analogy for this

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.110
I'm going to make an analogy for this
 

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.110
I'm going to make an analogy for this
because this is actually what's going to

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120
because this is actually what's going to
 

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.060
because this is actually what's going to
happen in the quantum Hall effect and

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:00.070

surface on which electrons can move with

00:12:08.699 --> 00:12:08.709
surface on which electrons can move with
 

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:11.519

a large magnetic field going normal to
 

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:16.320
a large magnetic field going normal to
the surface and in a magnetic field

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.330

electrons go around the little circles
 

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.970
electrons go around the little circles
just like in the atom but now it's the

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:20.980
just like in the atom but now it's the
 

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.130
just like in the atom but now it's the
magnetic force that drives you in a

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:23.140

circle the force at right angles to the
 

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.410
circle the force at right angles to the
motion of the electron and in this case

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:28.420
motion of the electron and in this case
 

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.350
motion of the electron and in this case
it's as the radius of the orbit gets

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360
it's as the radius of the orbit gets
 

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.750
it's as the radius of the orbit gets
bigger that corresponds to larger

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760
bigger that corresponds to larger
 

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.199
bigger that corresponds to larger
kinetic energy of the electrons so in

00:12:37.199 --> 00:12:37.209
kinetic energy of the electrons so in
 

00:12:37.209 --> 00:12:39.210
kinetic energy of the electrons so in
that case we have

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:39.220
that case we have
 

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.250
that case we have

we can completely fill up the lowest set

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720
we can completely fill up the lowest set
 

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.570
we can completely fill up the lowest set
of orbitals here the lowest Lander level

right so there's exactly the right

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:00.730
right so there's exactly the right
 

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.220
right so there's exactly the right

implications it led to his Nobel Prize
 

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:36.660
implications it led to his Nobel Prize
in 85 so so when you have this situation

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:36.670
in 85 so so when you have this situation
 

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.850
in 85 so so when you have this situation
you you've got an energy gap if you're a

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:38.860
you you've got an energy gap if you're a
 

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.340
you you've got an energy gap if you're a
chemist you call it the homo-lumo gap or

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:41.350
chemist you call it the homo-lumo gap or
 

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.360
chemist you call it the homo-lumo gap or
something and and so this is a kind of

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:45.370
something and and so this is a kind of
 

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:50.280
something and and so this is a kind of
rigid system that the that that you

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:50.290
rigid system that the that that you
 

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.810
rigid system that the that that you
filled it just up to this level it's

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:51.820
filled it just up to this level it's
 

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.740
filled it just up to this level it's
going to cost you energy

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:52.750
going to cost you energy
 

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.720
going to cost you energy
to put any electrons and he in a higher

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:54.730
to put any electrons and he in a higher
 

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.480
to put any electrons and he in a higher
level and so if I try to squeeze the

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:57.490
level and so if I try to squeeze the
 

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.270

system where I'm actually changing the

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:00.280

system where I'm actually changing the
number area in which the electron is

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:03.700
number area in which the electron is
 

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.030
number area in which the electron is
allowed to move and therefore changing

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040
allowed to move and therefore changing
 

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.100
allowed to move and therefore changing
them of orbitals if I compress this

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:08.110

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.320
them of orbitals if I compress this
thing down I will I will not be able to

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.160

compress it any further than having fill

they have strange States at the edge of
 

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.690
they have strange States at the edge of

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:45.610
the surface area of a sphere is 4 PI R
 

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.270
the surface area of a sphere is 4 PI R
squared whereas her radius and the

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:48.280
squared whereas her radius and the
 

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.790
squared whereas her radius and the
Gaussian curvature that Gauss introduced

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:50.800
Gaussian curvature that Gauss introduced
 

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.160
Gaussian curvature that Gauss introduced
of course for the sphere is is uniform

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:53.170
of course for the sphere is is uniform
 

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.500
of course for the sphere is is uniform
and it's 1 over R squared so if I

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:55.510
and it's 1 over R squared so if I
 

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.480
and it's 1 over R squared so if I
integrate the gaussian curvature over

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:57.490

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.300
integrate the gaussian curvature over
the surface area of the sphere i get 4

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:00.310
the surface area of the sphere i get 4
 

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.930
the surface area of the sphere i get 4

but what gauss discovered as this

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:03.490
but what gauss discovered as this
 

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.940
but what gauss discovered as this
amazing theorem was that i can change

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:05.950
amazing theorem was that i can change
 

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.770
amazing theorem was that i can change
the shape of the sphere to anything else

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:07.780
the shape of the sphere to anything else
 

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.710

and they still got 4 pi and this is

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:13.780
and they still got 4 pi and this is
 

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.290

and the other one it rotated 180 degrees
 

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.020
and the other one it rotated 180 degrees
anti-clockwise wishes so the difference

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:00.030
anti-clockwise wishes so the difference
 

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.359

spin you get a minus one factor so the

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900
spin you get a minus one factor so the
 

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.319
spin you get a minus one factor so the
quantum mechanics told you something so

00:47:09.319 --> 00:47:09.329
quantum mechanics told you something so
 

00:47:09.329 --> 00:47:10.400
quantum mechanics told you something so
I'm looking at this way gave you a

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:10.410
I'm looking at this way gave you a
 

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:12.230
I'm looking at this way gave you a
completely new way to look at things and

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240
completely new way to look at things and
 

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.000
completely new way to look at things and
it turned out that the conventional

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.010
it turned out that the conventional
 

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.010
it turned out that the conventional
wisdom was completely wrong and and

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.020
wisdom was completely wrong and and
 

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.800
wisdom was completely wrong and and
finally so we came up with this new

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:18.810
finally so we came up with this new
 

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:20.569
finally so we came up with this new
story which shocked people at the time

00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579
story which shocked people at the time
 

00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:22.300
story which shocked people at the time
because it it conflicted with

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:22.310
because it it conflicted with
 

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:25.640
because it it conflicted with
preconceived notions based on on the

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:25.650

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:28.130
preconceived notions based on on the
beta answers equation seem to seem to

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140
beta answers equation seem to seem to
 

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.880
beta answers equation seem to seem to
confirm incorrect ideas about spin ways

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:31.890
confirm incorrect ideas about spin ways
 

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:35.599
confirm incorrect ideas about spin ways
and finally it's not go through this too

00:47:35.599 --> 00:47:35.609
and finally it's not go through this too
 

00:47:35.609 --> 00:47:39.230
and finally it's not go through this too
much but at the end of the day this

with one arm up stretched out here and
the other arm up stretched out here so

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740
the other arm up stretched out here so
 

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.890
the other arm up stretched out here so
they're like two half spins at the end

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900
they're like two half spins at the end
 

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.680

all kinds of well I consider neat stuff
about quantum mechanics that we didn't

00:51:00.019 --> 00:51:00.029
about quantum mechanics that we didn't
 

00:51:00.029 --> 00:51:02.930
about quantum mechanics that we didn't
know before and there seems to be plenty

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940
know before and there seems to be plenty
 

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:07.009
know before and there seems to be plenty
of new insights to gain so so that when

00:51:07.009 --> 00:51:07.019
of new insights to gain so so that when
 

00:51:07.019 --> 00:51:08.539
of new insights to gain so so that when
you can find something very simple and

00:51:08.539 --> 00:51:08.549
you can find something very simple and
 

00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:10.969
you can find something very simple and
beautiful we all think that's the way

00:51:10.969 --> 00:51:10.979
beautiful we all think that's the way
 

00:51:10.979 --> 00:51:13.489
beautiful we all think that's the way
that's the truth and maybe we're going

00:51:13.489 --> 00:51:13.499
that's the truth and maybe we're going
 

00:51:13.499 --> 00:51:16.279
that's the truth and maybe we're going
to learn a lot about matter and learn a

00:51:16.279 --> 00:51:16.289
to learn a lot about matter and learn a
 

00:51:16.289 --> 00:51:18.499
to learn a lot about matter and learn a
lot about possibly applications of it

00:51:18.499 --> 00:51:18.509
lot about possibly applications of it
 

00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:19.840
lot about possibly applications of it
thank you

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:19.850
thank you
 

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:31.940
thank you
