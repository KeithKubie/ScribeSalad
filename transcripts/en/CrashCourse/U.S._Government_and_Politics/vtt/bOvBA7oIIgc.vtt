Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course
Government and Politics and today we're going

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.500
to talk about something almost every American
has an opinion on: interest groups. Now if

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.040
you've been watching these episodes and reading
the comments you might be thinking that we've

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.430
been trying to avoid the issue of money in
politics and the role of special interests

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.240
in the U.S. political system. We have. If
you are one those people that wants to talk

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.339
about money in politics, this episode will
not disappoint you. I'm kidding, I know that

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.139
some of you will still be disappointed. But
mainly because I'm still not John Green.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:36.100
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.360
So before we get into how interests groups
influence American politics, let's define

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.720
what we mean by interest groups. Groups of
people who put money in banks and gain interest.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.540
That's not what we mean. An interest group
is an organized group of individuals that

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.020
make policy-related appeals to government.
Now, interest groups don't actually have to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.190
meet in person, in fact in the case of very
large interest groups it would be almost impossible

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.580
to get them together in a room. But most interest
groups have a membership and often it's the

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.950
size of the membership that gives the group's
political clout.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.170
Political scientists tell us that there are
2 main things that interest groups do when

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.460
they interact with the government. First,
they try to shape policies, which they can

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.260
do by mobilizing voters or by putting direct
pressure on elected officials. The second

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.810
and probably more important thing that interest
groups do is gather information they can provide

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.780
for elected officials. Some would characterize
this gathering of information as interest

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.880
groups writing bills for elected officials
to pass into laws. So interest groups are

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.560
most likely to focus on a particular branch of
government and I'll give you 3 guesses which one.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.200
No not the supreme court even though with
only 9 members it would be the most efficient

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.520
way for an interest group to exert pressure.
Punching is most efficient way for me to exert

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.229
pressure onto an eagle. And not the executive
branch because if you remember, the president

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.920
has lots of professional people to advise
him and since he can only serve two terms,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.780
he's less susceptible to pressure that way.
That leaves congress, which is the answer!

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.200
That's where the interest groups exert their
pressure. But wait, what about the bureaucracy?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.130
Can't bureaucrats also be the target of interest
group pressure? Yes, in fact they can mainly

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.479
because interest groups, especially if they're
well funded, can supply information that is

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.170
either too costly or too difficult for congressmen
or bureaucratic agencies to get. But adding

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.510
the fourth group messes up the whole three
guesses three branches bit I was trying to do.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.580
And guesses are fun.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.869
The combination of interest groups, congress,
and the bureaucracy are sometimes called an

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.870
"iron triangle" which sounds a lot cooler
than it is. Actually it's pretty cool, unless

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.849
you're talking about the neighborhood in Queens
near where the Mets play in which case my

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.849
previous statement still stands. Anyway, in
a political iron triangle, not only do interest

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.620
groups help out congress through contributions
and support, they also provide congressmen

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.230
with information. Some might say that interest
groups don't just provide information, they

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.390
actually write the bills that become laws.
And it is true that interest groups often

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.910
have lawyers who propose language that can
make it into bills and laws. But this is much

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.459
more likely to happen on the state and local
level where legislators don't have the staff

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.090
resources to do the research behind bills.
In fact, the practice of interest groups writing

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.610
bills for state legislature is depressingly
common. Given that congressmen are pretty

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.220
busy trying to get re-elected, it's not surprising that they
will be grateful for information from interest groups.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.260
But what about bureaucracies? They're supposed
to be made up of experts and they don't have

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.709
to run for re-election, right? Well they are,
and they don't, but information is really

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.810
really costly, and often bureaucratic agencies
are just not as well-funded as an interest

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.580
group. The oil industry is represented by
the American Petroleum Institute as well as

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.379
individual oil and gas companies. Because
it's highly regulated, the oil industry has

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.520
a big interest in seeing legislation and regulations
they like passed. But more important here

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.819
is the fact that the oil and gas industry
has a lot of money money money money - way

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.910
more money than any particular federal agency,
so it can spend money on research and provide

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.750
information that the agencies often can't.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.120
One more thing about interest groups and
bureaucracies: There's a big temptation to think

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.940
that wealthy interests spend their money providing
campaign contributions and information to

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.660
Congressmen, and this does happen. But they can often
be more effective providing information to agencies

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.300
and writing regulations rather than the laws.
As we've mentioned before, regulations are

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.220
just as important as laws and for many industries,
even more so. That's why you'll see a lot

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.020
of interest group efforts spent lobbying bureaucratic
agencies as well as Congress.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.760
Before we get into the question of whether
or not interest groups are destroying American

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.080
democracy, I want to clarify two things that
interest groups are not: First off, an interest

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.819
group is not a political party. As you remember,
political parties exist to get candidates

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.319
elected. Interest groups exist to influence
the policies that those elected officials

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.550
make. Interest groups are also not the same
as political action committees or PACs. A

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.170
PAC is an organization that collects and distributes
campaign funds and information, and therefore

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.830
is concerned with elections. Interest groups
can give money to PACs and they can even form

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.830
their own PACs, but they aren't exactly the
same thing.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.180
Okay, so now the controversial issue with
interest groups. Do they have too much influence?

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.870
To sort this out, I'm going to need some help
from some friends, and by friends I mean clones,

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.400
which aren't my friends. Let's head to the
Clone Zone! Hey, here we are! Clone Zone!

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.470
It's just like the regular zone except that
thing's gone and there's a graphic. So today,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.590
clone with the tie is going to argue that
interest groups are good for American democracy

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.920
and clone without the tie is going to argue that
they're bad. He also has bad fashion sense. Okay, go.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.200
Clone with a tie: The main argument in favor
of interest groups has to do with pluralism.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.660
If all interest groups are free to compete
to influence officials, then they'll balance

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.590
each other out. It'll be cool. The idea of
incorporating lots of groups goes back at

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.220
least as far as James Madison. In the Federalist
Papers, Madison argued for extending the sphere

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.650
in American politics and encouraging more
and more factions. The theory was that the

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.460
more groups there were, the less likely that
any one group could gain a corrupting influence

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.440
over the government. Sort of like the idea
of the wisdom of crowds or Condorcet's jury

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.960
theorem. With more interest groups providing
more information, we will get policies that

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.090
are the result of thoughtful compromise.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.830
Another argument for interest groups is that
they offer more opportunity for participation

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.930
in politics. Elections only happen every two
years, on the federal level at least, but

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.150
policy gets made all the time, or at least,
it's supposed to. By joining an interest group,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.530
an individual can push for a policy that care
about all the time, not just at election time.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.740
And isn't participation the essence of democracy?
I think yes.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.440
Clone without a tie: Sure, it's great to have
more voices involved in policy making as long

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.680
as each voice is powerful enough to be heard.
In the current system, that is just not the case.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.100
Interest group politics diminishes American
democracy because some interest groups are

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.960
so powerful that their voices are able to
crowd out all the others. And in America today,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.040
the people with the loudest voices are the
wealthy! (loudly) And me right now!

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.120
And it's not only because the wealthy have
more money to give to politicians; although

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.250
that does help. Obviously, people who are
really poor can't offer campaign contributions,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.000
but there are plenty of advocates for them.
But in America, the wealthy have other resources

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.550
that the poor just can't bring to bear. Like
money! Lotsa, lotsa, money! They tend to be

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.430
better educated, so they have access to more
information, and the ability to disseminate

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.419
their views more (stumbling over the word)
articulately. And just as important, wealthy

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.169
people have more time to devote to political
participation than the poor.

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.509
Clone with a tie: Sure, what you're saying
makes sense, but do you have any proof? I

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:23.520
mean, there are plenty of laws protecting poor
people. What about the earned income tax credit?

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.340
Clone without a tie: Well, I have a chart.
Clone with a tie: Oh.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.110
Clone without a tie: You can see that the
number of PACs, while not exactly the same

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.419
thing as interest groups, has grown an awful
lot since the mid-1970s. Corporate interests,

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.239
which by and large represent wealthy people,
vastly outnumber the groups representing working

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.820
people, like labor and cooperative groups.
By numbers alone, wealthy interest groups

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.830
would seem to have more power than other groups.
But that's not all. A series of studies that

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.039
culminated in the book Affluence &amp; Influence
by Martin Gilens shows pretty definitively

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:51.419
that Congress is much more likely to enact
laws that respond to the interests of the

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.919
wealthy, than the poor. It's not that they
never took poor people's interests into account,

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:58.610
it's just that they are much, much more likely
to make policies that favor the rich. Is that

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.160
the essence of democracy? I think no.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.039
Wheezy: Thanks you beautiful clones. So there
you have the basics of interest groups in

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:08.569
America and why they are so controversial.
I hope that you now have a better of what

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:12.380
interest groups are and what they are not
and how they work to influence policy in government,

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.169
which is their main function in the American
political system. You should also know what

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:19.410
the Iron Triangle is and why people complain
so much about interest groups in America today,

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.280
other than they haven't had their coffee yet.
Where's my coffee?!?

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.640
Thank you. But I also hope that you understand
the idea of pluralism, it's powerful idea

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.419
and one that if taken seriously, shows the
importance of participation in politics.

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.430
This is empty. And that's ultimately what
interest groups do for us. They give us another

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.590
avenue to have our voices heard and contribute
to the policies that shape our lives. Thanks
