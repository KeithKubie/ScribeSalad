Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: Good afternoon,
my name is Jason Steinhauer,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.130
I'm a program specialist
at the John W. Kluge Center

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.340
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.120
Today's lecture is presented
by the John W. Kluge Center

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.600
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.970
The Kluge Center is a vibrant
scholar center on Capitol Hill

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.530
that brings together scholars and
researchers from around the world

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.400
to stimulate and energize one
another, to distill wisdom

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.060
from the library's rich
resources, and to interact

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.260
with policymakers and the public.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.890
The center offers opportunities
for senior scholars,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.770
postdoctoral fellows, and PhD
candidates to conduct research

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.030
in the Library of Congress
collections.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.830
We also offer free public
lectures, conferences, symposia

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.460
and other programs and we
administer the Kluge prize

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.490 position:56%
which recognizes lifetime
achievement in the study of humanity

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.550
and which we will award
later this month.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.480
For more information about
these and other events,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.610
as well as opportunities to
conduct your own research here

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.370
at the Library of Congress, please
visit our website LOC.gov/Kluge

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.950
or sign up for our RSS list
on the table on your way out.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.280
Today's lecture is
titled Images of the Earth

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.090
in American Children's Books.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.490
Our speaker is German
fellow, Sibylle Machat.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.160
Machat's research focuses
on depiction of earth

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.150
in children's books from
1843 to the present.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.220
Her research draws on several
collections held by the Library

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.580
of Congress, including those of
the Children's Literature Center,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.950
the Rare Book Collections
and the Greshnikov Collection

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.590
of Soviet Era children's
books in the Business

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.670
and Science Reading Room.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.250
Her study considers the collective
imagination of space prior

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.080
to photographic evidence
and through the imagery

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.260
in children's books clarifies the
relationship of modern humanity

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.480
to its planetary environment.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.180
More about Sibylle's work
is currently on our blog,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.100
it's right up there and she'll be
telling you more about her research

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.040
at the library during her talk.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.370
Sibylle Machat is an associate
professor at the Europa University

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.520
of Flensburg and is
currently a German fellow

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.320
at the John W. Kluge Center
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.990
Her first book was titled In
the Ruins of Civilizations,

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.730 position:56%
Narrative Structures, World
Constructions and Physical Realities

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.370
in the post-apocalyptic novel.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.340
At the Kluge Center she is working
on her second book on the depiction

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.240
of planet earth in American
children's and young adult fiction.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.510
So please join me in
welcoming Sibylle Machat.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.200
[ Applause ]

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.500
&gt;&gt; Sibylle Machat: All right,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.210
let's see can you all
hear me okay like this?

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.310
All right, so we're going to
be looking at a lot of images

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.870
in this presentation
in the next 45 minutes.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.790
So if you cannot see one

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.350
of the screens really well
now is your chance to move

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.800
to a place where you can see it.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.880
It's more important to see the
screens than to see me even though

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.750
of course, it's nice
that you're all looking

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.110
at me and a little scary too.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.410
To be honest.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.650
So first of all, maybe
you've noticed these flyers

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.720
that have been lying around and
if you haven't seen one already,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.790
please spend like 20
seconds thinking

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.240
about how you would describe
the planet earth to a child.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.120
And just keep a couple of words in
the back of your brain and later

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.600
on I'm going to ask you to compare
whether or not any of these came

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.520
up during my talk like whether or
not you've maybe been influenced,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.560
heard some of this before or
you came up with all new ideas.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.310
Okay, so before we start and I
have a little Oscar speech to give.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.540
That's sort of what we jokingly
call saying thank you to everyone

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.180
that you need to thank
up in the Kluge Center.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.360
A couple of people said oh I
need to write my Oscar speech,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.060
so I thought I would
put the Oscar in there.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.980
So before we start I want to
thank the John W. Kluge Center

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.770
and Mary Lou Travis, Joann,
Lauren, Nancy, Jason and Dan,

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.740
and everyone else there who's
been so great and supportive

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.120
for what I've been doing here.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.200
I also want to thank
my interns, Kira,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.930
who's already in Japan doing
work there and Katie who's

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.330
in the audience and who has been
helping me with some scanning

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.900
and other slightly
boring things, thank you.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.460
The Children's Literature Reading
Room and Sabella [assumed spelling]

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.240
who is also in the audience
has been very helpful.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.590
The people in the Main Reading Room

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.090 position:56%
who have been letting me use their
big scanner they all know me by name

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.050
by now and so do the
security guards.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.990
I always go there with
my books and say hey,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.820
I'm in the Kluge Center I want to
take these in and scan something

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.200
and take them out and by now
they just see me and they wave.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.130
The Business and Science
Reading Room, which is the place

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.690
where you read the Russian
Children's Book Collection,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.990
so I've been there.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.500 position:56%
The NASA HQ archives Liz, Colin and
Jane I spent two weeks there working

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.260
with their material, looking
for images of the earth,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.630
early photographs to compare
them to the children's books.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.230
And the Smithsonian and Space
Museum archives and Elizabeth there

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.790
where I also went looking
for early photographs.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.500
And last but not least my home
university, the Europa University

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.660
of Flensburg who told me yes of
course, you can go for seven months

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.140
and not teach in the
summer term and do this.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.890
Without them saying that
I would not be here.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.350
Okay, so this is what
we're going to be doing.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.950
The Earth in American
Children's Books.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.920
We're going to start with a
very vague picture of the earth,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.040
which you can see there on
the left next to the title

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.120
and the little astronaut and
the spaceship that's taking off.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.010 position:56%
And then we're going to follow the
path the spaceship is taking all the

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.910
way until we get to the blue
marble, so the first photograph

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.650
of the whole illuminated
globe of the earth --

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.080
well the half that you can see

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.470
if you're taking a
photograph taken by Apollo 17.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.680
Okay, so this talk takes
place at a point in my project

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.770
where I have spent a long time with
primary resources, finding them,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.150
building a timeline and a
database out of what I'm finding.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.380
But I haven't yet done very
much work with secondary sources

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.200
or critical thinking really.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.060
I did that when I first got
here I thought yeah okay,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.670
I'm going to analyze all
these books in depth and look

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.130
at what I'm finding and
then really write it down.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.280
So I did that for a month and then
I looked at all the things I wanted

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.630
to do and how fast
my time was going.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.310
And then I changed my work
process a little and focused more

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.900
on the primary material itself.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.310
So this is in the way.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.870
So what I'm going to show you

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.810
in the next 40 minutes
is still very much a work

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.340
in process and all that it is.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.020
I'm showing you what I found I'm
letting you look into my archives,

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.910
but I'm not claiming that my
thoughts have been finished.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.290 position:56%
If they ever can be finished at all.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:07.350
So our journey is going to take us
through what triggered my project

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.220
in the first place, one of the
triggers and which I don't want

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.870
to tell you too much about
yet because it's going

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.700
to spoil the moment and then we're
going to spend five short minutes

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.470
on the theory behind
analyzing children's books

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.010
so you have a little context

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.320
for that before we're delving
right into the thick of it.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.620
I'm going to be using three early
children's and young adult books

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.450
as the foundation for the pictures
of the earth that I'm going

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.080
to be showing you and the pictures
that I'm going to be constructing

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.530
for you, meaning that
we shall return

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.030 position:56%
to these three books time and again.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.000
And then we will also look at
how these things have changed

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.740
over the interim 175 years.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.040
And these three books are going

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.910
to be Samuel Goodrich's
1831 Peter Parley's Tales

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.840
about the Sun, Moon and Stars.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.730
J. L. Comstock's 1835
Youth's Book of Astronomy.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.020
And John Blake's 1836 First
Book in Astronomy adapted

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.020
for the use in common schools.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.660
Plus we're also going to
pre-empt the 1843 from the poster

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.110
by 12 years, but I found this
book and I thought this is great

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.910
and we're going to use this and
so starting 12 years earlier

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.660
than advertised I hope that's okay.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.800
But first of all, this is what
really triggered my interest

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.100
in this project.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.480
I'm going to be showing
you a two-minute video

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.660
and this is a compilation of the
audio recorded [inaudible] taken

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.880
on Apollo 8 overlaid with
the corresponding photographs

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.890
that the astronauts were taking at
the time the recording was made.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:41.620
The setting is it's December
24th, 1868, 1968 sorry,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.520
1968 we went to the moon 100 years
earlier, don't tell anyone 1968.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.100
And Frank Borman, Jim Lovell

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.510 position:56%
and Bill Enders have recently become
the first men to leave earth's orbit

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.060
and thus to see the
planet from a distance.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.240
Granted orbit is also a distance,
but this is a greater distance.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.110
And a little more recently
they've also become the first men

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.540
to see the dark side of the moon

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.270
with their own eyes
and to orbit the moon.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.950
At this time, the time
that the video is set,

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.330
Apollo 8 has completed three
full orbits of the moon

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.490
and the three astronauts are
busy with their assigned tasks,

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.290
primary one which is to extensively
photograph the ground passing

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.690
beneath the spacecraft and to
visually appraise the approaches

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.830
to two possible landing sites on
the southern plains of [inaudible].

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.510
And then the following happens.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:11:25.510
[ Inaudible Video Playing ]

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:30.960
Okay, I first listened to Apollo
8 recordings years and years ago

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.210
when I was writing my PhD on
an entirely different subject

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.320
and needed some tangential
information on the connections

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.440
between famous photographs
of the earth from space

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.170
and the environmental
movement for a talk

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.530
that I was giving an
interdisciplinary event.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.560
And what struck me about the
recording was Bill Enders' choice

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.620
of words, he does not say look at
the earth or look at that or look

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.200
at that site no, what
he says is look

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.710
at this picture implying
something mediated,

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.950
something framed right,
a photograph, a picture.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.770
It's not the earth itself he
says, look at this picture.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.720
I might be over interpreting this
here, but it really struck me

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.360
and in a way it's of
course true 99.9999999.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.660
And so [inaudible] percent

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.770
of the human population will
never see the earth from space

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.900
with their own eyes as a
whole, but it's something

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.310
that we always encounter
in a mediated fashion,

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.800
framed a certain way, labeled a
certain way, an image composed

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.240 position:56%
and contextualized in a certain way.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.950 position:56%
And even if you're an astronaut one
might argue you cannot see the earth

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.520
directly, you need at least one
layer of glass between yourself

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.920 position:56%
and the earth otherwise, you might
see it but it might be a painful and

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.370
or short lived experience right.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.550
So it's always somehow mediated.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.450 position:56%
So yes, look at this picture and the
choice of words led me to thinking

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.330
about pictures of the earth and
about the fact that photographs

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.500
from space have now
existed for 69 years.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.120
And thus at the time of the Apollo
8 flight had already existed

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.890
for an incredible 22 years.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.610
So they've been around for a while,

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.100
but they're also a pretty
recent event in the course

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.490
of human history, even
if not entirely

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.290
as recent as they used to be.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.590
If I look around here I think the
photographs have been around longer

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.670
than any of us here have been
alive right, so it's been a while.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.450 position:56%
Photographs of the earth from space
have been praised among other things

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.040
as raising human consciousness to a
new level of awareness of the earth

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.730
as a whole, of globality,
of the environment.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.360 position:56%
And while I certainly agree with the
statement, in my opinion thinking

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.890
of the earth as a planet is not
as recent a thing as some critics

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.680
and writers would make it out to be

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.880
and humankind has been
imagining the earth as a planet

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.960
for a much, much longer time.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.520
So I went and became
interested in and began looking

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.580
for pre-space flight descriptions,

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.810
images of the planet
earth, and now here we are.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.650
Over the last six months
I have according

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:58.410
to my bibliography software,
looked at a total of 1,011 items

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.500
from the Library of Congress, plus
about 50 Russian children's books

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.680
that I haven't been able
to add to my bibliography

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.580
yet because it doesn't deal
with [inaudible] very well.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.930
Some of which were more
relevant some less and some

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.380
which I've spent more
time on and some

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.470
of which I actually still
have to look at in detail.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.590
I came here with a list of books
that I knew that I wanted to see

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.520
and because I had some images
taken from them or read about them

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.930
in other bibliographies, but I
also tried to as systematically

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.910
as possible go through the
Library of Congress' digital

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:33.000
and card catalogs to look for
relevant books in my research area.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.430
Images of the earth can be
found in connection to a number

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.650
of different fields of
interest, of course.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.230
And the ones I spent most time
on are books that are concerned

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.850
with either astronomy, geography,
space exploration or spaceflight

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.060
in general, and all the
subcategories that fall into those.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.900
About 70% of my primary
resources are fact books

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.370
for children whereas the other
30 are fictive space adventures

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.670
of some sort.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.010
And though the lines often
blurred the most fact books

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.010
for children include an
imaginary part that's

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.460
like let's imagine we're
astronauts going to orbit,

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.600
going to the moon, going to Mars.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.390
So there's fiction in
the fact books as well.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.960 position:56%
I've also tried to build as complete
a timeline as possible regarding

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.390
which early photographs
of the earth were taken

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.630
from various [inaudible] Aerobee,
Viking and Nike-Cajun rockets

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.120
and precisely when and then
released to the public precisely

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.470
when to compare and contrast
them with illustrations

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.490
and descriptions which I'm finding.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.730
Which was the reason why I
went to the NASA archives,

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.220
why I went to the Air and Space
Museum, and also why I spent a lot

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.170
of time down in the newspaper
reading room looking at microfilm.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.160
And Kira, my intern, also spent a
lot of time down there doing that.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.530
So that being said about
the background of my project

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.960
and my research on to the
images of the planet earth

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.550
and children's book
theory before that.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.760
In the book -- how picture
books work Maria Nikolajeva

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.030
and Carol Scott assert that and
I quote, the unique character

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.510
of picture books is based on
the combination of two levels

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.780
of communication, the
visual and the verbal.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.400
They continue on by stating
that if we are making use

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.590
of semiotic terminology, we can
say that picture books communicate

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.620
by means of two separate
sets of signs,

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.070
the iconic and the conventional.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:23.310
Iconic or representational signs
are those in which the signifier

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.620
and the signified are
related by common qualities.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.950
That is where the sign is a direct
representation of the signified.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.630
A picture of a printer on a
computer's command menu is an icon,

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.120
a direct representation
of the printer.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.780
In most cases we do not
need special knowledge

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.800
to understand a simple icon.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.000
Conventional signs have
no direct relationship

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.660
with the object signified.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.900
The word print in a menu
only conveys the meaning

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.040 position:56%
if you process the code, that is you
must know what letters stand for.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.830
But letters together
to produce words

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.070
and understand what
the word stands for.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.310
Conventional signs are based on
an agreement among the [inaudible]

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.050
of a particular language, both the
spoken language and communication,

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.830
such as gestures, dress
code and emblems.

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.330
For anyone outside the given
community conventional signs do not

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:17.900
carry any meaning or at best,
the meaning is ambivalent.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.960
Thus, to understand the word
printer [inaudible] or I'm going

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.040
to mangle the Finish
kirjoitin, you need to be fluent

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.450
in the language in question.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.880
Whereas, the icon that symbolizes
the printer transcends one specific

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.240
language and should hopefully allow
you to print things on computers

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.190
where the language is set to
one that you do not speak.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.680
And if you've ever
accidentally changed the language

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.250
of your operating system into one

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.900
that you do not speak you notice
how long it takes to get back

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.470
to something you're familiar with.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:54.210
So the printer hopefully should
work even if it's set to Chinese.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.260
Both Nikolajeva and Scott
call conventional signs

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.900
and iconic signs have existed
in human culture for a long time

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.560
and have not only given rise to two
parallel types of communication,

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.240 position:56%
visual and verbal, but also have
been frequently put into interaction

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.340
with each other in such multimedia
forms as say the theater, movies,

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:17.710
TV shows, video games, comic books
and of course also picture books.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.450
Both the images and the words used
in picture books are complex signs.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.770
The function of the words
are the conventional signs.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.750
To stay with Nikolajeva
and Scott's terminology is

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.700
to narrate, to retell, to report.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.010
Whereas, the images are there
to describe, to represent,

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.710
to illustrate, to visualize what
has been narrated to offer more

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.330
or less concrete representation
of the more

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.430
or less abstract concept
being narrated.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.660
And picture books exists
somewhere between the two polls

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.430
of word and picture interaction.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.330
On the one poll you find
text without pictures

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.490
and on the other poll you
find pictures without text.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.040
So somewhere in between
you find the picture book.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.190
Are there lots of pictures and very
little words or are there a lot

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.620
of words and very few pictures,
it's all a give-and-take.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.700 position:56%
And even there differentiations they
need to be made between narrative

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.810
and non-narrative interactions
of the two extremes.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.050
So is it a story or
is it a dictionary.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.210
Is it a picture narrative or
is it a picture dictionary,

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.620
like A is for apple
and B is for beer,

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.410
well probably not in
a children's book.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.760
According to Nikolajeva and Scott,
images and text can interact

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.360 position:56%
in a number of different ways from
being symmetrical where the pictures

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.490 position:56%
and the text tell two mutually
redundant narratives all the way via

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.030
a number of steps to
selective picture books

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.080
where two narratives are told
independently of one another

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.460
and can, therefore, also
contradict each other.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.230
The theory, however, concerns
itself with narrative picture books

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.830
that tell fictional stories
and does not focus so much

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:02.210
on nonfictional narrative books nor
did any other scholars that have

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.760
so far found focus on those books.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.680
So most of these intricately
interwoven narratives

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.110
that Nikolajeva and Scott write

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.980
about are not actually
present in what I am finding.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.340
In a large amount of the
books that I have been looking

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.910
at are what they kind of
lump together as plate books,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.190
meaning nonfiction
illustrated books.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.150
I will show you that
notwithstanding the lack

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.630
of theoretical in-depth
analysis so far.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.230
Depending on the time these
books were published and the age

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.180
of the intended reader the variety
and the interplay between the text

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.880
and the illustration
nevertheless takes place.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.210
One of my goals for my
own book project is also

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:44.090
to formulate a comprehensive theory
of the interaction between images

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.330
and text in nonfiction
narrative children's books based

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.630
on existing scholarly
work of course.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:52.960
So that's one thing
we're looking at.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.710
And the second thing that really
interested me in my project

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.060
and that I want to introduce
you to for like the next two

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.750
or three minutes is the interaction
between metaphors and similes

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.280
when talking about the planet
earth and children's books.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:12.970
So earth is like a ball
or earth is a ball,

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.120
those are the two things
I'm finding.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.490
So a simile earth is like a
ball is a figure of speech

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.910
that involves the comparison
of one thing to another thing

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.890
of a different kind used
to make a description

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.860
that is then more emphatic
or more vivid.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.290
The metaphor earth is a ball is a
figure of speech in which a word

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:38.220
or phrase literally denoting one
kind of object or idea is used

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:43.380 position:56%
in place of another to suggest a
likeness or an analogy between them.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:48.750
While a simile compares two items,
a metaphor directly equates them.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.180
In his book the Philosophy
of Frederick I.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.300
A. Richards describes metaphors
as and this is another quotation,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.500 position:56%
the supreme agent by which disparate

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.670
and hitherto unconnected
things are brought together.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.870
And he also calls metaphors a
transaction between contexts.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.390
What a metaphor does
is not just to compare,

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:11.200
but to merge two distinct
contexts together.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.970
As my talk is called images of the
Earth in American Children's Book

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.730
and not metaphors regarding
the Earth

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.660
in American Children's Books
we're going to be focusing more

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.630
on visual representations
rather than verbal ones

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.570
and the interplay between the two.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.080
But in my final project I will
definitely be looking at both

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.930
and we're going to touch on
it a little bit here as well.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.780
So while fantastic voyages

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.370
into space have a long tradition
reaching back to ancient Greece

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.790
and then continuing all the way
to the present from [inaudible]

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:45.040 position:56%
of SAMOS' true history from 160
after Christ to Johannes [inaudible]

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.870
from 1634 and [inaudible]
a Voyage to the Moon

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.810
in 1657 to name but a few.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.280
These are neither American books
nor are they purposefully written

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.160
for children and there
are no pictures

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.560
of the earth drawn in them either.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.510
So they exist, but they do not fall
into my area of specific interest.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.040
However, the earliest book I found
that is really of relevance is

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:15.300
from 1831 and was written
by Samuel Goodrich.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:23.850 position:56%
So Samuel Griswold Goodrich was born
in August 1793 and died in May 1860

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:28.050
and he was an American
bookseller and publisher and editor

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.960
and a writer and among the
first Americans who wrote

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.660
and published books for American
children and young adults.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.120
Previous children's books had not
been written in the United States,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.510
but instead been imported
from Britain and Europe

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:44.180
and for the most part, been
written by British authors.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.330
Goodrich was responsible for
the publications of dozens

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:51.840
of works ranging from pocket-size
chapbooks to massive geographies

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.820
and according to the Boston
Globe sold 6 million copies

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.950
of his various books in total.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.170
His most famous creation is
the character of Peter Parley

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.710
and we're going to look
at one of those books.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.980
Peter Parley in the book
is a grouchy old man

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.530
who always tells children
that if they bump

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.590
into his foot he'll
stop telling them tales.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.990
He's like a bit cantankerous and he
tells children tales about botany,

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.670
history, geography, astronomy,
and various other subjects.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.550 position:56%
Thus teaching the fictive children
in the books while entertaining them

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.880
and also the real children who
are reading them are being taught

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.690
and hopefully entertained
at the same time.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.890
The book we're going to be looking
at is one of the Peter Parley tales

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:37.230 position:56%
and as you can see here, its title
is Peter Parley Tales About the Sun,

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.170
Moon and Stars and it was
first published in 1831.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.520
The edition we are going to be
looking at today is from 1836

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.490
and it is here in the
rare books collection

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.470
in the Library of Congress.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.270
The book is fascinating
because it is an early example

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.460
of both some features that have
become common in children's books

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.750
as the decades progress and
because it also quite frankly,

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.420
contains some rather
strange illustrations.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.700
And also an illustration
that points to a problem

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.970 position:56%
that will hound children's books
illustrators for the next 125 years,

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.920
which we'll get to a little later.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.130
But first let's see what
Goodrich actually has

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.230
to say about the earth in 1836.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:20.990
So I'm going to read the text for
you, so just look at the picture.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:25.050
This says chapter 4, Parley
tells about the earth.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.320
On the following page is
a picture of the world.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.220 position:56%
I suppose you know that the world we
live upon is a vast globe or ball.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.890
The [inaudible] side of which
is divided into land and water.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:40.430
You know that it is covered
with seas and oceans and rivers

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.560
and mountains and valleys
and plains.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.750
You know that the earth
is hung in the heavens

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.270
with stars all around it.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.510
Goodrich continues on with facts
and numbers about the earth,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.030
about the circumference and things
like that for the next two pages,

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.310
but interestingly quickly
[inaudible] the size of the earth

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.350
when he writes that how immensely
large then is the earth we

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.650
live upon.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.910
When we come to the foot
of a mountain and look up

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.830
and behold it its magnitude
fills us with awe and wonder.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:15.430
But the largest mountain is a mere
speck compared with a vast globe.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.530
But as large as the world is
many of the stars which glimmer

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:23.150
in the heavens and appear
to us small are much larger.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.540
A world when seen from these
stars does not appear bigger

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.960
than they do to us.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.490
To the people who inhabit the
stars our earth is a star.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.810
Look up at one of the stars in the
sky and imagine yourself upon it.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.710
This world dwindled by
the distance would appear

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.810
to you a little glimmering
light so faint and far

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.880
as to be scarcely visible.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.010
What is typical in Goodrich's
explanation of the motion

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.610
of the earth and the other
planets is that he tries

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.350
to explain the motion by
using everyday comparisons

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.190
that are easily graspable
by children and that will

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.030
for a large part remain unchanged
all the way to the present day.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:07.780
When he talks I quote about
the motions of the planets,

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.260
I must now beg the particular
attention of my little reader

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.050
to what I'm going to say.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.580
The seven planets of which I
have been telling you have each

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.600
of them two motions that is they
all turn round from west to east

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.780 position:56%
in the same manner as the earth does

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.250
of which I told you
a little while ago.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:28.440
They also move in vast
circles around the sun.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.900
To make you understand this better
suppose you put a small stake

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:35.520
through the center of an apple
and call the stake its axis.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.920
Now turn the apple around
on the stick, very well.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.270
The apple turns around on its axis.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.210
In a similar manner
each of the planets

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.820
and asteroids turns
round on its axis.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.180
The earth turns around on its axis
every day or once in 24 hours.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.490
Some of the planets turn around
in a shorter time than the earth

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.380
and some in a longer time.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.050
Now suppose you take an apple and
tie a string to the stem of it

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:00.970
and whirl it above your head.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:04.200
We will call the circle a
path in which the apple flies

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.160
about your head is orbit.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.800
So if you whirl it swiftly the
apple will go around in its orbit

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.730
or go around you head
150 times in a minute.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.490
And this is what you
can see here right,

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.450
there's the boy whirling
the apple around his head.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:22.330
And this is what this
looks like later on.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.260
Here's some more recent
illustrations

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.120
that show precisely the
same concept even if they

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.980
in more recent years
are usually applied

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.240
to explaining how satellites
stay in their orbits,

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.660
thus putting the child holding
the string in the position

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.080
of the earth rather than that of
the sun, which he or she inhabited

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.920
in Goodrich's explanation.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.640
These illustrations are from Rose
Wyler and Gerald Ames' Golden Book

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.300 position:56%
of Astronomy, a Child's Introduction
to the Wonders of Space illustrated

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.770
by John Paul Green from 1955.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.320
And Maurice Allward's
Timothy's Space Book illustrated

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.630
by T. E. North from 1961.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.260
And if you look at the slides
I always give you the names

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.350
of the authors, but
also of the illustrator

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.390
because I thought we're talking
about pictures and then I need

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.940
to tell you who actually
drew the pictures.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.320
So this is the first one.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:13.150
So Rose Wyler and Gerald Ames'
book the boy here is the sun

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.750
on the left-hand side
of the screen for you.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.690
And the illustration
on the right here

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.940
where the earth is
actually moving is orbit

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.490
and precisely parallels the boy
whirling the stone around its head,

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.050
it's a stone here it's
no longer an apple.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.790
And both of them explain
the combination

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.890
between centrifugal
forces and gravitation

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.520
which keeps the earth
orbiting the sun.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.850 position:56%
Maurice Allward's book was published
after satellites had been launched

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:44.340 position:56%
into earth's orbit and thus explains
the interplay between centrifugal

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.740
and gravitational force
in term of the earth

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.710
and its satellites instead.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.450
And the parallel is again made
explicit by the two drawings

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.860
on the right-hand side
displaying significant parallel

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.600
compositional aspects.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.860
The location of the boy's had
parallel that of the earth right,

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.040
they're on the same place in
the picture and the conqueror.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.090
This boy is not using an apple or
a stone, but he has a conqueror,

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.070
the conqueror is almost
in the same place

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.560
as the satellite is going
around in the orbit.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.230
So again, you can see
the parallel compositions

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.530
between the two pictures.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.740
So one parallel, but back
to Peter Parley for now.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.740
The next illustration
show how Goodrich explains

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.900
that the earth turns around the sun
rather than the other way around

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:31.700
and that the sun always shines
on some part of the earth.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.600
And so on the left you
can see someone reaching

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.240
out behind the curtain holding
an apple, so that's an apple

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.000
on a string that he's
holding next to the candle.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.270
And the other one has the
sun shining on the earth.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.890
So if you turn the
apple that you have

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:52.060
on the little string the
candle shines on its other side

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.250
and while your side might turn
dark the candle keeps shining

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.840
on the apple all the same.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.670
This illustration also
introduces one of the problems

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:03.650
that children's book illustrators
often contended with and especially

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:08.660
in more recent -- no not so recent
book, where to put the clouds,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.620
where do you put the clouds right.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.080
When you look up at the sky you
see clouds, but when you look

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.570 position:56%
at the earth from space do you see
clouds or do you not see the clouds?

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:21.000
And if we've talked about
my project at any length

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.210
in time I've probably joked to
you that before 1946 the weather

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.840 position:56%
on the earth was much better
because there were never any clouds,

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.600
there are never any clouds
from space very rarely.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.550
Interestingly, this
is not quite true

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.320
for this Peter Parley illustration.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.820 position:56%
Here the artist clearly knew that he
had to include the clouds somewhere,

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.300
but at the same time if you
don't want to obscure the view

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.670
of the earth and paint
them on the earth

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.810
and then the people can recognize
the earth where would you put them?

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:50.770 position:56%
So here his solution was to put them
around the sun, which technically

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.990
from the point of view of
someone standing on the earth

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.060
and looking up is kind of true.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.850
But also of course,
not actually the case,

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:02.010
so keep in mind where
the clouds are.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.270 position:56%
And last but not least, there's also
this interesting view of the earth

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:08.930
in the book, which really seems

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.420
to be planet water
rather than planet earth.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.440
So we're going to zoom in a little.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.910
The quality of my image
is not the best,

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:21.260
but you can see this is water world
more than it is anything else.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.300
The book does not give
any explanation

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.310
for this it just has a ton
of ships on this planet

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.770
and no continents,
which is interesting.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.840
And another interesting image
I'm going to show you is

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.980
from Samuel Goodrich's 1846
National Geography for schools,

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.250
so this is the front page.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.710
And there again, we see
the clouds around the earth

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:46.780
and the earth looks like this.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.080
Is there anything that
might be missing?

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.930
Asia yes, so the visible part
of the earth is only North

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:06.850
and South America, nothing else,
but he included the clouds.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:10.370
So something of this and
a little less if that.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.190
So now you've seen
Goodrich's problem of where

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:16.110
to locate the clouds and
also some images of the earth

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:20.690
without any clouds actually
between you and viewing it.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.170
And let me show you how
the planet earth and clouds

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:27.740
on the earth's surface are depicted
in the intervening 180 years.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:36.570
So these three, I hope you can
see these okay even from the back.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:41.280
These are from John
Astor, yes the John Astor.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.710
A Journey in Other Worlds and
Romans of the Future from 1894,

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:49.660
Mary Proctor's The Children's
Book of the Heavens from 1928

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:54.730
and the Stars for Sam
from W. M. Reed from 1931.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:58.090
And here you can actually
see some clouds if you look

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.250
at the Astor picture,
which is the big one.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.310
The description says the signal
is from the Arctic Circle.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.510
So they need to find out
where they're going to land

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.250 position:56%
and the signal helps them with that.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.780
But you can actually see
South America and some clouds

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.980
around it whereas in the other two
books -- Proctor still has some,

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.620
but then in W. M. Reed's
book it's the first book

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.420
where we're starting
to lose the clouds.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.260
So we have clouds and then we
start kind of losing more clouds

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.290
and we will not see
any clouds for a while.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:33.420 position:56%
So these are the next
illustrations -- that these are all,

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.130
these are from between
1935 and 1945 and that's

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:40.680
when we really start seeing lots of
books about space expiration again.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.940
In the decades before that they
are few and far between either

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.050
in fiction or they're
astronomy books.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.950
And it took me two weeks to figure
out why that is, why do people talk

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:53.580
about space a lot like
in the 1840's, 50's,

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.180
60's, 70's and then they stop.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:00.340 position:56%
It's because people start building
planes and all the [inaudible] books

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.670
of wonder are about aviation
and not about the stars anymore.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.470
I felt very stupid once
I figured that out.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.870
I thought of course, of course,

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.560
that's when we started having
aircraft and everyone's about hey,

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.460
we're going to fly the Pole
[inaudible] fly into space.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.940
But space comes back.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:21.110
So here as I said, these are from
W. B. White I'm Seeing Stars 1935,

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:26.500
Arthur Draper's Wonders
of the Heavens from 1940,

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.930 position:56%
Bertha M. Parker the Earth's Nearest
neighbor, which is the big picture

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.260
and then the Picture Book of
Astronomy by Jerome S. Meyer,

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.080
which we will keep
coming back to today

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.780
which is the bottom left picture.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.300
And here what is significant is

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.680
that the earth pretty much
look like a glow from space.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.970
So there's an absence of the
clouds, we see very clearly North

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:49.450
and South America and inn American
children's books it's always North

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.280
and South America that you see.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.350
In Russian children's books it's
not Russia interestingly enough,

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.510
they often show like in
the North Pole or parts

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:02.850 position:56%
of Europe they don't focus to such
a degree on the US and South America

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.850
as American children's books do.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.990
So now we're in 1945 there are
no clouds on the planet earth,

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.860
everything is sunny everywhere,
the weather is always good

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.710
and then silence has to
come in and ruin the view.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.790
So it's 1946 and this happens.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:21.950
This is the first photograph of
the earth in which you see clouds

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.940
from above and it was
taken on October 24th,

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.560
1946 and it's the first
photograph from space.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.360
It was taken from a V2 rocket
launched in the New Mexico desert

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.680
and which had been fitted with a
35 millimeter motion picture camera

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:41.530 position:56%
and went up to a suborbital altitude
of 105 kilometers or 65 miles

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:43.890
as I should probably say here.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:46.080
The camera was destroyed
after being dropped back

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.320 position:56%
to the earth, but the film survived.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.220 position:56%
You can see it here at the top left,
along with an image of the page

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.880
from the Christian Science Monitor,

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.090
which talks about it
which is on the right.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.540
And here courtesy of the
Microphone Collection

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.650
in the Newspaper Reading Room.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:03.070
I'm showing you this page
here alongside the photograph

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:04.740
so you can get a feeling
for the fact

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.650
that these images were
widely circulated

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.090
in the press, which
indeed they were.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.640
And another highly influential
publication this time not a

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.580
photograph, but a magazine
article or rather a series

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.720
of magazine articles was
published in Colliers between 1952

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.210
and 1954 and that's this one.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:26.550
And these are some of the
most influential drawings

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.980
of the planet earth
ever, ever, ever,

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.650
ever and especially
of space stations.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:36.860
They inspired a great deal of
children's books' illustrators

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:40.150
and Colliers ran a series of
articles on humankind's future

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:44.340 position:56%
in space in which leading scientists
talk about space exploration.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:48.860 position:56%
And these illustrations here were
taken from the first of these issues

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.980
of Colliers and this one was
called Man Will Conquer Space Soon.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:57.320
The article is drawn by Chesley
Bonestell, one of the pioneers

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.280
of space art who greatly
helped popularize space travel

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.880
and whose illustrations have
become so iconic that people refer

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.270
to other artists as
either being Bonestallion

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:10.100
or not quite Bonestallion enough.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.430
Here he is illustrating an article
written by [inaudible] Brown

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:18.300
about space stations and crossing
the last frontier into space.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.500
And if you keep this picture in
mind and then look at the next one

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:25.560
so you can see what I mean about
them being very influential.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:32.530
So especially the two on the right
they seem almost identical right,

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:36.970
it's a different artist but
clearly copies the style.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:41.150
These are from Arthur C. Clarke's
Exploration of the Moon in 1954,

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:44.340
illustrated by Ralph
Smith and then Rose Wyler

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.450
and Gerald Ames' Golden Book of
Astronomy, a Child's Introduction

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:51.380
to the Wonders of Space, and Willy
Levy Man-Made Satellites Adventure

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.030
in Space from 1955 and 57.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.530
And both of these were
illustrated by John Paul Green,

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.610
so that's why the images look
so similar it's the same artist

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:03.360
who clearly was influenced
by Chesley Bonestell.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.260
The earth looks a bit scary here,
there's not a hole being dug

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.570
in the earth so the earth is not
slowly disintegrating into itself.

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.800
The book is illustrating
an eclipse of the moon what

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.440
that would look like from space.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.080
So the moon's shadow
is on the earth here,

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.380
that's why it has that dark spot.

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.770
The next photograph that
is very influential or no,

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:31.830
the next autograph is from 1959
and shows the first photograph

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.410 position:56%
of the earth taken from a satellite,
namely by the Explorer 6 Satellite

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.600
on the 14th of August
1959 from a height

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.390
of about 27,000 kilometers
or 70,000 miles.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.770
The [inaudible], that's the one

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:46.220
on the top left it clearly
shows a sunlighted area

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.810
of the central Pacific Ocean
and its cloud cover right.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:54.760 position:56%
Of much better quality was the first
television picture from space sent

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.090
to earth on April 1st,
1960 and taken by TIROS-1,

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.160
the first successful lower
earth orbital weather satellite.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.460
In the first of its years

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.570
of television infrared
observations satellites,

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.290
which is the picture
at the bottom left.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:10.150
And it shows the coast of Maine
and Canada's Maritime Provinces

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:14.250
and this is when you really start
seeing the curvature of the earth

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:16.910
and to a greater degree and
cloud cover of the earth.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.920
And you start actually using
and television pictures to talk

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.010
about the weather and suddenly
people know what clouds look

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.130
like from space to
a far greater degree

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:26.660
than they did before even there,

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.330
though there they already
know it for [inaudible].

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:33.970
And next then and this is what
really, really kicks it all off.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:37.590
It's time for humans to get
in on the photography action.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.780
Yuri Gagarin became the first
man in space on April 12,

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:46.220
1961 and in February 1962 John
Glenn, the third American in space

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.650
and took his camera along
with him and brought back,

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.000
among others the photograph
of the earth

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.950 position:56%
that you see on the right-hand side.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:57.010
And this is when you start having
pictures taken by humans from space

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.780
who then can talk about what
they saw, what it felt like to be

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:04.490
in space, and that adds an entirely
different dimension to the way

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:08.490 position:56%
that people draw the earth and talk
about the earth in children's books.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:11.760
And again, here are four
illustrations that sort

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.780
of parallel this cloud cover.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.230
Some of them are more
realistic and some less,

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:18.380
but there's also some
time in between.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.980
So the one where it's still very
sunny except for this tiny piece

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:27.410
of cloud out in the Pacific Ocean
close to Mexico is from 1958.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.810
And then the one on the right
where the clouds are sort

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:33.610
of forming a little band around
the earth, I loved that image

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:38.300
when I saw it, that's from the
Sun, the Moon and Stars from 1959.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.690
And then the bottom two ones are,
the bottom right one is from 1961

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:45.570
and the one on the
bottom left is from 1963.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:48.350
And that one talks about
the first astronauts

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:53.150
in space while showing the
earth with a big cloud cover.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:57.900
So again, in the bottom right you
can clearly see there are more

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.160
and more clouds being
drawn around the earth

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.570
as we have the photographs, so
I'm going to skip back here?

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.600
Look at the top right
photograph and then compare it

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.320
to the bottom right picture right.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:14.190
So but maybe the most
influential single photo --

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:19.370 position:56%
series of photographs for children's
books is actually of the spacewalk.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.630
So the photograph on the top left
here shows Ed White's spacewalk

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:27.110
on the Gemini 4 mission
in June 1965.

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:30.780
And this is copied widely
in children's books.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.290
So either they use the
photographs themselves,

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:37.230
as in the top right The World of
Rockets by Alexander [inaudible]

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:42.400
or in the bottom two pictures
where the photograph inspires art.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:46.160
Before that the depiction
of astronauts is kind of all

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.590
over the place people don't quite
know what the spacesuits are going

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.980 position:56%
to look like, they have huge
antennas sticking out of their head.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.940
You're going to see one
of those pictures later.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:57.670
But after this spacewalks look
like Ed White's spacewalk.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:05.520
The next important images
from November 10th, 1967,

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.870
and offers the first full
view of the planet earth

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.560
that the public actually
gets to see.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:14.070
There is most likely arguably
an earlier photograph taken

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.640
by a military dodge satellite which
was never released to the public.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.550
And so while interesting it's
not interesting to my project

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:24.300
because it's never released it
cannot inspire anyone all right.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:28.410
And like the photo that I will
talk about after this one,

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:32.310
this photograph has been largely
overshadowed in collective memory

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:36.660
since in its case by Apollo 17's
famous blue marble photograph.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.680
So if I ask you what
was the first photograph

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.460
of the completely illuminated
glow from space,

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.210
most people would say
the blue marble.

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.730
And it wasn't actually
it was this one,

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:49.470
which was taken five years
earlier than the blue marble.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:52.940 position:56%
But when this photograph here was
taken it was a huge deal at the time

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.410
in children's books and it was
very quickly adapted into them.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:59.150
So it was released, it caused
huge excitement for the public

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:03.450
and it was very quickly covered
and put into children's books.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:06.920
So at the top right this
book is called Exploring

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:11.620
and Understanding our Solar System
by Daniel Q. Posin, it's from 1968.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.350
So the year after and
I copied the image,

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:17.190
they've also reversed
it for some reason.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.850
So everything is the
wrong way around,

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:23.940
but it's the first color photo
of earth taken from space

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.900
by the Aqueous 3 satellite.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:30.540
And then in the books at the bottom
here they go chronologically,

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.410
actually and then all
over the place.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:36.550
So the one with the [inaudible]
space stations from 1971 and then

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:43.960
at the far left it's 1977, bottom
79, and then 2008 at the right

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.550
which I show you here to see that
today it's mostly photographs

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.390
of the earth that are
used in children's books,

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:52.120
they don't do illustrations so
much anymore they use photographs

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.560
because we have so
many great photographs.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.000
So photography wise it is 1967 now

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.520
and thus the year before Apollo
8 goes to the moon and that is

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.120
where we will leave
space photography for now

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.990
for the relationship between the
earth and the moon is something

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:12.390
that is also extensively covered
in children's books as well.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:15.320
And for which we shall once
again start in the 1840's

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.250
and then move away forward.

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:24.640 position:56%
All right, there are two more books
from the 1840's that I want to delve

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.980
into a little, namely J. L.
Comstock's Youth Book of Astronomy

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:32.560
from 1835 and John Blake's
First Book in Astronomy adapted

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.960
for the use of common
schools from 1936.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.580
They're both interesting because
they while not providing the reader

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.980
with any detailed illustrations
of the earth itself,

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.350
discuss what the earth would
look like when seen from the moon

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:49.370
and thus highlight a very common
feature of children's books.

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:52.370
Someone is standing on the moon
and looking back at the earth

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.830
and when I say it's a very common
feature, I mean it's a very, very,

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:57.630
very, very common feature.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.300
It's almost in every children's
books where you go into space,

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.200
you stand on the moon and
you look back on the earth

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:09.360
and you think something about the
earth and that changes over time.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:18.460
So Blake -- so Blake in his
First Book on Astronomy adapted

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:22.240
for the use of common
schools writes the following,

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.820
as the moon illuminates the earth
by light reflected from the sun

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.430
so it is reciprocally
illuminated by the earth,

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:32.080
which reflects the sun's rays
to the surface of the moon.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.860 position:56%
And as the surface of the earth is
more than 13 times greater than that

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.720
of the moon, the earth
must appear to inhabitants

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.690
of the moon 13 times larger
than the moon does to us.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:45.200
The rotation of the moon
and its axis being performed

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.310
in the same time that it goes
around the earth it is plain

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:52.750 position:56%
that the inhabitants of one half of
the lunar world are totally deprived

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:57.410 position:56%
of the side of the earth unless they
travel to the opposite hemisphere.

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:00.080
So if you live on the moon it
depends on where you live whether

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.430
or not you get to see the earth.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:03.930
If you live on the far side
of the moon and then you go

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:07.090
around the earth you go oh,
what is this thing right.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.330
And Comstock kind of
writes the same thing,

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.680
but he does so in a far
more lyrical fashion,

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.710
which is why I'm quoting it too.

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:15.800 position:56%
We have already stated that one side

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.440
of the moon is never
turned towards the earth.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.690 position:56%
Consequently, to the lunarians which
are his inhabitants of the moon,

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:26.530
who live on the side nearest to
us the earth is always visible,

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.850
except when the moon
is in opposition.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:31.800
But those who live on the opposite
side of the moon and always stay

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.130
at home never see the earth at all

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:36.850
because that side is
never turned towards us.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:41.090
A lunar astronomer who happens to
live on the side directly opposite

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:45.410 position:56%
to us would have to travel a quarter
of the circumference of his planet

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:49.670
to see the earth at all
that is about 1,500 miles.

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:51.090
And if you would see our orb

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:56.360 position:56%
in its greatest magnificence he
must go 3,000 miles or to the middle

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.950
of the part next to us where
indeed he will behold a spectacle

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.900
which any terrestrial
astronomer would be happy

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.790
to enjoy at such an expense.

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:09.920
Namely a moon always directly
over his head, 13 times as large

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.600
as the full moon appears to
us and turning on its axis

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.670
so that he could examine
every part of it in 24 hours.

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:19.910
Don't you want to live
on the moon now?

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:25.150
So as I said, unfortunately no
detailed illustrations of the earth

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.290
from space or indeed
what the earth might look

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:30.230
like from the moon are provided
by either Blake or Comstock.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:35.130
The most you get is in Comstock
this drawing of an eclipse

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:39.100
like when the moon is dark because
the earth is between the sun

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.550
and the moon, that's the
most you get of the earth.

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:46.990
And it takes almost a hundred years
until the first image of the earth

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.780
as seen from the moon shows up in
children's books and it is in 1924

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.840 position:56%
in May Proctor's The Children's Book

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.550
of the Heavens and
it looks like this.

00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:00.020
This is a typical image for the
1920's, so it takes a while to show

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.380
up and then these are the
kind of images you get.

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:07.040
And the best one in
color that I have found,

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.270
which is why I'm showing
it to you here.

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:12.330
The moon as we all
know from seeing it

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:15.220
at night shines bright
yellow in the earth's sky.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.090
And so for a long time
it seemed to follow

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:19.530
that the earth too would be
bright yellow when we looked at it

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.070
from the moon right, one is
yellow the other one is yellow

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:23.620
seems logical.

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:26.120
This one is actually
slightly atypical

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.190
in that it does not show some
detail in the earth's surface,

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:34.790 position:56%
even if the planet as a whole seems
more reminiscent of drawings of Mars

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:37.250
and the canals that
might exist on Mars

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:38.640
that were also frequent subjects

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.950
in children's astronomy
books of the time right.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:44.750 position:56%
If I said you what is this you'd
say oh is this Mars, it's the earth.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:49.000
And the description says the earth
seen from the moon's [inaudible].

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:03.250
So details start showing up in the
1930's and these three images are

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.010 position:56%
from left to right from Elena Fontay

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:10.490
of the world's [inaudible]
from 1930.

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:12.160
Otto Gail's By Rocket to the Moon,

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.900
the story of Hans Hardt's
Miraculous flight from 1931.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:20.850
And W. M. Reed's The Stars
for Sam in 1931 as well.

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:26.960
So interestingly, the continents
here are only vaguely determinable

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.790
and clouds too seem
to actually exist

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.860
and obscure the features
of the earth.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.580
So again, it's a parallel

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.180
to the earlier pictures
we had of the earth.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:38.360
In the 1930's you have clouds, in
the 1940's there are no clouds.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.940
And maybe unsurprisingly if you
look at the earth from the moon

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.770
in the 1940's there are no clouds.

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:50.630
So we're going back to Bertha M.
Parker The Earth's Nearest Neighbor

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:54.050
and then Jeremy S. Meyers,
the Picture Book of Astronomy

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:58.910
and on the far right Marion
Cothren's 1946 This is the Moon,

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:03.780
which sort of has the earth
rising behind the moon.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.540
And this way of drawing the
earth doesn't really change

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:10.050
until the late 1950's and clouds
start appearing in these drawings

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:11.540
of the earth as seen from the moon.

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:15.510
So it really takes us after the
first satellites are in space,

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:19.900 position:56%
but before manned spaceflight begins
for these pictures of the earth

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:23.720
to change a little as they
are seen from the moon.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.120
And then you get pictures
like these and all four

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.490
of these are primarily concerned
with our future in space

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:32.650
and exploring the moon so you
can see various iterations

00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:35.950
of rocket ships going
there or unmanned probes

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.060
that might land on the moon.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.680
And you also always
see the earth somewhere

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.220
in the lunar sky, that's
very common.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.870
If you draw people landing on
the moon and working on the moon

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:49.040
and you always include the earth
somewhere to show that they are

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.850
on the moon and not
on some random plant

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:53.370
and because it's a
nice visual sight.

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:02.080
So where am I, I adlibbed.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.840
Photographs of the earth as seen
from lunar orbit are something

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.730
that once they are available
are also quickly integrated

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:11.420
into children's books as well,
somewhat unsurprisingly probably.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.370
Maybe even more so by sheer
amount than the early photographs

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:16.410
of the earth from orbit
actually are,

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:21.040 position:56%
which often only inspired art itself
rather than being copied one-on-one.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.190
The first photograph of the earth
from lunar orbit, which was taken

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:28.000
in 1966 by the lunar orbiter
this very quickly turns

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.880
up in front papers and end
papers of children's books,

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:33.660
as well as integrated
into the text itself.

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.660
Today again, few people might
recall that this image existed

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:41.130
as it has been overshadowed by the
Apollo 8 and Earthrise photograph,

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:44.210
which we saw earlier
but it did exist.

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:47.750
And interesting about this picture
is that while it is integrated

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:50.510
into the text sometimes it
also shows up in the front

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:53.250
and in the end papers, even if the
book doesn't really talk about it.

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:55.460
It's just there because it
exists and you want to show it

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:58.220
to the children, that's my theory.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:01.950 position:56%
It's like it doesn't really fit in
the text, maybe the text was written

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:06.100
if the book is published shortly
after, but do include this picture.

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.320
And of course, you can
show it in the full spread

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.140
which is very nice visually.

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:16.100
So these here are two books
from 1967, which are used

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:21.440
in the front paper and
then in David Dietz's Stars

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.720
and the Universe it's actually
in the text when they write

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.270
about the moon what the
moon might look like.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.780
So they use pictures that were
taken on the surface of the moon

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.690
and then also one from orbit.

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:35.660
But there are two pictures that
I really would like to talk

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:37.880
about in more detail
right now rather

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.360
than showing you endless
repetitions of globe earth

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:44.800
and spikey moon terrain, they
always have spikey mountains.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.930
And these are both from a book
that was written and illustrated

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:52.670
by Anthony Ravielli and which
is called the World is Round.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:56.680
The World is Round spends
most of its time explaining

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.710
that the world is round even if you
can't see that the world is round.

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:03.200
So it says the earth is a ball and
the earth is a really big ball,

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.680
but imagine you're a tiny fly
sitting on this really big ball.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.170
So to you it seems flat,

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:11.380
but if you're a child holding this
big ball it's nevertheless round

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.130
even though the fly can't see it.

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:15.690 position:56%
So like 80% of this book is actually

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:18.160
about explaining why
the earth is a ball,

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.680
which here the title
already shows you.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.850
And then it talks about the earth
as a planet and space exploration

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:26.740
and the space program a little.

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:30.110 position:56%
And what is interesting about this
book is that the Library of Congress

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:33.440
in its general collection has
two editions of this book.

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:37.630
And they are identical to each
other except for two pages,

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:41.640
one two-page spread,
namely pages 46 and 47

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:45.130
and this is what they look like.

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:49.350
Does anyone want to hazard a
guess what might've happened

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:53.470
between the first and the
second edition of this book

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:55.970
or when they might
be from very roughly?

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:58.390
What has happened here?

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.110
The moon landing has
happened indeed.

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:05.460
The book on the left it's the
-- let's see if this works yeah,

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.790
it's the 1963 edition
of the book and the one

00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:13.190
on the right is the 1970
edition of the book.

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:16.610
And so you see a couple
of interesting changes.

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:19.080
And if you look in the 1963 one,

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:23.200
so the one on the left the moon
still has the very spiky mountains

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.760
that everyone thought
the moon would have.

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.180
There is no atmosphere on
the moon, so there's no wind,

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.950 position:56%
there's no water, so there's nothing

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:32.700
to corrode the mountains away hence
the mountains must be very spiky.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.990
And the stars are very
clearly visible in the sky.

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:39.560
The moon lander looks somewhat
different people are climbing

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.780
out the top which leads you to the
question how do they possibly get

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:44.560
out of that thing to
the lunar surface

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.420
if they're climbing out the top.

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:49.110
And then the earth looks very
different from the moon right,

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.490
there are very few clouds,
it's very clearly --

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:53.880
the two out Americas are visible.

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:58.280
And then on the right the
moon landing has taken place,

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:01.280
so you have a realistic
depiction of the lunar lander

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.000
of what the gear you need to
wear and the moon looks like,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.260
the stars aren't as visible
anymore and the earth is very,

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:10.760
very cloudy as it looks
like from the moon indeed.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:15.610
And this book was both written and
illustrated by Anthony Ravielli,

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:20.320
so clearly he cared enough about
the inaccuracies of his book

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.860
that he said I'm going to draw a
new page 46, 47 and we're going

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.990
to include this in
the second edition.

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.330
And I brought both versions
of the book with me.

00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:31.470 position:56%
I brought some books with me you can
look at after the talk in the Q&amp;A

00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:34.560
if you and so you can
sort of compare and see

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.250
that indeed everything
else is the same.

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:41.350
What does the moon actually look
like, what does the earth look

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:44.030
like from the moon that you
can see in this picture.

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:48.100
So this is a photograph taken
by Eugene Cernan in Apollo 17

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.870
and it shows you what
the earth actually looks

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.590
like in the lunar sky.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:55.200
It's kind of tiny and
unimpressive isn't it?

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.680
So it's is very hard to photograph.

00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.050
If you've ever tried photographing
the moon you've had this problem

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:02.950
either you zoom in so you see
nothing else except the moon

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:05.780
or you take a picture and then
there's this tiny moon somewhere.

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.130
And the same is true of the earth.

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:09.650
So here you see the
boulder in the foreground

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:12.870
and then the half lit
earth in the sky.

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:17.840
In drawings in children's
books the earth is much bigger

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.140
and more impressive.

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:24.510 position:56%
So you can see that in the Ravielli
book where he didn't change the size

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:27.420
of the earth he kept that pretty
much the same he just changed what

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:30.390
it looks like and you
can see it in these here.

00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:34.300 position:56%
And the top right book is one that
I actually think is a little creepy,

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:38.620
it's called The Happy Moon, it's
from 1972 and it's about the fact

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.600
that the moon is really,
really very happy

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.180
about having people land on it.

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:48.010
But to me it looks like you're kind
of stepping on the moon's face.

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.380
So I read that book and
I thought oh actually,

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.600
this moon makes me
a little creep out.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:58.030 position:56%
And then at the bottom right is just
one of my favorite illustrations

00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:00.450
because it's such a nice
spread and it includes the text

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:03.430
and the imagery really well,
it shows you the lunar surface

00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:05.460
and the astronauts and
the earth and the sky.

00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:06.950
This is by Richard Whittingham

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:09.650
and Barbara Brooks' The
Earth and the Stars.

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:12.440
Unfortunately, it doesn't
tell you who drew the picture.

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:18.540
And the one on the left is from
1969, so it appeared late in 1969

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.500
after the moon landing it's called
We Came in Peace, The Story of Men

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.750
in Space and it's one of the
first picture books to deal

00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:26.340
with the moon landing itself.

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.070
And ever since the moon landing

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:32.700
in these pictures appeared this
is what illustrations of the earth

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:34.430
from the moon have looked like.

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:37.160
The moon is flat, there
are no spiky mountains,

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:41.420
the spacecraft look Apollo
like, the earth is cloudy.

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.950
And due to time constraints
because I think I'm kind of getting

00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:47.430
on with my time I see
Jason nodding in the back,

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:51.730
this is where we're going to
stop looking at earth from moons

00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:54.840
and then start turn our
attention very briefly to images

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.020 position:56%
that illustrate more abstract ideas.

00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:01.430
And that does closely tie into the
analysis of the use of metaphors

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:03.060
and similes in children's books,

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.940
which I want to at least
introduce you to a little.

00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:08.590
And this is also the point where
we get to the merry-go-round

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:12.660
that you may be saw on
the poster for my talk.

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.380
So the first thing I want to
talk about is actually more

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:17.360
about the solar system
than the earth itself

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:21.670
and this is how do you explain
gravitational forces to children.

00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:25.710
Right, we have the one where the
earth flies around on that string,

00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:28.970
but if you want to talk about the
solar system what you commonly

00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:33.500
or what I commonly
find are tugs of war.

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.430
So tug-of-war is a way
of explaining to children

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:38.860
that all the planets
influence each other.

00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:42.690 position:56%
So the one on the left is from Elena
Fontay again we're coming to back

00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:45.970
to her, Other Worlds
than This from 1930.

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:47.610
And the one on the right is

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:49.590
from Herbert Townsend's
A Wonderful Earth,

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:53.060
The Story of How it Became the
Great Round Earth it is today.

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:56.040
And so he actually in
the Townsend you see

00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:59.520
on the right-hand side
you see the sun sort

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.020
of having a tug-of-war
with all the planets.

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.410
So all the planets against the sun

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:05.350
and the sun is probably
still going to win.

01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:08.600
And then on the left, which is
the same as in Fontay except

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:13.000
that in Fontay you have
people pulling, it's like some

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.190
of the bigger planets or certainly
the sun have more influence

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:20.320
and the smaller ones have less, so
they're drawn as smaller people.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.180
But it also depends on where
you are in the solar system.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:27.340 position:56%
So Fontay's description says the man

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:30.570
with the greatest pulling power is
not always the biggest nor always

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:31.870
the nearest.

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:34.660
So Uranus might have more
power on Neptune than the sun

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:38.760
because the sun is father away
her illustration seems to say.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.900
And the second one
is merry-go-rounds,

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.740
so many merry-go-rounds.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.070
So again, this is a way
of explaining the fact

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:50.540
that the earth turns around itself
and also rotates around the sun.

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:55.300
So in Jeremy Meyer's book,
which is also the poster

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:59.570
that I have you can see the
merry-go-round superimposed

01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:02.210
on the earth and the stars
and it explains the fact

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:05.140
that the earth turns around
itself like a merry-go-round.

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:08.730
And the other three illustrations
are actually somewhat more

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:11.850
interesting, especially the
two on the right-hand side.

01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:18.940 position:56%
So on the top one in Herman and
Nina Schneider's You Among the Stars

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:23.870
illustrated the Symeon Shimin
the page before explains actually

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:27.580
that the earth is like
going to the dentist,

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.800
which is a painful thing isn't it.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.310
But you go to the dentist and
you sit in the dentist's chair

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:34.260
and you take your brother
and your brother spins you

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.760 position:56%
around in the dentist's chair right.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.660
So that is the earth
spinning around itself.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.770
And now imagine if you're
putting this dentist's chair

01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:43.320
on a merry-go-round.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.850
So the center of the
merry-go-round is the sun,

01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:49.140 position:56%
the one which is all the horses turn
and then your brother turning you

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:52.710
in the dentist's chair is the
earth turning around itself.

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:57.810
And at the bottom right you have
Julius Schwartz's The Earth is Your

01:01:57.810 --> 01:01:59.890
Spaceship from 1963.

01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:02.270
So this is also interesting
because it is an early mention

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:05.710
of the earth being a spaceship
where they put the merry-go-round

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:08.510
on a truck and the truck
drives in a circle.

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:11.830 position:56%
Okay, so here the earth is the
merry-go-round and the truck driving

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:14.520
in the circle is the path
it takes around the sun.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:20.500
And last one of these on
the bottom left Gerald Ames

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.660
and Rose Wyler again, they wrote
a lot of books about the earth.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.550
This is called Planet Earth
this book and illustrated

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.760 position:56%
by Cornelius DeWitt and there you
have the earth turning around itself

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.060
with people standing on it.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:35.690 position:56%
So the earth is the green planet and
on top of it is the merry-go-round.

01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:38.510
So rather than superimposing
it they attached it at the top

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:41.280
so you can see both the planet
turning, you can explain

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.000
that down is always towards
the center of the earth,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.770 position:56%
and that the earth is turning
around itself like a merry-go-round.

01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:52.330
So if you remember back to what
you thought about the earth

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:55.270
and how you might explain
the earth as a planet

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:58.510
to a child did you
find any parallels,

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:01.300
did you find any differences,
did you think of a ball,

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.010
did you think of a merry-go-round,

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:04.880
did you think of a
dentist's chair maybe?

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.440
If you have any thoughts
you want to share

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:13.560
about that I would be very happy
to hear them maybe after the Q&amp;A.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.450
And so far the only
thing that remains for me

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:19.080
to say is oops, thank you.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:23.350
There we go and that have now
arrived on the planet earth

01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:26.000
and you see all my sources where
the illustrations came from.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.800
Thank you.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:37.810
[ Applause ]

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:43.930
And if you have questions
feel free to ask them.

01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:46.250
Is there?

01:03:46.250 --> 01:04:14.670
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: We have
about five minutes of tape left,

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:16.910
so it will be five minutes of Q&amp;A

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:18.820
and then [inaudible] will
stick around and [inaudible].

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.120
&gt;&gt; Sibylle Machat: Sure.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.820
&gt;&gt; You mentioned [inaudible] you
mentioned about [inaudible] talk

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.670
about how the American [inaudible].

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:26.750
&gt;&gt; Sibylle Machat: Okay, I
can say something about this,

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:30.380
but this might not
be my final answer.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.860
So something I want to actually do

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:41.710 position:56%
for my project I'm learning Russian
right now and I want to go to Moscow

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:45.400
to look at the children's
book archive and after

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:49.080
that I will have a
much bigger answer.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.490
But from what I've seen so far
is the art style is of course,

01:04:51.490 --> 01:04:57.350
very different, clouds show
up around the same time.

01:04:57.350 --> 01:05:02.360
So we have a strange parallel in
the presence and absence of clouds,

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:05.640
but again we have a focus
that is far less on Russia

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.130
which is something I found
really, really interesting.

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:14.640
And at first I thought is Russia
maybe too big to fit on the earth,

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.360
but it's not true if you look

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.380
at the globe you can
actually see all of Russia.

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:24.000
But they frequently focus on
either the North Pole so looking

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.360
at the earth kind of from above,

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.660
but it tilted a little more
towards Russia than straight north.

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.820
Or they show the western
part and Europe,

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:34.460
Europe and then the western part of
Russia, that's what I found so far.

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.040
The text -- I have
a friend in Germany

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:40.630
who helped me translate some
things because he's a translator

01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:43.920
and the text I haven't
really looked at

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.770
yet because my Russian
isn't good enough yet.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:58.610
But I hope to come back to you
with an answer because I thought

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:06.580
if I'm looking at American books
wouldn't it be super interesting

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:09.010
to look at both space
powers and do that.

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:10.390
And I've looked at
some German books,

01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:12.200
I've looked at some British books,

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.990
but if I look at those then you can
just say aren't you being arbitrary

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:19.370
why aren't you looking
at French books

01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:21.800 position:56%
and Spanish books and Chinese books.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:26.120
So I said no, the two space
powers is what I really want

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.420
to write about.

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.900
So my project has kind of grown.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:35.460
&gt;&gt; It appeared that there were
suddenly an abundance of books

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:38.490
in the 1930's, what
would account for that?

01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:42.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sibylle Machat: I think from what
I found it's really only the 40's.

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:45.370
I showed you the examples
I found in the 30's,

01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:48.260
but these are actually some
of the only books I found

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:53.060
in the 30's whereas in the 40's
and 50's I really had to choose.

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.420
And I think the sort of what
accounts for it is for the lack

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:56.940
of books on the one
hand is that there are

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.860
so many books about airplanes.

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:00.290 position:56%
So if you want to write books for --

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:04.240
adventure books for boys
they're all about aviation.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.150 position:56%
I've looked at so many aviation
books which then have modern planes,

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.450
the new planes that will be
invented, adventures in planes,

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:13.720
going to the North Pole in
planes, going here in planes,

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.020
famous people who flew planes.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.320
Really there are so many
of those, but then I think

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.620
with the development of technology

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:18.920
and with the first
rockets being invented

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.220
by the Germans during the second
world war and these then coming

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:21.520
to the states that's sort

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.820
of when people realized
it might become realistic

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.120
that we can go into space.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.420 position:56%
And that's when you really see
these books taking off and certainly

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.720
after 1952, 53, 54, that's where
most of my books really start.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.020
Which is actually kind of
late for me, I want to do ones

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:29.320
from before we have
photographs of the earth,

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.640 position:56%
before we have the pictures of the
clouds, when there aren't that many.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.050
It's after we have the first
photographs and the V2s go

01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:33.580
into space and take these
pictures and people start writing

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.880
about [inaudible] and
Huntsville and all of that

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.180
and then Cape Canaveral
slash Cape Kennedy later,

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:37.980
that's when the books really,
really start appearing.

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:59.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.690
&gt;&gt; Sibylle Machat: That is
a very, very good question.

01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:04.630
Of the picture books that I have
found here there hasn't been any

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:08.210
earth, but negative evidence
is not complete evidence.

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:12.570
So to be able to say I
really can't find any earth

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:15.410
in the British children's books I
need to go to the British library

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:17.810
and look at the early
British children's books.

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:20.930
And then all I can say
is that in the books

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.420
that are here there is
no picture of the earth,

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:27.090
but on the one hand I focused
on American children's books

01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:29.620
so I didn't spend a lot of time
at the British children's book.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:32.940
I more went this is kind of
interesting I wonder what's in them

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:35.370
as I found out when
the first pictures

01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:37.170
of the earth start appearing.

01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:41.360
And yeah, as I said, it's
just me saying that there's

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.360
at least one swan in England,
which is white on one side rather

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.020
than saying all swans in
England are white okay.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:51.510

we'll stop there [inaudible].

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.670
So I think Sibylle will stick

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:03.620 position:56%
around for a few more minutes she
has a few books that she has brought

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.640
in for people to look at and she
can answer a few more questions.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.520
The Kluge Center is on break with
our programming until October,

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.710
at which point we have a
number of lectures coming up.

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:14.650
So please do sign our
list on the way out

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:19.490
and thank you again for coming.
