00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.820
In the virtualized set up the hypervisor sits

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.410
between the guest operating system and the hardware.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.090
So the picture gets a little bit complicated.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.950
Inside each one of these operating systems of

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.600
course they use a level processes and each

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.240
process is in its own protection domain. What

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.650
that means is that in each of these

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.090
operating systems, there is a distinct page table

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.490
that the operating system maintains on behalf of the processes that are running

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.730
in that operating system, similarly in this case. Does the hypervisor

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.790
know about the page tables maintained on behalf

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.780
of the processes that are running in each one of these individual operating

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.100
systems? The answer is no. Windows and Linux are simply protection

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.740
domains distinct from one another so far as the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.450
hypervisor is concerned. The fact that each of Windows

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.080
and Linux within them contain application of a processes

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.300
is something that the hypervisor doesn't know about at all.
