JOSH LIVNI: Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.220
Welcome to this week's edition
of Maps Shortcuts.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.020
My name's Josh Livni, and this
is our first Maps Shortcuts

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.620
after Google I/O 2013.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.100
So for those of you who were
at Google I/O or maybe

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.280
watching it around the world on
one of the live streams or

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.410
the follow-up videos, I just
want to let you know that we

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.170
do have a new refreshed look
and feel for Google Maps.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.710
So if you go to maps.google.com,
maybe you

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.600
already have an invitation,
maybe you're already in, or

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.830
you can request an invitation
and see what is really an

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.720
amazing experience.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.360
And what I want to talk to you
about today is how we're

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.740
integrating that into the API
for you guys, the developers,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.330
to sort of get the same look and
feel all of the new Google

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.110
Maps into your websites.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.000
So on our Geo Developers Blog,
we have a post outlining a lot

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.870
of details which you might
find interesting.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.390
The key here is the code,
which I'll get into in a

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.520
second how you set it.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.150
And there's just a one line
piece of code that you can add

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.130
to your website.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.670
And what will happen is you get
the look and feel of the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.430
new tiles and the refreshed look
of the new Google Maps on

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.560
your API site.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.690
So before I go into the details
there, I also want to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.840
point out a refreshed look and
feel we have for our maps site

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.396
on developers.google.com.

00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:26.580
So if you go to
developers.google.com/maps,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.780
you'll see our new page.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.380
Check it out.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.320
It's quite nice.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.800
And the first thing I want to
point out is we have a new job

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.560
site, so go to the
job site here.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.190
We can see if you're interested
in working here.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.520
We have a lot of open positions
and a lot of super

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.660
exciting teams.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.480
Some of them we talked about in
some detail, what the teams

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.110
are doing, at Google
I/O. So check out

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.460
those YouTube videos.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.050
And the point here is, if you go
through the instructions to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.250
send in a resume packet,
following pretty simple

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.620
guidelines here, it'll go
straight to the Maps team, and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.690
we'll take a look.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.370
It's a little bit different than
if you're applying for a

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.520
job at Google generally, and
it might go to all of the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.070
potential teams, which
is also great.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.650
But if you're interested in Maps
specifically, check out

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.280
this job site.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.690
So the second thing I want to
go into is how do you enable

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.830
this visual refresh
on your site?

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.590
And if we go to our
documentation here for our

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.750
JavaScript API under the
Developer's Guide, go to our

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.790
basic concepts.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.700
We've added a new section
at the top

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.580
for the visual refresh.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.440
So you can see on the left and
right a slightly different

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.560
look and feel between
these maps.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.320
I'll get into the details of
that a little bit more.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.970
The point here is to enable the
visual refresh, all you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.800
need to do is set
google.maps.visualrefresh

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.440
equals true at some point in
your JavaScript before you

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.870
instantiate and render
the map.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.580
So as long as you set that
parameter to be true, we'll

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.600
have all of the map tiles and so
forth with the new look and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.290
feel for your page,
so super easy.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.080
OK, let's get into some of
the details of what the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.970
differences are between the
old and the new feel.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.560
So here's the new look
and feel of my

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.380
old hometown of Seattle.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.840
And one thing you'll notice, as
I zoom out, this cool site

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.960
that our friends at Ubilabs
put together.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.840
It's really simple, kind of
mouse over, mouse out.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.430
You can see the look and feel
of change as you in and out.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.820
So thanks to the Ubilabs
guys for that.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.180
I'll just give you a
quick example of

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.290
some different areas.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.640
If we zoom in, some of the most
obvious things we can see

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.880
is the water color changes
slightly, the icons change.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.760
Overall, the colors are just
kind of cleaner, and it's a

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.000
more clean look and
feel in general.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.930
Some of the other
details are--

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.640
especially for you guys
developing websites, we've

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.740
gotten rid of almost
all of the shadows.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.830
So if you bring up an info
window with the new look and

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.750
feel, you're not going to see
any shadows below that, and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.740
the code that you have
specifically on the shadows

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.610
panel will be ignored.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.920
Some of the other things
are the default

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.880
marker is slightly different.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.270
Obviously, we have new fonts
and icons, slightly new

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.140
colors, and new controls.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.970
So as I zoom in and out and
you look at the controls,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.380
you'll see some subtle
differences where we matched,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.990
again, the look and feel of the
maps at google.com site.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.380
So a couple other things, just
to note, is if you're using

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.980
static maps, so you can
also use the new

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.240
visual refresh look.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.000
So here is the standard static
maps, again of Seattle, and if

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.850
I just change the URL to add
visual refresh equals true,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.980
I'll go ahead and get
the new maps.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.900
So go ahead and play around
with new look and feel.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.110
We think it's a super
nice UI design.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.420
And again, we have some talks at
Google I/O you can look at

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.000
to see in detail some of the
things that went into making

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.280
this new tiles.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.380
And the very last thing I just
wanted to mention is that

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.870
we'll be changing the look and
feel by default for you guys.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.350
So right now, you have
to manually opt in.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.460
Starting on August 15 when we
put out our next version of

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.590
the Maps API, this new look and
feel will be the default

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.360
for our experimental branch.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.220
So if you load your JavaScript
with experimental, then we

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.170
will be pushing this out
to all of you by

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.980
default on August 15.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.930
And then three months later
when we put out the next

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.710
version, it will be the default
look and feel for our

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.660
default branch.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.185
So mid November, you should
expect if you're using our

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.590
default branch, you'll
also get it.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.260
So we definitely recommend you
guys check it out early.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.460
Check out the experimental
branch after August.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.330
Or for now, please go ahead and
play around with it, give

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.000
us feedback.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.130
And we look forward to seeing
lots more sites with the new

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.300
look and feel.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.910
Thanks a lot, see you
guys in a week.
