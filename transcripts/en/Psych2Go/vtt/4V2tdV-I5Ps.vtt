00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.960
Along with communication problems, negative

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.275
and insecure thoughts are also roots of broken

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:18.545
relationships.While it's crucial for both

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:21.535
partners to listen to each other and to reflect on their partners' ends,

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:24.575
they also need to be open about any underlying thoughts

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.300
they may be keeping to themselves.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.700
Although most issues need time to be resolved, the first step is

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.605
to be aware of the way you think about your partner. As there are some

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:35.600
thoughts that can destroy relationships. For example,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.820
One: "They don't love me anymore."

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.680
It's reasonable to worry when your significant other

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.540
begins to invest less time into your relationship.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.560
But constantly asking for confirmation of their feelings can (cause) conflict.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.960
If you're always asking, "do you really love me?"

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.100
your partner may start to wonder if there is cause for concern.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.080
In fact, your concerns may turn into reality

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.620
if your partner begins to feel overwhelmed by your constant need to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.740
validate your relationship. Instead of jumping to conclusions,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.240
communicate the feelings you have and work together to become closer.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.020
Two: "They should..."

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.780
It's toxic to believe your significant other should automatically

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.180
know what you're thinking.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.320
No one has the power to read minds.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.200
Thinking, "she should know how much it bothers me when she leaves my side at parties,"

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.620
Or "he should know today's important to me"

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.060
isn't very fair to your partner when you've never actually discussed these feelings with them.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.340
Instead of feeling disappointed, or pretending you're okay,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.560
communicate your frustrations to your partner.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.640
Three: "It's their fault."

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.180
It's easy to point fingers and blame the other person when you're upset,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.020
but thinking "it's his fault I'm having a bad day!"

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.955
or "it's her fault we're in this mess!"

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:43.645
will only worsen your relationship. Instead,

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:45.785
try to take some responsibility for the situation.

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:48.855
And, if you find that you upset your partner as well,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.285
make an apology. Which may in-turn influence them

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:53.960
to apologise too. We can't predict or control

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.520
what happens in a relationship, but we can control

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.060
how we react towards negative situations.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.780
Four: Overthinking.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.680
It's not fair to your partner when you jump to conclusions about them that aren't based on real

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.360
evidence.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.640
Such as assuming they're having an affair when they come home late from work.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.360
Even though they tell you it's because they had to work overtime.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.340
It's important to see your significant other for who they are

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.980
and learn not to blow little things out of proportion.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.240
Five: Less than perfect.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.500
When you start to compare your significant other to your ideal partner,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.420
you're placing unrealistic expectations on them.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.180
Even comparing them to your friend's partner or your old partner

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.620
can be harmful.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.080
It's important to respect who your current partner is, and understand that they're

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.240
not perfect.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.160
If there's qualities or traits you admire in someone else,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.420
just let your partner know what they did and find out if it's something they're willing to change.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.300
Six: "I wish..."

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.640
Sometimes on bad days you mind find yourself fantasising

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.100
what it would be like to be with someone else.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.220
If you frequently have these thoughts,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.240
you'll prioritise those possibilities over your current relationship.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.540
Relationships aren't smooth or easy

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.260
and changing partners won't prevent you from

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.340
experiencing similar conflicts in your new relationship.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.815
Remember, there's a difference between a relationship that will never work out

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.420
and a relationship that could grow with extra effort.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.400
Seven: All or nothing.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.080
You might see your partner as someone who can do no right or no wrong,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.860
thinking they can always or never make you happy.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.220
To make sure you're not having such extreme thoughts,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.760
establish a safe, stable ground that the two of you can exist on.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.460
Learn to take in your partner's mistakes, failures and accomplishments

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.580
in moderation,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.200
without seeing those elements as all-defining.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.620
It'll prevent you from putting your partner on a pedestal,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.240
or only focusing on negative traits.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.700
Eight: Labelling.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.240
Label-slinging occurs when you generalise who your partner is.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.800
For example, you might call your partner lazy for leaving a few dishes around.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.060
Although it's common to see the worst of your partners on bad days,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.780
if you're constantly labelling them,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.220
it becomes harder for you to focus on their positive sides

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.060
and prevents you from helping them grow out of bad habits.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.400
They may even feel as though they'll only ever amount to that label,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.500
letting little room for improvement.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.820
Nine: Playing head games.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.820
If power struggles start to affect you,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.435
you may have thoughts about trying to out-smart your partner

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.760
or gain the upper hand in the relationship.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.840
You'll believe your partner has ulterior motives, and try to gain a favour from you.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.140
Although power struggles usually only come after the intitial stages of

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.640
romance and attraction,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.560
they need to be overcome in order for a relationship to grow and last.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.700
You must relinquish your desire for power and drive for real happiness.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.940
Ten: "What happened to us?"

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.820
Married couples often think this, as their relationship changes over time.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.860
It's normal to reminisce, but try not to look back.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.000
Couples often forget that there's more to look forward to

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.780
when they think their relationship won't be as exciting in the future,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.460
robbing the relationship of its' full potential.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.020
Relationships are constantly evolving,

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.180
but that doesn't mean they can't be as exciting as they were in the beginning.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.000
And those are ten thoughts that couples potentially run into in a relationship.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.860
Have you experienced any of them in one of your relationships?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.100
What do you think we can do to overcome them?

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.240
