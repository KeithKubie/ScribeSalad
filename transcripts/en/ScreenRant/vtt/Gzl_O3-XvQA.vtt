00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.679
Have you ever found yourself watching a new
movie when suddenly, you're hit with a serious

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.030
case of deja vu?

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.910
Hollywood recycles movie plots and twists
every year, but the places the films are set

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.160
can be even easier to spot. But really, when
you find a perfect set, why waste it on just

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.410
one movie?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.099
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Movies That Stole
Their Sets From Other Films.

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.480
Mr. and Mrs. Smith (20th Century Fox)

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.489
Some sets being reused can be explained by
studios or producers who find one spot to

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.399
fit the bill, but sometimes, a single location
becomes the go-to set for dozens of films.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.320
If you've seen Mr and Mrs Smith - or just
about any movie set in Los Angeles, you've

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.379
probably seen The Quality Cafe. It's hard
to know if studios all got in on the same

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.079
joke or the diner was just the perfect fit,
but movies like Seven, Gone in 60 Seconds,

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.590
Training Day, Catch Me If You Can, and too
many others to count have set scenes inside

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.840
the diner. 500 Days of Summer and Old School
even recreated one shot perfectly. The diner

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.900
has been closed for years, making more money
from films these days than food.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.330
Batman (Warner Bros.)

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.060
When Aliens director James Cameron needed
an alien-infested space colony right here

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.590
on Earth, he found it in the disused Acton
Lane Power Station in West London. The building

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.390
had to be stripped of toxic materials and
painted silver, but it did the job. Just a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.530
few years later, Tim Burton decided it was
the perfect place to create his Joker, finding

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.390
the Aliens sets still intact, and redressing
it to create Axis Chemical Works for his Batman

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.159
movie. Take a close look at some of the catwalks
and stairways and you can see the Joker walking

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.439
the same steps as Ellen Ripley just years
apart.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.990
Star Trek Into Darkness (Paramount)

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.750
The Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills may
have been built by an oil tycoon in 1928,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.460
but once it was made into a city park in 1971,
its life as a Hollywood regular began. The

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.450
mansion's checkerboard floors have stood out
in The Big Lebowski, There Will Be Blood and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.470
The Muppets Movie, and the hallways, gardens
and massive staircase have been used in dozens

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.930
of films and TV shows. But the cleverest use
came in Star Trek Into Darkness, when the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.280
mansion was given a CG makeover as a futuristic
London hospital.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.680
Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (Paramount)

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.850
You would think that finding a huge, centuries
old mansion in England wouldn't be hard, so

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.709
it's unclear why Lara Croft shares a house
with a DC Comics billionaire. The Hatfield

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.379
House is one go-to location for the movie
wealthy, with its Long Gallery used in the

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.730
modern Sherlock Holmes films not long after
Lara Croft walked through the same spot in

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.370
Tomb Raider. In Tim Burton's Batman, fans
can get a view of the hallway from the opposite

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.610
side, not to mention a look at the exact same
library used in both films.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.610
X-Men (20th Century Fox)

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.319
Long before superheroes were Hollywood staples,
Marvel fans saw the mutant X-Men remained

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.980
for the big screen. The movie had plenty of
milestone moments, but the appearance of Charles

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.260
Xavier's school for gifted youngsters is chief
among them. X-Men fans may appreciate the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.500
scene even more when they realize it's the
same mansion Adam Sandler chased an imaginary

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.310
penguin around in Billy Madison. The movies
don't have much in common aside from the mansion

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.810
in Ontario Canada, but it does explain who
owned the school before Charles took.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.870
Speed (20th Century Fox)

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.629
Every movie buff knows that Die Hard turned
to the real-world Fox Plaza for its tower

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.599
of destruction, but the studio's corporate
headquarters weren't limited to just one blockbuster

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.489
film role. The tower's distinctive lobby was
used for the opening sequence of Speed, when

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.750
Keanu Reeves rushed past the spot where Hans
Gruber's gang made their last stand on his

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.010
way to save an elevator full of office workers.
The lobby would make a less-epic cameo in

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.730
the comedy Airheads, all released by 20th
Century Fox.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.730
The Artist (Warner Bros./Weinstein Company)

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.870
With a story set around 1930, it made sense
for The Artist to feature a scene set on and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.909
around an eye-catching staircase that is clearly
the mark of old-world ingenuity. But the stairs

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.080
should look familiar. They belong to the famous
Bradbury Building, one of the oldest office

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.330
buildings in Los Angeles, and a recognized
Historical Landmark. Over the years, the interior

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.019
was most famously used for one eerie, shadow-filled
set in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. And its

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.849
appearance in the final scene of 500 Days
of Summer shows a movie doesn't need to be

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.299
a sci-fi or period drama to add some extra
flair.

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.299
The Mask (New Line Cinema)

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.220
It was part of the charm of the original Ghostbusters
that they chose a decommissioned Fire Hall

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.480
for their base of operations, with a very
real New York City building used for its exteriors.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.299
For the interior of their building, though,
a fire hall in Los Angeles did the trick.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.129
Apparently its appearance in both supernatural
comedies gave it a taste for fame, since its

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.060
unmistakable architecture was later used for
an auto shop in The Mask, starring Jim Carrey.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.660
The movies may not be seen as equals these
days, but it's nice to know the hall didn't

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.519
close up shop along with the Ghostbusters.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.519
Star Trek (Paramount)

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.080
Is it still a "set" if it's millions of years
old?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.490
Either way, the Vasquez Rocks are about as
famous as a movie or TV location can get.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.009
The California rock formation named for the
outlaw who used them as hiding place were

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.080
used to add some character to desert scenes
since the 1930s. But when the jagged rocks

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.729
appeared in the now-infamous episode of Star
Trek where Kirk traded blows with a "Gorn,"

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.449
they took on a life of their own. The rocks
would be used in the likes of Blazing Saddles,

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.570
Army of Darkness, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike
Back, a movie packed with dozens of geek references.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.639
But J.J. Abrams took the cake when he used
the so-called "Gorn Rocks" to create the entire

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.090
landscape of the planet Vulcan in his 2009
reboot.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.090
Daredevil (Marvel/Netflix)

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.620
The Netflix series following Marvel's "man
without fear" was the Daredevil story fans

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.990
had always hoped for, and there were even
a few hints that the blind hero was soaring

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.729
over the same New York rooftops as Spider-Man.
They haven't teamed up in live-action as much

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.690
as they have in the comics, but in one episode
of Daredevil, Wilson Fisk meets one of his

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.789
fellow crime bosses in a familiar spot. The
rooftop garden in the heart of Manhattan was

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.470
the same spot where Peter Parker dropped Mary
Jane off in the first Spider-Man movie. If

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.669
you ask us, that's all the hint of a team-up
we need to start hoping.

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:24.669
