00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:02.686
- "Theodore and Claire
were each asked to factor

00:00:02.686 --> 00:00:06.006
"the term 24 x to the
fifth as the product of

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.608
"two monomials.

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.466
"Their responses are shown below."

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.950
So Theodore factored 24 x to the fifth

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.947
as being equal to eight x third, times

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:16.408
three x squared, and Claire factored

00:00:16.408 --> 00:00:19.229
24 x to the fifth as being equal to four x

00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:21.481
times six x to the fourth.

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.921
And then they ask us,
"Which of the students

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:26.624
"factored 24 x to the fifth correctly?"

00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:28.319
So I encourage you,
pause the video and see

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.747
if you can figure this out.

00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:32.707
Which of them factored it correctly?

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:34.959
All right, now let's
first look at Theodore.

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:37.687
So he factored it into
these two monomials,

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:39.986
eight x to the third and three x squared.

00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:41.483
Well, let's just see,
if we were to multiply

00:00:41.483 --> 00:00:44.397
these two things, do we
get 24 x to the fifth?

00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:48.101
So if you multiply eight times three,

00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:50.538
you do indeed get 24.

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:52.048
And then all you have to do is multiply

00:00:52.048 --> 00:00:56.412
the x terms, or the powers of x.

00:00:56.412 --> 00:00:59.024
You have x to the third times x squared,

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:02.056
that indeed does equal x to the fifth.

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:04.666
So Theodore did factor
it correctly, this is

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.011
one factorization, I guess you would say,

00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:08.613
of 24 x to the fifth.

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:10.273
Now let's look at Claire.

00:01:10.273 --> 00:01:13.384
So Claire, if we were
taking just the coefficient,

00:01:13.384 --> 00:01:17.808
four times six is indeed equal to 24.

00:01:17.808 --> 00:01:19.886
And then if we were to
look at the powers of x

00:01:19.886 --> 00:01:22.265
we have x to the first power here, times

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:24.471
x to the fourth power,
which is going to be

00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:25.841
x to the fifth power.

00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:28.732
So Claire also factored it correctly.

00:01:28.732 --> 00:01:30.508
And this just goes to
show you that there's

00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:33.201
more than one possible factorization of

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:36.405
a monomial like 24 x to the fifth.

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:37.404
I could come up with another one.

00:01:37.404 --> 00:01:39.307
I could write something like

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:42.790
24 x to the fifth, I could say that

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.147
that is 12 x,

00:01:48.368 --> 00:01:51.687
to the third, times, what
would have to be left?

00:01:51.687 --> 00:01:55.750
12 times two is 24, so two x squared.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.643
That's another possible factorization.

00:01:57.643 --> 00:02:00.104
So clearly there's more than one way

00:02:00.104 --> 00:02:04.161
to factor this monomial
into two other monomials.
