00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.987
(players chanting)

00:00:01.987 --> 00:00:03.131
- There's always pressure,

00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:06.048
it's just, when do you tune it out?

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.765
Come on, I want you guys to go over it.

00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:09.598
Counter, no counter?

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:11.574
It's not about what you're doing,

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:14.901
it's about how you're doing it.

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:16.897
So, whether that be me studying film,

00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:19.065
applying to colleges, or
just studying for a test

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:21.560
like the SAT, it all
comes from your practice,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.906
which you've been doing before.

00:00:23.906 --> 00:00:26.159
We've done this hundreds of times,

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.492
ran this thousands of times.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.862
The phrase that we use,
"Practice how we play,"

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:34.612
that's pretty much our slogan,

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:37.588
whether we're on the
field or off the field.

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:40.339
It all starts now, so
working little by little

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.099
to get to that goal, and we
practice, practice, practice

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:45.170
so that when the game comes along,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.080
you already know what to expect.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.452
You just know what you're going to do.

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:50.979
You can go out any day
and do the same thing

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.646
over and over, and it'll happen.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.226
