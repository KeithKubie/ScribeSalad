00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
People have this weird urge to comment on my race

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.680
So what exactly are you?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.440
Um, well I'm Japanese, Hawaiian, Filipino

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.700
Woah, you are way too Asian

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.680
English, German, Spanish, French, Irish

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.000
Wow, you are not Asian enough

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.120
It's especially weird when they say

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.340
You're white washed

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.200
The only legit example of "white washed" I can think of is Hollywood

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.460
Like when somehow Emma Stone classifed as a Chinese Hawaiian woman

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.140
Or when "The Martian" took all of its Asian and Indian roles from the book

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.980
And gave it to white and black actors

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.400
Or when, fun fact, the script for the live action version of "Mulan" completely did away with Li Shang

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.480
And introduced a Roman dude

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.900
Hey Hollywood!

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.840
Stop.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.920
You're embarrassing yourself

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.900
My problem with calling a person of color "white washed"

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.600
is that it heavily implies that that person isn't meeting their ethnic stereotypes.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.020
Oh... I'm not very good at math

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.060
Oh, yeah you don't have to lie.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.040
I'm not here just to copy your homework, I actually like you

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.620
Now, solve for x.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.740
People are products of their environment

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.700
So unless you are surrounded by your heritage growing up

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.540
You're more likely to be a product of where you are and who you're with

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.100
Uh yeah, I just gotta warn you, Anna's a little..... um... different

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.960
Uh, different how?

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.640
She was raised by wolves.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.280
[Very long howl]

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.020
[Sigh] She's so wolf-washed

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.220
Saying that someone isn't "Asian enough," "black enough," "Indian enough," "Hispanic enough", whatever enough

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.220
is basically saying that they don't represent your idea of what the color of their skin means.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.920
I asked a bunch of people on Twitter if they'd ever been called "white washed," and why?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.440
And I noticed a bunch of the same reasons popping up

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.020
Their food preferences weren't in line with their culture

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.620
They didn't speak the native tongue

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.700
Or they simply hung out with people outside of their own race.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.560
Can we please agree, people, that race does not define who you are or where you're from

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.300
And to make assumptions about a person based on those stereotypes

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.140
And then to throw slurs at them when they don't fulfill that idea of who you think they should be?

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.540
That's rude

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.940
I'm Anna Akana.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.260
Stay awesome, Gotham

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.640

Squarespace, stuff that dreams are made of

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.580
Should I believe in God, and if so, which one should I believe in?

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.760
You know, should I believe in the traditional, Western version of God

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.440
Where he's this omnipotent dude who sits in the sky

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.429
And watches everything that I do, because he's got a subscription to me?
