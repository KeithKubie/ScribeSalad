a hydraulic models they do one on line
 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.969
a hydraulic models they do one on line
one offline and what we found in that is

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979
one offline and what we found in that is
 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.680
one offline and what we found in that is
that people tend to do the same thing so

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690
that people tend to do the same thing so
 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.719
that people tend to do the same thing so
the people who are extroverted and have

their everyday life having said that

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330
their everyday life having said that
 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.820
their everyday life having said that
there's a couple of interesting things

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830
there's a couple of interesting things
 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.870
there's a couple of interesting things
is that is that people don't really know

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880
is that is that people don't really know
 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.370
is that is that people don't really know
how they're viewed on the basis of their

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380
how they're viewed on the basis of their
 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.070
how they're viewed on the basis of their
spaces so one of the things we've looked

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080
spaces so one of the things we've looked
 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.170
spaces so one of the things we've looked
at is is whether people project a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180
at is is whether people project a
 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.490
at is is whether people project a
accurate view of themselves or they

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500
accurate view of themselves or they
 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.920
accurate view of themselves or they
project an inflated positive view of

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930
project an inflated positive view of
 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.880
project an inflated positive view of
themselves because we thought well maybe

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890
themselves because we thought well maybe
 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.860
themselves because we thought well maybe
people are using these more like a sort

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870
people are using these more like a sort
 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.390
people are using these more like a sort
of a personal website in order to

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400
of a personal website in order to
 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.520
of a personal website in order to
promote themselves or are they really

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530
promote themselves or are they really
 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.890
promote themselves or are they really
just using it as a way of communicating

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900
just using it as a way of communicating
 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.539
just using it as a way of communicating
more like the telephone are they just

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549
more like the telephone are they just
 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.250
more like the telephone are they just
using it as another way of living out

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260
using it as another way of living out
 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.130
using it as another way of living out
their lives and so how we tested that

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140
their lives and so how we tested that
 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.169
their lives and so how we tested that
was we got people to observe people on

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
was we got people to observe people on
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.729
was we got people to observe people on
the basis of their Facebook profiles and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739
the basis of their Facebook profiles and
 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.170
the basis of their Facebook profiles and
we compared that to how people really

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180
we compared that to how people really
 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.949
we compared that to how people really
saw themselves and also how they would

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959
saw themselves and also how they would
 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.050
saw themselves and also how they would
like to be and what we found there was

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060
like to be and what we found there was
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.449
like to be and what we found there was
that people the impressions people get

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459
that people the impressions people get
 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.580
that people the impressions people get
of you based on your profile and they

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590
of you based on your profile and they
 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.960
of you based on your profile and they
know nothing else about you but just

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970
know nothing else about you but just
 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.530
know nothing else about you but just
based on your profile match much more

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540
based on your profile match much more
 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.270
based on your profile match much more
closely with how you really see yourself

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280
closely with how you really see yourself
 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.990
closely with how you really see yourself

not trying but one of the interesting
 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.620
not trying but one of the interesting
things which would make it a real

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630
things which would make it a real
 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.540
things which would make it a real

we which are nonlinear so people are
seen as more and more positive if they

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
seen as more and more positive if they
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.740
seen as more and more positive if they
have for example a large number of

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750
have for example a large number of
 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.320
have for example a large number of
friends and contacts if they have too

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330
friends and contacts if they have too
 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.750
friends and contacts if they have too
many then it's it then it's seen as it

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760
many then it's it then it's seen as it
 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.180

turned becomes become seen a negative

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190
turned becomes become seen a negative
 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.539
turned becomes become seen a negative
light so you so you have to control the

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549
light so you so you have to control the
 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.610
light so you so you have to control the
number of connections that you have but

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620
number of connections that you have but
 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.110
number of connections that you have but
I think one of the sort of the broader

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120
I think one of the sort of the broader
 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.289
I think one of the sort of the broader
point is you have to kind of realize

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299
point is you have to kind of realize
 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.330
point is you have to kind of realize
that you can't really control these

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340
that you can't really control these
 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.470
that you can't really control these
things I mean I think most of the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480
things I mean I think most of the
 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.280
things I mean I think most of the
technologies that we've had you know

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290
technologies that we've had you know
 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.960
technologies that we've had you know
probably since industrialization you as

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970
probably since industrialization you as
 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.029
probably since industrialization you as
we used to live in tiny groups of people

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039
we used to live in tiny groups of people
 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.159
we used to live in tiny groups of people
and we'd know everyone in our group we

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169
and we'd know everyone in our group we
 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.930
and we'd know everyone in our group we
and we wouldn't have this idea of having

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940
and we wouldn't have this idea of having
 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.750
and we wouldn't have this idea of having
a work self and a social self and a

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760
a work self and a social self and a
 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.689
a work self and a social self and a
relationship self and even you know sub

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699
relationship self and even you know sub
 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.430
relationship self and even you know sub
cells within those would you just be the

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440
cells within those would you just be the
 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.010
cells within those would you just be the
person everyone would know you from all

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020
person everyone would know you from all
 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.270
person everyone would know you from all
of those contacts when we lived in small

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280
of those contacts when we lived in small
 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.170
of those contacts when we lived in small
groups then then when you when you start

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180
groups then then when you when you start
 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.480
groups then then when you when you start
having a life where you have to leave

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490
having a life where you have to leave
 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.040
having a life where you have to leave
and you go to work and you have people

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050
and you go to work and you have people
 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.510
and you go to work and you have people
who know your work who don't know your

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520
who know your work who don't know your
 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.550
who know your work who don't know your
home you begin to segment these things

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560
home you begin to segment these things
 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.260
home you begin to segment these things
up you have these different cells you

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270
up you have these different cells you
 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.360
up you have these different cells you
have this idea that you can go and be a

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370
have this idea that you can go and be a
 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.029
have this idea that you can go and be a
professional self and then that's

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039
professional self and then that's
 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.670
professional self and then that's
different and it doesn't matter that

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680
different and it doesn't matter that
 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.379
different and it doesn't matter that
that you behave in what some people

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389
that you behave in what some people
 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.150
that you behave in what some people
might think as a non-professional way at

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160
might think as a non-professional way at
 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.529
might think as a non-professional way at
home and so and I think until now all of

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539
home and so and I think until now all of
 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.029
home and so and I think until now all of
the technologies have increased the

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039
the technologies have increased the
 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.580
the technologies have increased the
segmentation they've made us go into

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590
segmentation they've made us go into
 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.980
segmentation they've made us go into
these different fields but now with with

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990
these different fields but now with with
 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.440
these different fields but now with with
the social networking sites that all

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450
the social networking sites that all
 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.300
the social networking sites that all
where we can't really control who looks

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310
where we can't really control who looks
 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.129
where we can't really control who looks
and we can control a bit but not that

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139
and we can control a bit but not that
 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.140
and we can control a bit but not that
much and when where people can look us

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150
much and when where people can look us
 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.969
much and when where people can look us
up on Google suddenly you're losing

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979
up on Google suddenly you're losing
 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.020
up on Google suddenly you're losing
control of that I think this is the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030
control of that I think this is the
 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.700
control of that I think this is the
first technology that's now beginning to

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710
first technology that's now beginning to
 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.730
first technology that's now beginning to
have reversed the trend so you can for

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740
have reversed the trend so you can for
 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.740
have reversed the trend so you can for
the first time you can now no longer

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750
the first time you can now no longer
 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.420
the first time you can now no longer
keep these things separate so I can

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430
keep these things separate so I can
 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.330
keep these things separate so I can
dress up in my suit and shirt and go in

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410
and teach my students at the University
 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.760

you know part of the thing that we have
 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.879
you know part of the thing that we have
to do is is sort of

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889
to do is is sort of
