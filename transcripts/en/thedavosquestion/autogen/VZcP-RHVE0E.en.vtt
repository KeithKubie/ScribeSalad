 In September, global business and political leaders will gather in Dalian, the northeastern city of China, to explore the economic recovery. 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.210
 Although the government’s economic stimulus plan can be urgently needed in the short term, 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.120
 The driving force behind the long-term “transformation” recovery of the global economy will come from entrepreneurship, innovation and technological advancement. 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.100
 The main force leading this economic recovery will be a new generation of leaders - the new leader, 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.120
 They will gather in the "Summer Davos" under the auspices of the World Economic Road Forum. 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.210
 However, the key issues are: 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.080
 “Can China lead us out of the economic crisis?” 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.090
 Can China be an important driving force to help the world economy emerge from the current recession? 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.090
 What's your opinion? 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.010
 You only need to vote in our survey, 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.240
 And upload your speech video to the network! 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.020
 Your video will be shown at the annual meeting of the New Champions in Dalian. 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.150
 We will call on the leaders to focus on responding to your video. 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.160
 Thank you!
