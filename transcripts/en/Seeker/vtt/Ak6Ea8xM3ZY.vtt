00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.150
If you thought Mondays were depressing, you're
absolutely right.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:10.500
Science has proven it.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.400
Hey guys Tara here for Dnews - with some harrowing
facts about suicide.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.480
A new study published in the Journal of Emergency
Medicine, finds that certain seasons, holidays,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.800
and days of the week are associated with a
higher number of suicide attempts.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.699
Poisoning is currently the #1 most common
method of attempted suicide in the U.S.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.809
So for this study, researchers examined over
a million calls classified as ''suspected

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.180
suicides" by the National Poison Database
System between 2006 and 2010.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.020
The results showed that the beginning of the
week, along with spring and fall, and New

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.289
Year's Day - were all associated with higher
numbers of ingestions with suicidal intent.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.210
For adults, Sundays and Mondays were the two
most common days of the week, while those

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.030
age 19 and under saw the biggest peak on Mondays
and Tuesdays.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.839
As for seasons, research has previously shown
that spring carries a higher number of attempted

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.089
suicides, but this study also found a correlation
between fall - noting significantly more attempted

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.280
suicides in those two seasons, than in the
summer and winter.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.909
New Year's Day also had a higher number of
incidents than any other holiday, with the

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.920
lowest amount occurring on Independence Day,
Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.780
It's unclear why more people attempt suicide
during these times, but one explanation offered

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.799
by the doctor who conducted this study, says
it's possible that people associate these

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.830
times with new beginnings, "but become disappointed
when their life circumstances remain unchanged."

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.439
She also found that nearly two-thirds of individuals
who commit suicide had contact with a physician

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.299
in the month before their death, while 43%
had been seen in an emergency department sometime

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.640
in the year before their death.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.390
This ties in with the fact that patients experiencing
suicidal thoughts on a Sunday, or on holidays

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.470
like New Year's Day, may have limited access
to doctors.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.150
And it further highlights the need for a 24-hour
help hotline, along with 24-hour clinics.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.289
It's pertinent to mention here that if you
or someone you know is experiencing suicidal

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.270
thoughts, there is a place to get help.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.270
Several, in fact.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.789
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is
open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week - and they

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.759
always have someone willing to listen and
talk.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.759
(800-273-TALK)

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.000
