go and but I think about a third of

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810
go and but I think about a third of
 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.559

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819
I think without those laws you'd have a
 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.240

very strong Green Party that would be a

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250
very strong Green Party that would be a
 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.540
very strong Green Party that would be a
real threat to the Democrats and I think

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550
real threat to the Democrats and I think
 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.970
real threat to the Democrats and I think
you'd have a small el Libertarian Party

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.260
the current Libertarian Party is that
would be real threat to the Republicans

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270
would be real threat to the Republicans
 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.440
would be real threat to the Republicans
and would attract a lot of independence

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450
and would attract a lot of independence
 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.250
and would attract a lot of independence
but it's it's difficult
