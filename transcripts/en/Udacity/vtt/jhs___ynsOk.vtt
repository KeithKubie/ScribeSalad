00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.885
So, in the first part of the quiz we have

00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:04.280
seen that the answer is wrong. The load doesn't get

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.050
the value from cache or memory. It gets it from

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.815
the store. So the second part of the quiz is, the

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:14.231
load gets its value from. A result broadcast. Put a

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:18.195
check mark here if this is correct. A reservation station.

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:21.708
Put a check mark here if that is correct. A

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:25.455
ROB entry. Put a check mark here if that is correct.

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:27.972
And an LSQ entry. Put a check mark if

00:00:27.972 --> 00:00:32.592
this is correct. Note that in different situations it might

00:00:32.592 --> 00:00:36.009
be possible that multiple answers are correct, so put check

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.200
marks for everywhere where we might get the value from.
