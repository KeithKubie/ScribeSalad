00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 align:start position:0%
so in this talk I want to tell you what
 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.460 align:start position:0%
so in this talk I want to tell you what
we've

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 align:start position:0%
we've
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
we've
and<00:02:13.890><c> also</c><00:02:14.310><c> how</c><00:02:14.670><c> we</c><00:02:14.730><c> were</c><00:02:14.940><c> managed</c><00:02:15.300><c> how</c><00:02:15.630><c> we</c>

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 align:start position:0%
and also how we were managed how we
 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.820 align:start position:0%
and also how we were managed how we
managed<00:02:16.050><c> to</c><00:02:16.080><c> leverage</c><00:02:16.590><c> causing</c><00:02:17.100><c> in</c><00:02:17.460><c> our</c><00:02:17.640><c> app</c>

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 align:start position:0%
managed to leverage causing in our app
 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.430 align:start position:0%
managed to leverage causing in our app
so<00:02:19.850><c> we</c><00:02:20.850><c> release</c><00:02:21.180><c> this</c><00:02:21.360><c> opinionated</c><00:02:22.170><c> guy</c><00:02:22.320><c> to</c>

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
so we release this opinionated guy to
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
so we release this opinionated guy to
the<00:02:22.680><c> of</c><00:02:22.770><c> architecture</c><00:02:23.610><c> but</c><00:02:24.120><c> if</c><00:02:24.330><c> you</c><00:02:24.480><c> read</c><00:02:24.660><c> it</c>

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 align:start position:0%
the of architecture but if you read it
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.900 align:start position:0%
the of architecture but if you read it
you'll<00:02:24.990><c> see</c><00:02:25.170><c> that</c><00:02:25.200><c> it's</c><00:02:25.890><c> also</c><00:02:26.070><c> still</c><00:02:26.580><c> quite</c>

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's also still quite
 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.050 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's also still quite
vague<00:02:27.330><c> so</c><00:02:27.930><c> we</c><00:02:28.080><c> have</c><00:02:28.320><c> these</c><00:02:28.620><c> like</c><00:02:28.980><c> main</c><00:02:29.370><c> classes</c>

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 align:start position:0%

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.910 align:start position:0%

some<00:02:30.360><c> idea</c><00:02:30.780><c> of</c><00:02:30.840><c> how</c><00:02:31.080><c> we</c><00:02:31.140><c> should</c><00:02:31.230><c> architect</c><00:02:31.770><c> our</c>

some idea of how we should architect our

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.250 align:start position:0%
app but we decided we want to create
some<00:02:34.770><c> clear</c><00:02:35.040><c> guidelines</c><00:02:35.640><c> so</c><00:02:36.330><c> we</c><00:02:36.480><c> defined</c><00:02:36.900><c> some</c>

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
some clear guidelines so we defined some
 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.980 align:start position:0%
some clear guidelines so we defined some

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 align:start position:0%
main types of classes in our app and we
 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.470 align:start position:0%
main types of classes in our app and we
also<00:02:40.170><c> define</c><00:02:40.680><c> a</c><00:02:40.710><c> set</c><00:02:41.010><c> of</c><00:02:41.040><c> rules</c><00:02:41.400><c> for</c><00:02:41.730><c> each</c><00:02:42.270><c> of</c>

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
also define a set of rules for each of
 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
also define a set of rules for each of
these<00:02:42.600><c> classes</c><00:02:42.960><c> so</c><00:02:43.710><c> let's</c><00:02:43.920><c> see</c><00:02:44.040><c> which</c><00:02:44.160><c> ones</c>

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
these classes so let's see which ones
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
these classes so let's see which ones
these<00:02:44.670><c> were</c><00:02:44.850><c> so</c><00:02:45.780><c> we</c><00:02:45.900><c> define</c><00:02:46.260><c> a</c><00:02:46.500><c> remote</c><00:02:47.100><c> data</c>

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 align:start position:0%
these were so we define a remote data
 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.850 align:start position:0%
these were so we define a remote data

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
on this so it would either do this and
 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.020 align:start position:0%
on this so it would either do this and
share<00:03:08.130><c> preferences</c><00:03:08.820><c> or</c><00:03:09.120><c> in</c><00:03:09.630><c> the</c><00:03:09.840><c> database</c>

share preferences or in the database
next<00:03:12.030><c> I</c><00:03:12.330><c> would</c><00:03:12.780><c> have</c><00:03:13.050><c> the</c><00:03:13.260><c> repository</c><00:03:13.980><c> whose</c>

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 align:start position:0%
next I would have the repository whose
 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.190 align:start position:0%
next I would have the repository whose
role<00:03:14.850><c> is</c><00:03:15.120><c> to</c><00:03:15.150><c> fetch</c><00:03:15.720><c> ants</c><00:03:16.440><c> and</c><00:03:16.860><c> store</c><00:03:17.370><c> data</c><00:03:17.400><c> and</c>

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
role is to fetch ants and store data and
 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.750 align:start position:0%
role is to fetch ants and store data and
optionally<00:03:19.200><c> it</c><00:03:19.380><c> could</c><00:03:19.650><c> also</c><00:03:19.920><c> do</c><00:03:20.280><c> in-memory</c>

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
optionally it could also do in-memory
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.330 align:start position:0%
optionally it could also do in-memory
cache<00:03:21.239><c> so</c><00:03:22.170><c> the</c><00:03:22.290><c> repository</c><00:03:22.950><c> will</c><00:03:23.100><c> be</c><00:03:23.190><c> the</c>

uh what's interesting in cotton is that

if you want to be able to extend the

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
class you have to mark it as open so
 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.550 align:start position:0%
class you have to mark it as open so
this<00:07:05.640><c> means</c><00:07:05.970><c> that</c><00:07:06.090><c> classes</c><00:07:06.780><c> are</c><00:07:06.930><c> final</c><00:07:07.410><c> by</c>

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
this means that classes are final by
 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.590 align:start position:0%
this means that classes are final by
default<00:07:07.950><c> and</c><00:07:08.190><c> you</c><00:07:08.340><c> have</c><00:07:08.520><c> to</c><00:07:08.670><c> be</c><00:07:08.790><c> intentional</c>

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 align:start position:0%
when using inheritance so this means
 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
when using inheritance so this means
that<00:07:12.690><c> cotton</c><00:07:13.260><c> really</c><00:07:13.530><c> supports</c><00:07:14.340><c> this</c><00:07:14.430><c> idea</c>

00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
you look at this code this is actually
 

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:55.550 align:start position:0%
you look at this code this is actually
not<00:11:52.230><c> enough</c><00:11:52.589><c> because</c><00:11:53.130><c> in</c><00:11:53.730><c> the</c><00:11:53.880><c> case</c><00:11:54.089><c> when</c><00:11:54.560><c> your</c>

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
not enough because in the case when your
 

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.910 align:start position:0%
not enough because in the case when your

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
device is offline this code will crash
 

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.190 align:start position:0%
device is offline this code will crash
so<00:11:58.920><c> what</c><00:11:59.070><c> we</c><00:11:59.190><c> actually</c><00:11:59.310><c> had</c><00:11:59.670><c> to</c><00:11:59.790><c> do</c><00:11:59.940><c> is</c><00:12:00.149><c> to</c><00:12:01.019><c> wrap</c>

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
so what we actually had to do is to wrap
 

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
so what we actually had to do is to wrap
every<00:12:01.680><c> request</c><00:12:02.040><c> inside</c><00:12:02.670><c> a</c><00:12:02.910><c> try-catch</c><00:12:03.510><c> and</c><00:12:03.959><c> we</c>

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:04.649 align:start position:0%
every request inside a try-catch and we
 

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:07.250 align:start position:0%
every request inside a try-catch and we
have<00:12:04.800><c> a</c><00:12:04.829><c> lot</c><00:12:05.070><c> of</c><00:12:05.100><c> requests</c><00:12:05.730><c> so</c><00:12:06.420><c> we</c><00:12:06.570><c> saw</c><00:12:06.810><c> that</c><00:12:07.050><c> we</c>

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
have a lot of requests so we saw that we
 

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.650 align:start position:0%
have a lot of requests so we saw that we
kept<00:12:07.470><c> on</c><00:12:07.649><c> adding</c><00:12:07.980><c> and</c><00:12:08.459><c> adding</c><00:12:08.700><c> this</c><00:12:09.029><c> try-catch</c>

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
kept on adding and adding this try-catch
 

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
kept on adding and adding this try-catch
everywhere<00:12:10.350><c> and</c><00:12:10.890><c> then</c><00:12:11.310><c> our</c><00:12:11.550><c> methods</c><00:12:11.970><c> were</c>

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.130 align:start position:0%
everywhere and then our methods were
 

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.610 align:start position:0%
everywhere and then our methods were
bolted<00:12:14.130><c> bloated</c><00:12:14.910><c> so</c><00:12:15.510><c> we</c><00:12:16.200><c> couldn't</c><00:12:16.380><c> really</c>

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
bolted bloated so we couldn't really
 

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.380 align:start position:0%
bolted bloated so we couldn't really
focus<00:12:17.130><c> on</c><00:12:17.310><c> what</c><00:12:17.490><c> really</c><00:12:17.730><c> mattered</c><00:12:18.180><c> on</c>

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:18.390 align:start position:0%
focus on what really mattered on
 

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.329 align:start position:0%
focus on what really mattered on
building<00:12:18.930><c> of</c><00:12:19.020><c> the</c><00:12:19.079><c> response</c><00:12:19.500><c> triggering</c><00:12:20.190><c> the</c>

00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:20.339 align:start position:0%
building of the response triggering the
 

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
building of the response triggering the
request<00:12:20.810><c> so</c><00:12:21.810><c> what</c><00:12:21.959><c> we</c><00:12:22.110><c> did</c><00:12:22.260><c> is</c><00:12:22.440><c> create</c><00:12:23.339><c> a</c>

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:23.370 align:start position:0%
request so what we did is create a
 

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
request so what we did is create a
top-level<00:12:23.850><c> function</c><00:12:24.540><c> so</c><00:12:25.110><c> this</c><00:12:25.380><c> would</c><00:12:25.560><c> be</c><00:12:25.649><c> a</c>

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
top-level function so this would be a
 

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.620 align:start position:0%
top-level function so this would be a
suspension<00:12:26.100><c> function</c><00:12:26.730><c> that</c><00:12:27.149><c> would</c><00:12:27.300><c> get</c><00:12:27.480><c> as</c><00:12:27.600><c> a</c>

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:27.630 align:start position:0%
suspension function that would get as a
 

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.260 align:start position:0%
suspension function that would get as a
parameter<00:12:27.899><c> a</c><00:12:28.200><c> suspending</c><00:12:28.770><c> lambda</c><00:12:29.190><c> and</c><00:12:29.399><c> the</c>

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:30.270 align:start position:0%
parameter a suspending lambda and the
 

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.420 align:start position:0%
parameter a suspending lambda and the
error<00:12:30.450><c> message</c><00:12:30.680><c> so</c><00:12:31.680><c> here</c><00:12:32.040><c> it</c><00:12:32.279><c> would</c><00:12:32.399><c> just</c>

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:32.430 align:start position:0%
error message so here it would just
 

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.460 align:start position:0%
error message so here it would just
trigger<00:12:32.850><c> the</c><00:12:33.029><c> call</c><00:12:33.240><c> wrap</c><00:12:33.959><c> it</c><00:12:34.110><c> inside</c><00:12:34.260><c> a</c>

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:34.470 align:start position:0%
trigger the call wrap it inside a
 

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
trigger the call wrap it inside a
try-catch<00:12:35.070><c> and</c><00:12:35.399><c> then</c><00:12:35.970><c> we</c><00:12:36.329><c> would</c><00:12:36.480><c> build</c><00:12:36.660><c> in</c>

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:36.930 align:start position:0%
try-catch and then we would build in
 

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.930 align:start position:0%
try-catch and then we would build in
case<00:12:37.110><c> of</c><00:12:37.260><c> an</c><00:12:37.350><c> exception</c><00:12:37.890><c> a</c><00:12:38.010><c> result</c><00:12:38.459><c> of</c><00:12:38.670><c> error</c>

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
case of an exception a result of error
 

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.290 align:start position:0%
case of an exception a result of error
based<00:12:39.570><c> on</c><00:12:39.899><c> the</c><00:12:40.079><c> error</c><00:12:40.200><c> message</c><00:12:40.620><c> with</c><00:12:40.800><c> pass</c><00:12:41.010><c> 10</c>

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:41.300 align:start position:0%
based on the error message with pass 10
 

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
based on the error message with pass 10
so<00:12:42.300><c> that</c><00:12:42.329><c> this</c><00:12:42.630><c> means</c><00:12:42.959><c> that</c><00:12:43.350><c> in</c><00:12:43.709><c> our</c><00:12:43.920><c> mode</c><00:12:44.279><c> data</c>

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:44.610 align:start position:0%
so that this means that in our mode data
 

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.389 align:start position:0%
so that this means that in our mode data

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:49.699 align:start position:0%
source we could just create a safe API
call<00:12:47.760><c> and</c><00:12:47.970><c> then</c><00:12:48.420><c> put</c><00:12:48.839><c> the</c><00:12:48.959><c> call</c><00:12:49.200><c> that</c><00:12:49.380><c> actually</c>

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:49.709 align:start position:0%

00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:54.209 align:start position:0%
like this the code became more readable
