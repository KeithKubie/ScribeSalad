00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.270
so there was a new article I think it

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280
so there was a new article I think it
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.889
so there was a new article I think it
was published in nature I'll try to find

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899
was published in nature I'll try to find
 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.950
was published in nature I'll try to find
the link for it it's Bodhi year-old that

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960
the link for it it's Bodhi year-old that
 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.549
the link for it it's Bodhi year-old that

was based on high-resolution imaging of
 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.259
was based on high-resolution imaging of
neuronal connections and it's actually

Kurt's Wells book how to build a mind I

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
Kurt's Wells book how to build a mind I
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.810
Kurt's Wells book how to build a mind I
think that's the name of it and so it

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
think that's the name of it and so it
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.580
think that's the name of it and so it
turns out that the cortex is made out of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590
turns out that the cortex is made out of
 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.769
turns out that the cortex is made out of
these columnar structures that are

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
these columnar structures that are
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.050
these columnar structures that are
pre-organized units of neurons and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060
pre-organized units of neurons and
 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.730
pre-organized units of neurons and
they're replicated across the entire

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740
they're replicated across the entire
 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.679
they're replicated across the entire
cortex it's basically the same structure

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689
cortex it's basically the same structure
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.310
cortex it's basically the same structure
and like the older let's say

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
and like the older let's say
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.709
and like the older let's say
connectionist idea was that neurons that

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
connectionist idea was that neurons that
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.660
connectionist idea was that neurons that
fire together wire together right that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
fire together wire together right that
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.490
fire together wire together right that
that's happen of course that's pretty

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
that's happen of course that's pretty
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.040
that's happen of course that's pretty
standard neurology but the the columns

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
standard neurology but the the columns
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.600
standard neurology but the the columns
are already pre-wired so it's actually

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
are already pre-wired so it's actually
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.580
are already pre-wired so it's actually
columns that fire together that wired

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
columns that fire together that wired
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.840
columns that fire together that wired
together but there's but there's even

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850
together but there's but there's even
 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.790
together but there's but there's even
more with the high-resolution scanning

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
more with the high-resolution scanning
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.220
more with the high-resolution scanning
so it turns out that underneath the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
so it turns out that underneath the
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.959
so it turns out that underneath the
columnar structure there are these

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
columnar structure there are these
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.110
columnar structure there are these
pre-built highways that are connected

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
pre-built highways that are connected
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.029
pre-built highways that are connected
connective tissue that are pre

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
connective tissue that are pre
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.670
connective tissue that are pre
pre-prepared so the columns have the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
pre-prepared so the columns have the
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.010
pre-prepared so the columns have the
option to connect to the to the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
option to connect to the to the
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.840
option to connect to the to the
underlying highway and then that highway

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
underlying highway and then that highway
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.870
underlying highway and then that highway
can connect other columns so it's as if

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880
can connect other columns so it's as if
 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.460
can connect other columns so it's as if
in implicit in the brain organization

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
in implicit in the brain organization
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.469
in implicit in the brain organization
and this is at the cortical level say

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
and this is at the cortical level say
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.179
and this is at the cortical level say
nothing of subcortical organization

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189
nothing of subcortical organization
 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.740
nothing of subcortical organization
there's already preexistent likelihoods

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
there's already preexistent likelihoods
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.960
there's already preexistent likelihoods
that certain neurons will fire will wire

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970
that certain neurons will fire will wire
 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.300
that certain neurons will fire will wire
together yeah so and and what else is

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
together yeah so and and what else is
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.999
together yeah so and and what else is
cool is that this is actually

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009
cool is that this is actually
 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.300
cool is that this is actually
architectural II quite regular so they

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
architectural II quite regular so they
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280
architectural II quite regular so they
found that the these super highways are

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
found that the these super highways are
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.270
found that the these super highways are
arranged in lines and and and in at

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
arranged in lines and and and in at
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.679
arranged in lines and and and in at
right angles to one another so it's

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
right angles to one another so it's
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.460
right angles to one another so it's
almost like a three-dimensional

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
almost like a three-dimensional
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.520
almost like a three-dimensional
structure of wired cubes that underlies

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
structure of wired cubes that underlies
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410
structure of wired cubes that underlies
the neuronal structure so that's some

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
the neuronal structure so that's some
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300
the neuronal structure so that's some
neurological evidence for the archetypal

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310
neurological evidence for the archetypal
 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.610
neurological evidence for the archetypal
idea
