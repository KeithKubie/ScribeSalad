00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.960
JACOB: Welcome So we're here
for an author's talk, as usual.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.460
This is for "Eccentric Orbits--
The Iridium Story" written

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.190
by John Bloom to my left.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.770
To my right, we have actually
two distinguished guests

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.390
as well with us, Dan
Colussy and Ray Leopold,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.070
both very distinguished
in their fields.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.820
I will let John handle
their own intros.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.880
But we're actually
really, really

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.005
lucky to have them with us.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.310
They are two of the
stars of this book.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.229
Without further ado, John Bloom.

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:28.145
JOHN BLOOM: Thank you.

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.935
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.880
Well, this is kind of a
one of a kind of event.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.290
And I feel like the
second grade kid

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.330
who gets to read "My Pet
Goat" to the President.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.420
Because we have today
in the audience,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.630
as Jacob SAID, the two
main characters in my book.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.610
AND these guys are
imminent beyond belief.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.125
The first is Dr. Ray Leopold,
Air Force officer expert,

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:03.300
expert on maneuver warfare,
fighter plane tactics,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.570
tactics that he developed
into tactics for the business

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.930
world, formerly a teacher at the
Air Force Academy, senior air

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.302
staff at the Pentagon,
a pure scientist

00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:16.510
who helped me greatly during
the writing of the book,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.530
and more the point at this
gathering, the inventor

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.300
of the Iridium Satellite System,
the most complex engineering

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.460
system ever put into space.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.760
And Ray is the star of the
first half of the book.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.640
So, would you stand
up, Ray, so everyone

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.889
can appreciate you being here?

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:38.546
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.150
And then we also have Dan
Colussy, the savior of Iridium

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.210
after the Motorola
Corporation threatened

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.450
to destroy the largest satellite
constellation ever created.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.000
Dan is the star of the
second half of the book .

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.220
Now, one of the themes
running through the book

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.890
is that Dan was retired
and playing golf

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.650
in Palm Beach, Florida
when all this happened.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.520
In fact, he was just
learning to play golf

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.145
because when he was
younger, he thought

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:06.690
golf was just an excuse for
businessmen to give off.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.660
So he never learned
how to play the game.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.770
But after many years
of running airlines,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.820
and he ran a corporation
called UNC that many of you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.860
might be familiar with,
he promised his wife

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.400
he wouldn't be running
any more companies.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.090
And then he keeps
getting sucked back

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.190
in because he can't stand to
see these satellites destroyed.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.360
So when he was 69 years
old-- so I got to know Dan.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.020
And he helped
greatly with the book

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.210
because he never
throws anything away.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.670
Any piece of paper that ever
crosses his desk, he keeps it.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.036
And so his archive rivals the
Alexandrian library in size.

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:45.660
But it was a great
resource when you're

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.540
writing a book like this where
people have faulty memories,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.340
or they lie about what happened,
which is more often the case.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.910
But anyway, Dan made
a fool out of me.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.150
Because now he's 85
years old, and he's

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.480
running three companies.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.890
So it's not so big a deal
that he did the Iridium thing

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.860
when he was 69.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.110
But stand up, Dan.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.210
Thanks for being here today.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.460
And we have kind of
a historic event.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.560
Because these two men had never
met until about one hour ago.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.810
But anyway, in 1990 at the
Hayden Planetarium in New York

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.480
City, the Motorola
Corporation, which at that time

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.250
was the most
powerful electronics

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.170
company in the world,
announced the most

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.200
expensive and complicated
engineering project in history.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.680
And it was more complicated
than Los Alamos.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.440
Because that project was
only doing one thing.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.860
And Iridium was
doing many things.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.000
And what it was is a system of
autonomous action satellites

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.370
that would function as cell
phone towers in the sky.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.910
And for the first time,
every inch of the planet

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.070
would be accessible by phone.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.620
So they built it.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.720
It worked.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.000
It was acclaimed by systems
engineers all over the world.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.930
And so why when I met Dan
Colussy 19 years later

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.650
had I never even heard of it?

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.580
I met Dan through
a mutual friend.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.370
And Dan was interested
in getting somebody

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.560
to help with his memoirs.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.090
He wanted somebody to
help edit his memoirs.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.589
And I was talking
to him about that.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.560
And in the course of doing that,
he tells me the Iridium story.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.850
And I said, wait, what?

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.810
Tell me that again.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.770
I don't believe you.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.200
They did what?

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.080
And so he told me again.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.220
And then he just told
me the general outlines

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.390
of what happened, the
involvement of the Pentagon,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.920
the involvement of Bill Clinton,
the Clinton Administration,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.730
the White House, the
Secretary of Defense,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.620
a telephone company in Saudi
Arabia that was connected

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.770
to the Bin Laden group.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.210
And all of that was fascinating.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.090
But the main thing he
showed me was a 3D file

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.400
of the satellites in motion.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.750
And those satellites
were beautiful.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.887
Now, engineers-- and I think
this is a roomful of engineers.

00:05:01.887 --> 00:05:03.470
So you'll know what
I'm talking about.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.830
Engineers are not a
sentimental bunch.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.970
But I have a passage in the book
about the huge number of people

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.180
over the years who fell in
love with these low earth orbit

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.290
satellites.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.070
And they used that language when
they were talking about them.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.420
I loved those satellites.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.072
Those satellites were gorgeous.

00:05:25.072 --> 00:05:26.680
Many of them used the word "my."

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.870
They were "my satellites"
as though they were

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.520
in love with these satellites.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.450
So anyway, I hear
this story about one

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.450
of the most amazing
engineering projects

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.830
of the last century
that became the biggest

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.290
bankruptcy in American history.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.960
It was the year before Enron.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.990
So that record got
shattered pretty fast.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.370
But if you ask a
Wall Street guy what

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.350
he remembers about
Iridium, he'll

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.065
tell you, oh, a huge flame out.

00:05:51.065 --> 00:05:54.045
Another thing where
Motorola screwed up so bad.

00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:56.170
Motorola wanted to crash
those things in the ocean.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.680
They probably should
have crashed those thing

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.650
into the ocean.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.700
So I'm hearing
this bipolar story.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.220
Yes, the greatest
engineering project ever.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.370
Yes, biggest bankruptcy ever.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.030
But I'm here in it years after
that the main events happened.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.990
So I go off for awhile.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.320
And I talk to people, people
associated with Iridium,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.350
people associate with Motorola.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.850
And I ask all the
obvious questions.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.680
And there are a
remarkable number

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.900
of people who refused
to talk about it.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.440
Now, nothing makes
a reporter more

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.000
interested in the
story than people

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.590
refusing to talk
about something.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.910
So Bill Clinton didn't
want to talk about it.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.940
Al Gore didn't want
to talk about it.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.390
The Secretary of Defense
at the time, Bill Cohen,

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.940
he didn't want to talk about it.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.820
90% the people involved at
the Motorola Corporation

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.840
didn't want to talk about it.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.520
Ray, you were a
notable exception.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.120
Thank you so much.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.375
So who wanted to talk about it?

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:55.620
The engineers certainly
wanted to talk about it.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.540
The scientists wanted
to talk about it.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.970
The civil servants
wanted to talk about it.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.900
The bureaucrats, the maligned
bureaucrats, they said,

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.850
I want to tell you about that.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.712
And what they would
say was startling.

00:07:09.712 --> 00:07:11.170
Because you know,
my first question

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.200
is how do you eat through
$11 billion in nine months

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.400
and bankrupt a company that's
been in the works for 12 years?

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.800
Well, maybe it was because the
phone weighed almost a pound

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.110
and was a brick long after the
age of the brick had passed.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.710
Because Motorala,
by the way, had

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.470
invented the brick, the original
DynaTAC back in the '70s.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.960
But the Iridium
phone, it looked kind

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.870
of like a World War
II walkie talkie

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.152
with a giant antenna on it.

00:07:40.152 --> 00:07:41.610
And it was even
worse than a brick.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.901
It was like a brick with a
baguette sticking out of it.

00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:46.560
Because it had this
giant antenna on the top.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.430
And it retailed for $3,500.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.850
So that might be
part of the reason.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.290
And then there was
the business plan.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.460
Motorola was seeking
an elusive creature

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.000
called the international
business traveler.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.520
That's who was going to
buy the phone, the guy who

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.720
needs to be connected
wherever he goes in the world.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.500
By the time they developed the
phone, rolled out the phone,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.740
started selling
the phone, that guy

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.010
had been blessed with
a slim phone that

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.910
worked on the GSM
system, and therefore

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.010
was capable of roaming.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.530
Roaming was never popular.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.180
But roaming worked.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.640
And that phone didn't
work everywhere,

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.730
like Iridium, didn't
work in the ocean,

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.410
didn't work at the South Pole.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.660
It wasn't global.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.680
It just worked in the
places where the people are.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.169
So the next question
I ask is who

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.140
came up with this idea
in the first place?

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.510
And the answer was
three engineers

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:45.330
in the most obscure part of
the Motorola Corporation.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.450
In fact, they called
it Motorola Siberia.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.470
It was the Chandler Lab
in Chandler, Arizona.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.700
All three guys had worked
on the Star Wars program.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.700
The official name was the
Strategic Defense Initiative.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.150
But they tell me
there are two people

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.560
in the world who understand
the full Star Wars program.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.100
I haven't found them yet.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.420
But Ray knows a lot about it.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.840
They worked with these
autonomous kinetic kill

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.540
vehicles.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.760
Autonomous kinetic kill
vehicles, satellites.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.350
And the three
inventors at Motorola

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.510
incorporated all that
technology into what

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.820
would become the
largest civilian space

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.750
project in history
at the time, thinking

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.240
that the future of the world
would have millions of people

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.610
using satellite phones.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.670
Because look, what do we do now?

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.560
We build cell towers
every one to five miles.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.650
We try to build cell towers
every one to five miles all

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.810
the way across the planet.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.580
In fact, more than
one to five miles.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.100
Because each
service provider has

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.170
to do its own cell tower
one to five miles all

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.460
the way across the planet.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.020
Except you can't build them
on most parts of the planet.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.680
So no more than about
14% of the planet

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.910
will ever be covered
with cell towers.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.480
So in 1987-- and
actually today--

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.390
it seems like people would
say let's put them in the sky.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.130
Doesn't that make a
whole lot more sense

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.870
than the way we're
trying to do it?

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.700
So my next question was why
didn't the rest of the world

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.840
think the same thing?

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.070
The rest of the world
did think the same thing.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.090
There were at least a dozen
other satellite phone companies

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.410
formed in the early '90s
including one created

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:40.100
by Bill Gates and Craig McCaw,
Kirkland's own Craig McCaw,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.710
called the Teledesic system.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.470
Some of you might be
maybe familiar with it.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.070
That would have provided
the holy grail-- broadband

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.730
in the sky.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.090
So what happened to all those?

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.770
Well, they went bankrupt
too was the answer?

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.740
So why did Iridium survive?

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.370
Because this one guy here,
this retired businessman

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.850
who was playing golf
in Palm Beach, had

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:06.320
no previous experience with
satellites or outer space,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.120
had no money of
his own to buy it,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.260
and his single-minded
persistence

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.810
resulted in the
deal of the century

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.030
really that saved
the Iridium System.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:24.250
So in order to write this book,
when people won't talk to you,

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.930
what do you do?

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.000
You go get their
e-mail is what you do.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.630
So I filed a Freedom of
Information Act request.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.360
And the result is
that they turned up

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.240
18,000 pages of documents
dealing with Iridium

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.720
at the William Jefferson
Clinton library in Little

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.960
Rock, Arkansas.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.760
Then they wouldn't give
those documents to me.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.540
They tell me they had them, but
they wouldn't give them to me.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.660
Oh, Clinton has to
read them first.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.200
Obama has to read them first
before they can be released.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.210
Next month, maybe next month,
next month, next month.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.990
This went on forever.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.130
And then finally,
lo and behold, they

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:05.170
released 17,000 of the
18,000 pages of documents.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.380
OK, that's the good news.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.610
The bad news is now I have to
read 17,000 pages of government

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.920
documents, including hundreds
of pages of handwritten notes.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.990
And the handwriting of
White House economists

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.230
and national security
people is not good.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.720
I'll tell you right now.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.590
I don't know if any of you ever
been to the Clinton Library.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.736
But if you ever get
a chance, don't.

00:12:27.736 --> 00:12:29.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.640
Although they do have a gift
shop there with any Bill

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.610
Clinton bobblehead doll that I
would recommend in case-- well,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.680
unfortunately, it's not
anatomically correct.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.870
So you can't use it to
explain the Monica Lewinsky

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.090
scandal to young children.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.650
But at any rate, the
contemporary architect

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.310
who designed the Clinton
Library put it up on stilts

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.670
and made it long and narrow.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.370
And so the locals
quickly noticed

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.620
that it looked like a giant
trailer house up on blocks.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.590
Therefore, it's known in Little
Rock as Bill's double wide.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:02.180
So I spent several weeks
in Bill's double wide.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.800
And by the way, I
was almost jailed

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.450
three times for violating
various Clinton Library

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.050
regulations.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.570
Crimping the upper left
corner of a stapled document

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.530
is a capital offense
in Little Rock

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.100
apparently because you
have to go up and have

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.160
the staple officially
removed by the person

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.080
at the front of the room, which
if you did that every time you

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.940
had a staple, you would
be there for seven years.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.480
So there were 24 boxes
of Iridium documents.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.130
And each box has a dozen
or so bulky folders.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.450
And I was also found
guilty of the infraction

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.410
of having more than one
folder open at any given

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.100
time without returning
it to its proper box.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.950
And finally, I just said stop.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.770
Listen to me, people.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.370
You don't have to worry about
the document being permanently

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.270
crimped.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.090
Because only one
person is ever going

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.750
to read any of this stuff.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.160
And you're looking at him.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.940
And so some of the more
sympathetic librarians--

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.630
or actually, don't
call them librarians.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.850
They're always archivists.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.020
Archivists, they're
never librarians.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.720
They eventually allowed
me to crimp and scan.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.480
So I won't try to
summarize the whole story.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.400
But Dan Colussy
comes into my story

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.390
where Motorola is threatening
to destroy the satellites.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.900
Because the business
plan has failed.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.670
So he has to ask
himself the question--

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.180
if he's going to
rescue the system,

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.960
the business plan failed, so who
is going to use these phones?

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.840
So he says, who needs the phone?

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.320
Who has to have that phone?

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.610
Who can't live without it?

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.130
And he finds the answer to
that is, well, CIA agents love

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:39.820
the phone.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.480
People working alone
love the phone.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.170
Drug enforcement agents love it
even more than the CIA agents

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.800
because they're working in
the jungles of Colombia.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.430
And the drug dealers in
Colombia have the phone already.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:58.790
So Marines in small units
in Bosnia love the phone.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:04.100
Oil exploration companies in
remote places love the phone.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.290
Small craft on the open
sea love the phone.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.790
Fisherman, mining
companies, people

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.260
in the most isolated
parts of Africa,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.820
truckers at the North
Pole, but especially guys

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.570
with secret identities
who sneak across borders

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.560
in the dead of night,
they want this phone.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.950
So Dan Colussy says,
OK, so it's obvious.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.986
I've got to go to
the Pentagon, right?

00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:26.860
Goes to the Pentagon.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.230
Obviously, you guys
need this phone, right?

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.770
Nope.

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.280
We're not interested.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.740
The military uses
secure phones that

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.620
run from Cheyenne Mountain.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.680
And we don't need any
phone that anybody

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.480
can buy that was invented
for playboys in Monaco.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.180
No.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.210
So the Navy was
especially negative.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.810
And the Navy sort of controls
all telecommunications

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.830
for the military.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.270
Or were they telling
him the truth?

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.930
Because when he made his
first visit to the Pentagon,

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.150
this enthusiastic,
youthful, bouncy civilian

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.900
suddenly shows up out
of nowhere and says,

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.570
I'm here to guide you through
the process, Mr. Colussy.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:10.500
And his name was Mark Adams,
a man with strange credentials

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.470
from a corporation many of you
are familiar with I'm sure--

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.666
the MITRE Corporation.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.540
It tends to have ex-CIA
heads as its president.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.830
Colussy had at one time been
president of Pan Am Airlines

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.300
when terrorists were regularly
hijacking his planes to Cuba.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.500
And he was somewhat familiar
with government agents.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.130
And his spook detector went
off when this guy showed up.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.150
And from there, the
story got stranger

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.600
and stranger and stranger.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.840
Because the spies
wanted the phone.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.980
But the generals
didn't want the phone.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.820
The Marines at Camp Pendleton,
the first responders in war,

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.270
they wanted to phone
because it works on the move

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.430
and it's handheld.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.390
And they didn't have
a phone like that.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.960
In fact, it would later
prove indispensable

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.710
in Afghanistan and in Iraq.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.510
The scientists in charge of
operations at the South Pole

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.680
were begging for the phone.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.170
So let me put this in context.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.450
A satellite constellation
conservatively

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.540
estimated to be
worth $6.5 billion

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.310
is about to be destroyed by
its operator, the Motorola

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.109
Corporation, at a time
when any Fortune 500

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:25.160
corporation could acquire it for
what amounts to pocket change.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.099
But there are no bidders.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.030
And the military is not
inclined to step in.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.550
So Dan Colussy goes
to Motorola and says,

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.800
let me come up with a
plan to get the system.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.780
They scoff at him.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:41.090
They say, surely you don't
think you can use this for data.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.070
It's too slow for that.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.190
He goes to all the other
co-owners of Iridium,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.340
28 companies around the world.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.830
They're apoplectic with rage
because they feel like Motorola

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.150
sold them this bill of goods.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.880
And now they have this
worthless company.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.720
So none of them want to put
up the money to get it out

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.940
of bankruptcy court.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.240
He goes to every service
provider in the world telling

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.010
them they could own the system
for pennies on the dollar.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.350
Actually, it wasn't even a
single penny on the dollar.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.970
It was mils on the dollar.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.060
But nobody knew that yet.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.272
And nobody was willing to
take a chance on this system.

00:18:14.272 --> 00:18:16.420
He goes to an investment
banker that he's

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.960
known for 35 years, a classmate
from Harvard Business School.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.590
And that guy promises
to put up enough money

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.250
to buy the system
out of bankruptcy

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.110
and run it for a year.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.740
And then he backs out at the
last minute very publicly,

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.470
tells "The New York Times"
that the company is worthless.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.760
And in fact, it was so public
that the State Department

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.650
informed Russia that another
nuclear debris would be coming

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.810
out of the sky so that Russia
wouldn't mistake the falling

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.670
satellites for
incoming missiles.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.280
Meanwhile, the
government-- and that's

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.980
an indication of how the
government was panicking.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.970
A dozen different agencies
are writing memos.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.530
They're making
plans for the moment

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:00.786
when 88 satellites-- there
are 66 in the constellation.

00:19:00.786 --> 00:19:02.410
But there are a lot
of spares up there.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.201
And there were some
that failed before they

00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:05.550
got to their operational orbit.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.610
So 88 satellites are going to be
jolted out of their flight path

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.110
and allowed to plunge to earth.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.970
Especially annoyed by
this is the President,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.030
Bill Clinton, who
says that is not

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.000
going to happen on my watch.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.940
Only to find out
he has no authority

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.260
over the satellites because
they were launched entirely

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.890
by private industry.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.740
And in fact, there are
foreign governments,

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.010
including China and Russia, who
are part owners of the system,

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.050
whereas the Pentagon is a
mere customer of the system.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.120
So China and Russia have
more control over the system

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.690
than we do.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.780
And then-- listen to
this very carefully.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.560
The owner of the Black
Entertainment Network

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.860
asks one of his female
talk show hostesses

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.190
to set up a meeting with
the Secretary of Defense

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.120
so that some friends
of Jesse Jackson

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.830
can provide phone service
with the Iridium System

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.780
to villages in Africa.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.870
You need me to say that again?

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.080
The owner of the Black
Entertainment Network

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.720
asked one of his
female talk show

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.250
hostesses to set up a meeting
with the Secretary of Defense

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.050
so that some friends
of Jesse Jackson

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:16.090
can provide phone services
to villages in Africa.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.700
Bob Johnson is his name.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.150
He comes to the aid of a group
of African-American investors,

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.130
all friends of
Jesse Jackson, who

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.980
have noticed the way Dan
Colussy is being treated,

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.540
and don't like it, and think
that Iridium can be used

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.190
for communications in remote
African villages, which

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.660
is an idea that resonates
deeply within the Clinton

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.350
Administration.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.560
Because they were always
looking for ways to help Africa.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.160
Hence, one of the oddest
business partnerships

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.135
in history is formed.

00:20:45.135 --> 00:20:47.840
But they still do not
have quite enough money.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.470
So they seek additional
funding from Saudi Arabia.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.950
And the story gets
stranger still.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.690
Anyway, all of this
is in the book.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:00.010
But I went on this journey that
took me all over the country,

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.060
interviewing some of the
thousands of people who

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.860
were involved with Iridium,
including Ray Leopold,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.400
who by the way, lives in
northwest Montana, pretty much

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.890
the hardest place to get to in
the whole continental United

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.500
States.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.620
And then I called Ray
over and over again.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.190
Every day I would call Ray
and say, I'm an English major.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.780
You know?

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.870
So I would call Ray.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:23.000
And Ray said
something very wist.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.800
Ray said, you know, I was
always a science geek.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.690
And I was always bad
in every other subject.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.670
But everywhere I went to
school-- high school, college,

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.610
when I got my Master's, when I
got my PhD-- they would always

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.970
make me take an English course.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.340
He says, you're
an English major.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.430
How many times did they make
you take a science course?

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.850
Touche, right?

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:44.350
Never.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.670
You know, once or twice.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.480
But you could easily
get out of them.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.390
And the way this story
plays out-- anyway--

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.800
it's full of twists and turns
and dirty tricks and revenge.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.350
And it's sort of a secret
history of the four or five

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.530
people who saved Iridium.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.890
But I wanted to wind
up these remarks

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.240
with things that were so
strange that I never even

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.460
thought about them before
encountering this book.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.510
One short section in the book
is the history of the car radio.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:21.050
Because the name Motorola comes
from motor in a car combined

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.810
with Victrola sound in a car.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.280
And the whole culture
of that company

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.530
evolved from being the guys
who started putting electronics

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.582
in automobiles.

00:22:31.582 --> 00:22:34.090
So I had to learn
all about that.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.250
Nazi rocket scientists play
a big part in this story.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:44.120
Because when they launched the
first intercontinental missile

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.370
from the Peenemunde
Research Center in Germany

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.820
during World War
II, the toast they

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.170
gave that day-- this was
the V2 missile that they

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.170
used to bomb London--
the toast they

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.780
gave that day was not
about winning the war.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.570
It was about making
satellites possible.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.910
And so they were
science geeks too.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.660
They were just on
the wrong side.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:11.570
Then of course, we brought them
on our side pretty quickly.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:15.310
Secret Chinese launch
complexes-- Iridium

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.800
was the first commercial
space launch in China.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.140
There's feedback here.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.100
Iridium was the first commercial
space launch in China.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:31.141
And when the first people went
there to use the Taiyuan Space

00:23:31.141 --> 00:23:36.510
Center, they retired
to their bedrooms

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.140
in the officers quarters
the first night.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:43.620
And they heard the
sound of clanking.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.290
Their doors were changed shut so
the Americans couldn't get out

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:53.150
and spy on Base 25, this top
secret military installation.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.225
So Dannie Stamp,
the rocket scientist

00:23:55.225 --> 00:24:00.000
who was running Iridium had
to call his Chinese partners

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.490
and say, there will be no
imprisonment of Motorolans.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:08.730
And if you don't stand down,
forget about commercial space

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.120
launches in China.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.600
And they did stand down.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:19.490
The next day, no more
imprisonment of Motorolans.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:24.350
The Air Force agreement--
all Iridium satellites

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.760
have to be launched from
Vandenberg Air Force Base

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.440
because their polar orbits.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.630
Now, China doesn't
have any problem

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:37.450
with launching a polar orbit
over heavily populated cities.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:41.070
But if you launched a polar
orbit from Cape Canaveral,

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:46.710
you would go over Charleston,
Charlotte, Toronto.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:54.240
Or if you launched south, you'd
go over Havana, Bogota, Quito.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:59.120
So we never launch polar
from Cape Canaveral.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.250
So all launches are from
Vandenberg Air Force Base.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.300
And the only people
in danger are

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.650
the people in the city
of Lompoc, California.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.390
And they have an
agreement with the city.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.060
Six dead civilians.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.330
That's the limit.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.540
Seven dead civilians
is too many.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.520
And apparently,
that's OK with Lompoc.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.516
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.219
Why the Russian proton rocket
is the most reliable rocket

00:25:26.219 --> 00:25:28.510
in the world-- when they
asked Dannie Stamp, the rocket

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.560
guy at Iridium what
rocket should we use,

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.260
he said, any rocket other
than an American rocket.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.480
I only feel safe on Russian
and Chinese rockets.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.570
And the reason is he'd been
in the war room in the '80s.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:47.980
And he considered-- they
thought that in the event

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.860
of nuclear war, the
Russian rockets were

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.750
going to outperform
the American rockets.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.850
I mean, they would talk about
it after hours at Cheyenne

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.420
Mountain in the bunker.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.420
And when I was
interviewing him, I

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.820
said, Dannie, that just
doesn't sound right to me.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:08.870
Because Russia was crumbling
throughout the '80s.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.460
And he says, yeah,
they were doing badly

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.000
in every category
of civilization

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.630
except nuclear warfare.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:20.080
And so he was very impressed
by the Russian proton.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.930
And that's actually the
rocket that they relied on

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:27.210
for many of their launches.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.460
I had to learn about
kinetic kill vehicles

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.250
and how they work.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.490
I had to learn about maneuver
warfare fighter plane tactics.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.870
I had to learn about why the
inner Van Allen Belt is toxic.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.170
The other two
inventors, one of them

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.254
is Ken Peterson who is
a pure mathematician.

00:26:44.254 --> 00:26:45.920
And I said, what was
your toughest thing

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.860
that you had to do on
the Iridium problem, Ken?

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.790
And he says, well, we had to
tessellate the unit sphere.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.270
And I said, oh,
Ken, how long is it

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.250
going to take you to
explain that to me?

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.470
And he says, you know, that's
the great thing about Iridium.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.480
He says, all I did-- it was
the greatest job I ever had.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.220
All I did for
years was theorems.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.450
And I said, really?

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.580
He says, yeah, I would
dream about them.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.620
In my unconscious moments,
I would solve the theorems.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.830
And I would say, Ken,
you're one of a kind.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.450
One of a kind.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.870
So anyway, that's
what you have to do

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.780
to reassign the channels when
you have satellites moving

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.530
that fast in a moving handset.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.260
All other systems, you either
have a stationary satellite

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.050
or a stationary handset.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.430
This one, you have extremely
fast moving satellites

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.104
and extremely fast
moving handsets,

00:27:37.104 --> 00:27:39.020
especially when the
handset is in an airplane.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.910
Radio astronomy.

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:52.460
Unfortunately, the frequency
that Iridium for its phones

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:57.750
is beloved of the
28 radio astronomy

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.040
outposts around the world.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:06.040
And the reason is that there
is a spectral band emitted

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.880
by hydroxyl radicals created by
interstellar dust storms coming

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.610
from the direction of Orion.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:14.915
And it's on that frequency.

00:28:14.915 --> 00:28:16.270
It's on the Iridium frequency.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.320
So the radio astronomers
were up in arms.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.980
You can't use that frequency.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.250
We have to listen to the
interstellar dust storms

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.360
from Orion.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:28.940
And so even though
commercial uses always

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.840
are favored over the other
uses by the people that

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.850
allocate frequency, Iridium
made a picket fence solution

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:42.690
so that they could
share that spectrum.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.360
And they share it to this day.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.740
Although the astronomers
are still not happy, Ray.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.510
I'd like you to know
they're still pissed off

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.700
because it decreased
the sensitivity

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.534
of their telescopes.

00:28:52.534 --> 00:28:53.783
I don't know if you know that.

00:28:53.783 --> 00:28:55.000
But they don't work as well.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.070
Superstitions at the
Baikonur Cosmodrome where

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.250
all Russian launches occur.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.080
When you're on your
way to the launch pad,

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.710
you have to piss on the
right rear tire of the bus.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:09.490
The reason you have to do this
is that Yuri Gagarin did it.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.260
And Yuri Gagarin survived.

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.730
First man in space, right?

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:18.900
In fact, when Dannie Stamp went
to the Baikonur Cosmodrome,

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.610
which is the most famous
launch complex in the world.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.170
It's in Kazakhstan.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.360
When he went there
for the first time,

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.390
he said, I need to
see the control room

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.430
that my men will be using.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.022
And the Russians
kind of said, oh, you

00:29:31.022 --> 00:29:32.230
want to see the control room?

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.680
OK.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.790
And they went off,
and they kind of

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.120
like muttered among themselves.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.080
And they came back, and
they said, you know what?

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.780
We'll show you
another control room

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.500
that's exactly like the
one your men will be using.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.490
But we can't show you the
one your men will be using.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.440
And Dannie said,
no, that's not OK.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.230
I need to see exactly where
my men will be working.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.380
The Russians go off.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.080
They mutter among themselves.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.500
They come back, and
they say, OK, we'll

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.680
show you the control room.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.910
But on the way to
the control room,

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.450
we're going to go through
another room first.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.660
And when we go
through that room,

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.370
we would appreciate
it if you would

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.790
stare directly
down at the ground,

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.910
walk as fast as possible, and
not move your head to the right

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.700
or to the left.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.650
And so I said, what
did you do, Danny?

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.770
He says, I walked as
slowly as possible

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.450
and moved my head
as much as I could

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.740
to see everything in the room.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.290
And I said, and
what did you see?

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.900
And he said, I saw a giant
map of the Soviet Union

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.520
at the bottom, an upside
down map of Canada

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.380
and the United
States at the top,

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:35.200
and blinking lights showing the
location of every active ICBM

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.190
in the world.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.200
He said, for whatever
paranoid reason,

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.980
they were still on alert.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.741
And I said, what did you do?

00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:43.740
And he said, I said, let's
have some more vodka.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.230
We were starting the
first global corporation.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:50.070
The family had to get along.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:53.630
So by the way, the
satellites, because

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:56.540
of the work of these two
men, that the satellites

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.440
still fly today.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.020
There's a second generation
going up in September.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:07.010
Most Americans still don't
know that the satellites exist.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.800
If they know anything
about the Iridium phone,

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.180
they know it from the movies.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.620
Robert Downey, Jr.
uses an Iridium phone

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.950
in all the Iron Man movies.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.060
Clive Cussler has Dirk
Pitt use the phone

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.200
in all of his stories.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:28.100
Brad Pitt fights zombies and
saves the world with an Iridium

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:32.450
phone In "World War Z."

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:35.850
Actually, he doesn't
show very much talent

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.170
in using their
phone in that movie.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:42.020
Probably the most famous
scene with an Iridium phone

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:45.830
is Bradley Cooper in
"American Sniper."

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:49.770
He executes the longest
kill shot in history.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:54.710
And then he's still shaking
really from finishing the shot.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.700
And he picks up his Iridium
phone, and extends the antenna,

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.580
and says, I'm ready
to come home, baby.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.830
So most people remember that
scene as there Iridium moment.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.050
There were three events--
after the system was saved,

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.190
there were three events
that made the system famous.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.570
9/11-- it was the
only phone that worked

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.120
in New York City that day.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.050
Hurricane Katrina knocked
out the entire communications

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:22.950
infrastructure of
southern Louisiana.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:27.540
It was the only communications
device that worked there.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.330
Afghanistan-- in most of
the places where troops

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.660
were deployed, it was the
only phone that worked,

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.450
including many of
the military phones.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.819
There have been
traditions now grown up

00:32:39.819 --> 00:32:40.860
around the Iridium phone.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.570
If you get to the summit of Mt.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:45.880
Everest, the first thing you do,
you make an Iridium phone call.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.144
Guess where I am?

00:32:47.144 --> 00:32:49.310
If you get to the South
Pole, the first thing you do

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.760
is you make an
Iridium phone call.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.050
Guess where I am?

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:55.830
Many countries and
aid organizations

00:32:55.830 --> 00:33:00.350
have installed it as
standard safety equipment.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.520
I have to tell one more
story about Ray though.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.710
Ray is a Boy Scout leader
in northwest Montana.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.720
And they go on survival hikes.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.250
And they don't take
Iridium phones.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.833
You don't take Iridium
phones with you

00:33:11.833 --> 00:33:15.680
because they think it would
be an unfair advantage.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:24.250
But since I know you're
all engineers, any of you

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.420
work with radio
frequency spectrum?

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.260
No?

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.800
OK, well, listen to this anyway.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.490
Because I think engineers
can appreciate this.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:40.040
There's a chapter of the
book in which Motorola

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.590
sends about 100 people
to a United Nations

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:46.600
meeting in Torremolinos, Spain
to get the spectrum that they

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.780
need to launch
the constellation.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.640
Ray told me about this meeting.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.440
And it sounded like
the most boring thing

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.960
you ever said to me, Ray.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.990
And I was like, I was kind
of zoning out as you told me

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.190
until he told me the
part about Motorola

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:04.330
hiring Russian-speaking spies
to inveigle information out

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:08.780
of the KGB during the conference
while the French government was

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.880
bugging the hotel rooms
of the Motorola guys

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.679
and rifling through
their suitcases.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.389
OK, now it's getting
more interesting.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.210
You know, all that's
in the book too.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.179
But in the course of researching
this chapter about the most

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:22.889
brutal politics I've ever
encountered in my life

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:25.650
at this thing called the
World Administrative Radio

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:29.810
Conference in Spain, I was
introduced to the International

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.230
Table of Frequency Allocations.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:37.150
Now, I called a friend who
is a book editor when I

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.570
got to this place in the book.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.460
And I said, I've just arrived
at the most daunting task

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.510
I've ever encountered
in my entire career.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.100
I have this thing.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.290
It's thousands of pages.

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:48.960
It's multicolored.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.170
It's incomprehensible.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:55.080
It resembles the world's
longest hippie peace quilt.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.170
It's impossible to
make this interesting.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:03.590
And he says, well, is it
that important to the story?

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.790
I said, oh yeah.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.890
Now I know the International
Table of Frequency Allocations

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:12.604
pretty much determines
the future of the world.

00:35:12.604 --> 00:35:15.210
And he goes, oh yeah, well, OK.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:16.630
I guess that's important then.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.110
Well, you'll figure that out.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.120
So fast forward to
a few months ago.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.580
The book is done.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.450
The editors have
messed around with it.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.520
The lawyers have read it.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.750
I had to go have three
long days of meetings

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:32.750
just with the Saudi
Arabian lawyers.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.670
The Saudi Arabian investor's
named Prince Khalid.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:39.010
So I'm at a Christmas party.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:40.120
And I see this editor.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.750
And he's very happy
with the book.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:46.920
And so I say, hey--
he's telling me

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.770
what he likes, this
and that and the other.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.320
And I say, hey, what about
that International Table

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.310
of Frequency Allocations thing?

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:57.330
He says, oh, that's my
favorite chapter in the book.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.604
OK, I can die now.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.770
Thank you for being
an attentive audience.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:07.840
And do you have any questions
for me, or for Dan Colussy,

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.820
or for Ray Leopold?

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:13.230
Yes.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.750
Oh, OK.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.330
The question is there's
a phenomenon called

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:23.670
iridium flare In which
there's a bright-- it

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:27.110
looks like a comet in the sky.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:30.690
And how did that occur?

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.610
And how did you plan that, Ray?

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.750
RAY LEOPOLD: Actually
that was unplanned.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:40.840
And the giant iridium
flares are a phenomenon

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.890
that has caught the imagination
of people around the world.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:47.300
In fact, all you have to do
Google iridium giant flare.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.919
And you'll see photos of these
flares from around the world.

00:36:51.919 --> 00:36:53.710
If you look in the
book, you'll see a photo

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:55.560
of the Iridium satellite.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.410
The Iridium satellite is
a three-sided satellite,

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:02.410
like a triangular cylinder.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.080
And flopping out from
those three sides,

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.420
our main mission antennas that
operate in the L band frequency

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.620
range, and that's where the
satellites communicate directly

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.570
with the users on the ground.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.530
Well, those are
planar phased rays

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.820
that have a very shiny surface.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.130
And the attitude and
orbit control system

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.290
for the satellites
is pretty precise.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.740
So you know the orientation
of the satellite.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:32.460
You know the position of the
satellite at any point in time.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.600
And there's a website
called heavensabove.com.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.015
You can just go in, put in your
own latitude and longitude.

00:37:40.015 --> 00:37:43.250
And just after sunset
or just before sunrise,

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:45.420
you'll be able to see
these giant flares

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.300
as they reflect the sun down
into your portion of the earth.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.320
And I don't know who it
was at heavensabove.com

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.110
that did all the calculations.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.300
But it's purely deterministic.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.510
And it's not going to
last too much longer.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:00.610
Because on September
17, the company

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.940
that currently owns Iridium
is replacing the constellation

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.110
with a new satellite that
is not the same physical

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.240
configuration.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.890
And those giant flares
won't be happening anymore.

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.750
So if you've never seen them,
they're rather spectacular.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.270
I was on top of
the mountain close

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.690
to where I live in
northwest Montana.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:22.050
On the darkest night of the
year, every year in August,

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.750
all the astronomers go up there.

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:25.860
And I went up there
one time with them.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.360
Boom.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.215
What was that?

00:38:27.215 --> 00:38:27.715
Boom.

00:38:27.715 --> 00:38:28.490
Another one.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:29.310
What was that?

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.315
And these Astronomers,
they're stupid I guess.

00:38:33.315 --> 00:38:36.054
I said, those are
iridium giant flares.

00:38:36.054 --> 00:38:37.050
Oh!

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.990
Then they finally saw them.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:42.250
JOHN BLOOM: They're nine times
brighter than Venus I think,

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.072
which was previously the
brightest thing in the sky.

00:38:46.072 --> 00:38:47.530
At their peak,
they're that bright.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.863
RAY LEOPOLD: Yeah, that's right.

00:38:48.863 --> 00:38:52.830
And actually, if you go
to the heavensabove.com,

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.100
it'll tell you how
bright it should

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.280
be for any particular
iridium giant flare.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.682
So a cloudless sky--

00:39:00.682 --> 00:39:02.640
JOHN BLOOM: But you don't
have to do that, Ray.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.590
You can get an app.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.470
There's an app
called Iridium Flare.

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:08.110
You just get the app.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.255
It gets your GPS position.

00:39:09.255 --> 00:39:10.430
It tells you where you are.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.804
It tells you where
the next flare

00:39:11.804 --> 00:39:13.570
is, where to point your camera.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.720
Do it the lazy way.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.620
You can prank people.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.272
You can say there's going
to be a UFO event tonight.

00:39:20.272 --> 00:39:22.480
RAY LEOPOLD: I've got to
tell you, these same Iridium

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.150
astronomers who hate us using a
20 centimeter wavelength band,

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:30.860
where they wanted to
listen without looking

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.189
through the picket fence,
when they go home at night,

00:39:34.189 --> 00:39:35.980
and they're just
amateurs, they like seeing

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.440
the iridium giant flares too.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.090
JOHN BLOOM: Any other questions?

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.420
CROWD: Yes, hello.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.560
Hello.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.190
So security was probably
a primary concern

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.539
when you all were working
on setting up Iridium.

00:39:49.539 --> 00:39:51.080
Can you talk a little
bit about that,

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.080
some of the concerns you
had, some of the issues

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.470
you had to overcome, especially
with traffic like San Diego?

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.020
I'm sure it was kind of tough.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.920
RAY LEOPOLD: OK, the
Iridium System is actually

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.900
the first commercial use of
both a packet switch network

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.410
and a circuit switch
network integrated together.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:13.650
Up until that time, all
the communication systems

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:15.910
tied to the public
switch telecommunications

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:19.740
system around the world
were circuit switched.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.410
When we created the architecture
of the Iridium System,

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.820
we made the constellation
of satellites.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.240
And the satellites
are six planes

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.698
of satellites that went up one
side of the Earth, come down

00:40:29.698 --> 00:40:32.720
the other with the Earth
rotating underneath it.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.040
And those six
planes of satellites

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.570
have 11 satellites per plane.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.630
Each satellite
communicates satellite

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:41.950
directly in front of it.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:45.020
It's zero degrees azimuth
minus 16 degrees elevation.

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.800
The one behind it,
180 degrees azimuth

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.140
minus 16 degrees elevation.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.217
And the ones to the left
and to the right, well

00:40:54.217 --> 00:40:55.800
the ones to the left
and to the right,

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.190
when the satellites are
coming together at the poles

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:00.600
and then cross over poles
and go the other way,

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.580
you have the
direction that you're

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.210
going to the other satellite
constantly changing.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.310
And so those inner
satellite links

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.370
actually change direction.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:17.280
We have slotted phased arrays
that change the direction.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.520
And because the
change becomes so

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.750
excessive at the
high latitudes, we

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:26.500
shut them off at plus 68 degrees
latitude minus 60 degrees

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.680
latitude, and then
re-acquire them

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:33.030
when the satellite gets over
to the 68 degrees of latitude

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.640
on the other side of the Earth.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.520
Well, that entire
constellation of satellites,

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.630
and every subscriber
in the Iridium System

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.250
are in a packet switch system.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.220
And then each of the
satellites has the ability

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.780
to go down to a gateway.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:52.890
And the main gateway is
in the Tempe, Arizona.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:55.650
And there's always at
least one satellite visible

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.990
from every point on the
surface of the Earth.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:01.080
And so as the satellites go
by, they hand off the gateway

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.570
from satellite to satellite.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:04.350
And when we get
down to the ground

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.820
to that switching
center on the ground,

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:11.870
each Iridium ground station
acts as an international switch.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:16.120
It's converted to the
circuit switch system.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.035
So Iridium was the first
realization of packet switch

00:42:20.035 --> 00:42:23.840
to connect together
with circuit switch.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.220
With respect to
security, it turns out

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.090
that when you have a
packet switch system

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:31.080
and you have the geometry
like you do with Iridium,

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.100
you get a certain
amount of security just

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.250
from the basic Iridium System.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.020
Well, then we also
interweave the bits.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.360
We use forward error correction.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:46.790
The packets are 414
bits per packet.

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.880
The framing for the Iridium
System, for the user links,

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.830
is 90 millisecond frame.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:56.360
The time slots for any burst of
energy for one of those packets

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.620
is a 8.28 milliseconds.

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.340
And a lot of 90
millisecond frame

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:05.795
is guard just so we don't have
any interference from satellite

00:43:05.795 --> 00:43:06.750
to satellite.

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:10.720
And we do use some of the
guard time in each time slot

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.750
for the ringing system and the
paging system in the Iridium

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:14.420
network.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.820
So just the geometry and the
architecture, the interweaving

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.940
forward error correction
affords us so much

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.410
communication security
that we didn't have

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.440
to put a lot in on top of it.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.810
Nevertheless, the
Department of Defense

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.440
decided they wanted
their own gateway.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.060
And it's in the
Hawaiian Islands.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.640
And we put an applicate
on top of the user

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.910
units and then another
applicate in the government

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:40.620
gateway in Hawaii
that offers them

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.200
communication security beyond
what the Iridium System has

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.245
in and of itself.

00:43:45.245 --> 00:43:46.495
Does that answer the question?

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:54.350
JOHN BLOOM: Yeah, and Iridium
was the first non-country

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.170
to get it's own country code.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:58.360
What's the country
code of the Iridium?

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.530
DAN COLUSSY: It's 814 and 816.

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.840
816.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.710
JOHN BLOOM: It's the
nation of Iridium.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:06.855
DAN COLUSSY: There's
two country codes.

00:44:06.855 --> 00:44:08.480
RAY LEOPOLD: There's
two country codes.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.290
And then Globalstar has
one that's adjacent to it.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:17.412
But the US has country
code 1, single digit.

00:44:17.412 --> 00:44:19.370
There's a couple other
countries that have one.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:21.130
Like Russia's 7.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.954
But some other important
countries have two digits.

00:44:24.954 --> 00:44:26.870
Well, we're kind of down
in the pecking order.

00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:32.640
CROWD: Really fascinating talk.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.970
So what does it take to
operate the constellation?

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:38.530
Is there like a
control room that's

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.390
filled with people monitoring
and adjusting things?

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:42.520
Is it highly automated?

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.870
What does that look like today?

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:47.162
And how might it be changing
with the new system?

00:44:47.162 --> 00:44:48.370
DAN COLUSSY: Ray, that's you.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:49.730
You're the expert.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.680
RAY LEOPOLD: We
built what we call

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.440
the SNOC-- the System
Network Operation Center--

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.445
in Lansdowne, Virginia.

00:44:59.445 --> 00:45:00.820
DAN COLUSSY: Near
Dulles Airport.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.030
RAY LEOPOLD: Yeah,
near Dulles Airport.

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:08.730
And it turns that the satellites
are relatively autonomous.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.390
And it also turns
out that when we

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:14.630
looked at the requirements that
came from the communications

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.840
system-- because the
satellites project

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.280
down to the earth's
surface cells

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.200
like a cellular
telephone network.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.880
But unlike the cellular
telephone network, instead of

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.432
the user moving
through the beams,

00:45:24.432 --> 00:45:26.890
the beams move through the
users because the satellites are

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:29.510
going 7,500 meters per second.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:32.310
And it turns out
that when we looked

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.470
at what the actual
communications system

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:38.990
requirement was, it
wasn't that tight.

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:42.640
What we learned was we
save fuel on the satellite

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.300
by updating the position of
the satellite more frequently.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.900
And so when you think about
it, the communications system

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:52.760
needed each satellite
to be in a certain area

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.110
in space that looked
like a sausage.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:59.762
And as long as the satellite
was in its sausage,

00:45:59.762 --> 00:46:02.540
the communications
system would work OK.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:07.420
Well, we save fuel by making
that sausage real small.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.810
And we do the normal
corrections in the polar regions

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.660
when we shut down cells.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.480
Because we can have
a lot of satellites

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.240
over a pole at any one time.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.890
And only one cell needs to be
on in that particular region.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:23.020
So when we have those
userlinks turned off,

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.350
we can do some
small corrections.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:30.220
And as a result, we keep a
very tight orbit control.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.640
The attitude is
maintained primarily

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.860
with the single pitch
and momentum wheel

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.150
that we have on the satellite.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:41.260
It's about a three-pound
mass momentum wheel.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:46.050
And we also augment that
with the signal instruction

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:47.670
in the satellite links.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:50.575
We've actually had momentum
wheels fail on satellites

00:46:50.575 --> 00:46:54.280
when we continue to keep
the satellite in orbit

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.840
by doing the attitude and orbit
adjustments with knowledge

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.280
of what we get from near
satellite [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.950
DAN COLUSSY: That was the
number one issue when we first

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.430
took over Iridium.

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.890
I asked the CEO who was
retiring at that time

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.510
w what's the number one
problem we're going to have.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:14.270
And he said, these
momentum wheels will fail.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:15.940
They're mechanical devices.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.869
And we've already
lost a few of them.

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:19.910
And he said, you're going
to lose a lot of these.

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:22.720
And it's going to
really screw things up.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.680
So I brought Boeing in.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.180
You guys had left by then.

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:30.280
And you know, [INAUDIBLE]
retro rockets.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.960
When those things
fail, it's on wheels

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.860
to position the satellites.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.519
And they came up with software
so that any time-- and I

00:47:39.519 --> 00:47:40.810
think we had lost six or eight.

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:44.110
I'm not sure where we are today,
Ray, but quite a few of them.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:49.770
And the software takes over.

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:55.510
And it keeps it in position
so the solar panels always

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:57.680
get the sun and so forth.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.020
So that's been a lifesaver.

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.970
I mean, that would have
been a real disaster.

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.340
And I think the big thing
that Ray designed into this

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.580
was the fact that we
can change the software

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.680
in the constellation.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:16.270
When they go to the North Pole,
we have several ground stations

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:19.450
in a location within
the Arctic Circle.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.680
And we sent up new software.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.440
We've done them dozens of times.

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.780
And every time we have a major
crisis, technical crisis,

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.200
we figure it out.

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:33.200
Our group of engineers
down in Tempe-- actually,

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.760
Chandler, Arizona.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.710
And we can send that
new software up.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:41.439
And that's very unique.

00:48:41.439 --> 00:48:43.105
I don't think there's
a satellite system

00:48:43.105 --> 00:48:46.420
today-- Ray, you might know
this better than I-- who

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.480
has this capability where
we can send up new software,

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.790
can take care of anomalies.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.450
And that's worked
probably hundreds of times

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:58.960
in the last 15 years
where we saw a problem

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:04.702
and we could fix it by
sending up new software.

00:49:04.702 --> 00:49:07.160
JACOB: I am fortunate enough
to have both hosted this event

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:12.180
and get the last question before
we wrap up and go to signing.

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.700
I'm actually-- as much as I
am an engineer and curious

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.330
about all the
engineering details,

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:20.390
I'm fascinated by the show
of will and confidence

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:24.089
that you, Dan, put into
resurrecting this project,

00:49:24.089 --> 00:49:26.380
especially against all of
the odds that John has talked

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:30.270
about, including the purchase
price, which was, as you noted,

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:31.820
like half a penny on the dollar.

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:34.153
An incredible purchase price,
but still a lot of money--

00:49:34.153 --> 00:49:37.510
not money you had to
follow your vision, Ray.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:42.330
So what made formal this
notion that you were really

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:43.890
going to do this?

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:46.396
What forced your, sort
of, to take this action?

00:49:46.396 --> 00:49:48.270
DAN COLUSSY: I think it
goes back to the days

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:51.470
that I ran Pan American World
Airways, which we flew to 120

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:52.890
cities all over the world.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:57.300
And we had a patchwork
terrestrial system.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.750
Every system you could think of.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:03.240
And it worked most of the
time, but not all the time.

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.820
And so suddenly, I hear
about this system--

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:10.860
66 satellites in the sky that
are working all the time.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.730
And it's beautiful.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:15.600
And it can communicate with
airplanes, ground stations,

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.120
ships, whoever.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.960
And somebody says, they're
going to destroy this.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.469
Why is that?

00:50:22.469 --> 00:50:24.260
That's the stupidest
think I've ever heard.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.180
I mean, they spent $6
billion on it already.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.840
And so I just got
very interested

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:35.000
and made them an
offer-- $25 million.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.510
And of course the banks who
were the secured creditors

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.210
said this is chump change.

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:41.550
Forget it.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:43.080
And I said, well,
that's all I have.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:43.610
I'm sorry.

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:49.500
So they accepted it.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:53.070
But it was really not that
moment specific so much.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:59.060
But it was really my-- I have
to say it was altruistic.

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:01.170
Because every time
I said in public,

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:04.550
people looked a
little strange at me.

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:10.844
But it just seemed
complete insanity

00:51:10.844 --> 00:51:13.260
that you would take this system
that's working technically

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.970
beautifully.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.250
And because it had
a bad business plan,

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.704
they were going to destroy it.

00:51:19.704 --> 00:51:21.610
And it just was so stupid to me.

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:24.310
I couldn't believe it.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.680
So I just got in the fray
and started making offers

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.150
and ran into lots
of difficulties.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:35.100
But at the end of
the day, it survived.

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:38.420
And we own the system
for $25 million.

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.430
They sort of ran out
of money and said,

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.060
[INAUDIBLE] with the banks.

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.420
Oh, the 25 by the
way, I can only

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.230
give you six and a half cash.

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:53.360
And would you take and
$18.5 million loan 10%?

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.830
So this woman who was in charge
of a consortium of 38 banks

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:57.430
said, you've got to be kidding.

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.290
I said no.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:03.070
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:06.300
JOHN BLOOM: And
actually, years later,

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.230
a business columnist
for "USA Today"

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:12.810
was looking for a parallel
in terms of a resource that

00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:15.760
was bought for such
a low price that

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.210
resulted to be as valuable
as it turned out to be.

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.600
The only parallel
they could find

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.955
was the Louisiana Purchase.

00:52:21.955 --> 00:52:24.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:26.930
And I should say, in
terms of altruism,

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:30.260
there were four or five
people in the government-- not

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.520
famous people in the
government, not the top people

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.910
in the government, but a
person at the White House,

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:38.580
a person at the FCC, and
a person in the Pentagon

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:39.942
who were not well known.

00:52:39.942 --> 00:52:41.150
I could tell you their names.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.983
They're in the book.

00:52:41.983 --> 00:52:46.070
But you wouldn't know
them-- who fought like crazy

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:47.970
to make sure these
things weren't crashed.

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:49.600
And even after the
whole world was

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.560
preparing for the destruction
of the constellation.

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.120
As I said, they sent
out messages to Russia

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.430
saying it's going to
happen on a certain day.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:59.820
The software was written.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:03.120
The suicide software
was written.

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.550
And there were these
three or four people.

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:07.340
And when I interviewed
Kathy Brown,

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:11.250
who was the Chief of Staff
at the FCC, about this,

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:14.340
she said, you know, when
you spend your whole life

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:17.860
in government service,
there's a lot of gray areas.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:21.350
And there's very few things
where at the end of the day,

00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:25.200
you can say, I'm proud to
have been part of that.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.630
But I'm proud to be one
of the saviors of Iridium.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.670
And that's the way--
these government people,

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:35.930
they didn't benefit a
single penny from it.

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:38.910
But they were just like,
this is outrageous.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:43.060
The White House economist who
was involved was told strictly

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.540
by the White House
legal office, do not

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.910
get involved in the bankruptcy.

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:51.740
It's unethical.

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.410
All you can get involved
in is public safety.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:56.730
And she just said, screw that.

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:58.550
I'm getting involved
in the bankruptcy.

00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:01.210
And she was one
of the key people

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:03.450
that set up the
key meetings that

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:07.680
caused the system to be saved.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.940
And a lot of these people
they were dealing with

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:17.170
were veteran politicians who
just see what's in the wind

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:19.780
and decide whether they want
to risk their career on this

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:22.489
or whether it's worth
fighting for or whatever.

00:54:22.489 --> 00:54:24.530
And you had these lower
level people pushing them

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:25.849
saying, do the right thing.

00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:26.640
Do the right thing.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.400
Do the right thing.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:27.920
Save it.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.350
Save it.

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:28.850
Save it.

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:29.380
Save it.

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:30.389
Until finally--

00:54:30.389 --> 00:54:31.680
DAN COLUSSY: It saved billions.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.230
JOHN BLOOM: The higher level
people finally at the very end,

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:42.260
after meeting in the White House
Situation Room with 12 agencies

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:46.930
there, finally did
the right thing.

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:49.070
And throughout that
period, every day,

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:52.880
Motorola was saying, OK, we're
destroying it on Tuesday.

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.580
OK, we're destroying
it next week.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.835
I think they threatened
18, 19 times to destroy it.

00:54:58.835 --> 00:55:00.710
DAN COLUSSY: The only
other thing I would add

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:04.590
is that we don't have
exact figures on this,

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.610
but there are
thousands and thousands

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:11.520
of lives that have been
Iridium Constellation

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:14.530
all over the world, all
kinds of circumstances.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:18.500
And there has been
so much communication

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:22.285
from these very remote parts of
the world that would never have

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:24.500
had any means to communicate.

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.730
And this is really
very gratifying to me.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.170
Because now, starting
September of this year,

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:32.920
we're going to put up
the next generation.

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:36.465
It's another $3 or $4 billion.

00:55:36.465 --> 00:55:38.730
But we have a cash
flow now to do.

00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:46.510
Because now, we have 5,000 plus
people actually paying money.

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:49.240
And when we get to the
next generation which

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:55.081
will be 15 or 20 years from now,
we'll have so much cash flow,

00:55:55.081 --> 00:55:56.080
this won't be a problem.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:02.850
So now we have a system
that's in perpetuity.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:07.270
And that to me is I think
the greatest satisfaction.

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:09.399
And Ray, I'm sure
you can elaborate.

00:56:09.399 --> 00:56:11.690
RAY LEOPOLD: Let me say on
behalf of Bary Bertiger, Ken

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:14.500
Peterson, and I who created the
system and the couple thousand

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.760
people who brought
it into existence,

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.185
thank you, Dan Colussy.

00:56:20.185 --> 00:56:21.560
JOHN BLOOM: I
should also mention

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.100
that the Malaysian airliner that
went off the grid and was never

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.590
found.

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:28.350
Once the new
generation of Iridium

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.650
goes up, that will
never happen again

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:35.200
because of a system called
Arion that uses Iridium

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.310
so that no matter what
air traffic control system

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:40.860
you're in, anywhere
in the world,

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.510
you're never off the grid.

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:47.190
DAN COLUSSY: We can track every
commercial airplane 7 by 24,

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:52.320
365 until it disappears off
the surface of the earth.

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.566
We'll have altitude,
speed, direction,

00:56:55.566 --> 00:56:56.920
the whole nine yards.

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.496
So there will be no
more Malaysian Airlines.

00:56:59.496 --> 00:57:01.945
That won't happen until 2018.

00:57:01.945 --> 00:57:03.422
But it's coming.

00:57:03.422 --> 00:57:05.130
JOHN BLOOM: So if it
goes into the water,

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:07.460
they'll know exactly where
it went into the water.

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:08.445
DAN COLUSSY: Well, and you'll
have all the parameters

00:57:08.445 --> 00:57:09.390
going down, John, as well.

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:10.140
JOHN BLOOM: Right.

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.070
JACOB: Thanks again
to all our speakers--

00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:15.919
Ray Leopold, Dan
Collusy, and John Bloom.

00:57:15.919 --> 00:57:16.710
They'll be signing.

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:20.240
[APPLAUSE]
