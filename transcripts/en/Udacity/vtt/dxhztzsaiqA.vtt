00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This wasn't the easiest question,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
because even though there was some hint that you had to use trigonometry,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
it might not have been completely clear what triangle we're talking about.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is the triangle I was looking at, this one in purple.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And here, it turns out the side opposite alpha is the width of the well,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is 1 meter, and the side adjacent to alpha is the depth of the well, which is 40 meters.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So once again, as often happens in nature,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we were able to find a right triangle even though it wasn't totally obvious

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
at the start of the problem that it existed.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Okay, so we have a right triangle.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I know the opposite and the adjacent, which means I'm going to use tangent,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I'm going to say the tangent of alpha is equal to 1/40.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now I want to know what's alpha.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
To figure this out, I'm going to type into Google arctan (1/40) in degrees.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And the answer I get is 1.4 degrees.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So this points to some error in the measurement.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It looks like we could have been off by as much as 1.4 degrees in either direction.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The sun's ray could have been coming like this, or it could have come like that.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
That's certainly an appreciable error since the angle we had been dealing with before

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
was only 7.2 degrees.

00:01:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
But how does this error in angle correspond to an error in calculated circumference?
