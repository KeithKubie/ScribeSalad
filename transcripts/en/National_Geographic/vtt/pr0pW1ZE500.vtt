00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.867
[intense music playing]

00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:07.033
Cameras aren't working and
it's getting super frustrating.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:09.200
CHRIS MULTOP: This is what
it's like on "Life Below Zero."

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.533
Cameras already down.

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.700
Tough conditions all
around to film in.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.800
WOMAN: No heat, no
power, no anything.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.200
[grunts] Won't even turn on.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.900
WOMAN: I've fallen
too many times.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.967
We have bad winds and it's just
a typical day in the Arctic.

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:29.400
MAN: Making the best
of what we've got.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.667
[intense music playing]

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.934
It's really cold, but
this is kind of our job.

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:40.734
This is what we do.

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:41.934
This is what we live for.

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:44.800
How can we do that
out-of-the-box cinematography?

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.600
MAN: The Iditarod is
something I've been dreaming

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.133
about doing for 12 years.

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.834
And it's the last great race.

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:52.667
This is the grand
Olympics of the north.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.967
First thing I'm going to
have to do is get out my maps

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:58.000
and get out my mileages, and
start making a race plan.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.133
More people have summitted
Everest than have finished

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.767
the Iditarod in 47 years.

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:08.233
Jesse is planning out his
Iditarod, all the stuff he has

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:09.734
to take for the Iditarod race.

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:13.500
It'd be really cool to get a
cool specialty shot time lapse,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.967
but we're trying to
figure out how to do it.

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:16.233
And Benji had a good idea.

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:18.700
He's like, what if we
did this corkscrew,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.133
bird's eye view
over his shoulder?

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.934
BENJI LANPHER: I haven't
seen it done on the show yet,

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:24.333
and this was kind of exciting
about it-- is that it's

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.033
something kind of
new and we're trying

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:28.133
to push it a little
bit as far as in terms

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.633
of making this kind of pop.

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:30.834
CHRIS MULTOP: But
we're just going

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.567
to make do with what we've
got, and start building,

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:34.200
and see if it'll work.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.900
The part that sucks, because
it's cold and my hands

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.066
are going to get cold.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:40.867
Ha!

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.734
[clattering]

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:44.667
Man, that burns.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.967
I know one of the things that
we really strive for on the show

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:51.133
is, outside of a great story,
is to try to do these incredibly

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.867
creative shots that are
out of the box usually

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:58.100
utilizing stuff that's not meant
to be used that sort of way.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.333
So every trip, every show,
every episode that we produce,

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.233
we do that out-of-the-box
cinematography.

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.133
[drilling]

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.900
This is all we've
got to work with.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.033
It's not like you just
go get any ol' bolt

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.767
and size you need at the
hardware store, you know?

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:13.166
Oh, perfect.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.367
All right, let's
go take it up there

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:15.200
and see if we could hang it.

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:22.266
[dogs barking]

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:26.767
All right.

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:28.133
So far, so good.

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:29.433
BENJI LANPHER: The
idea of the shot

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:32.367
is to pull out from the map,
so you can see him writing

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:34.967
and then pull out and twist.

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:37.433
You'll see it but we're going
to try to keep the map in focus

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.700
the entire time as we pull out.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.133
The lens is cold, so what
we have to do every time

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:44.934
we bring any of our
gear, cameras or lenses,

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:47.433
from inside to outside is
we have to let it acclimate.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.667
So it gets foggy out here
and then it gets foggy

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.000
on the inside.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.066
We can't shoot until
this lens acclimates

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.900
to the temperature inside.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.467
The idea is to really
show that essence

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:04.100
of time passage for all
the work that he has to do.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.233
We want to do the
most incredible

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:09.367
shot that we can try to pull
off to make that look amazing.

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:17.333
Half the battle in these
time lapses is the ingenuity,

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:18.934
and being innovative,
and creative.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.500
WOMAN: Running the loader,
and this is what I noticed.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.834
This is oil that's
being blown up.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.166
This is the piece
of machinery that's

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:34.066
going to get my runway fixed.

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.066
This has got to get fixed.

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:37.700
Once it does, I'm
back in business.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.834
But until it is,
I'm out of business.

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:42.133
MIKE CHEESEMAN: And we're
going to try to capture

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:44.967
the whole time lapse
all the way across Kavik

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:48.000
with dusk all the way into the
night to the northern lights.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.834
And we need a lot of weight,
because we're going to put

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:53.033
a lot of tension on the cords.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.834
So we're going to
ratchet-strap one point in,

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:58.567
ratchet as hard as we can down,
and then we're going to run

00:03:58.567 --> 00:03:59.867
the line all the way across.

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:01.333
The more tension the
better, because we

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:02.467
don't want the camera to sag.

00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:04.367
We want it to be taut.

00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:05.600
There we go.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.467
As you can see, one
point is secure.

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:10.333
It's not going one
way or the other.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:14.133
We're going to put a
lot of tension on this,

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.166
so we need to make sure
it's pretty stable.

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:22.133
So here's our
beginning of the shot.

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:24.000
We'll be here.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We're trying to achieve a
full Kavik from her storage

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.400
shed, generator shack,
loader all the way

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.800
to the front of the Twinkie.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.333
So from 80 paces,
roughly 80 feet,

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:40.867
we'll be able to go
the length of her camp

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:42.033
all the way to the front.

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:46.400
So we're probably about
60% done with the tension.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.533
And as we're
pulling the tension,

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:49.000
the barrels are moving.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.066
So now we have to figure out
more weight for the barrel.

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:54.633
So when we put more tension
on, the 100% tension,

00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:58.100
we will be solid and
the barrels won't move.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.734
The ropes are perfectly even.

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:02.667
The carriage will ride
straight, and it won't bounce

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:04.800
off the wires or the rope.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.066
So we're pretty
much at that point

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:08.133
where we can mount the 5D.

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:11.066
The temperatures aren't
in the negatives yet,

00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:15.233
but our motor for the slingshot
time lapse is all metal.

00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:17.667
I need to just
basically insulate it,

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:21.066
and an easy way to do it is
just to use an extra beanie.

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:24.734
And that at least insulates
it enough that it stays warm.

00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:27.800
Houston Texans save the day.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.100
So we just set it.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.300
The camera is now rolling,
and the best thing we can do

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.433
is get the hell out of the way
and let the camera do its work.

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:38.967
