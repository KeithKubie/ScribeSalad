Hey, Doug Walker here. We are doing a video
addressing why are videos have only been fifteen

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.540
minutes here on YouTube. And as some of you
have noticed, keeping on eye on YouTube recently.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.410
A lot of YouTubers, some very well known some
not so well known have suddenly have had their

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.440
channels deleted or they have been having
their monetization taken away. That means

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.150
they can't get paid for the videos they have
been putting up. And a lot of them are saying

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.640
they are not getting answers why this just
happened out of no where and it's a big questions

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.420
mark and YouTube has given no answers. And
you might be thinking at home, YouTube, that's

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.059
a big organization, clearly they must have
done something wrong. Speaking as people who

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.860
have been hit by this as well, they are not
lying. This is a real thing and we don't usually

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.270
go into behind the scenes business stuff because
we feel its not professional to do but this

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.520
kinda effects you too. So this is one of the
reasons we are talking about this. On January

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.719
5th, at 8:57 PM we got an e-mail from YouTube saying that
monetization and other account features have

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:15.829
been disabled. Two hours later we were finally
able to get into our account to see what apparently

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.060
affected us. We found out that we had a strike
from Studio Ghibli, the japanese company,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.159
not the American Disney part of it against,
My Neighbor Tortoro. The Disneycember review

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.130
of My Neighbor Tortoro which is completely
in Fair Use. Which by the way you can see

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.679
on three separate other YouTube channels right
now they haven't gotten hit. Now you might

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.389
be thinking Oh, thats the reason. Well, we
have gotten strikes before on League of Super

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:46.560
Critics, we have gotten two and we have never
lost these features before. When you get one

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.899
strike your videos are limited down to fifteen
minutes which is what's going on now but not

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.039
these other features. So as of now with one
strike, the only features we can use is thumb

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.609
nails, we can make custom thumbnails and the
wonderful YouTube editor which I'm sure you

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.349
all know how fantastic that is. So you might
be thinking, maybe they changed the rules

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.379
on strikes. Well, if they did they never told
anyone about it. So, we went to YouTube's

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.420
partner support and we said what's going on
here, why can't we monetize our videos. We've

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.159
gotten strikes before and we resolved them.
We are coming up on three weeks with no answer

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.879
from YouTube what so ever. And if you look
on their site, they say they will respond

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.870
in one business day. One business day now
means three weeks. They forgot to tell you

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.879
that but were letting you know this right
now. And going it could be even longer than

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.879
this. Ok, what if it is the strike, we can't
get a clear answer. We just want to clear

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.510
as much as we can. We tried to go through
the traditional route, we tried to file the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.189
DMCA counter claim which you can do through
YouTube. Ever single time we did this and

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.659
we did this for a couple days we always got
a server error. So then we contacted YouTube

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.849
asking why we are getting a server error.
This is a separate email from the one saying

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.730
why we getting monetized. They sent us a form
email again, not able to talk to a person

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.400
and they said don't use that route use these
other means. So, they are already acknowledging

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.780
this other route doesn't work. Whatever, we
have other means. One was a link we can't

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.239
use because we have these limitations. So
the same day we sent them an e-mail the manual

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.659
way because they said that's one of the ways
you can do it. We put down all the information

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:26.239
needed, as well as overnighted a physical
letter to make sure this was getting to them

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.469
because that was an also a way they said this
would work. Both said we were missing information.

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:35.139
We looked over it, we followed it to a T,
nothing was missing. So, we had to think outside

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.829
the box because clearly this is making no
sense. We have two managers on the YouTube

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.189
account, one logged in to do the way we tried
and one of the other managers logged in. The

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:50.909
other manager that logged in got a completely
different form. 100% different. And to make

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:57.739
things even better, they said the characters,
the amount of letters you can put in has to

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:06.029
be 250. You can't go over that. So, you have
pretty much the length of a tweet to make

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:12.019
your legal case about why you're in the right.
The counter DMCA notice is in effect after

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.849
going through this incredibly broken system.
But we have yet to talk to a human being and

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:22.220
were coming up on three weeks of getting no
mentization. No money for any of the videos

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.819
that we put out. Past and present, all videos
we are making no money right now. The only

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:32.639
way we have gotten any contact to YouTube,
like a human being, is with contacts from

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.750
other people. And even then nobody has given
us a straight answer, nothing has been consistent.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.580
Nobody knows whats going on. Ok, so this is
the part that concerns you. We have over 350,000

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.400
subscribers on YouTube. We've been around
for years, if this can happen to us with no

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.169
explanation with no reason why and weeks of
no pay, no explaining any of it. What chance

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.530
do people have putting up their family videos
have. What chance do we people just starting

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.930
off, monetizing or trying to make a living
or whatever have against this. Everything

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.400
being done right now is through the algorithm.
There is no human being looking over any of

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.520
this and it seems like the only way to get
attention and get them to do something is

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.180
to escalate it. A lot of YouTubers are now
making videos saying this has happened and

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.090
we don't know why because they were trying
to do the same thing, they were trying to

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.080
go the professional route of trying to talk
to YouTube. Trying to get answers and none

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.180
of them have been answered. Even the channels
that were lucky enough to be put back, if

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.910
the channel was deleted and put back, if they
weren't getting monetization, they were put

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.620
back YouTube has never explained what happened
or what they could do to not have this happen

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.150
again in the future. That is Scary! For years
we put up with this idea that YouTube makes

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.490
it where you are guilty until proven innocent
and that's not just, but at least they made it

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.879
clear these are the rules this is what you
have to do. We didn't like following them,

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:05.889
but it's still in the grand scheme of things
a young business when you really look at it.

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.250
So many changes are happening and studio heads
are trying to bully them so they are making

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.729
changes and trying to figure it out. Fair
enough, but now nothing is making sense. Rules

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.770
are just being made up and they are not being
explained to us. And this is for anybody,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.759
not just big channels. Anyone can get taken
down. These rules and everything was put in

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.629
place to stop people from running full movies
and pirating stuff. Fair enough, you have

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.319
to do what you have to do. But now we are
at a point where it's just abuse. People are

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.789
not looking at these anymore, they haven't
looked at them for awhile, but now they aren't

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:40.470
even following their own rules. If you have
any videos on YouTube right now, make sure

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.569
they are backed up. Make sure you have them
stored somewhere on your computer because

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:48.879
they can disppear at any point and they don't
have to tell you why. You know companies make

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:54.169
mistakes and its fine. Were a company and
we make mistakes, everybody does but when

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:59.110
your doing this and your now doing anything
to change it. Your not explaining why, your

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.280
pretty much let everybody know that this is
how we do things and this is right. This is

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.949
just, we can do whatever we want. If we want
get rid of someone showing their family movies

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:15.409
and we don't have to explain why, we can do
it now. It's totally ok. If we want to take

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:23.439
someone who is making a living now on YouTube,
as many people are and get rid of their monetization,

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:27.580
just destroy their entire channel, it is totally
fine with them and they dont have to tell

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:34.470
you why. So, that's the reason you haven't
seen many Steven Universe Vlogs, Bum Reviews,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.000
because we have been busy with this. We have
gone almost three weeks with no pay for any

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.250
of our videos. And in my opinion, until we
get monetization back on this channel and

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.909
these other channels or channels that have
been deleted are put back or at least given

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:57.500
an explanation or anything, it's pretty much
saying YouTube can do whatever it wants and

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.590
we are ok with it. Just as we make money off
of YouTube, YouTube makes money off of us.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.930
We were in a situation we were forced to accept
and we accepted it because the rules were

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.530
in place and they seemed to follow it. But
now their not even following there only rules.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:16.379
YouTube's support is no existent right now.
Right now you need to be very cautious, we

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:22.990
can't say how because even we don't know how.
You need to be very careful. Here's the thing,

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:28.090
anyone can change. They can come around and
say hey, this mistake happened we are fixing

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.050
it and we are on top of it. Here is the new
rules and we will do our best to follow it.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:38.300
We have been changing our content a lot in
order to fit YouTube's rules. And even doing

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.350
that now hasn't worked. But we aren't told
why because we aren't even told what the rules

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:49.410
are anymore. YouTube's system is not only
broken but its made to be abused. We are still

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.990
going to do Nostalgia Critic videos because
we know you guys really want to see those

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.910
even though we aren't making anything on them
right now we are still going to do them. Stuff

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.650
like Steven Universe's and the Bum reviews,
real thoughts, we got to hold off until we

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:07.210
figure this out. Until we are allowed to make
a living again. YouTube's system right now

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:12.460
is run on automation. Everything from small
complaints to stuff that can shut a channel

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:18.060
down. No human being is looking at them until
its escalated so thats why we are forced to

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.640
talk about this. Like I said, there is a whole
mountain of other issues that's going on with

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.050
YouTube that we can't talk about here because
we only have fifteen minutes. We just wanted

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.610
to keep this focused and give you guys fair
warning what is going on with YouTube right

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:38.030
now and how your channel is at risk. So, hopefully
this gets resolved, hopefully YouTube wakes

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:43.330
up and starts treating people and channels
fair and just again because their lively hoods

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:51.640
are dependant on it now. You can't just wait
weeks and weeks with no answer when people

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.140
are now dependant on this to make a living.
We are going to have links below to other

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.310
channels that are going through similar issues
right now because there are quite a few. We

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.640
hope this gets resolved, we hope that so many
of these problems that are going on with YouTube

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.800
get fixed, but as of now we are forced to
deal with a broken system and this is the

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.050
best we can do. This is the best we are allowed
to do. So guys thats about it, an explanation

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:19.470
of whats going on and be cautious. Be very
very cautious. Back up all your videos if

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.160
you have them on YouTube and just be very
very careful. I will talk to you guys later,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.660
take care.
