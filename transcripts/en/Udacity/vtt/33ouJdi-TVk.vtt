00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.980
I'm glad you bring up the idea of
the work factor and the resources.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.640
I guess we hear people saying
adversity is going to prevail, or

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.920
we need to be paranoid or
hyper-paranoid.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.350
How do we strike a balance
between how paranoid we are and

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.340
the price we pay for it?

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.730
&gt;&gt; Well, one I think,
typically we aren't paranoid enough.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.060
Actually, I would say first we need
to we design things we need to assume

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.930
there's an adversary.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.390
Which a lot of people don't do.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.490
Particularly when products
are rushed to market.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.570
And then I don't think that we
assume an adversary is as powerful.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.530
We assume the adversary is stupid.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.940
Which is, again, a bad, bad idea.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.390
And then, I think we can even really
be a little more paranoid than that and

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.400
assume they can do a little
bit more than we think.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.520
Maybe a lot more, depending on how
important the information the system

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.580
you're trying to protect actually is.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.350
When it comes to trade off, though,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.320
you could put an infinite amount of
resources making something secure.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.830
And conventional wisdom says, and

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.990
actually I would say best practice from
industry, is to form a calculation.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.740
So the amount of money you're
putting into securing a system

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.080
shouldn't exceed the value of
the item you're actually protecting.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.170
If you're building a vault to hold
a $10 item, something's wrong.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.050
So that's part of the calculus.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.240
The other calculus,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.740
I think, is I personally I don't want to
live in a world with perfect security.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.700
The amount of pain involved
in our day to day lives

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.990
makes an overwhelming amount of security
very, very unpleasant place to be.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.190
So it really comes down to risk.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.060
Life is about risk.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.370
Banking is about risk.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.570
Crossing the street Is about risk.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.880
So each organization has to determine
how much risk they're willing to take.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.490
Understand its security cost
in terms of time and money and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.380
resources and
frustration of your actual user base.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.520
There have been times that I haven't
been able to get into the building

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.080
where I work because of some
glitch in the security system or

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.360
I forgot my ID card or
my pass card in another place.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.710
So it comes at a cost.
