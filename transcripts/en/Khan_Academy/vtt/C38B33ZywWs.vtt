00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.720
Welcome to the presentation
on adding and subtracting

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.440
negative numbers.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.390
So let's get started.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.530
So what is a negative
number, first of all?

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.090
Well, let me draw
a number line.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.910
Well it's not much of a
line but I think you'll

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.200
get the picture.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.930
So we're used to the positive
numbers, so if that's 0, you

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.680
have 1, you have 2, you have 3,
you have 4, and you keep going.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.640
And if I were to say what's 2
plus 2, you'd start at 2 and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.790
then you'd add 2 and
you'd get to 4.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.160
I mean most of us
it's second nature.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.940
But if you actually drew
it on a number line

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.140
you'd say 2 plus 2 is 4.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.490
And if I asked you what's
2 minus 1 or let's

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.840
say what's 3 minus 2?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.280
If you start at 3 and
you subtracted 2, you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.350
would end up at 1.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.310
That's 2 plus 2 is equal to 4
and 3 minus 2 is equal to 1.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.990
And this is a joke for you.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.990
Now what if I were to
say what is 1 minus 3?

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.160
Huh.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.110
Well, it's the same thing.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.370
You start at 1 and we're going
to go 1 -- well, now we're

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.970
going to go below 0 --
what happens below 0?

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.510
Well then you start going
to the negative numbers.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.940
Negative 1, negative 2,
negative 3, and so on.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.550
So if I start at 1 right here,
so 1 minus 3, so I go 1, 2,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.620
3, I end up at negative 2.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.690
So 1 minus 3 is equal
to negative 2.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.290
This is something that you're
probably already doing

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.100
in your everyday life.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.870
If I were to tell you that boy,
it's very cold today, it's 1

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.830
degree, but tomorrow it's going
to be 3 degrees colder, you

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.710
might already know intuitively,
well then we're going to be

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.810
at a temperature of
negative 2 degrees.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050
So that's all a
negative number means.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.870
And just remember when a
negative number is big, so like

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.100
negative 50, that's actually
colder than negative 20, right?

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.920
So a negative 50 is actually
even a smaller number than

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.890
negative 20 because it's even
further to the left

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.720
of negative 20.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.170
That's just something you'll
get an intuitive feel for.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.400
Sometimes when you start you
feel like oh, 50's a bigger

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.770
number than 20, but it's a
negative 50 as opposed

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.860
to a positive 50.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.470
So let's do some problems, and
I'm going to keep using the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.290
number line because I
think it's useful.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.790
So let's do the
problem 5 minus 12.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.810
I think you already might
have an intuition of

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.896
what this equals.

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:34.600
But let me draw a
line, 5 minus 12.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.936
So let me start with minus 10,
minus 9, minus 8 --I think I'm

00:02:52.936 --> 00:02:58.170
going to run out of space --
minus 7, minus 6, minus 5 -- I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.380
should have this pre-drawn --
minus 4, minus 3, minus 2,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:11.470
minus 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
I'll put 5 right here.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.570
5 minus 12.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.440
So if we start at 5 -- let me
use a different color -- we

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.945
start at 5 right here and we're
going to go to the left 12

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:22.800
because we're subtracting 12.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:33.880
So then we go 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.780
Negative 7.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.010
That's pretty interesting.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.020
Because it also happens
to be that 12 minus 5

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.590
is equal to positive 7.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.910
So, I want you to think a
little bit about why that is.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.980
Why the difference between 12
and 5 is 7, and the difference

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.200
between -- well, I
guess it's either way.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.025
Because in this situation we're
also saying that the difference

00:04:01.025 --> 00:04:04.730
between 5 and 12 is negative 7,
but the numbers are that far

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.270
apart, but now we're starting
with the lower number.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.640
I think that last sentence just
completely confused you, but

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.620
we'll keep moving forward.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.070
We just said 5 minus 12
is equal to minus 7.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.480
Let's do another one.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.720
What's negative 3
plus 5 equals what?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.060
Well, let's use the
same number line.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.490
Let's go to negative 3 plus 5.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.590
So we're going to
go to the right 5.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.530
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.950
It's a 2.

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:44.230
It equals 2.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.790
So negative 3 plus
5 is equal to 2.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.720
That's interesting because 5
minus 3 is also equal to 2.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.340
Well, it turns out that 5 minus
3 is the same thing, it's just

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.990
another way of writing 5
plus negative 3 or

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.050
negative 3 plus 5.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.400
A general, easy way to always
do negative numbers is it's

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.650
just like regular subtraction
and addition and subtraction,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.026
but now when we subtract we
can go to the left below 0.

00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:19.720
Let's do another one.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.000
So what happens when you get
let's say 2 minus minus 3?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.960
Well, if you think about how
it should work out I think

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.030
this will make sense.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.720
But it turns out that the
negative number, the negative

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.150
signs actually cancel out.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.610
So this is the same thing
as 2 plus plus 3, and

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.060
that just equals 5.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.530
Another way you could say is --
let's do another one -- what

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.630
is negative 7 minus minus 2?

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.030
Well that's the same thing
as negative 7 plus 2.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.400
And remember, so we're doing to
start at negative 7 and we're

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.570
going to move two to the right.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.475
So if we move one to the right
we go to negative 6, and then

00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:08.340
we move two to the right
we get negative 5.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.950
That makes sense because
negative 7 plus 2, that's the

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.550
same thing as 2 minus 7.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.720
If it's 2 degrees and it gets 7
degrees colder, it's minus 5.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.240
Let's do a bunch of these.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.360
I think the more you do the
more practice you have, and the

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.000
modules explain it pretty well,
probably better than I do.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.990
So let's just do a
ton of problems.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.350
So if I said
negative 7 minus 3.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.760
Well, now we're going
to go three to the

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.410
left of negative 7.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.740
We're going to get 3 less
than negative 7 so that's

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.430
negative 10, right?

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.280
That makes sense, because if we
had positive 7 plus 3 we're at

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.880
7 to the right of 0 and we're
going to go three more to the

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.045
right of 0 and we
get positive 10.

00:06:54.045 --> 00:06:57.580
So for 7 to the left of 0 and
go three more to the left we're

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.690
going to get negative 10.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.470
Let's do a bunch more.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.110
I know I'm probably confusing
you, but practice is what's

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.120
going to really help us.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:12.180
So say 3 minus minus 3, well,
these negatives cancel out

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.580
so that just equals 6.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.990
What's 3 minus 3?

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.410
Well, that's easy
that's just 0.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.990
What's minus 3 minus 3?

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.420
Well now we're going to get
three less than minus 3,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.890
well that's minus is 6.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:34.040
What's minus 3 minus minus 3?

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.510
Interesting.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.800
Well, the minuses cancel out
so you get minus 3 plus 3.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.530
Well, if we start three to the
left of 0 and we move three to

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.070
the right we end up at 0 again.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.260
So that makes sense, right?

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.370
Let me do that again.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.290
Minus 3 minus minus 3.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.400
Anything minus itself
should equal 0, right?

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.960
That's why that equals 0.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.170
And that's why it makes sense
that those two negatives

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.160
cancel out and that's
the same thing as this.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.430
Let's do a bunch more.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.150
Let's do 12 minus 13.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.620
That's pretty easy.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.950
Well, 12 minus 12 is 0, so
12 minus 13 is negative 1

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.930
because we're going to
go one the left of 0.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.670
Let's do 8 minus 5.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.280
Well, this one is just a
normal problem, that's 3.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.650
What's 5 minus 8?

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.080
Well, we're going to go all the
way to 0 and then 3 more to the

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.430
left of zero, so it's minus 3.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.510
I could draw a
number line here.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:46.180
If this is 0 this is 5, and now
we're going to go to left 8,

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.310
then we end up and negative 3.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.410
You could do that
for all of these.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.780
That actually might
be a good exercise.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.590
I think this will give you good
introduction and I recommend

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.030
that you just do the modules
because the modules actually,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.450
especially if you do the hints,
it has a pretty nice graphic

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.350
that's a lot nicer than
anything I could draw

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.870
on this chalkboard.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.740
So try that out and I'm going
to try to record some more

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.150
modules that hopefully won't
confuse you as badly.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.210
You could also attend the
seminar on adding and

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.700
subtracting negative numbers.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.170
I hope you have fun.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.470
Bye.
