00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.237
- [Voiceover] So we've been
talking about the system

00:00:02.237 --> 00:00:04.438
of Jim Crow segregation

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:07.938
and in the last video we left off in 1876.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:14.042
And in 1876 there was a
contested presidential election

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:18.209
between a Republican candidate
named Rutherford B. Hayes

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:26.181
and a Democratic candidate
named Samuel J. Tilden.

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:34.796
And in this election there
was one of the rare cases

00:00:34.796 --> 00:00:38.296
where Tilden actually won the popular vote

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:42.500
whereas Hayes won the electoral vote.

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:47.184
So there's a standoff
in Congress for months

00:00:47.184 --> 00:00:50.284
over how this presidential
election is going to end

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:54.440
and eventually they make
kind of a backroom deal

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.107
known as the Compromise of 1877.

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:03.460
And in this compromise the
Democrats and the Republicans

00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:08.761
agree that Hayes, a Republican,

00:01:10.694 --> 00:01:13.202
will get to be President
of the United States.

00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:15.785
In exchange the military forces

00:01:16.778 --> 00:01:19.483
that have been occupying the South,

00:01:19.483 --> 00:01:21.399
especially the last two states

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.814
of Louisiana and South Carolina

00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:26.762
and have been enforcing the 14th Amendment

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:30.013
or the equal citizenship of
African Americans in the South

00:01:30.013 --> 00:01:31.104
they're going to leave,

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:32.799
they're going to go back to their barracks

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.493
and will no longer interfere

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:37.757
in the political system of the South.

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:40.257
So with the Compromise of 1877

00:01:41.138 --> 00:01:44.818
the Republican Party which
has been standing behind

00:01:44.818 --> 00:01:46.316
the rights of African Americans,

00:01:46.316 --> 00:01:49.393
remember the Republicans were
the Party of Abraham Lincoln,

00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:53.933
pretty much gives up as a
Party on trying to ensure

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:57.137
the racial equality of African Americans.

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:58.634
Now why did they do this?

00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:03.395
Well, I think mainly this
was a question of weariness

00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:05.171
and giving up on their part.

00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:09.432
Remember that the Civil War ended in 1865,

00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:12.015
now it's 12 years later in 1877

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:15.957
and there are still Federal
troops in the South.

00:02:15.957 --> 00:02:19.858
So imagine if you were a
parent in Massachusetts

00:02:19.858 --> 00:02:21.738
and you thought that your son

00:02:21.738 --> 00:02:24.351
who was enlisted in the Union
Army was going to come home

00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:28.518
in 1865 and now it's 1877 and
he's still in South Carolina

00:02:29.413 --> 00:02:32.187
it seems like a long time to fight a war.

00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:33.646
So that's one part of it.

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:36.646
The other part of it is that in 1873

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.306
there is an economic panic,
this is an early Depression.

00:02:43.758 --> 00:02:45.662
You know we often think
of the Great Depression

00:02:45.662 --> 00:02:49.481
as the only time the
United States was stricken

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:52.419
with an economic downturn
but before the Depression

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.262
there were about 20 year
cycles of boom and bust.

00:02:56.262 --> 00:03:00.767
So in 1873 there was an
economic bust that meant

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:04.934
that people had less money
to throw at the problem

00:03:05.773 --> 00:03:07.619
of reconstruction in the South.

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.056
And I would say the last
part of this is a combination

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:15.223
of racism and the new labor
movement in the North.

00:03:17.035 --> 00:03:20.298
So as whites in the North
got farther and farther away

00:03:20.298 --> 00:03:24.059
from the Civil War the animating spirit

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.630
of abolition started to
fade among many Northerners.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.797
The late 19th century was an
era of increasing racialization

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:37.122
especially as new ethnic classes
came into the United States

00:03:37.122 --> 00:03:39.108
from Southern and Eastern Europe

00:03:39.108 --> 00:03:42.092
and so there was a new
interpretation of race

00:03:42.092 --> 00:03:45.087
that really came to the
foreground in this time period

00:03:45.087 --> 00:03:47.002
which we call Social Darwinism

00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:49.673
and we'll talk more about
that in other videos.

00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:52.912
But the interpretation
of racial difference

00:03:52.912 --> 00:03:57.568
and hierarchy among the races
became more broadly accepted

00:03:57.568 --> 00:04:00.307
throughout the United States
not just in the South.

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:03.890
So in 1877 the Federal
troops in the South,

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:07.413
that are remaining, pack
their bags and go home

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.224
meaning that African
Americans in the South

00:04:09.224 --> 00:04:13.590
have no one to protect them
from the Southern governments

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.932
and so within months many of
these governments pass the laws

00:04:17.932 --> 00:04:20.788
which we now call Jim Crow laws.

00:04:20.788 --> 00:04:21.809
And these are the laws

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:24.573
which prevent African
Americans from voting,

00:04:24.573 --> 00:04:27.754
prevent intermarriage
between whites and blacks,

00:04:27.754 --> 00:04:31.086
and also enact all of these separations

00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:33.024
of public accommodations

00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:35.184
that we now associate with Jim Crow,

00:04:35.184 --> 00:04:36.867
sitting in the back of the bus,

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:38.713
using a separate water fountain.

00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:41.407
Now if it sounds like these sorts of laws

00:04:41.407 --> 00:04:45.564
are directly in contradiction
with the 14th Amendment

00:04:45.564 --> 00:04:49.731
which says that laws cannot
target a specific race,

00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:54.224
that there's equal
protection under the law

00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:56.523
for everyone born in the United States

00:04:56.523 --> 00:04:59.170
you're right that's exactly
what these laws are.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.632
They are a contradiction
of the 14th Amendment.

00:05:01.632 --> 00:05:05.715
And in 1896 a man named
Homer Plessy was arrested

00:05:08.586 --> 00:05:11.628
for sitting in a white train compartment.

00:05:11.628 --> 00:05:13.392
You thought Rosa Parks was the first

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:15.029
but in fact it's Homer Plessy

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:17.526
who tries to desegregate trains.

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:20.544
In fact he's trying to
test the constitutionality

00:05:20.544 --> 00:05:24.166
of having segregated
train compartments in 1896

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:27.092
and his case goes all the
way to the Supreme Court

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:31.864
which rules that it is
fine to separate the races

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:35.974
as long as separate
accommodations are equal.

00:05:35.974 --> 00:05:40.141
So this is the place where
separate but equal comes in.

00:05:42.313 --> 00:05:46.480
Now in theory, separate
accommodations for whites and blacks

00:05:49.674 --> 00:05:51.543
were supposed to be equal,

00:05:51.543 --> 00:05:56.164
in reality they almost never
were and in fact it was the

00:05:56.164 --> 00:06:00.587
very separation itself
that implied the inequality

00:06:00.587 --> 00:06:03.849
and that is what the
NAACP is going to argue

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:08.006
in the Brown versus Board
of Education case in 1954

00:06:08.006 --> 00:06:11.210
which overturns this doctrine
of separate but equal.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.793
But in-between this
period of 1877 and 1954

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.485
Jim Crow laws were on the books

00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:23.191
in all of the Southern states.

00:06:23.191 --> 00:06:24.933
But I don't want you to come away thinking

00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:27.510
that things were terrible in the South

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.773
and that the North was a racial utopia

00:06:30.773 --> 00:06:34.940
even though segregation laws
and violence such as lynching

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:40.026
to enforce segregation laws
existed mainly in the South,

00:06:40.026 --> 00:06:43.291
de facto segregation and
widespread racial prejudice

00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:46.356
also existed in the North
particularly in housing

00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:48.051
and job discrimination.

00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:49.978
And of course, 1954,

00:06:49.978 --> 00:06:52.555
the Brown versus Board
of Education decision

00:06:52.555 --> 00:06:56.515
didn't end segregation
or end racial prejudice

00:06:56.515 --> 00:07:01.228
in the United States, it's
enforcing the end of segregation

00:07:01.228 --> 00:07:04.908
and enforcing the end of
some of these de facto forms

00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:07.730
of segregation and racial
prejudice in the North

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.900
that will be the real focus
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.220
So I think the real
tragedy of the Jim Crow era

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.588
was that it didn't have
to be this way, in fact,

00:07:16.588 --> 00:07:20.675
it was just in this
presidential election of 1876

00:07:20.675 --> 00:07:23.589
that the Federal government
more or less gave up

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:25.876
on protecting the rights
of African Americans.

00:07:25.876 --> 00:07:28.512
It's interesting to imagine
what life in the South

00:07:28.512 --> 00:07:30.032
might have been like

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:32.552
had the Federal government not given up.

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:35.478
Perhaps it would be very
different, perhaps it would not

00:07:35.478 --> 00:07:37.196
but it's hard not to mourn

00:07:37.196 --> 00:07:41.631
the lost opportunity of
reconstruction, this 12 year period

00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:44.231
where African Americans had voting rights

00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:47.287
and often served in public office.

00:07:47.287 --> 00:07:51.270
Instead, the United States
doomed African American citizens

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.263
in the South to another almost 100 years

00:07:55.263 --> 00:07:57.538
of second class status in our society.
