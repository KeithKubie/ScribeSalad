00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.420
I figure now is as good a time
as any to learn about probably

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.420
what most people focus the
most on when they analyze

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.190
companies, and that's the
income statement.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.600
And the income statement is
one of the three financial

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.620
statements that you'll look at
when you look at a company.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.360
There's the income statement
and the other two are the

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.560
balance sheet, which I have
drawn a lot in a lot of the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.760
other explanations I've done
on the financial crisis and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.330
whatever else.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.640
And actually, in this video,
we're going to see how the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.750
income statement relates
to the balance sheet.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.670
And, of course, the last one--
well, it's not of course if

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.015
you don't know it-- is the
cash flow statement.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.190
And we'll focus on that a
little bit later because

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.080
that's a little bit more
nuanced relative

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.730
to the income statement.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.570
So the income statement is
literally just saying how much

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.925
a company might earn in a given
period, and it's always

00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:48.920
related to a period.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.890
So it could be an annual
income statement.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.790
It could be for the year 2008.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.480
It could be a quarterly
income statement.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.970
Those are usually the two
types that you see, but

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.390
sometimes, there's monthly or
six-month income statements.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.080
And the general format is pretty
consistent, although

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.410
there is a lot of variation
depending on what a business

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.320
does, but in this video, I
really just want to cover

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.020
almost a plain vanilla income
statement for a company that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.680
just sells a widget.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.980
So the first thing when you sell
a widget is you make it

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.440
and you just sell it.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.290
You sell the widget.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.630
You give a customer a widget,
and they give you some money.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.310
And that money that they give
you-- and I'm not going to get

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.040
too technical about the
accounting right now-- is

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.290
considered revenue.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.080
It's sometimes considered
sales.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.590
And that's literally the money
that they give you at a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.620
certain period of time.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.760
And some of you accountants out
there are like, oh, well,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.450
no, that's not just the money
that they give you.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.680
It's the money that you've
earned in a certain period of

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.710
time, and that's true.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.790
But for our sake, let's just
say that when you give the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.410
widget, you have earned the
money that they give you, and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.460
that's revenue sales.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.750
Later on, we'll talk about
different ways to account

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.200
revenue and sales.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.620
So let's say the revenue or the
sales in this case in a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.060
given period, let's say
that this is an income

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.700
statement for 2008.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.050
So over 2008, we sold
let's say $3

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.570
million worth of widgets.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.340
So let's say it's $3 million.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.970
And a lot of times when you look
at income statements for

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.040
companies, if you go to Yahoo!

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.310
Finance, you could do this right
now, instead of writing

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.520
$3 million, you'll
see $3,000 there.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.160
It's like, oh, my God!

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.440
This company, they're hardly
selling anything.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.250
But it's kind of a standard that
they tend to write things

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.050
in thousands.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.950
So 3,000 would be
3,000 thousands,

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.000
which would be 3 million.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.060
And for really big companies,
they actually sometimes write

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.330
their numbers in millions.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.530
So if you saw 3,000 there, it
would actually mean 3 billion.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.190
But we'll actually look at real
income statements in the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.310
not-too-far-off future.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.770
So that's how much money
they give us.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.910
But that's not how much income
we made, because there was a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.750
lot of cost that went into
making that widget that we

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.280
have to account for.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.710
It's not like when someone gives
me $3 million, I can

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.100
just say, oh, I made
$3 million.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.460
Let me just put it
all in the bank.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.040
I'm done.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.980
That was all income.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.720
So the first thing that you
tend to see on an income

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.930
statement is the cost of those
actual widgets, the cost of

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.510
producing those widgets.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.550
And I'll put all my expenses
in magenta.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.870
So it'll sometimes be written
as cost of sales or cost of

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.120
goods sold.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.570
And this is literally-- well,
there's two things.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.190
There's a variable cost which
is, each widget, they might

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.800
have used some amount of metal
and some amount of energy to

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.540
produce it and some
amount of paint if

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.960
it's a painted widget.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.490
And so that the cost of goods
is literally how much did it

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.680
cost to buy the metal and the
paint and provide the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.000
electricity to make those $3
million worth of widgets.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.820
That's the variable cost. And
then on top of that you have

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.500
the fixed costs, or the
relatively fixed costs, where

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.280
just to have the factory open,
it costs a certain amount of

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.960
money every year, regardless of
how many widgets you make.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.960
And we'll go into more detail
on that, But for simplicity,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.070
let's say all those costs
of making the

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.730
widgets were $1 million.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.220
So sometimes someone might say
it's a $1 million cost. When I

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.870
make models, I like to put
a minus there, so that I

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.370
remember that that's a cost.
Anything that detracts from

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.550
income I put as a minus.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.760
Anything that adds is a plus,
although that's not

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.430
necessarily the standard
convention.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.820
Some people say, oh, it's a
positive $1 million cost,

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.920
which means you subtract.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.730
But either way I think
you get the point.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.430
And then if you subtract your
costs from your revenue, or if

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.280
you just add these two numbers,
because this one is

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.490
negative, you have your
gross profit.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.900
And in this case, it would
be $2 million.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.260
And this number tells you, how
much money did you make, or

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.350
how much profit did
you make just from

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.680
selling these widgets?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.530
So the more widgets you sell,
in most circumstances, the

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.560
larger this number
is going to be.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.720
So this is your profit before
all of the other expenses that

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.290
a company has to incur,
like the taxes

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.730
and the CEO's salary.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.610
The CEO's salary doesn't
go in here, right?

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.890
Because the CEO doesn't go out
there to the factory in most

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.480
cases and actually help
make the widget.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.610
So the CEO's salary or the
CFO's salary or the

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.160
headquarters in a nice
skyscraper, that doesn't get

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.140
factored in here.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.620
Or the marketing
expense, right?

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.490
You have to tell people, hey,
we make good widgets.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.240
So none of that is
factored in here.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.680
So that goes into
the next line.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.410
And oftentimes, you'll see it
broken up, where they'll have

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.660
marketing expense.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.200
Sometimes you have to pay
salespeople, so you might have

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.380
sales expense, and then the
stuff like the corporate

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.500
office and the CEO's salary, and
you have to hire auditors

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.050
and accountants and
all of that.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.130
That might be included
as general.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.770
Actually, I should be doing this
in magenta because it's

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.300
all expenses.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.900
Marketing, sales, and then
G&amp;A you'll sometimes see.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.790
Sometimes you'll see SG&amp;A.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.920
G&amp;A just stands for general and
administrative expenses.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.450
If you see SG&amp;A-- sometimes
instead of that you'll see

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.420
SG&amp;A-- that mean selling,
general and

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.580
administrative expenses.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.920
Selling is things like, it could
be the commissions that

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.070
the salespeople get.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.830
It could be just the cost of
having salespeople travel

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.060
around the country and taking
people out to steak dinners.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.330
And then the general and
administrative, that's just

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.270
all the stuff that the corporate
office does, and all

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.110
the people who are
at that level.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.380
So if you subtract these, and
I'm just making up these

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.120
numbers as I go.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.220
Say, in marketing, the company
is spending $500,000.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.280
And I'm putting it as a minus
because I like to remember

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.160
it's an expense.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.180
Some models you'll
see, they'll say

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.340
it's $500,000 expense.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.870
Sales, let's say, this
is just G&amp;A here.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.130
I want to make a separate
line for sales.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:24.840
So let's say sales, selling
expenses is $200,000.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.400
And let's say G&amp;A, the corporate
offices and all of

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.840
that, let's see that's
another $300,000.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.210
And now we're ready to figure
out how much money did the

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.610
operations of this
business make?

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.260
So this is operating profit.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.500
This is really important to pay
attention to, because so

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.410
many people say, oh, a company
made this much.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.940
And you'll hear these numbers,
gross and operating profit and

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.570
net profit and pretax profit,
and it's very hard to

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.890
understand that these are
actually very, very different

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.590
things, because they all have
the word "profit," and what

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.250
does gross and operating
and all that mean?

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.300
But here you see it means very,
very different things.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.900
Let's calculate this number
first before I go off on one

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.110
of my tangents on all the
differences between the

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.460
operating and the
gross profit.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.450
But let's see, 2 million
minus 1 million.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.920
My head I think implicitly
made the

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.940
numbers work out nicely.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:23.030
So my operating profit
here is $1 million.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.830
So already we have some
new nuance on profit.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.150
I made $2 million just from
actual widget sales, but then

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.520
when you take out all of the
overhead of the company, the

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.210
marketing, the sales, the
general and administrative

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.030
expenses, I'm only left
with $1 million.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.610
And this is the profit from the
operations of the company,

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.390
or you could say from the assets
or from the business or

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.920
from the enterprise
of the company.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.500
That's what it is generating.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.890
But we can see-- I've drawn a
bunch of balance sheets before

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.410
and I think this is a good time
to draw a balance sheet.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.390
So you have kind of the
assets of a company.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.570
And we'll talk a little bit
more about assets and

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.460
enterprise value, and there's
a little bit of a nuance

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.800
there, but essentially
the company itself.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.415
Before you think about how the
company is paid for or how

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:11.420
it's funded, if you just think
about the enterprise itself,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.450
the assets.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.980
The assets are generating
this.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.660
They're generating the operating
profit, and that's a

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.400
very important thing to realize
in the future when we

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.590
talk about return on assets.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.360
Actually, we could talk
about it now.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:31.070
Let's say our assets, if we
paid $10 million for these

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.650
assets, and these assets-- this
is the income statement

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.410
for 2008-- are spitting out $1
million a year, or at least $1

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.390
million in this year, our return
on asset-- I wasn't

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.850
planning on introducing this,
but it doesn't hurt to

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:47.450
introduce it right now-- our
return on asset, often

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:53.530
acronymed ROA, would be-- well,
the numerator is the

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.485
return, which is $1 million.

00:09:57.485 --> 00:10:01.240
The denominator is the
assets, $10 million.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.660
So we got a 10% return
on our assets.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.240
For a $10 million investment,
we're getting

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.090
$1 million a year.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.580
We're getting 10% of our asset
investment back every year.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.580
So that's a nice thing to keep
in the back of your mind, this

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.860
return on asset concept, and
it's very closely tied to

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.170
operating profits and the
actual assets of a firm.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.970
What we've learned, and
especially if you watched some

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.880
of my other economics videos,
that all companies aren't

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.430
financed the same.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.040
A lot of them might
have some debt.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.670
So let's say that company had
$10 million of assets, but

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.380
let's say they paid for it
with $5 million of debt.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.370
And let's say the interest rate
on that debt is-- let me

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:50.595
think of a good number-- 5%.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.190
Let's make it easier.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.720
Let's make it 10% interest.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.240
So this is the operating
profit.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.790
This is the money that just
comes out of the asset itself.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.980
But, of course, that's not the
money that we get to take

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.090
home, because we have to pay
this interest. So let's throw

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.340
that in there as an expense.

00:11:13.475 --> 00:11:14.320
Interest expense.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.350
And obviously, a company that
has no debt will have no

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.540
interest expense, but
in this case, we do.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.350
And this is an annual
income statement.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.990
So let's see, if we have $5
million of debt, and we're

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:30.240
paying 10% on that, 10% of $5
million is $500,000 a year in

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.970
interest. So we have to
essentially take half of our

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.660
operating profit and give
it back to the bank.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.150
And now we are left with our--
we're getting close to where

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.650
we need to get to--
pre-tax income.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:58.060
And if we do the subtraction,
we're at $500,000.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.950
And you could guess what the
next line is going to be,

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.290
given that this says pre-tax.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.770
This is what the owners of the
company get before they pay

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.510
the government.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.875
So you can guess what
the next line is.

00:12:07.875 --> 00:12:09.125
It's going to be taxes.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.760
Let's say that it's a 30%
corporate tax rate, and you're

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.020
going to take 30% of this
number right here.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.520
30% of that number
right there.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:28.580
So 30% of $500,000
is $150,000.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.060
And then we are done.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.020
We finally have paid off
everybody we need to pay off.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.060
So we started off with
$3 million up here.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.500
We kept paying a bunch of
expenses, and then now we're

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.650
left with what?

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:48.610
This is $350,000
of net income.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.300
And this is what goes to the
owners of the company.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.910
This net income right here.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.000
So going back to our balance
sheet, we had a $10 million

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.540
asset, we had $5 million
of debt.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.600
We know what's left over
is the equity.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.640
So let me do that in
a vibrant color.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.120
Equity is what's left over.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.100
So let's say this is
all book value.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.880
So we have $5 million
of equity.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.430
And when I say book value,
that's just a fancy way of

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.810
saying this is what our
accountants say that we paid

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.830
for the stuff.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.180
This is what we have
on our books.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.920
And we'll talk later about
depreciation and amortization

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.620
and how we might change what
these values are, but a very

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.380
simple way is, if you went out
and bought $10 million worth

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.910
of stuff, you'd write on
your books, I have

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.250
a $10 million asset.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.010
And if you took a $5 million
loan, then what you really

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.260
own, if you were to kind of sell
all of this, you would

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.955
get $5 million of equity.

00:13:46.955 --> 00:13:48.890
And I think this is an
interesting thing.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.630
When we did return on asset,
we looked at the operating

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:55.010
profit, because this is what our
company generated before

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.820
we paid the bank or Uncle Sam
or anything like that.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.340
And so we took this number as
the numerator and we divided

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.840
by the number of assets.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.285
Now we can do another notion,
and that's return on equity.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.620
In return on equity, the
numerator is the net income

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.460
that we got, so it's $350,000.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.120
And the denominator here is the
equity, the book value of

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.040
our equity, so that's
$5 million.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.300
One, two, three.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.200
One, two, three.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.250
Let's cancel some zeroes out.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.380
So it's like 35/500.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:38.230
35/500 is the same thing
is 7/100, so it equals

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.460
7% return on equity.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.650
And that's interesting because,
well, why that's

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.780
lower is-- well, I don't want
to go into too much depth

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.330
because I realize I'm already
pushing my time limit.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.730
But at this point, you should
have a good understanding of

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.720
at least a basic income
statement of a company that

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.420
sells widgets.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.010
And in the future, we're gonna
look at a lot of different

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.830
companies, financial companies,
insurance

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.650
companies, natural gas pipeline
companies, that will

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.100
have very different-looking
income statements, but this

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.210
gives you the general template
for how things work.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.920
And at least it'll give you a
sense of how revenues, gross

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.300
profit, operating profit,
pre-tax income and net income

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.570
really are different.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.960
A lot of times in the
popular press.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.940
They're all jumbled up as just
kind of the company is making

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.930
this much money.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.490
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
