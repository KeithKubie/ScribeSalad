Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Two. One.

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       Hello Michelle. How's it going? And really crack my neck. Oh, go ahead. Crack your neck. Put it up. Put the microphone to it so we can hear it. Does it pop? Ooh, that was a good one. That was a good one. Did you do that all the time? It's just when I'm getting ready to throw down. Pull this up. Microphone. Like a fist from your face. There we go. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. So what's happening?

Speaker 1:          00:00:27       No, we're just in town. Um, uh, my brother in law just moved, just got stationed here in California, so we drove them down and then we did the whole, um, no, I think it's, it's actually an hour south of here. I think it's not close by, but cool air force. And so we did the whole thing. Yes. Yeah. So he got stationed there.

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       That was the first time I ever saw, um, a stealth bomber. It was like at right after nine one, one we were filming, um, uh, fear factor out there and I saw one fly overhead. It's like a Ufo was like, wow, that is crazy. Does it look like a Ufo? Yeah. It doesn't even look real. You ever seen one in real life? It looks like, Huh? Like a Batmobile, like, like Batman's plane. It's so crazy when you see one fly and you're like, wow, the engineering involved in something like that. It's insane. And that was a while back. Yeah, sure. It was 2001 because it was right after nine 11. So it was 2000 that's it right there. That's what we saw on of them. One of them is a, there's, it'd be two and this is like a f one 16 or something like that. I don't know which one we saw, but it was black and wicked looking

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       nice. That's crazy. It looks like your Tesla flying around and one of those things. That's what we thought. Imagine back then, that's what it looked like back then. So what, what, what is there now? You probably can't see him. I'd probably look like the sky. I probably owe you from military background. My Dad. Yeah, my dad was him. So that's where my parents met. My Dad was stationed in Germany. My mom was fleeing Thailand. Um, to her, her first husband was like physically abusive to her. So she was leaving Thailand and she came to Germany to find her a Gi and then found my dad. She came to find a Gi specifically. Well, you know, I think she's coming to get away, but she wanted to, she wanted a better life for her son at the time. And my dad was in the hospital and so my mom was taking care of them and cooking and food and made him fall in love it. My Dad always jokes, he says, he tells us a story all the time. He's like, yeah, your mom was taking care of me. And then she told me that you were pregnant and then 12 months later you were born. Oh, that's funny. So, but now they fell in love.

Speaker 2:          00:02:51       It was just a really long pregnancy. This weird, just kind of weird. I don't know why. Yes,

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       I don't know. But that was very small, but no. Yeah. And then so then we moved to Colorado and I was born then we lived in Germany for a little bit when I was younger. And then back to Colorado and I grew up in Aurora, Colorado. Oh, cool. When did you start training? Um, probably around 10. Yeah. Yeah, around 10. Um, I have, I have an older brother, he's four years older than me. He's my half brother. And, um, I really wanted to do gymnastics as a kid and my parents just, we just couldn't afford, it was really expensive. And so my brother found, um, a little karate spot at the church, just across the street and it was a community, like a community, a karate thing. And so it's something that all three of us could do. And so yeah, we jumped into it and I fell in love with it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       I just, it just took over my life and changed, changed my life. Did you start competing really quickly? Yeah, I think so. Um, and at first it's funny because at first, um, so I would do like the karate tournament and so there's point sparring and then there's the Cahtos and I thought the Cahtos were silly. And I remember going in and doing point sparring and I'm getting knocked on my button. I was like, okay, I think I, I want to do some cod is then I want to bring some trophies home. So, but um, so yeah, I competed co put uh, karate from 10 all the way up until I was 18. And so I did a lot of the like the flashy, like, um, extreme martial arts, Carter's with the, um, like the flips and stuff like that. But I always, I always came back to sparring because I wasn't good at it. Like I was like, ah, it, it bugged me. It bugged me that I, that I wasn't good at it. And then I found my niche because it's point sparring, so you get to two points to the head for kicks to the head. So I would just sit back and let him come in and just kick him in the head. I'm Cuban had come times and win the fight.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       So how did you go from that to, did you go from that to kickboxing or did you go right into MMA? Like when did you, when did you just start training?

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       So, so I did, I did karate and then I got my black belt in karate, what kind of American freestyle. And then, so I think around 18 or 19, I was kind of just exploring, doing a couple of different things. So I did, we'll shoot for a couple of years and I competed in wool shoe and then I did a little bit of Campbell and um, and then kind of dabbled a little bit into um, kickboxing. And uh, so it, it kind of just happened pretty strangely. I was in college, I was working at Hooters and I was doing the, all these like little side jobs. I'm like, fuck doing photo shoots for this and that. And um, I was a ring girl for MMA shell. I hadn't ever seen MMA. And I remember, uh, just walking around the cage and thinking I want to be like on the inside.

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       I that one that looks cool. I think I could do it cause it was mixed martial arts, you know, and I remember talking to her motor and he kind of laughed me off and was just like, whatever, you know, you're a ring girl. And, um, it was a smaller local show. Donald Cerrone was actually fighting on that show and he overheard me yeah. In, so he came to my work at Hooters and I wasn't there and he was just like left me know if serious about fighting, get your ass in the gym. Wow. Then there was, this is in Colorado, Colorado. And then I saw, I went to go train and went to go train and wood with Donald and you know, we, we, Jim hopped from place to play is I trained with, um, with Duane. I trained, um, with Trevor. I trained with, with, with all the guys.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       Wow. And, um, and so I took a couple of smokers would drive, you know, drive around the region and, and took a couple smokers and then, um, it was like at that point when I was still in college and, um, I just was not happy in college. I, I was kind of wandering around aimlessly is really successful in high school and uh, you know, um, it just didn't transfer over to college. I, I still, I got good grades. I was 3.8, you know, I was going to do you, but I wasn't happy. I just, I there was something missing and it was, it was the martial arts. So this is a big part of my life.

Speaker 3:          00:07:21       And you needed a real challenge. Yeah. It's something physical to probably right. Yeah. I would imagine that someone growing up doing martial arts as long as you did, you like the thrill of using your body and moving around. It's like that it's so important. Like once, once you do that and you compete and it's becomes a part of, you did the idea of like sitting in the classroom all day and then eventually sitting in a job all day, that's probably not, not that compelling.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       Yeah, I think so. I think that, um, I just loved going to school for, I was going to school, so I was double majoring in theater and sports science. So was majoring in theater because I got a scholarship for it and I was doing sports science. I wanted to be like physical therapist for um, like a sports team or something like that or even a martial arts team. But uh, yeah, so I, I decided to take a, like a little bit like a break from that and my mom, my grandma was sick in Thailand. So then I was like, I told my mom, I just go with her for the summer and he went to visit my grandma and Thailand and all those out there. I, um, I went to sit your tongue more Thai camp and I absolutely fell in love with it. They made fun of me because of my, my karate kicks.

Speaker 3:          00:08:34       Yeah. It's interesting how, how different karate kicks are. Yeah. Thai kicks.

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       Yeah. And they were looking at me like I was crazy, but it was like, but no, I'm a black belt. I know what I'm doing there. Just laughing at me with training on concrete outside these little five year old kids are doing 10 year old, 10 minute rounds. And um, my feet are blistering up from kicking and over and over on the concrete. But I loved it. I fell in love with it. It kicked my butt and I fell in love with it and I came back and I dropped out of college and I decided to

Speaker 2:          00:09:05       pursue fighting. Wow. So where did you learn grappling?

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       It's so, so my first MMA fight was kind of just, it was supposed to be an amateur fight and I'm, like I said, it was training with, um, with Donald and he was training at a school in Vail. And so I would, I would go to, I would, um, I would work on the weekends and then drive up to Vail and train, uh, my grappling and all of it, like the, like all of the MMA. And so,

Speaker 2:          00:09:42       so you basically train MMA together. He didn't take specific grapping in classes, but would've imagined that that was the thing that you needed to concentrate on the most, right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       [inaudible]. Yeah. And I figured, okay, is my, my, my pro day or it wasn't, it was supposed to be amateur, but the girl that I was supposed to fight fell through and I'm the only girl that they had available was already pro. She was like two, no pro. And of course you know how Donald is, he's like, whatever. Fuck it, just do it. And so that's a good Donald accent. So I was like, all right. I mean we've been training. So I literally had four weeks in my, um, in my, like throughout my, my karate career, we would have grappling nights when we would do grappling, but it wasn't anything like substantial. So yeah, four weeks of, of grappling training and I figured, okay, you know, I'll just use my stand up to, to win the fight. And she was swinging from, from way back here and trying to take my head off. So I ended up taking her down. I ended up taking down like six or seven times and, and winning the fight by taking her down in ground and pounding.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       That's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy. Did you say while you were doing it? Like, wow, this is so weird that I'm doing this. It was, I wasn't thinking at all. I was just in the moment having the time of my life. Were you thinking that this was what you're going to wind up doing, like professionally or were you just thinking, I can't believe I'm doing this?

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       I, yeah, that's exactly what I was like, this is so much fun. Um, it was that the Broomfield events or not, I dunno if that's still called the Broomfield, the Ben Center

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       in Colorado, but yeah, I think a bank owns it now or something. Yeah, those changed names. It was so much fun, but never in my life. I thought I would, I would be a top UFC contender. Never. And on your way, your goal is to be the first mommy yeah. To ever a title. Yeah. That's possible. 100%. You're in the, you're in the hunt right now. Like what are you ranked? Um, ranked seven, seventh, but I don't think the rankings are anything. They're weird. They're weird. Yeah. There's like sometimes someone will beat somebody and then that person is still ahead of in the racking. I'm like, explain that. I just, I don't understand the rankings though. I feel like I've, I've won my last two fights and I've gone down and rankings you want to, hasn't fought and she's gone down in rankings. Um, and some of the girls haven't fought and they've gone up and rankings.

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       Uh, I just think the rankings are crazy. Yeah. Well it's a bunch of people get to submit their positions. Right. Like a bunch of journalists and excepted experts on MMA. Good to have an idea. I guess when I look at them and, because sometimes I feel like it shifts depending on who they're trying to push or, you know, just sometimes I feel like just storyline kind of can dictate. Yeah. The, the rankings, you know, obviously I'm a giant fan of the UFC. I loved them to death. I'm so happy and I just would do nothing for any other organization. They never want to work for another organization, but I don't like the way they do things. There's a lot of things that I don't like. They just stay as cut. Elias Theodora really? Yeah. One loss. Derek Robertson cut. I'm like what? They cut Derek Beth. No, he lost the dark hair.

Speaker 2:          00:12:57       I was like, what? Just one. I'm like, explain that. How do you explain that one? That one doesn't make any sense. There's like some match ups don't make any sense. Interim title shots. Those are preposterous. It's crazy. Yeah. I mean I understand it's, it's as machine, it has to work and they're trying, but it just, it, um, especially for like a fighter whose life depends on yeah, the fights and you know, your livelihood depends on that and for it do you just to be out. Yeah. It's stressful enough to only fight a couple of times a year because you have to divvy up that, that person money throughout those times, you know? But yeah. Well I think

Speaker 3:          00:13:34       pupil like you are very important for women's MMA because you seem so normal. You know what I mean? Like there's some women, you talked to them, you're like, well, this girl's fucking crazy. No wonder why she's a fighter. You know what I mean? Like there's some girls that are real aggressive or just that like you talked to Amanda Nunez. You like, I get it. Yeah. She should be a fighter. She's, she's cool. She's so cool. She's so cool. But that's a bad ass bitch. Yeah. You know what I mean? She'll fuck people up. You could tell. You could tell just looking at her, you know, like the way she's built. She's wide did. You can tell she's got power and she looks like a girl. You would not want to fuck with

Speaker 2:          00:14:13       Josh. You called it, Josh called it. He said, ETF that she'd knock out Cyborg.

Speaker 3:          00:14:17       That was crazy. That was crazy that that was, I didn't, I didn't think that she could knock her out. I thought, I think she could knock out anyone. I mean, I think she could not. I think Amanda Nunez can knock out a lot of guys. She hits so hard. Yeah. But I thought that there would be a big weight disadvantage. Cyborg has a tremendous experience advantage, and she's never shown herself to be someone that gets hurt. Yeah. But even when she fought Juliana bars, did you ever see that fight in lion fight? I

Speaker 2:          00:14:44       remember seeing highlights of it cause she's just like stuck in the uh, on the ropes and Georgina is a elite

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       and Cyborg got dropped and kept coming and mean she was pursuing her in the final rounds. Yeah. I mean she was chasing after she lost the decision but she gained a lot of fans because she didn't have any pro Moy Thai fights and she fought a woman who like she couldn't get a fight for almost three years cause girls were ducking her. Yeah cause they didn't want to fight her more ties. Brutal. I feel like

Speaker 1:          00:15:11       because my husband and I talk about this all the time, cause it MMA you have options. Like if you have, if you're having trouble in the stand up, you can take them down, you can work your grappling this or that. In boxing you don't really have much options. Either you give up, you get knocked out or you give up, you know, in the corner. And I felt the same way in might type set for now you're introducing knees and Shins and elbows. Yeah. Cut. And you have no way out. Like, yeah. You know, so that's,

Speaker 3:          00:15:40       yeah, that's a rough sport and an incredibly exciting sports watch. And one that I've never understood me boxing so gigantic in this country and Moitai has almost no presence. And I, I've just, it baffles me to no end. I mean that they have the product. Yeah. I mean, and they have great American fighters. I mean like Joe Schilling, Kevin Ross, and there's, there's a ton of them and this guys like John Wayne, par from Australia and all these guys are exciting to watch and fun. And then there's so many elite kids that are coming up, but there's no mainstream appeal. It doesn't, I don't understand that. No, no. I either, yeah, that is crazy to think they need a thing like the UFC or something comes along and they dump a ton of money into it. But the thing is like, there's only, people only have so much time to watch things, so it's like, oh, Deontay wilder is fighting.

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       I'll watch that. Oh, you know, uh, Tyron Woodley's fighting. I'll watch him. Yeah. Oh, Jon Jones is fighting. I'll watch that. What's this? Moitai ah, this fights. I'm going to watch Bella towards debt. I'm going to watch that instead. It's like there's, it's almost like too saturated. Yeah, that's true. But it's, it's a shame. It'd be cool if they had like a card with all different types of, of fighting. That's what one does. You know, the all on the same night. Yes. One FC does that. They'll have kickboxing, Muay Thai MMA in one night and they'll have no, no, they let everybody know this is what they're doing. I think one is doing fantastic. They're there. They're doing their, they're putting on amazing fights. I mean, and we've seen that these are like legitimately worldclass fighters. They're beating guys like they, you know, um, Timothy nuts. You can just beat Eddie Alvarez knocked him out and that was crazy. Yeah. And they're also, they cut out all the weight cutting. There's no way cutting over there. So like when sage Northcutt fought a cosmo Alexandra [inaudible] vitamin 185 pounds because that's really what he walks around. Yeah. You know, so there's no way cutting over there was a brutal hit. Then he got caught with crazy. I'm, I'm glad that he's okay, but he's okay. But yeah, his, his faces had eight fractures. Do you think it's better for him to cut down? That's a good question. Very good question. Because I mean, if he's getting knocked out

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       by that, and I'm wondering if maybe he should be walking around lighter or if, I don't know, cause he's pretty lean already

Speaker 3:          00:17:57       his lien, but that's, that fight played out realistically. Uh, not, not that it's better for him or worse for him, but sage is a young guy. He's 21 or 22 years old. He's got a limited amount of worldclass Moitai experience. He fought cosmo who was a multiple time world champion. Yeah. And it's just a bad fight. Why, why did they, why would they set that up if they're trying to build them? It's easy to like, I, I've said that too. And people were like, oh, it's easy to say after the fact, you're right. But if I was in sage as corner going, hey bro, there's a lot of fights we should take. And that was [inaudible] knows who's an MMA fight. Okay. But sage is not a wrestler. Yeah. I mean he has taken guys down before, but I would absolutely say that's the game plan. The game plan is tie this guy up and drag him to the ground. Don't, don't be standing with us.

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       I just feel like if you've, if you have a background in something, in stressful situations, you always revert back to what you know. Sure. Yeah. So even if he did work as wrestling, he's gonna Revert back to his, you know, really hoppy movie stance and, and that's, that's what it looked like. What happened? He was kind of pulling out, hop and back and got caught. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:19:07       Well he was trying that sideways karate style stance. You know, Cosmo's just super elite. And you saw if you saw the fight, he fainted a couple times with the left. He set them up like with a switch a couple times. And then as sage circled off, he went to his right and cracked him. Well, that guy's just a super elite fighter. I mean, when it comes to striking, I feel like that is where being elite is the most dangerous for an opponent. You know? Uh, I feel like if someone, if you find an elite Jujitsu guy and he catches you and he submits you, you live another day, you know, like Neil magazine, Damien Maia, we found out, you know, Damian gets him to the ground and just strangles him, right? Yeah. But that's, he'll be all right if you get chaos by an elite striker. Who knows what kind of damage happens to you. You know, when, when his face got broken and he's had eight fractures in his face, his cheek, his warbird old, they had a piece them back together again. He chose attached. Do you know? I don't know. I don't know the extent of the injuries. He, she, he posted up some images though. Did you see the images of the x rays? It's like, whoa. Like this is, it was horrible.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       Yeah. I mean so, so that's how I feel against, um, do you do to people when they submit me I'm like, ah, okay. Like let's do it again. Yeah, exactly. Well, what about unjudged and rose? I was scared. I was scared for rose.

Speaker 3:          00:20:35       Was it really bad landing landing on her neck, like that was terrifying.

Speaker 1:          00:20:38       Lots of it scared me just cause we were in Brazil to, that crowd was crazy and everybody shot up and started screaming and rose just like

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       laid out on the canvas and I kind of was just like wanting her corner to be in there with her cause she was just all alone by herself, you know? And I was worried that she wasn't going to get up. I was like, Hey, you guys like wait to cheer until we see she's okay. Cause that can parallel. If you look at the impact, have you seen the photograph of the landing itself? I mean it's, it's one of the worst ways you get ever land. She's essentially headfirst with the neck, sideways and um, flat or negative space. Yeah. It's like someone was cranking on her neck. I was like, horrible. Yeah, that was a bad landing. I mean the whole thing was bad. She's going for the Camorra. Um, Jessica picks her up. She doesn't lace a leg and she holds onto the Camorra, which you, you just can't do.

Speaker 3:          00:21:34       You just can't do it. You got to let it go know. But she, she's, she's held on to things before and you know, and caught armbars and triangles and it's one of those things, you know, you make a mistake. So, cause I know people were talking about it being illegal to slam somebody like that. She didn't do it on purpose. She just tried to slam her. I mean she's just trying to take, lift her up and dump it down. I mean the illegal slamming is like when Minataro fought Bob Sapp. Do you remember that? Nope. Military fought Bob Sapp and Bob Sapp literally got them in a pile driver where he scooped and Bob Sapp was 370 pounds with abs and on everything that Mexico has to offer, every steroid that was available. Bob Sapp was on. They said that he used to travel with like a briefcase. Phil would roids I mean he was a goddamn science project at one point.

Speaker 3:          00:22:24       It was fascinating to watch, right? Because I think to this day, that was probably one of the greatest victories in all of MMA. Minataro who was, he was outweighed by a good solid hundred and 3,040 pounds, like legitimately and still got an arm bar off Bob Sapp. Jamie got it. Yeah. Watch this. So look at the size difference. First of all, just see the beginning of the fight scene. So he shoots, he shoots, but look at the size difference when you see them come out. It is so crazy. Bob Sapp was so big, but look at this. Boom. So that now many Taros neck was fucked up from that forever. Like that haunted him his entire career. Watch this. Boom. Yup. Yup. See He tucks his head a little bit at the last second so he doesn't catch it on the top of the head, but all of his weight, all of Bob Sam's. Wait, look at that. Why don't you think he tucked it? I think it just gave him, he kept going. Any fucking submitted them? We have a, Toro was one of the toughest guys that's ever walked the face of the planet. Look at this. He scoots out. He escapes and gets on top of them. Yeah. Well look at the size difference. 500 and [inaudible] I mean he, Bob was so big and he's probably

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       on Epo fucking everything. And Look, look at that. Just wind millin with his legs. He was, and he was trained by Maury Smith. You know, Maurice was training. I'm so, he was a legitimate, uh, you know, it will legitimately trained athlete and he was so big. So these were, this is back in the day when there's like 10 minute rounds, 10 minute first round. So Minotaur, I believe I went into the second round though. I want to say, oh my God. Don't remember entirely whether it went into the second round, but I want to say, yeah, yeah. I mean, look, he beat her Nesto who's twice in kickboxing matches, but also goes to show you how hard cro cop punches cause cro cop flattened him with one punch. [inaudible] broke his orbital bone with a straight left. So Minataro eventually gets him on his back. And then once he gets him on his bag as Bob Sapp, like you can only keep 375 pounds going for so long.

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       I mean, he's just completely exhausted. Steroids. You do. Yeah. So this is the end. He ties up his arm and catches him in an arm bar and Bob's have taps. And I was at my friend fuck whose house was at, but I was with Eddie Bravo when we saw this and were screaming, we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe it because it was like a victory for, it was a victory for technique, you know? That's what it was. It was, it was a victory for Jujitsu was a victory for technique over broad. And there's a perfect example of technique over brawn. Not that material doesn't have Bron and not that Bob Sapp doesn't have techniques, but if they're the same size, Minataro would've fucked him up. It would've been, it would've been an easy fight for him. It's just weather the storm and wasn't scared to be in there with them. Yeah. Fader wouldn't fight them. Faders said fucked up. They offered fatal or fight with pop size like, Nah, I'm good. And he fought Hahnemann Choi when hundred and Troy was like seven feet tall. You remember that fight caught him in there was was one of the most ridiculous armbars ever. He caught him in an arm bar and the arm is as long as this fucking table. It's so crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:25:48       That was a ridiculous armbar ridiculous. Armbar but you'll never see any fights like that happen. Not Anymore. Well, I still think someone, someone might do it. Yeah. Rise and could do it. There's two do fucked up things with Gabby Garcia. You've seen that hazy Gabby Garcia's a science project and a half. That's crazy. What is that? What's going on? Uh, not that I'm aware of. How are they going to find someone? A woman is 240 pounds. She's 240 pounds jacked and she's legit black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and she's, you know, she's legitimately tough. I thought I saw the video of her. I'm grappling with Mckinsey and Mckinsey, like almost the Kinsey bitter, I think Mckinsey Vader in a Jujitsu match. And did you do too much? But in MMA I'll take anybody's be here. Yeah. I think Mackenzie either beat her or how to draw one an advantage, something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:26:39       But it is, it is. That's science. Okay. You're, you're, you're doing some stuff. You're doing some stuff to people that it's not, your body's not supposed to have that in their lady. It's not, you know, I mean it's, it's interesting cause like, like the Bob Sapp thing, like you get to see what happens. Wow. Okay. This is what's, when someone just goes for it. And when pride, ensign anyway was on the podcast and he, and since hilarious, he was detailing the contract, he goes, like, it's said in all capital letters, we will not test you for steroids. They were like, that's what joy would tell me all the time. Joey visa. No, he's been in my shore for the last couple of fights. Joe, he's an excellent fighter, man. He would say that. He said it almost, they almost, um, encouraged courage. Not almost, they basically did encourage it because they just wanted to see crazy things that like came out of comic books.

Speaker 2:          00:27:35       You know, they wanted you to be jacked. They wanted you to be gigantic. Yeah. I mean as long as everybody's doing it, I guess I would never, I wouldn't want to do that. Even if I had the choice to do it. You wouldn't want to write one too. Right. I get it. Will that makes sense. And that's why I think people like you were important for MMA because you are, you're a woman. You seem like a woman. You behave like a woman. You look at a woman, if someone say [inaudible] top 10 UFC fight or you'd be like, what? No Way. Really. She's so normal. But if you saw it, Gabby Garcia and you know that girl's smashing people in Japan, like I fucking believe it out of this room cause she hops out and starts a flattened me. I just like, I feel like it takes the, um, the jaw.

Speaker 2:          00:28:22       I feel like it would take the joy out of a victory for if you did steroids. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you would become something different. The reality is a woman becomes something different when she starts taking male hormones. You just do. He becomes something different. Your tendons strengthen. Your bone structure changes. Your voice deepens. You become much more like a man. I mean, that's when you see transgender women, when a woman rather is a transgender man, she decides she wants to be a man. They start taking testosterone, they get beards, they have all sorts of strange things happen down below, and they, they start having a deeper voice and they sound like a man then that's, that's exactly what happens to a woman when a woman takes steroids if she's not trying to transition. So same thing. You just taking male hormones that make your muscles grow far larger than they're supposed to.

Speaker 2:          00:29:10       Yeah. I remember watching a movie that they did in Thailand. It's called beautiful boxer. Yes, yes. Yeah. It's the opposite. He, yes, he wanted to be a woman, but I think he did it the right way. Right. If there's a right way to do it because, well, he started as a man and then became a woman and kept fighting men. Yes. And I think that someone should have told her at the time, like, let's just stop fighting. Let's stop fighting. Or I, this is my take on it. Like that she needed to keep fighting so that she could pay for the surgery. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       Yeah. All right. Catch 22 if I ever was one. Yeah. Yeah, but would it was an elite fighter until the transition and then you see the skills start to diminish because there's no more testosterone when she's fighting men. But if she was fighting women, she would have a giant advantage still over women. And I don't think that's right either. I don't think that's fair either. No one does. No one does accept transgender people, transgender people, and super progressive activists who have no idea how sports work. It's, those are the people, the people that just want inclusiveness and they just want everyone to be okay. And you know, maybe this is the world I'm looking for. I'm looking, I'm looking towards a world where everyone's included. Yeah. Good. Have a transgender league. I have a transgender division. No, I'm cool with that. I'll be happily happily support them. But you're pretending that that's a woman and it's not. It's a male who's transitioning to a woman. You have an x, y chromosome. It's a different thing. Yeah. You know, I'm 100% if a woman says, I want to fight a transgender woman. Okay, I'm a hundred that's fine. Yeah. But like for leagues to recognize that this is the same thing and like to say like how would you feel if all of the UFC is weight classes in the women's division, we're dominated by transgender women.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       I would feel like there were some, I feel like I should not say something. Right, right, right. Yeah. Like I'm going to get caught up.

Speaker 3:          00:31:06       Yeah. Let me talk for you to fucking bullshit. It's fucking bullshit, right? Yeah. You don't have to say anything. And that's how girls feel right now when there's sports being dominated and track and field. Yeah. That's okay. That's not fair.

Speaker 1:          00:31:18       [inaudible]. I mean, I as, I guess for me, I've always been, especially like being a female in a male dominant sport, I've always, I've, I guess if I can let the like to consider myself a feminist, not, not so much a feminist, but I like when I go into the gym, I, my teammates look at me as a fighter. Like they don't look at me as a female fight or anything like that. They look at me as their teammate, you know what I mean? And the, and I appreciate that. I appreciate that they trade, treat me as an athlete and, and, and all of that good stuff. But I feel like w like at the end of the day, like girls need to fight girls and guys need to fight guys. We like, we have different strengths than the guys do and the guys have different strengths in the girls do and, and it's nice for us to have a place so that we can showcase our skills.

Speaker 3:          00:32:05       Yes, I agree. I think the only problem that I have with that transitioning thing is physical competition. That's it. Physical competition against the gender that you supposedly aligned with. Yeah. Yeah. You can't do it, but here's what you don't see. Here's what you don't see. You don't see a lot of transgender men who want to fight men. You don't see a lot of women who are taking hormones, uh, to become a man who want to fight men. Yeah. Good. Fucking luck with that, ladies. Yeah, good luck. Stop. This is crazy. Like this idea that you just magically become a woman or you just magically

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       become a man. It's just not true. And athletes recognize it and rational people recognize it, but there's so much pushback from progressive people who it's like what percentage of the population and we even talking about here and we as a, it's not even 1% it's a very strange thing that it's, it's taking over the conversation with bathrooms and competition, sports and so many different things. I'm all for inclusiveness and I'm all for being open minded and letting, letting people do you whatever you want to be yourself. Be Whatever yourself is. I don't know what yourself, I don't know what you feel, but you can't compete against women. That's, it's that simple. It's really that simple. It has, it has to be something deeper where they, you know, it and to me, I think it goes back to like that mental, like a mental block where you, where you need some like a false sense of confidence.

Speaker 2:          00:33:31       Yes. I feel like, what's like sand bagging? It really is. It really, it is the ultimate sandbag. It's like, Oh, I'm a woman. Like, wait a minute. Where the fuck did you get those hands? That's really like the ultimate form of sex. I mean everybody, for folks who don't know what sandbagging is, oh, I was going to bring up smokers too. For folks who don't know what smokers is. If you listen to this podcast, the smoker is small amateur fights that they have in gyms or little arenas, a high school gym, stuff like that. But, um, uh, sandbagging is like, say if Michelle had a black belt in Jujitsu and then entered into a judo tournament as a white belt and then just fucking flying armbar everybody, they'd be like, what the hell is this? Where'd you get your white belts? Like how do you have a white belt?

Speaker 2:          00:34:16       But we've all seen things like that before. Everyone has seen things like that before. There's people that pretend they're a younger than they really are. They pretend they're lighter than they really are. They pretend they cause they want to win. This is no different. It's no different. It really is. And the people who don't understand it, they have never competed in high level athletics. It's really that simple. If you've competed in high level athletics, you know that there's a differentiation. There's a difference between men and women. And there's a reason why we have a man's division in a women's division. It's not that anybody's better or worse, it's just like there's unfair advantages like the Bob Sapp mandatorial thing. That was an unfair advantage. It's just overcome by someone who have superior skill and an iron will. And that's what Minataro was when he beat Bob Sapp. I mean there's no denying that one guy was way bigger and way stronger, but it was overcome. You shouldn't force people to overcome. It should be, even if they were, even if Minataro and Bob Sapp or even here's the fight, shoot, take down, Dang on his back. Armbar Bang fights over. It'd be like a couple minutes maximum admin Atar would armbar yeah. What do you think it's because people like to see the mismatch and maybe like that underdog story where the person that is, you know, the underdog wins. Yeah, like mandatory, but like again, minutes Harlow's neck is still fucked up to this deck. You know, his neck bothered him. His entire, from that one

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       pile driver, three hours, 75 pounds, plus his weight all on his neck. It just shows you how fucking tough dot guy is. You know, the [inaudible] story was run over by a truck when he was a kid. That's way as this giant scar on his back. Like he was in the hospital for like a year. He's at the Carson animal. I mean, he's as tough as they go.

Speaker 2:          00:35:56       I got hit by a truck. You're not going to do nothing to me. You can't force it,

Speaker 3:          00:36:01       everyone to be that tough. You know? I think it's important to have fairness in this. This is why I'm so pro Usada. I love what they're doing. I love the fact that they're testing the shit out of people. They're just showing up at people's houses at six o'clock in the morning, hey, wake up time for a test.

Speaker 2:          00:36:16       And but is it the same in, in every country? Um, that's a good question. It's a very good question. Right? Someone's training in Russia or Germany or wherever. Yeah, that's a very good question. I do not know the answer to that because I know that's kind of one of the concerns for some of the athletes that yeah, it might be really strict here in the states, but in other states or is it as strict? Right. Because it is u s antidoping agency that's Usada. Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah. So what do you think if you don't think it is, I don't know. I'll talk for you. Is there something fucked up you need to say, just go like this. I don't know. Um, I guess I just, I, I'm can only be concerned with what's under my control and so then I'm just going to train and I'm going to get as good as I can get and hopefully, you know, you sought a can, can take care of the rest. But for me to stress about it is, is, is just time wasted I think for myself. Well, I do know of a case

Speaker 3:          00:37:12       where there was a fighter who told me that there was a guy who was openly dirty as far as what everybody knew and he knew that he was going to piss hot. So he went and did some seminars in another country and just stayed over in another country for just moved around. It's like, so you see this world class fighter, these weird little gyms. And I was like, what is going on over there? And the gentleman who told me said, listen man, he's, he's dark and drug tests. That's what he's doing over there. That's crazy. Yeah. Hey look, for sure. Like when you, when the kind of like Tj Dillashaw gets popped and you're like, wow, TJ for a world title, he's getting bopped like how many people are getting away with this? How many people got away with it?

Speaker 2:          00:37:55       It's just not worth it. He lost a lot doing that. What? Yeah. Oh yeah. Is that it's not worth it. It's not worth it.

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       Ultimately it's definitely not worth it cause its legacy is tainted. But if he got away with it, is it worth it? How many, how many people got away with it? Here's the question. How many people retired? And we never got to see their drug tests from 2006, 2008 like what were you taken? Are we on like back when they used to have those silly wait, uh, drug tests or their chest, you at the weigh ins, which is basically the intelligence test. Like, Hey, you still taken steroids or do you stop a couple of weeks ago? And the, the today is so much more sophisticated. That's why people are getting popped for EPO and a bunch of things that were hard to hard to find. Yeah. They're the thresholds. Like this is the John Johnson with the Pika grams, the, the t the insignificant amount in terms of like the performance enhancing aspect of it that is in his system.

Speaker 3:          00:38:55       Like how can they detect that? Well, they can detect that because the machines are way more sophisticated. The drug testings way. Like he, if he had tested, if Jon Jones had tested two years ago, he would have tested clean. Yeah. But now it's just, they're just way better to tie even something, even if you're taking creatine and that creatine is tainted. Yeah. Which is a lot of what these guys, Tim means that was his deal. He was taking a supplement. It was tainted. Quite a few guys have legitimately just taken over the counter supplements that they thought were clean and they got something just some tiny free that doesn't have any effect on their performance, but it shows up. It'll show up for months and weeks. And in John's case, like hears, it's been showing up for like a year and a half. It comes on and off.

Speaker 3:          00:39:39       Yeah. And when you're cutting weight, that's when it seems to come back. That's what it seems to show because your body is gone, you're losing fat, you're losing, you're losing body weight and some of it's stored in fat. They think it's very confusing for them. They're trying to figure it all out and then the knee, all these fucking people online or we rant and rave at about Pika grams and this and I like the science experts and they think it's the think it's all bullshit that John's allowed to fire. You should be banned for life and like, yeah, okay, you don't, you're not listening. Like he tested negative and then he tested positive a week later and then he tested negative a week after that. Like what's happening here? Something weird is happening. Figuring out for themselves. Exactly. Yeah. But I'm glad they're figuring it out because now people get to see like, hey look, Jon Jones was out for all that time for other problems and then for the drug problems. Yeah. Like this is a lot of money. That guy lost. John probably lost tens of millions of dollars. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:31       You know, he's still young, he's still young and he's still out, you know, and hasn't hit his prime yet. I don't think.

Speaker 3:          00:40:37       No. I think also all that knowing that it can all be taken away from you probably met like tempered him, like put him in a better place. We realize like I still have this gift of incredible talent. If he just a natural born fighter fishing, he just knows how to fight. Some guys, they have all the techniques, all the talent, but they don't know how to put it together. Shawn knows how to put it together.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       Yeah. He's just, he just, that's his, that's his jam. He just goes out there and he can, he just does things on the fly that nobody would ever think of that works. Yeah. He tries things out. It's crazy to watch him train cause he's just super laser done and focused and there's nothing, you know, there could be, the building could be getting bombed and it wouldn't matter. He just beyond the bag working on his technique. Yeah. It's really, it's really cool to watch. Well

Speaker 3:          00:41:27       he's, he's the outlier, right? I mean there's a, there's special fighters. They're outliers in, in the sport and for our era it was like Anderson Silva, mighty mouse. Jon Jones. Yeah. Those are the real outliers. Or are you just watching me just go, Jesus Christ, like Anderson, when he was in his prime, you would watch him and you would watch them set guys up and it's, he just, it's almost like he had cheat codes. Like you could just see what they were doing. Yeah. We just like checks and you did that. I did this and you do that. Okay, well I'm going to do this and I know you're going to do that. And Pop. There it goes. Yeah. And he would just figure you guys out. It was wonderful to watch though because

Speaker 1:          00:42:06       opened up, opened up like a door for all of the rest of us. I feel like with any good fighter, when you watch them fight, it opens up a door in your own mind. Like, oh, like that's possible. I can do that. And so I feel like with Anderson Silva did that a lot with his movement, with this head movement, with his variety of, of punches and kicks and the angles at which they came in from, you know, and I don't know, I feel like Anderson Silva did. I feel like Rhonda did that with her judo feel like Machita did that with his karate. Um, and then, you know, I, I can go down the list of everybody, but I feel like it kind of like goes in cycles, you know? And um, I mean, it's great for me because I can watch them and I can implement new things. I feel like that's why I've been able to be in the game for so long and still continue to grow and evolve because I get to watch other people and the things that they do and like add that to my, to my tool lists, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       Yeah. It changes the expectation of what's possible. Right. I think it will. The mighty mouse. That was one of the best examples of that because when I would watch mighty mouse fight, I'd be like, show me someone who's better, show me, show me. Show me someone who's ever been better than this guy. Like I've never seen anybody move better than this guy. Like he doesn't get hit or if he gets hit, he, it's rare. Like every three or four fights on my catches him, like John Moraga caught him with a good straight punch like that. That's like, that was the last I remembered. I'd like to see him run it back with pseudo oh, too close fight and very close fight. And he kind of was so

Speaker 1:          00:43:38       it blew my mind how like nonchalant he was about at all. Like at the end he's like, yeah, whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:43:44       But that's him. Dj is just a special guy and he's another one's like, couldn't be a nicer guy. Yeah. Like if you didn't know that he was, uh, one of the best fighters that's ever walked the face of the planet, you go along with this friendly guy, he seems, he's so nice and normal. It talks like he's articulate. He doesn't talk like a mean person is just, it's a great, it's a great example of like something that's contrary to the stereotypes that people think of when they think of cage fighters. Yeah. You know, someone is fighting, which is a weird word, right? Like Kate, like do, what do you think? Cage fighting. You do that? Yeah. Like you're a cage fighter. UFC. Yeah. You do UFC. Yeah. That's if you're fighting for Bella to are people like, what's that? Is that like UFC? What is that? What's Bella tour?

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       Yeah. Catch for changing though. It's great. I love the competition. I think that's great that there's more options out there for the fighters.

Speaker 3:          00:44:39       Oh, for sure. Yeah. I think it's very important. I think it's very important. What's interesting too about this sport is that it's one of the only sports where you can go back from 1993 to 2019 and you could see massive evolution. Yeah. There's no other sport like that. If you go back and watch boxing from 93 you're watching great boxing, worldclass boxing. Like you could take someone from [inaudible] 93 and put them into 2018 like they would fit perfect. Right. Thanks. Roy Jones Jr shit, Rachel's genuine. He's in his prime today. Everybody be fucked today. They'd be fucked. He was just something special.

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       Bernard Hopkins boxing mentality is like so old school when you got to stick to their traditions even it's, it's kind of like taboo to to see like fighters switching stance, which some of them like the good ones are Josh. Like my husband, he boxed, you know, and he has a lot, he had a lot of old boxing coaches that were like, you don't switch stance. Like you stick your stance and you perfect that stance, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:45:37       out of their fucking mind. You've watched Terrence Crawford this one of the things he does so brilliantly. Yeah. He, he is as good as a southpaw as he is orthodox and it's one of the reasons why it's so difficult to solve. Yeah. Because if you think you got to read on his timing and then all of a sudden you're looking gonna Right Jab instead of a left jab now like, oh shit, maybe it's, maybe it's just,

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       did I watch MMA and more focused on MMA than I am in boxing. But when I just from, you know, having my husband helped me out and all this stuff, he, that's what he's saying is going to be the, like the biggest evolution or what has started to evolve in boxing is that they are realizing, okay, you can use both sides now and that's going to trick them even more.

Speaker 3:          00:46:18       Well, Marvin Hagler was amazing at that. It was one of Marvin hangers best skills that he could fight southpaws as well as he could get fired. Orthodox Hagler was one of the greatest fighters of all time, you know, and he was a champion in the 80s Oh, okay. You don't know Marvin Hagler? No, I never already hottie you don't know the marvelous one. I never even really watched boxing until I met my husband. Really? Yeah. That's crazy. Well, he introduced you to something awesome. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good time right now to watch boxing. You know, there's so many good boxers.

Speaker 1:          00:46:50       Yeah. Um, I think that's the, one of the things that he wants me to really work on in order to, to get my game to the next level is my boxing. You know, cause my kicks are good. My wrestling's you know, getting better at my Jujitsu is good. And if as long if I can put together my punches and we'll be a okay. Ready to get that belt.

Speaker 3:          00:47:09       Karate is an interesting martial art too that you are really good at because you have this, you have an excellent ability to use that front leg that most people don't. They don't have, like you have an awesome front like sidekick, great fun, like roundhouse kick. And when you do that, I see, I see that in your fight sometimes people are like, oh I've got to adjust to this. Cause like a jab. Yeah. By, but a jab that could fuck you up. I could shove that can knock you out.

Speaker 1:          00:47:33       Yeah. I think I, I mean, I guess like, Oh that to my, my point find days when everybody was bigger than me, it didn't matter because it was by, by belts. Right. And so I was always a smaller one and trying to, trying to get the point off first I would just use my, my front leg and kick it out there as fast as I could. Um, but I do, I feel like my, my, my kicks have lended to being, I've adopted them as jobs, you know, so, yeah. And I love it. I think it helps it because then it kind of neutralizes the height difference.

Speaker 3:          00:48:04       Do you train a lot with Winkeljohn? I do. Called John is a, he was an excellent fighter, a really good kickboxer and really good at both styles too. Like leg kick style, but also good at like he had karate techniques as well. He, and he's also, he was very good at those transitions between those straight kicks and punches. Yeah. Well, you know, that's the thing where a lot of people get confused as like a a no man's land between kicking him, punching with people were kicking specialists and you see it like even with elite fighters like Raymond Daniels as he's coming up in his kickboxing career, it took a while before he could make that smooth transition between kicking and punching because Raymond would be on the outside and he was a world class top of the food chain karate point fighter. Yeah. And then got into kickboxing and as long as he was at a distance, he was fucking people up. But in the transition, the no man's land between the kicking and the punching, he looked awkward. It took a while before he sorta, so some guys like Joseph Vault, Eleni and Nikki hold skin. They sort of exposed that the gap, the no man's land gap. That's a problem with a lot of kickers have. Yeah. They have that problem with the gap from the kicking to the punching.

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       Yeah, for sure. I think that's one of the things that I had to, that was one of the things that I had to really work on. And I think because I enjoy grappling and Jujitsu that I went straight from kicking to clench up grappling and I kind of skipped the boxing, the boxing part of it. How much boxing you doing now? Um, quite a bit actually. Is that your main focus? Yeah, yeah. Especially off, you know, off camp. We don't have any, you know, game plans to work on. We're working boxing and wrestling.

Speaker 3:          00:49:50       Now. When you say you work in boxing, are you just sparring, boxing and hitting pads, boxing or are you trying to implement that into MMA training? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:01       um, I would say both were not sparring. We're not spying right now. Boxing. Um, but I was working on your hands working on the hands, working on the foot work and then, so we'll just do strictly boxing, but then we'll do, like you're saying the transitions, so kicks the boxing and boxing, the kicks and then boxing to take downs. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:50:21       yeah. Having things to do when you don't have to think by knowing exactly what to do. I'm in this position, there goes the knee, I'm in this position, now I'm throwing a punch. When you see someone going, oh, like I've gotta do this. I've got to think. Yeah. You know, the, the, the, the, those transitions, it's, it's very, it's a, that when you're in higher, higher pressure situations, that's when those transitions are the most awkward when you don't have like a conditioned response.

Speaker 1:          00:50:47       Yeah. And I think that's the biggest thing that I've really been able to work on is [inaudible] is the blending of all of them. I feel like so much of us, so many of us, we train specific boxing's specific MMA or kickboxing, Jujitsu, wrestling, whatever, but we never really blend it together. And I think that's the most important part.

Speaker 3:          00:51:08       Well, that's why with George was so great. George St Pierre was so amazing at transitions. Like you never knew what he was going to do. Yeah. He was so unpredictable. He was going to punch you or he's going to take you down. So everyone's worried about everything. You didn't know what was coming. Yeah. That's why I always encourage fighters. Like even if you're really good striker man, you got to attempt take downs. You've got to keep people honest because otherwise people are just going to settle in and never worry about your takedowns. And then they have an extra degree of comfort with their striking and you can get caught what stuff you wouldn't get caught with otherwise.

Speaker 1:          00:51:41       Yeah. And there's just, I just feel like in MMA you have so many opportunities. Like why would you limit yourself those opportunities? Yeah. I remember one of my fights, um, I was fighting this girl who was like a 10 time boxer in MMA. And so I'm like, oh, this girl is coming into my world. I'm going to show her what's up. But then, and I was beating her the whole first round, kicking her out, keeping out with kicks, keeping out with punches. I remember going back to my corner and saying, man, this is too easy. Like, um, you know, I'm piecing this girl up and just, just me saying that to myself. I think something in my head switch. But, um, I went back out and ended up, I think what happened was I told myself, okay, your piece in our up with what, you know, go out there and beat her at her own game. Oh Jesus.

Speaker 1:          00:52:38       Talk to your corner Bro. I told my, I think it was just like a mental, like this is too easy. I'm going to make it challenging, more challenging on myself. I didn't tell my corner that it was just like, you know how sometimes when you're in a fight you have like a million thoughts that go through your mind in a split second. And I think that was one of them. One of them, oh show this bitch what's up? Yeah. And at her own game, which is stupid cause it's MMA. So I stood in front of her and then she cracked me and then, and I saw stars and I stood in front of her and I didn't take her down and I was trying to, you know, exchange with her and she cracked to me again and you know, I was waiting for her to stop so it could be my turn and she never stopped and the, and I got Tkos you know, but um, I mean lesson learned, but I was just so stubborn in, you know, in my thoughts that I was like, I'm going to beat her own game. What are you talking about? You're fighting MMA was so mad at myself after the fact because, um, I just, I beat myself. I just beat myself when I went back out there.

Speaker 3:          00:53:40       Well, that's that old. How did you win? Or you learn and you obviously this is something that's still in your mind to this day. You learned. Yeah. But that's a part of what makes a champion like that desire to show I can beat you anywhere. Yeah. That crazy belief in yourself. Like, Oh fuck this bitch up standards high that those thought processes are so crazy because the reason why you get so good in the first place is because you love challenges and you want to do this difficult thing. Yeah. So you literally made it more difficult.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       Yeah. I don't know why I would do that, but that is exactly why I continue to fight now. You know, I think I was nervous coming into the UFC cause I was coming up from one oh five you know, I talking to my husband and saying like, what are we doing? Like do you think I can make the jump up and still hang with these girls? And

Speaker 3:          00:54:31       what would you be fighting in one oh five the UFC had a one oh five.

Speaker 1:          00:54:34       Um, I dunno, I guess it just, uh, it, it would depend. I think it would have to be worth it. Um, actually didn't make the cut. Yeah. I feel like my last couple of cuts at one oh five are pretty brutal. Like, um, [inaudible] fallen out. Your eyelashes or, yeah, like I was so shy, jaded that my like my, you know, how your eyes sinking and I like, I remember wiping, wiping my eye and just looking down and like a whole row of eyelashes or like on my, um, on my arm. And um, that's like when people get syphilis. Oh, I don't want to die. Start falling out. I was sickly for Shirley. Wow. Um, the, you know, they check your, check your vitals after weigh ins and the doctor when it released me because he couldn't find my heartbeat, like my, my heartbeat for like an hour. Couldn't find your heart because you're so dehydrated. Yeah. Whoa. So, um, I just think that also that last cut was, it was like a, I did it too quickly. I think I walk around that, um, like one 30 to one 30 for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:55:46       And when you make the cut done with one 15, how slowly do you do it?

Speaker 1:          00:55:50       I usually have that eight week fight camp and as I do like pound, pound and a half, two pounds a week.

Speaker 3:          00:55:57       Yeah. So for you to get to one oh five. Yeah. Don't do that. That sounds, that sounds crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:56:01       Back when the last time I fought at one oh five I was probably, when I was fighting at one of, I was probably walking around at like 25

Speaker 3:          00:56:08       mm still. That's 20 pounds of weight for a hundred pound person. That is 20% of your body weight. Yeah. That's a significant amount of drain yourself. I mean, if you think about a welterweight, losing 20 pounds, it's a good cut. But an Adam person,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       that's so much weight.

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       I know. I feel, I feel so much healthier now. I feel like when I'm in Camp I can focus on training and having good energy, you know, going at 100% rather than going 70% and then go on to do more cardio. So I absolutely feel like more healthier. I feel like I've been able to put muscle on, I feel like I'm stronger and just happier, happier training.

Speaker 2:          00:56:49       Yeah. What you're seeing there from so many fighters? Somewhat and that's one of the reasons why to go back to this one FC thing, I love what they're doing that they've eliminated weight cutting. Yeah, they do hydration tests on people and make sure you're not cutting any weight. And I think the UFC is missing the boat. They want to test for steroids, which is fantastic. 100% I'd support that. They should test hydration to this weight cutting weight cutting is nothing, but it's just sanctioned cheating. That's all it is. You're not 115 pounds. Right? But everybody is going to cut down to one 15 and then you're probably going to go back up to like what do you, when you fight, when you get into the cage, what do you think you weigh this last time I got back up to one 28 yeah. See that's what you're really way like why is everybody saying she's fighting at one 15 this is not fighting at one 15 like when you see Tyron Woodley fights at one 70 no he doesn't. No, he weighs one 70 you know Kamara Uzman. He's not one 73 ways. One 74 a very small time.

Speaker 1:          00:57:47       What? Maybe it's just kind of like the old school mentality or just the, the idea of that being the last challenge that you go through before you step into the octagon. That I enjoy and not that I enjoy it, but again, going back to challenges and it's like one of those things like, all right, like, you know, take yourself to this point. And if you can get through that without breaking, then me and you can go to battle. Right. I don't know. There's just something to that for me.

Speaker 2:          00:58:19       I see what you're saying. So it's another challenge. Like you have a whole, there's a series of challenges. Yeah. The training, there's the mental preparation and there's a weight cut. All these things are together

Speaker 1:          00:58:29       and, and I feel like that's like the last step. It's like, you know, it's a battle within yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:58:36       Is that the death star on your forearm? What is that? This is, it looks like the death star from a distance. Let's try to figure it out. It's an actual, uh, silhouette on my husband. Oh, that's so cool. So it's a circular silhouette with the mountains and the trees. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, that's really cool. That's very unique. Thank you. Does kinda look like the death star though? From a distance? I was like Shit, a fucking star wars game. Actually I don't remember the last time I seen star wars, but yeah. So the, the way cut though, the only problem with it is it's bad for you. Yeah. I mean I understand that.

Speaker 1:          00:59:10       I don't cut much. I'd probably cut four pounds of water weight. Oh that's great. I hit when I like when I show up fight week, I'm probably like three like four or five pounds off.

Speaker 2:          00:59:19       Right. But if you just ate normal we wouldn't you be healthier give if instead of getting down within four pounds of the weight, like, cause you're going to go up to one 28 the day fight. Right. So that's, that's an additional 13 pounds. Where's that coming from? It's come from somewhere. Right. So you're doing something. I understand that the thought process about talking to one of the doctors about it. My last fight cause he was like so strange that you go through all of this just to be the same way the next day. I know doctors are so smart. I just looked at him like that is strange. It's fucking stupid is what it is really is for for the sport. Not you personally, but it's what you have to do is you want to compete in the sport. I guess just because I've been doing it for so long, it's just this in in my head it's like you know they're only, a couple of things you have to do as a fighter.

Speaker 2:          01:00:07       Cutting weight is one of them. If you can't do that, then you know it is hard. I feel it. It's a process that you have to go through and you have to be mentally prepared to go through it and if you do it right, it should only be water that you're cutting. Even though that's silly to do. I don't know how it's, it's silly to do. It's not good. It's never good to just cut that water. It's just not, it's not good for you. But if you do it, if you, if you do it intelligently where you're not cutting too much weight, it's not that bad. But so many people are doing these brutal 30 pound wakids. I just, I feel like at that point it's, it's not a benefit for you. Like some, for some people they are the bigger person coming into the, to the octagon the next day.

Speaker 2:          01:00:51       But you're going to reach a certain point where cutting weight is not a benefit for you. Maybe, you know, that's, if you can do it and you pull it off, especially if you're young and you figure out how to do it correctly and replenish your electrolytes, you know, it is an advantage to be bigger. But the reality is you're with whatever weight class that is, that's not what your way, you don't really weigh that much. Your weight. It's like, it's crazy. Like you should be, it should be about skill versus skill, but it shouldn't be about who's got the best scientists. So, I mean, so what do you think you think in drag would still be a one 15 or no chance? No chance. No, no, no, no. She's bigger too. She fucking struggles. She struggles for one 15 but then you've got Valentina. I was like, I think that way class, it's really interesting, right when you're talking about weight classes, if you're talking about the difference between 105 pounds in 115 pounds, it might only be 10 pounds, but it's a giant percentage of your body weight. And then you look at MMA in the men's division and you have, you know, one 55 and you have one 70 you have that 15 pound gap. That's a big gap. It's a giant gap. I think there should be every 10 pounds, every 10 pounds for men and for women. I think there's a real good argument that should be every five pounds. But if Dana heard this, he would find whatever Harris has got left to pluck them out of. He said, John Logan to shut the fuck up. Plucking his eyebrow

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       hairs. He doesn't even like the idea of a one 65 I'm like God damn that's a no brainer.

Speaker 1:          01:02:24       Yeah there is. There's plenty of fighters out there that are willing to to, to fight and just give him a place to do. So in

Speaker 3:          01:02:32       and guys who would be champions cause that's there. They're real natural weight close betweens. I think the what one FC is doing in terms of weight cutting is the way to do it. But the other side is they're not doing the same thing that you saw is doing in terms of steroids. So they are able to take a hundred percent hundred percent talk to guys who compete over there. And it's like, yeah, I mean there's some, some testing. So would you rather fight somebody that's heavier than you or somebody that's taking question? Very good question. Because if there were not just taking steroids but also taking EPO, there's a lot of different shit that people can take, you know that can give you more like EPO is a scary one because the person has more gas in their tank to beat you. Yeah. They have more, they can hit you, they can take shots better, they can recover better, and then they can come after you and then they, they'll have more gas in the tank, then maybe they can put you away.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       Where did we meet somebody that's heavier than me and depleted from cutting water weight than somebody that was taken steroids or equals for sure

Speaker 3:          01:03:29       for a woman. I think for sure. For sure. I think there's, for women, for women, there's a real argument that once someone has ever taken steroids that you've altered your chemistry enough and your physiology enough that you're forever going to have some sort of an advantage. So then there's nothing you can do about that. Well, I mean maybe deduct a point before you even get in the octagon that's not even good enough. Somebody chaos people. Right? Yeah, that's true. Yeah. How often do you spar? Um,

Speaker 1:          01:03:55       I would say heavy sparring once a week, once a week. Like, um, so we do, uh, like Emma make grappling on Mondays. Tuesdays is a heavy sparring. It's the 16 ounce. Let's throw down spiring. Wednesdays is wrestling, Thursdays is MMA gloves. Barring. So it's kind of more just, um, accuracy, like light on the striking, heavy on the grappling and then Fridays technical work technique stuff. Like

Speaker 3:          01:04:29       now you're at a gym, you're at Jackson Winklejohn, which is one of the best gyms on the planet earth, but also a gym. It's filled with savages. I mean, yeah, there must be a lot of chest bumping and a lot of people that are trying to test people and yeah, there's got to be girls who were there who look at a girl like you is, hey, this girl's where I want to be. Yeah. And I mean I've talked to males who trained their say, man, let me tell you something. There's some Russian cats just show up out of nowhere and tried to take your head off. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:00       And they go outside and smoke cigarettes and drink some vodka. Are they smoking cigarettes? Um, some of them we, that's weird. Fighters are crazy. You get the funniest, coolest stories from meeting fighters all around the world. Yeah. Jackson's is, is, um, it's a shark tank. Like, you're not going there to find emo, you know, you find a job. Yes, exactly. So you've got to give it, you have to have a good set of skills before you get there in order to kind of hold your own right. But we do actually have an amateur, um, team right now that is run by Jove is senior and he's done an amazing job with the amateur team. And so, um, we've kind of been able to separate the classes in that sense where Joey, um, is kind of overseeing all of the amateur fighters and he's building these amateur fighters. And when he feels like they're ready to come and train with the proles, he'll give them the goal, you know, or, or do a trial run where they, where they train with us for one week and see if they're ready. And, um, you know, for a higher level of the competition. And then if they are, then they stay. And if they're not that, they come back to the amateur team and, and it's, it's actually worked out quite well.

Speaker 3:          01:06:11       Oh, that's great. So did they start people from fresh, like no skills at all? Some so you, cause there's classes there for total beginners.

Speaker 1:          01:06:18       Uh, yeah. It's crazy if you ever like go into Jim and see like, um, when you, when you see like amateurs or people that have like zero training spar versus like professional fighters spot. Yeah. It's crazy. It's almost looks more dangerous. I would not want to be in that w in like the cage with some of those people that like, because you just don't know where the punches or kicks are coming from. They're all coming full blast. Exactly. 100% control. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:06:47       Jujitsu. Jujitsu is the same thing. You don't want, the last thing you want to do is grapple with a really strong guy was about to get his blue belt. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:56       Oh Geez. Yeah. Just he goes, gets in, you know, gets in the way. I think that's why they match up high level with low level, don't you?

Speaker 3:          01:07:03       Sure. So someone can control you and calm me down and

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       yeah, I love Jujitsu. I can't wait to, you know, to get my black belt in Jujitsu. And, uh, I think it's kind of brought me back to my more traditional background where, you know, there's a little bit more structure when you come, come, come to that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:07:25       Yeah. Now how much of that do you, do you use a lot of grips? Like do you grab collars and sleeves and things? Like

Speaker 1:          01:07:32       I try, I try to force myself outside of my comfort zone because I am so used to grabbing wrists, grabbing shoulders and you know, right at the crick of the elbows and stuff like that. And I find myself going for those grips because that's just what I've done for the last decade. But because I am stepping into their world, I want to learn, I want to learn the grips and I want to learn all of that stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:07:57       Um, yeah, it's, I mean, it's great if you want to compete in Jujitsu with a g, but I think for MMA, I think the best benefit of Jujitsu with the g for MMA is defensive for submissions because you get caught and things you can't power out of them because it's not slippery.

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       Uh Huh. And I'm, I'm slippery. Like I've, I love Nogi because I can slip out of things and I'll just wait until I have a little bit of space and then I'm all out. Yeah. I'm just glad. Yeah. And I'm just out, but I can't do that in game. Yeah. So what I'll do a lot of times is I'll go train g and I'll do the technique class and then when it's time to go, like do live rolling, I just take my key off and I go, Gnocchi.

Speaker 3:          01:08:38       That's smart. So that way everything you're doing is applicable in MMA. Because one of the things we used to see in the early days of MMA CDs, g world champions, like elite level world champions, and they'd fight in MMA and they lost all of their technique because everything was collars and sleeves and pants and everything was grabbing things. Whereas instead of now they try to go to cable, grabs her over hooks and under hooks and they were all confused. We liked their technique is off. Yeah. And they would be like a blue belt or a purple belt world champions.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       Yeah. I think it's great. Like my professor now. Um, he, so I'll, I'll be rolling with his, with his wife or some of his students. And he like, it's weird because they're getting me ready for my fights, but I'm also getting them ready for worlds and stuff like that. So depending on who's getting cool ready is what he'll call out if we're going. And, um, you know, there's, I'm sitting in their guard, um, he'll tell them that they have to get active. They're like, he'll, he'll straight up say if she was fighting, you should just be punching the face. You got to move, you've got to do something, you know. So I think it's good just to give them a different perspective as well. Have you ever watched combat Jujitsu? Uh, I've seen a couple. But where do you get to slap them in the face and stuff like that? Yeah, I've seen some of it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:09:53       That's interesting because it shows you where there are these gaps will, okay, this is an MMA. But if it was, yeah, you'd be getting pounded out right here. You can't just hang out. Like there's moments in Jujitsu that are unrealistic. And self defense situations. We're in a fight situation. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:08       And that's where I get frustrated. But it's good. I need that frustration cause I'll be in a position and in my head I'm like, I could just punch you right now in the face, but I can't cause they're grappling. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:10:20       so your schedule that you're laying out, is this a schedule of Jackson? John is just their schedule. So

Speaker 1:          01:10:26       yeah, that's what I do in the mornings at the gym.

Speaker 3:          01:10:29       So who sets up like when you're in camp, when you have to, do you know, you, you've got to fight. It's 12 weeks from now. Who sets up your schedule?

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       Uh, I think what what we do is we get a fight skeletal then, then we, we get all the coaches and together. And so my Jujitsu coach, I go to Gracie Baha, fruit Jujitsu, so Jujitsu, wrestling, you know, coach Jackson, coach Winkeljohn in your, and my husband and my husband's with me all the time. So he kind of oversees everything. And uh, we just sit down and we talk about all the things we need to get together. I do one pilot with coach Jackson a week. I do two privates with coach wink a week and do a private with a coach via cellular. And then I do all those in the morning and then I, and then I work out at my house as well. And then I do Jujitsu. What do you do at your house? Um, it depends on the day. Sometimes we do simulations will do like round simulations.

Speaker 1:          01:11:26       Sometimes it's just hardcore cardio. Sometimes it's just technical set up in your garage or something. Yeah. That's nice. So you got a home gym and we gotta we got a clear light sauna. We got a for your health. Um, what's a clear light? Sorry. It's like it's an infrared sauna and then we have a cold plunge. Oh, nice. And so, and I can get something men at home, everything. Everything. If we needed to, we could do our whole Canada. Oh, that's good. But, um, I really enjoy being at the gym around my teammates and around my coaches and just pulling energy from them, you know, for sure. What about strength and conditioning and how often are you doing that? I just, Shane, um, I do more strive to conditioning when I'm out of camp. So like right now I'm doing strength and conditioning like three, four times a week.

Speaker 1:          01:12:10       Uh, but when I'm in camp, it depends on my body in, it depends on what I'm needing at the time. But I usually once or twice a week and then I run just for maintenance just for like metal, like meditative running, you know? Nothing hard to like longer distance but slower. Yeah. But not even too long. Like three minutes. The three miles. Yeah. Nothing crazy that hill that Jackson loves to throw people up. What is that all about? That looks crazy. It is crazy. I mean, it's, um, it, coach Jackson always says, if the mountain can't beat you, nobody can be too, you know, it's like mother nature, Mother Nature as a mother, you know, there's something about that steep ass hill too. And it's crazy. The whole team running up at [inaudible]. It's crazy because, well, there's that one. But then coach wink has another one and that one's just insane.

Speaker 1:          01:13:06       You can't sprint up at you like crawl up it and it's, yeah, it's ridiculous. How steep is it? It's so steep. You can't run. You have to like, you have to basically the first three sprints, there's 10 sprints to the top and then you, and then you slowly jogged back down because it's a really steep, but the first three you really can't sprint up, but you kind of have to bear crawl up them the mountain as fast as you can, as fast as you can. But the one I'm the Hilah tears is, is crazy because of the color. The Halo Tiers. Yeah. It's like it goes up, it goes up and then it goes up. So like when you think you're almost there, it like cranks up even harder and then you have to get to the top and um, it will test you for sure. It can break you. Well, that camp

Speaker 3:          01:13:55       was known for its endurance. Like the fighters that come out of that camp are known for having great cardio. Yeah. And how often do those Jackson maker or Winkeljohn make everybody do those?

Speaker 1:          01:14:07       It just depends. Um, we used to do them as teams as quite a bit as a team, quite a bit on the weekends. But you know, coach Jackson, coach Wayne. Yup. Oh, that's me. That's my sister. That's my dog. My, my Adobe. It doesn't look like anything really.

Speaker 3:          01:14:24       No, it looks like it to me. Yeah. I'm used to running hills. I know what it's like. That it's terrible. Yeah. It looks like that. Yeah. That's a feels like, yeah. Well it's, it's amazing how gravity is one of the best things to work with. Like get a good pitch, good steep angle and try to run up that this is one of the best things for strength and conditioning for just conditioning your lungs and your, your ability to recover.

Speaker 1:          01:14:50       Yeah. Yeah. I love it. I think that, um, again, it's another one of those things that can, can really break you. And uh, I think it's just like a, a theme, like a consistent theme in fighting is, is will you break, can you, if you break then you're not meant for it, you know, or, or maybe you are and you just need to, to heal. Up and go back at it and try it again. But

Speaker 3:          01:15:21       when you, in terms of your mental endurance, I mean that's what we're talking about, right? We're talking about four to two and your spirit, your indomitable spirit. When if you go back to when you first started fighting versus now, like your tolerance must be through the roof. Like what you can tolerate, what you can endure and your belief in yourself. Yeah. All that stuff I feel evolves. Just like your skills do.

Speaker 1:          01:15:44       Yeah, 100% and, and, but it's crazy too because you know, we all have our, our own separate journeys and I feel like when you first start fighting, just like when you're a kid and you jump off of things and you, you're fearless because you don't know what it feels like to get hurt. And then you break your leg and then you're like, oh, I'll never doing that again. You know? I feel like it's the same in fighting. Like when you see a lot of amateur fighters or, or new fighters, they go out there and they just do whatever because they're fearless. They've never been knocked out there, never been hit. They never broken anything. And so they're just going to go out there and, and, and be fearless and, and then they get knocked out or submitted and then the next time they go out, they're not as as free. Um, and I think the, the truth, the true test is to see if, you know, you can deal with those, those challenges and allow it to, to make you grow versus, you know, petrify you and make you go backwards, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:16:42       Do you do any psychological training? Do you have a mental coach or a hip and test? Right.

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       I do. I have a sports psychologist, Dr. Shannon, and he's, he's, um, he's been working with me from my last few fights and I won all three fights. And I think that's a, a big reason why for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:17:00       I, I think that is a giant overlooked factor. And some people get along great without it, but could they be even better with it? That's the rule. Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       absolutely. There's so much that goes into fighting that I think people don't see. You know, I think it's just like with anything in life, like how long it takes to make a movie versus the actual movie and, and, and what goes into that 15 minutes of a fight that nobody even knows, you know, not just eight weeks, but your entire, you know, training before that. You know, for me it's, you know, I've been doing martial arts since I was 10 and fighting professionally for over 10 years. And so it, it's an accumulation of all of those things. But um, each fight presents its own problem and if you're not mentally prepared for it, if you're not prepared physically for not prepared, like spiritually, emotionally, like hormonally, if that's even a word, um, everything has to line up that one night, those 15 minutes or 25 minutes in order for you to win. And, um, you can definitely beat yourself before you step into the octagon.

Speaker 2:          01:18:13       So what kind of stuff do you work on with your psychologist without giving too much away?

Speaker 1:          01:18:19       I talked to him about this all the time cause it's like my secret sauce. Right? But how he explains his is everybody knows what you're supposed to do, but you have to put in the work. Just like physically you have to put in the work. Like I can sit up here, I can tell you what I do, but it's not going to make a difference unless you actually put in the work to, to, to strengthen your mind mentally. Um, but um, we do a lot of, um, so your opponent, it's not like you can practice barring them because you've never fought them before. Um, and so how he explains it to me is it's just a repetition, you know, of the mind and um,

Speaker 2:          01:19:01       okay, so when,

Speaker 1:          01:19:04       so you just have to really, I think explore your imagination. And um, for us, we, we practice the fight in her head. And um, some days are harder than others. Sometimes I win the fight in the first 10 seconds of the, of the round. Sometimes it's all five rounds and it's a war and, and I win that way. But you have to, you have to see yourself going through every different scenario and there are millions in MMA and you just practice them over and over and over. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:19:37       So it's essentially just going through that or do you, do you prepare your mindset in terms of do is for, for, for, for me, I have a set of power where there's what he calls him. Power words won't tell us what they are. And so, um, yeah, I again, um, confidence, uh, flow vicious.

Speaker 1:          01:20:09       Um, thank think I'm trying to see mom champ.

Speaker 2:          01:20:15       Mom Champion. Yeah. Cause you want to be the first mom champ.

Speaker 1:          01:20:17       Yes sir. Um, healthy.

Speaker 4:          01:20:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:20:29       There are a couple of others as well, but the one word is, is not just a word. It's like a whole thought process. So when I say one word, it, it feeds into an entire feeling, if that makes any sense. And so instead of having to have a conversation in my mind, which takes way too long, I just say confidence and it takes me where I need to be. And, um, eventually I want, you shouldn't even have to do that. You should just be in the moment and just allow your, your mind to connect with your body. Do you do any meditating at all? Yeah, I mean, I would say it's kind of a meditative,

Speaker 4:          01:21:21       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:21:21       I, I would say it's more of, of, of, of a practice than it is meditation because I'm not trying to clear my mind. I'm really trying to focus on something specific. Right. But outside of that, you don't meditate? Uh, I wouldn't say sell. Maybe just maybe in my runs. Sometimes when I run I just, that's when I clear my mind. How about you?

Speaker 2:          01:21:43       Yeah, I've been doing it a little bit, but most of what I do, I do what I get in the tank. Float tank. I like float tank. Do you, do you use one? I have before. It feels like you're floating in space. Yeah. That's amazing. Does Jackson's have one? No. They should have won. We should. Huh? So if you wouldn't want to go in there after God disgusting. And we have this, we have a hot sauna at the gym and there's tons of people. There's tons of people. So it gets, could you, yeah, no, I'm sure the hot sauna, those different than a float tank is full tanks. So personal. It's just one little [inaudible] naked [inaudible] is they showed me yours and it felt hotter than the ones that I've ever done. Is this the right temperature? Is it? Yeah. Okay. Cause 94 degrees, that's what it should be. Yeah. It should be the same as the surface

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       as your body temperature. Right? Yeah. Cause it was crazy. I remember doing at one time and I kind of drifted off and I remember almost waking up and feeling like I was like floating in space. Yeah, sure. Almost like kind of panicked because I didn't have a sense of where my, what my where my body was. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:22:47       That's what triggers is weird psychedelic states. But if you can find one and use it on a regular basis, it works great with visualization and a lot of athletes, UFC and other sports as well. They, they use it for visualization. I till think about passes like throwing a pass and then watching someone catch

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       it. They'll, they'll visualize things and go through the, the, the technique in their head. And I've done that with Jujitsu as well. I've done that with certain techniques that I was really trying to learn. You could do it as if you're rolling, you know, like you're, you're just like picturing your body going through the different positions.

Speaker 1:          01:23:23       Yeah, yeah. That's basically what we do, um, with the mental training and, um, it probably just take it up a notch in the, um, in the float tank. Yeah, I'm sure. But a lot of times, like when I meet up with my, with Dr. Shannon, we meet up at at noisy places like Starbucks or you know, or at a coffee shop or something like that. And it's because he wants, he that, that life is always going to have distractions. Oh, that's interesting. And, um, you know, you need to be able to focus with instruction, especially me. Like there's so many things going on in my life with being a mother and a wife, um, that sometimes I can use the distractions as an excuse to justify why I'm not getting things done or this or that. You know? Right. And, um, so that's something that I've really been working hard at is to, not to not use those as excuses, but more so to, to, to allow the distractions to happen and, and choose to stay focused anyways.

Speaker 3:          01:24:23       Um, there are, there's quite a few women's MMA fighters now, but it's still small in comparison to men. When you meet young girls that look up to you, do you recognize that the, you have, you have a very, this is a very critical, and it's a very small role. There's an in small, in terms of small amount of people providing that role. Yeah. As role models to young kids that are thinking about fighting. When a young girl meets you, like, oh my God, it's the karate hottie like, is it, is it weird to you? Like what is that feeling like to you when you meet a young girl and you say, Oh my God, this is me when I was six?

Speaker 1:          01:25:04       Yeah. It's amazing. It really is to know that just through my story that I've touched people's lives, you know, um, I get approached a lot by, by parents, you know, that are happy that I'm pursuing what I'm pursuing, even being a mom, you know, so, um, I think that's really cool just because I feel like when I was pregnant, um, how old's your daughter now? She's eight. Yeah. So when I was, she was much younger for some reason. I know she's a shrimp. That's why I showed the pictures when she was younger. She is anybody. I I, this might be too much information, but um, after I had my daughter, she's been to every single one of my fights. Um, and uh, I had my first fight back when I was 10 months old and I was still breastfeeding. I like breastfed

Speaker 3:          01:26:02       when she was 10 months old. Now you were 10 months old

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       when she was tennis. Wow. You had a fight while you were breastfeeding. That was your first fight? My first fight back. Oh, okay. How many fights did you have before your daughter? Oh, I had a good amount. I'd say.

Speaker 3:          01:26:17       I don't even as you've been fighting for 10 years, professional years, 12 years

Speaker 1:          01:26:21       [inaudible] yeah, a good amount. I was 25 when I had her when I was pregnant. But yeah, I just remember being pregnant and being, everybody talks about like postpartum depression, but I was really depressed during my pregnancy. I mean, don't get me wrong. I loved being pregnant and there was a lot of memories that I had with her being in my belly and me feeling her and all of this and that, that, um, those moments I, I treasure forever, but I was depressed. Like I couldn't do what I wanted to do. It's not like I could go out and, you know, I fell, I was feeling bad. I couldn't just throw the gloves on and go out and spar and hit somebody in the face.

Speaker 3:          01:26:59       So, you know, like, you know, normal thing that you do to relieve stress.

Speaker 1:          01:27:06       And I just, I, I've watched everybody get better and I watched everybody progress and, and fight and it, you know, it ate me alive and I just, I, there was just so much uncertainty and so much unknown. Was my body going to be the same, you know, it was I going to even want it. Was I going to have time to do it? Um, there were just so much that I didn't know until I was, I was really down then. And I, um, I get a lot of moms that approach me and they tell me that because I went back and continued to pursue my dream that they did to, you know, and I think that, um, that's cool. That is cool.

Speaker 3:          01:27:46       Now when you say you had your first fight back 10 months, that's, that's a really, for people that don't recognize, that's a very short amount of time to rebound from giving birth, then get yourself back in shape and then get yourself into a fighting shape. Yeah. Where you're like, I'm ready to take a fight and then train for the fight. I mean that is a incredible process to go through in 10 months.

Speaker 1:          01:28:07       It was crazy. It really was. My body was it when you, when you have a baby, your, your bones kind of like drift apart from each other and um, you gain weight. And I, after I had my daughter, I found out that I will, during my pregnancy I got gestational diabetes and um, and I gained like 50 pounds. I gained a lot. Like I looked like, um, the blueberry on a Willy Wonka.

Speaker 3:          01:28:36       But

Speaker 1:          01:28:37       um, yeah, I I,

Speaker 3:          01:28:40       how long did it take you to bounce back where you in the gym again? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:28:43       I probably stayed with my daughter for the first three months that I had her and I just wanted to be a mom. I just wanted to be with her and I wanted to nurture her and you know, enjoy my time with her. Uh, and I think it was after three months where I was like, I, I want to take somebody that notes. But yeah, hold on a, relieve some stress. So, and coach wink and coach Jackson and all my teammates were so supportive. And so I would come into the gym and I'd have, you know, my diaper bag in one hand and my gym bag in the other and my car seat. And I'd, I'd come into the gym and I'd set it all down and I'd get wrapped up and she'd be in the car seat and she chill out and wow. If she would start to cry, coach wink or a coach, Jackson would pick her up and then, you know, they'd let me spar and you know, she needed to get, she needed to eat.

Speaker 1:          01:29:35       I would go to the room and feed her and then come back and, and, and we made it work. Wow. Yeah. So, um, so I started training for that and I really couldn't run to, to lose the weight because my joints and my bones were like all spread apart, you know. So when you say spread apart, like what actually does happen? Well, they, I mean, I don't know like all the, the science behind it, but they just say that in order to like have the baby, like everything kind of separates from each other. Your, your bones like loosen and you're like more agile and loose and stuff like that. And so

Speaker 3:          01:30:09       felt it, I felt a big difference in the way your body.

Speaker 1:          01:30:12       Yeah, for sure. I felt it. And um, so instead of running I would swim from my cardio and that helped me, um, cause it wasn't hard on my joints or anything like that and it kind of helps me get back into shape and you kind of just, you kind of just go with the flow and figure it out as you go. It was really hard. I was worried that I was worried that because I got back into sparring and this and that, that um, I would go dry, like my milk would go dry but I didn't, it just, my body just figured, okay this is what, what you do. And I, I still produce milk and everything and it was really sensitive at first to get hit and, and then I just got used to the pain and then wow.

Speaker 3:          01:31:00       How many would have one of those? I'm like, yikes. Yeah, I would imagine you're, yeah. I mean, if your memories, you know, like pump up.

Speaker 1:          01:31:10       Yeah. It's, it's, the body is just so amazing though. Like it'll, it'll adapt to what it needs to adapt to. And, and when I trained, I got used to the pain and then it didn't hurt anymore. And then, you know, my, I would only produce as much as she needed. It was really cool. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:31:29       Now when you fought 10 months, it's pretty incredible for your daughter to have only seen you fighting. That's gotta be crazy too, right? Yeah. Can't remember when you weren't fighting. Yeah. My mom kicks ass.

Speaker 1:          01:31:42       Yeah, she has, she has a really cool upbringing, I think. Like she's just, she's, she's surrounded by really cool people. Like she gets to meet the coolest people in the world and they're normal to her because that, you know, she, she sees John and Holly and you know, that's, that's Auntie Holly to her. And so like, you know, her expectations for, for what she can be in life I think are way higher, you know? And I think because she's surrounded by people like that, that shit. And that's why I like to keep around because you know, my dad used to always tell me that, um, we learned through our actions, our parents' actions. You know, you walk the walk, you don't talk the talk. And so I think the best teacher can be my actions and for her to see it through her own eyes.

Speaker 1:          01:32:35       I can tell her this, this, and this all day. But, but it's a different story when she comes to a fight with me and I am the champion, the one oh five champion and I'm defending my belt and you know, I bust my eye open to the point where you can't see it anymore and I lose my belt. And for her to see that and for her to see that Mommy's okay and that failure is a part of life and that I still love what I do and I'm going to still go after you know, my set of dreams because failure is a part of your journey. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:33:10       that's amazing lesson for kid learn and to see that at a high level, growing up with her mother on this giant stage in front of all these people in the crowd and television, that's amazing for her.

Speaker 1:          01:33:22       Yeah. And because people ask me all the time, like, is w w aren't you afraid that she's going to see you get hurt and this and that, but why would you want to shield them from that stuff? I know, I know. It's, it's hard. It's a hard pill to swallow. You don't want your children to see you, her and this and that. But I'd rather her see it and be prepared for it, you know? Because life isn't fair. Life isn't sunshine and rainbows all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:33:46       Yeah. It's challenging for her and challenging things for kids. That's how they grow, you know? Um, that that's do you have, when you think about your career, do you have a timeline where you don't want to fight anymore? How old are you now? I'd like to fight for the belt this year. This year? Yeah. You're 30, 33 33 so you're in your prime. Like right now that's like an athlete's prime is like 30 to like 35, 36. Yeah. You're in that zone. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:34:15       I'm in the zone. I'm confident. I feel ready. I feel like I've gone through my ups and downs. I've, I've, I've gone through all the steps that I, that are necessary for me to be confident to, to be a contender.

Speaker 3:          01:34:28       Okay. Do you have a timeline when you want to stop? I would give myself,

Speaker 1:          01:34:34       I don't know, it just really depends on how my career goes, but I would say three to four more years.

Speaker 3:          01:34:41       So you're just, you're just in the zone right now. You're just concentrating on getting things done, fighting for a title. You're not thinking about like planning the future up.

Speaker 1:          01:34:51       I would like my children. Oh. Um, I know my husband doesn't care for him. My daughter doesn't even care for me to have challenge. She'd rather just be the three of us, you know? But, um, I would like my children and, um, I, I have taken steps to, to figure out what I'm going to do when I'm, when I retire as a fighter. Um, but, uh, I feel like this story needs to, I need to finish out the story from my own sake and for, you know, millions of other parents out there that, you know, have a dream and don't give up on their dream and just because they have children, it's a longer road, but it's worth it. No. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:35:35       I hear Ya. Now when you look at the division, it's an incredible division now. So town stacked, we don't know what's going to happen with rose. She mean she's even said she might retire. Yeah. And she's a very eccentric person. I mean she's, she's not motivated by money. She's very, very unusual.

Speaker 1:          01:35:54       And I love how honest she is about her emotions. Yeah, I do as well. Like she's very vulnerable.

Speaker 3:          01:36:00       She's very strong. I mean, in terms of like her ability to broadcast that and tell everybody in project it. Um, so she was, I felt like she was winning that fight and I'm a hundred percent yeah, she got caught with one of the craziest slam chaos we've ever seen. I mean, you've got to go back to like Carlos Newton, Matt Hughes to have a slam k like that. Yeah, I don't, I'm trying to remember. I guess one, it's one of the best slam Kaos of all time PD. Tito Ortiz, Evan Tanner. That was another one. I mean, Slam Kao is a rare

Speaker 1:          01:36:32       and I love that it came from the smallest division in the UFC. Right. I think that is just amazing. I'm just so proud of the strawweight division if I can say so. But I do, I think it's stacked. I feel like in from my, any fight that I have from here on out is championship caliber fight in my opinion. Yeah. Um, and that's why I want to fight for the belt. Like I want to go for the belt so that it's legit. Like we're fighting for the belt, you know? And after that it's a championship fight every time. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:37:05       When you're looking at that division, do you have those two Jessica on drudge? And we don't want, again, we do not know where rose his head is at, what she wants to do, but if she wanted to have a rematch, they probably would set that up. Then you have you wanna. Um, you have Tatiana Suarez who's a beast. You have, you, you have, who else in the division stands out? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:37:26       To, um, well, Nina, sure. What Jenna has to get through Nina first. Sure. She kind of just write it under the radar. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:37:32       The, our office, she's Badass

Speaker 1:          01:37:35       and maybe it's because, and that's a problem that I've had to, is that I'm not as vocal, you know, she just, she just goes in there and does her thing. And, um, and I think that a lot of people are overlooking her as well. Sure. Um, and, and that's why I'm just, I'm speaking out now. This is what I want. And Joshua's jokes. He says, we get 100% what you don't ask for. So, so I'm asking for it. It's what I want, you know. Um, but, uh, yeah, there's, there's widely, um, so I know that they're, they're trying to pump her and she's really good. I'm coming out of China and then, um, you know, obviously Teesha Claudia and, and even the girls outside of the top 10 are dangerous. It's, it's, it's a stacked division and in can go probably the most talented division I would say. So for sure technically and heart driven, I would say for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:38:33       Now, what have they said in terms of like what your future holds, if they have anything lined up for you? When do they say, like, if they're going to come to you and say, hey, Michelle, we'd like you to fight in July or August or September. Like when would they come to you?

Speaker 1:          01:38:49       I feel like, um, with the way that the rankings are, are working, if I just take a fight outside of who the, who is the current champ, I'm going to be in the same spot. I've won my last two fights and I've gone down and rankings, you know, so I, um, I, I really would like to hold off to fight the champion because I feel like any other fight is going to either take me down or keep me in the same spot. So I don't know what they're planning on doing with Tatiana and Nina, but, uh, if they're trying to give them a shot before me, I feel like I want the winner of that and let me in them, hash it out to, to fight for the belt.

Speaker 3:          01:39:35       Hmm. So that would be what you would do as a second choice. First Choice. Does he want to fight for the belt? Second choices, whoever's going to fight for the belt. Let me fight her.

Speaker 1:          01:39:43       Let me find them first because Tatiana only had seven fights. Nothing against her. Like she's, you know, she's pled her case. I have three times the money fights as she does. You know, I've fought for about four. I've been a champion before. I've gone five rounds before I fought main event before I've worked my way back up. Give me a shot. Let me be mom champ.

Speaker 3:          01:40:06       Yeah. You gotta get there before somebody else does. Right. That's what I'm saying. Cause the only other person in that, well, cats and Ghana, you know, I mean, I don't know how our eyeballs doing right now. I know that was a crazy situation to have all those fights in the UFC and never have someone get towed in the, I like that before. And obviously, you know, that's how Winkeljohn Boston's vision. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:40:25       Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. It is really scary to think that this is what we do and that there's very, there's so many dangerous. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:40:34       I mean you, you're in a while business lady.

Speaker 1:          01:40:36       Yeah. But I, I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't trade it for the world. I just, you know, this is what I love doing so.

Speaker 3:          01:40:43       Well that's awesome. Then you're in the right spot. Well, obviously, you know, you ranked number seven in the world even though it is gotta be frustrating though, that you have gone in rankings. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       Yeah. I haven't lost absolutely 100%. And I just, um, I don't know why they would argue for me not to get the belt to go for it. You know, everything's there at the storyline. Is there. Yeah. Um, it would be, you know, technique versus strength, speed versus power. This is you and Jessica. Yeah. Yup. Yeah. And um, and like I said, there were, there, there were millions of people rallying behind me because they want to see me, you know, get that belt. And I do too. You know, I'd love for my daughter to see that dream of mine come true and, and uh, for her to come in the octagon with me and be holding that belt, I think it would be an amazing moment.

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       Yeah. It's crazy watching kids see their parents when titles and how amazing it is to them. It's, it's a, it's very strange thing to see like that, oh my God, you know, my mom is the champ of the world and my dad's champ, we've never seen it, obviously from a woman, but that my dad's a champion. The world. Yeah. It's a very powerful thing.

Speaker 1:          01:41:58       Yeah. So you're in a holding pattern right now, essentially. Yeah, that's, that's, that's what we're doing. Is your last fight? Um, was it April, March or April? March or April. Yeah. We're just working. We're getting better. Almost a year. No, this April, this April two. What am I talking about? Yeah. I thought I thought Carolina cleavage. That's right. Yeah. I know. It was a great fight. Um, I wanted to finish, but you can't force those things, you know? So, uh, I just going to continue to do what I'm doing and continue to get better. And

Speaker 3:          01:42:32       what'd you think of her loss to on drudge? That was crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:42:36       I feel like styles make fights and it was the perfect fight for, and Raj to showcase her knockout power because K K is a pressure fighter and she instinctively will go forward and throw when she is in danger and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, you know? Yeah. And she throws hard, obviously she put, um, you ana, you know, she buckled you on a couple of times. She's dangerous. She's, she won. She won against rose. Yeah. You know, so, um, but yeah, I think styles make fights and um, that's, that's what happened with her in that situation. What do you think?

Speaker 3:          01:43:23       Entourages unusually strong. Yeah. Look Freakish. No. Like you see when she grabs a hold of people and then dumps them on their ass, like she's, she's freakishly powerful to be able to like hit that single and elevate a rose that way and drop on her head. When you think about how strong you have to be to do that, it's beautiful. Yeah. Beautiful to watch. Um, she's a beast. Great technique as well. No, no doubt about it. But man, a lot of dollar bottle horsepower, that's her bread and butter. And

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       I, and I figured, I honestly, I gave it to rose to win the fight. Um, it only takes a split second though to lose your focus and to get picked up and slammed it down like that. And then the fights over,

Speaker 3:          01:44:05       you know, the division is actually probably good because it's exciting because it mixes things up a bit. You have Yolanda who is the dominant champion for so long. Rows comes on to Pete's, her and then Jessica dumps rose in her head and beats her and a fight that she was losing. I mean there's like, it's a hotbed of talent. It's really, it's 115 pound women's division is amazing right now. There really is.

Speaker 1:          01:44:24       Yeah. Yeah. And um, so that's what I'm wanting. That's exactly what I want. And uh, in the meantime we just, we just get better and beautiful way. We train and we get better. We feel like what's going to be on Androgel is, um, I mean rose had rose was doing exactly what she's doing. I think that role is actually kind of got a bit just to, as a little bit complacent and in like, she, she's even said it herself. It was a moment of, of laziness.

Speaker 3:          01:44:56       Yeah. And I mean so hard after the fact to try to figure out what went wrong, why it went wrong, what was going on in her head, but clearly it was not lacing up the legs when she's attacking the Camorra elevated and dumped

Speaker 1:          01:45:08       and, and, and I'm sure for a lot of her camp she's, she was able to do that with um, with her teammates and eat probably pop off good submissions, you know, but in the moment of a fight for a championship belts in your hometown against the person that's bread and butter is a pile drive, you know, it, it's just like stacks up against you

Speaker 3:          01:45:33       for sure. Well good luck trying to find someone as strong as val is, her outside of me, Valentino who she does train with. I mean, but Jessica and Raj is probably one of the strongest women in the 150 pound division. She's so damn strong. So good luck trying to find someone to replicate that.

Speaker 1:          01:45:48       The training, you don't train that you don't train the pile driver. Like that's dangerous. That's one of those things that you just, I don't, I don't,

Speaker 3:          01:45:59       she does train of Valentino though. Who's one of the strongest women at 125 Valentino's a tank. That's a very strong one.

Speaker 1:          01:46:05       But her style is different too. Yeah, she's a, she's a counter fighter and she picks and chooses when she wants to go and if she holds you down. Yeah. Like her take downs or not unjudged his take downs. Right. You know, so I don't know. We'll see.

Speaker 3:          01:46:20       It is one of the things that's so exciting about the sport is that there are so many different ways to approach it. There's so many different ways. Here's your way, karate style. There's you on his way. Moitai you know there's something, there's Jessica's way bulldog get ahold of you. Take her down and you know, in a lot of ways you'll want to also show how to beat Jessica was Raj, you know, she showed her the beat here.

Speaker 1:          01:46:41       I just, I feel the difference with Johan and rose is that rose, because this is just my opinion, rose has, it has shown to have more variety in her, in her toolbox. She's this really good grappling and this and that, that I don't think she's as, she's not a hazard as hesitant to go to the ground. I feel like if, if, if the situation allowed it, she would go to the ground and even get a submission on, on drudge. Whereas with [inaudible], she knows what she has to do to win, and she'll be stubborn in that sense and do that for five minutes, for five rounds consistently. You know what I mean? And I feel like with rose, she's, she will, she'll take risks and, and a lot of times it does work for her, you know? And sometimes it just doesn't.

Speaker 3:          01:47:37       Yeah. And that was just one of those times. Yeah. Just, it's interesting to see her talk about fighting in peer period, that she doesn't know if she has that in her anymore, just to be mean to a person to hurt a person. But I thought that was really interesting. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:47:50       Yeah, I love how honest she is, but I also feel like a big part of her getting the belt was to know that she could, you know, to know that she could take down, you honor the invincible, you know? And then she did that and then it was like, all right, well now I know that I can, and it's kind of like, well, I've already, I've already accomplished what I wanted to accomplish. I don't know. Maybe that's just me thinking out loud of what maybe she might be going through. What might be going on in her mind, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:48:19       let's say if you fought on drudge and you beat her and you become the champion, would that take a significant amount of motivation away from you or would you have more motivation to defend it?

Speaker 1:          01:48:30       So we'll talk about this too, because that's been such a huge goal of mine is to be the champ. Um, and I, I want to say two fights ago, we started implementing, um, visualizations of me being the champ and defending the belt and how that would look like, you know, and, um, does with your psychologist. With my sports psychologist and um, yeah, so that, that makes the mountain higher. You know, it's like, it's not the end game. Once you get the belt. And coach Jackson would say that all the time. It's easy to become the champ. It's harder to stay the champ.

Speaker 3:          01:49:10       No, Charlie is, well, listen, Michelle, you're very entertaining. I love Washington fight. I hope if you do get the Cha, the chance of fight for the title, that I'll be there to call it. And uh, thanks for doing this. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much for having me. [inaudible] everybody get a chance to get to know you. Thank you Michelle. Waterson ladies, gentlemen, bye everybody.
