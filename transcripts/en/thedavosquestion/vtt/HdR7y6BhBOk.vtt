00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.249
&gt;&gt; My name's Don Tapscott, and I'm a member
of the Global Attending

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:09.980
Council on the Future of Government.
And I've just received the -- the Youth Task

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.540
Force report of the Global
Redesign Initiative.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.490
And I think it's a great piece of work.
And it's so important that young people are

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.990
involved because around the
world we have the biggest generation ever,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.989
and this is a generation
that is very different.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.029
They're enormously influential.
A lot of them are wired, they learn and think

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.330
differently, and at their
fingertips they have the most powerful tool

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.960
ever for figuring out
what's going on, for informing others, even

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.690
for organizing collective
responses.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.010
And the problems that -- that the Global Redesign
Initiative is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.510
addressing are ultimately not going to be
resolved by my generation.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.690
These problems are going to be handed over
to young people, to you.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.100
And the world is not a very happy place right
now.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780
So we're counting on you to really bring about
the kind of changes

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.970
necessary to ensure that the smaller world
that your kids inherit will

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.040
be a better one.
So get involved and keep up the great work.
