00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.750
What are the learning outcomes of this course? At the conclusion of this class,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.200
you will be able to do three primary things. First, you'll be able to design,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.370
implement and evaluate and describe knowledge-based AIs. The design and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.680
description of knowledge-based AI agent is really the first learning goal.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.640
In order to be able to design an agent,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.770
you need knowledge of the methods of knowledge-based AI. Second, you will also

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.700
be able to use these strategies to address practical problems. This learning

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.275
outcome addresses the second learning goal, where you will be able to

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:37.408
[INAUDIBLE] the relationship between AI agents and real world problems. Third,

00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:41.860
you'll also be able to use the design of knowledge-based AI agents to reflect on

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.570
human cognition and vice versa. This addresses the fourth learning goal.
