1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.550
What do you see in terms of the way they fueled themselves?

2
00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:03.660
It's like the biggest error.

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.270
Sticking to want one style of feeding regardless of the training style that

4
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:11.400
they're engaging.
And so MMA athletes,

5
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.700
they have to do high intensity training session strength and conditioning.

6
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:15.870
They have to be doing sparring,

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.850
they have to be doing pads rounds that are you crazy heart in every athlete.

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.600
Each one is going to have a different intensity relative to to to their body

9
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:26.580
type.
And so if somebody is doing pads,

10
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:31.140
it's a nine or a 10 out of 10 in terms of intensity and they're doing that fast

11
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:34.770
it or they're doing that without carbohydrates available to do that work.

12
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.730
They can't,

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.690
they can't a hit those training intensities repeatedly and then they can't adapt

14
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.190
as a response to that training.

15
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:45.450
So they in end up just getting slower and more beat up instead of faster and

16
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:47.730
more powerful.
So if they're doing high intensity,

17
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:51.810
we need to fuel the body in the specific way that supports that training effort.

18
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.280
And then the longer term adaptation to that bout.
Additionally,

19
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:57.420
if they're doing lower intensity,

20
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:02.190
we can adjust our fueling strategies based on what that dictates.
You know,

21
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.641
if it's,

22
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:06.930
if it's a kind of a base of aerobic training session or if they're doing skills

23
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:07.620
and drills,

24
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.980
we want to be feeding the body to adapt differently than if they're doing the

25
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:15.270
high intensity sparring strength and conditioning or pads or whatever that might

26
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:19.860
be.
So for every athlete we're looking at how their body uses substrate energy,

27
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.270
the energy that they're using,

28
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:24.300
the sub strait between carbs and fat at each of these intensities,

29
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.400
and then we also needed basic base.

30
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.960
We need to base our recommendations on where their body fits into the division.

31
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:35.430
If they're,
if they're 20% out from their weight division four weeks out,

32
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.670
then we're going to have a little bit of a more aggressive strategy

33
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:41.790
nutritionally because of weight becomes a primary factor.

34
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.090
If they're 10% out,
four weeks out,

35
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.440
then we're going to have a little bit of a different conversation than

36
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:51.780
prioritization around the fueling strategies and all of these conversations

37
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:54.910
integrate within our strength and conditioning program so that we're working in

38
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.930
concert and tying in the workload in into our own system as well as the,

39
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:03.540
the training load that they're engaging with.
Skill specific training.

40
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.290
Now when you vary the Diet that you give them independent dependent of the

41
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:09.090
workout,
what does,
what does that based on?

42
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:14.091
Is that based on a heart accepted science of carbohydrate versus protein versus

43
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:18.680
essential fat essential fatty acids?
Like how do you determine that?
So we,
we,

44
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.900
we use a philosophy,
a system called metabolic efficiency.

45
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.480
You could call it metabolic flexibility.
I've heard of call it as well.

46
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.950
And essentially the body will use different substrate add different intensities

47
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.280
and at low intensities and at rest the body can and likely should be adapted,

48
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.510
uh,
for our,
for our sports athletes to,
to fat at rest.

49
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.670
Now it depends on the sport type.
Again,

50
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:45.060
if we're a shot putter or if we're a 100 meter sprinter,

51
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.610
then we're going to be much more dependent on carbohydrates.

52
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.830
And really the creatine phosphate system,

53
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.990
we're not even getting into the glycolytic system.

54
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.970
And Duncan could talk a lot more about the energy systems,
but essentially we're,

55
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.850
we're reliant upon glucose and ATP for energy at those lower intensity births.

56
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.770
Right?
So to hit repeated Max or sub Max efforts,
we require blood sugar.

57
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.720
And without it,
we will,
will deplete our,
our initial stores.

58
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.070
And then we can't,
we can't,
we can no longer hit 90 or 95% of our Max.

59
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:20.071
We start hitting 80 and 70 and 60 and diminishing our ability to do these high

60
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:21.160
intensity efforts.
Now,

61
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:24.460
do you guys see anybody come in and try to fight on a Ketogenic Diet?

62
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.750
Because I know quite a few guys were doing that for awhile.

63
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.120
I know Bryan Caraway did it.
Matt Brown.
Yeah,
that's right.
He has fought,
but he,

64
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:35.830
he varies it,
I think he,
yeah,
well I talked to him.
I think he did one per pure,

65
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.040
and then he did,
you know,
he did the one where you,
you know,

66
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.890
you might take in 60 or 80 carbs,
but then you work them off to stay Kadijah.

67
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.790
I don't,
some of those guys like Zack bitter.
Um,

68
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.950
he's a ultra marathon runner.

69
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.400
He v he does eat ketogenic most of the time,

70
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:56.210
but then on days of big races he'll consume a lot of sugars.
Yeah.
And yeah,

71
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.560
and again,
I'll insulin sensitivity to,
yeah.

72
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.070
So essentially the more we could regulate blood sugar at rest and low

73
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:03.904
intensities,

74
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.650
then we can expand and to support the development of that kind of aerobic

75
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.470
oxidative system.
And by adapting to use fat as a primary substrate,
we're,

76
00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:14.680
we're doing a number of things.
One,

77
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:19.150
we're balancing blood sugar at rest so that we can really limit the insulin

78
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.810
spikes and essentially adipose development.
Um,

79
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.430
in addition to really

80
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.550
driving the body towards the oxidative and,
or the OC state of aerobic system.

81
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.200
And then as we increase in,
in,
what we do is we assess how the body adapts,

82
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:37.210
so through the training intensities,

83
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.570
and we'll repeat that kind of on a monthly basis to see how the athlete changes

84
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.080
and then as they increase in the intensity of a training effort,

85
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.160
then we will adjust the ratio of fat to carbohydrates as,
as the,

86
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.440
as a fuel substrate.
