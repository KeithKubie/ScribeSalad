CALEB: All right.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.480
Welcome everybody.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.070
Thank you guys for coming to
another "Authors@Google" talk

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.760
with the one and only
Steve Hindy, co-founder

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.410
and president of
Brooklyn Brewery.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.420
His new book, "The
Craft Beer Revolution,"

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.490
tells the story about how
craft brewers joined forces

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.940
to forever change the way
the world buys, enjoys,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.692
and appreciates beer.

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:23.650
As one of the founding
players in the movement,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.790
Hindy brings a true insider's
account of the personalities,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.850
battles, and
alliances that colored

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.920
the early days of craft beer.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.930
So now I want to read
you a paragraph that

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.060
made me actually laugh
out loud and shows

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.620
why I like the
book so much and I

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.170
think you guys should grab it.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.440
The set up is Paul
Shipman, the co-founder

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.230
of what became Redhook, was
telling a story to Peter Krebs

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.960
for his book-- is Krebs right--
"Redhook Beer Pioneer," when

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.050
he hilariously said
this, "We inspired people

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.000
to become microbrewers,"
Shipman claimed to Krebs,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.400
"because every home brewer
who tasted our beer thought

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.840
they could make better
beer in the bathtub.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.520
They were thinking
that if Redhook

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.670
could be this successful with
a beer that tasted this odd,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.582
just think of what they could
do with a good tasting beer."

00:01:07.582 --> 00:01:10.040
So that's one of the reasons
I think you should pick it up.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.800
If you're still
not sure, the book

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.260
has praise from the founders of
Anchor, New Belgium, Sam Adams,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.130
Dogfish Head, Sierra
Nevada, Deschutes,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.100
and even the CEOs of
Miller, Coors, and Heineken.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.100
Sam Calagione, founder
of Dogfish Head

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.040
said, "Balance-- it's a
desired trait in the brewery

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.640
world, that perfectly
comforting zone

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.030
created through the
interplay of hops and barley.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.760
Steve Hindy has found the
equivalent space as a beer

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.710
journalist/brewing
pioneer in his book,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.990
'The Craft Beer
Revolution.'" So here he is.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.490
Steve Hindy.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.590
STEVE HINDY: Thank you, Caleb.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.790
Well, great to be here,
talking about my new book,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.230
which is actually
my second book.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.740
The first book is
called "Beer School,"

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.930
and it tells the whole story
of the Brooklyn Brewery,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.550
the adventures we had in
Brooklyn, the ups and downs,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.720
things we did right,
things we screwed up.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.140
Actually, Mayor Bloomberg
wrote a forward to that book,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.710
and he's quite the
entrepreneur himself.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.920
And I was very proud of that.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.600
You may ask, who am I to
write a history of craft beer,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.570
and that would be
a good question.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.330
Actually, there's an epigraph
before the author's note

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.150
in the book that quotes
Winston Churchill, saying,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.820
"History shall be kind to me,
for I intend to write it."

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.550
And that's sort of the
approach I took with the book.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.080
A lot of it is based on
my personal experience.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.280
I started Brooklyn
Brewery in 1988,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.030
and I was able to kind
of watch the development

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.300
of this industry close up.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.320
I've been involved with the
Brewers Association, our trade

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.560
association, from the
beginning, and it just

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.620
amazed me to see what was
happening with individuals

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.110
coming from all
different walks of life

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.810
with a passion for beer,
starting companies,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.890
and then actually
coming together

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.190
through our association
to really shape

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.340
the industry that
we were involved in.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.590
The book begins with
the ultimate pioneer

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.720
of the craft beer
revolution, which

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.270
is Fritz Maytag, the-- obviously
a scion of the Maytag washing

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.310
machine family, who bought the
Anchor Brewery in San Francisco

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.310
in 1965.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.450
That was a failing local brewery
with a very distinctive brewing

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.420
style called-- that made a
beer called steam beer, which

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.790
is actually a beer
made with a lager yeast

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.630
but fermented at warmer
temperatures like an ale.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.500
So Fritz kind of bought
that brewery on a whim

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.339
and set about reconstructing
it and building

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.400
one of the most
beautiful breweries,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.620
I think, in the world and
also dedicating himself

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.620
to bringing back that all-malt
beer called Anchor Steam.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.080
He was alone in doing
this until 1976,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.060
when a guy named
Jack McAuliffe, who

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.360
had been a US Navy
submariner based in Scotland

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.810
and had gotten into home
brewing when he was over there.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.040
And also, that was-- this would
have been in the mid '70s, when

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.930
the campaign for real ale
was happening in England.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.470
And so Jack came back to
California, to Sonoma,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.460
and cobbled together a
brewery called New Albion,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.860
using old soda tanks, Pepsi
tanks, 55 gallon tanks,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.290
and dairy tanks to
make this brewery.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.770
And actually, he
had two co-founders

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.340
with him, Suzy Denison
and Jane Zimmerman,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.800
and I interviewed
Suzy for the book.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.270
She's 80 years old now
but had just returned

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.270
from a tour of Europe
with her niece,

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.200
and she and Jane do a lot
of traveling together.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.510
Actually, she told me
that she and Jane did

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.060
a lot of the brewing after
New Albion got up and running,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.660
that Jack kind of left
the brewing to them, which

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.640
is interesting if you
think about in the days

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.350
before the commercialization of
brewing, a lot of the brewing

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.310
was done in the home by women.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.810
So I think it's interesting
that those two women were

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.390
kind of there at the foundation
of the craft beer revolution.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.220
That project, New Albion,
was kind of doomed

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.250
from the beginning.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.110
I mean, it was too small, and
the whole idea of craft beer

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.340
was too new at that time to
really have any kind of chance.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.510
But they struggled along
for about six years

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.310
before the whole thing
went out of business.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.070
It was an important
six years though,

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.600
because there were other members
of what I call the pioneer

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.140
group-- people who started
before 1984 building craft

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.570
breweries.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.630
So Ken Grossman
from Sierra Nevada

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.460
visited Jack and the
brewery at New Albion.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.370
Paul Shipman, the guy
who Caleb mentioned,

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.120
from Redhook-- he
came there, the guy

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.210
from Goose Island in Chicago.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.420
People from all
over the country who

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.990
were interested in
starting breweries

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.430
came to see what was
happening at New Albion.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.410
And a number of breweries
started up as a result of that.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.540
I think you know Sierra Nevada.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.800
Ken had a bicycle repair shop
and later a home brew shop

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.190
before he started Sierra
Nevada in his garage.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.160
Ken is an amazing
engineer and tinkerer,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.950
and to this day,
the new brewery he's

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:38.150
building now in North Carolina--
he's there every day, very much

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.510
involved with the
engineering of that project.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.730
Caleb mentioned
Redhook, and there's

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.470
a great story about
Redhook in the book, which

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:55.340
I think describes some
of the struggle of being

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:01.560
a pioneer with craft beer
back in the early '80s.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.380
Paul Shipman was
determined he was

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.170
going to do a very
original beer,

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.900
so he didn't want to buy
a brewer's yeast from any

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.760
of the companies that have yeast
libraries where you can buy

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.760
different kinds of yeast
for different styles.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.280
He wanted an original yeast,
so he went to a chemist

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.010
at the University of Washington
and got a yeast from him

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.090
to make Redhook Ale.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:34.679
I guess he agreed with
the local publican

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:40.360
to launch the Redhook
Ale on a certain date.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.230
And the date came
for the launch,

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:48.090
and they realized that the beer
didn't really taste very good.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.940
But they were kind of stuck,
because they had put out

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.070
in the press that they were
going to open on this date.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.610
So they had their grand
opening with the mayor

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.600
and all dignitaries,
and they tapped

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.460
the keg, poured the
beer, and every one

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.550
took a sip and kind of
put a good face on it.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:11.250
But they knew this stuff
doesn't taste good.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.740
And it was actually left to
a reporter for the Seattle

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.410
newspaper to say what
everyone was thinking, which

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.480
is, this beer tastes
like rotten bananas.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.760
He called it banana beer.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.320
But they kind of soldiered on.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.360
This was all new
territory, and who

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.470
knew what craft beer was
supposed to taste like.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.790
So they soldiered on with
this bad tasting banana

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.160
beer for about a year,
and people bought it

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.870
because they wanted to give
a local brewer a chance.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.570
They were thrilled
that there was

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.810
going to be a new
brewery in Seattle.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.720
People bought the beer,
but after about a year,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.060
word was getting
back that people

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.650
will order this in the pub,
but they'll kind of choke down

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:06.490
one pint and then they'll
switch to Bud, Coors, or Miller,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.160
because they couldn't
get much beyond the pint.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.940
And then a guy
came to Seattle who

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.260
is very important for the
craft beer revolution.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.910
I'm sure many of
you know the name

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.210
Michael Jackson, a
British beer writer

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.160
who wrote a really important
book called "The World

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.090
Guide to Beer,"
published in 1977.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.560
And it was really
the first ever,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.860
I think in history,
serious history of brewing

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.760
and how the different
styles developed.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.780
And Michael, over his
lifetime, which unfortunately

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.940
ended at age 65-- he was
also the world's authority

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.030
on single malt scotch, and
he swallowed the scotch

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:55.830
and the beer, so his
life ended rather early.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.600
But Michael visited
all those breweries.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.280
So he came to Redhook, and
he tasted the Redhook ale.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.167
And Michael never said anything
bad about any craft brewery.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.750
If he didn't like
the brewery, he just

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.580
wouldn't write about it.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.530
So he tasted it,
and he said, well

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.650
this is kind of
like a Belgian beer.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.480
And Shipman said,
exactly, Michael!

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.130
It's a Belgian style beer.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.300
And he set about-- he changed
all the copy on the label

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.650
to say it's a
Belgian style beer,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.380
and they changed all
their marketing materials.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.490
And they forged ahead,
but still, no matter what

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.690
you called it, it
didn't taste good.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.540
And then this guy,
another guy who's

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.190
really important for the
history of craft beer,

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:51.380
came to Seattle, a brewing
chemist named Joe Owades.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.290
Dr. Joe Owades.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.990
And Joe had been the technical
director at the Rheingold

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.990
Brewery in Brooklyn, and
he developed light beer.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.230
He developed the first ever
low calorie beer in the '60s.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.020
Unfortunately, the
marketing department

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.320
decided to call it Gablinger's,
and it totally flopped.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.830
No one really understood
what it was all about.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.110
And it really wasn't
until Miller Lite years

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:25.840
later popularized light
beer with those less filling

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.300
more flavor commercials,
which actually many

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.200
of your generation
may not remember.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.630
Anyway, it was a while
before light beer took off.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:41.520
And Joe actually advised
many other craft brewers,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.230
but when he came to Seattle--
Joe's a very blunt guy.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:52.130
German, and very
sure of himself.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.610
So Joe tasted the Redhook
ale, and he turned to Shipman

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:01.380
and said, is this made for
some sort of ethnic group

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.590
here in Seattle.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.530
And Shipman said, no, Joe.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.350
It's our Belgian style ale.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:14.480
And Owades looked at him
and said, no, it's not.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.950
It's infected.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.910
He said, this beer
has a bacteria in it.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.110
So Joe gave them a
number of a yeast

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:28.680
to buy from the Siebel Institute
in Chicago, which Shipman did.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.590
And then they produced a new
beer called Ballard Bitter,

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:38.960
and Redhook was on
their way to success.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.800
I love that story
because I think it really

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:47.500
illustrates how clueless
the small brewers were back

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.030
in the day.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:55.040
Joe Owades went on to create
a beer in New York City

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.320
called New Amsterdam Amber
for one of the pioneers name

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.710
Matthew Reich, who was
the first contract brewer.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.590
Matthew brewed his beer
in upstate New York

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.650
and sold it in New York City.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.200
Unfortunately, he couldn't wait
to open a brewery in New York

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.910
City, and he did that on
11th Avenue and 26th Street.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.540
And if you know anything
about New York City,

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.750
particularly back
in the mid '80s,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.850
that neighborhood was
better known for hookers

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.940
than for a brewery with
a 300 seat restaurant.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.820
And he was out of
business within a year

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.560
after building that brewery.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.870
But I learned a
lot from watching

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.270
what happened to
Matthew building

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.650
the brewery prematurely
in a bad spot.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.240
And so did Jim Cook
from Sam Adams.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.920
Jim went to school
on Matthew, as did I.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.580
And actually Jim
ended up hiring Owades

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.060
to develop the recipe for
Sam Adams Boston Lager.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:04.280
And he also ended up
hiring Matthew's brewmaster

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.770
and assistant brewmaster,
and the brewmaster

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.780
is still with Sam
Adams to this day.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.470
And the point I'm making
is that Jim and Brooklyn

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.630
Brewery and a lot
of other breweries

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.380
started up after the
period of the pioneers,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.420
and we learned
from the pioneers.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.270
That was critical
to our developing

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.190
our businesses and the
beers we were selling

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.090
and how we priced those beers.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:38.620
We learned so much, the
same way the later pioneers

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.111
learned from Fritz
and New Albion.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.850
Things developed pretty
quickly in the '80s.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:54.680
There were about 1,000
breweries by 1994.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.690
I call my generation of brewers
the first generation as opposed

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.010
to the pioneers.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.450
A lot of people look
at the '90s and believe

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.850
there was a period where
craft beer kind of crashed,

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.920
because there were a couple
of spectacular failures.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.820
Pete's Wicked Ale, which
actually started right here

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:19.860
in Palo Alto, went up
quickly to 400,000 barrels

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.270
and down almost as
quickly when they

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:28.300
sold to Gambrinas Company,
the importer of Corona beer.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.320
And Catamount, in Vermont, one
of the pioneering breweries,

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.590
built a second brewery
but then stopped growing.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.600
So one thing you
learn in manufacturing

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.520
is if you build a brewery,
you must pay for that brewery.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.900
And if you don't produce
beer in that brewery,

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.630
you're probably not going to
be able to pay for the brewery.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.910
And I've seen that
happen numerous times

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.726
to different people.

00:16:52.726 --> 00:16:54.600
But in writing the book,
one thing I realized

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.050
is that, far from a
slump in the '90s,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.750
there were actually about
500 breweries started up

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:06.660
between '94 and 2000, including
some incredibly innovative

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.730
breweries, like Dogfish
in Delaware, Allagash,

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:15.650
up in Maine, Russian
River, here in California,

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.740
New Belgium in Colorado.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.050
And the difference
between those breweries

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.940
and Brooklyn and
the first generation

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.440
was that they were making
Belgian style beers.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.930
First generation, we
were kind of stuck

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.880
on the idea of the
German purity law,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.400
making beer according
to the Reinheitsgebot,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.140
using only the four basic
ingredients of beer.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.510
But these breweries that
started up in the '90s

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.120
made all different
kinds of styles

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:52.280
based on the Belgian styles,
and Sam Calagione, in Delaware,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.280
will put chocolate
mole in his beer.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.870
So far from being a
slump, it was actually

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:05.590
a whole new-- a whole new
push toward innovation

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:10.060
in the craft beer movement.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.750
The last 10 years have
been an incredible growth

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.910
period for craft beer.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.570
It's been double digits
for the last five years.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.120
And when I started
Brooklyn Brewery,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.730
people thought I was crazy.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:32.730
And people tasted Brooklyn
Lager and said, my god,

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.940
it's so dark and bitter.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.840
Why don't you make
something like Heineken?

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.010
And I said, well, Heineken
makes pretty good Heineken,

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.360
and I'm doing
something different.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:50.170
But really today, everyone
knows what a craft beer is.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.210
Back then, people didn't.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:55.500
And those of us in
the first generation

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.370
and second generation
really had to educate

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:04.060
people in our communities and
wherever we were selling beer.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.100
I think there are a couple
of important reasons

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:11.160
for the big growth
in the last decade.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.950
One might surprise you.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.140
It's the big
distributors in America

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:21.160
have suddenly embraced
craft beer in a big way.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.010
And part of the reason why
they embraced craft beer

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:28.300
is because they realized
finally it's not a fad.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.850
It's not going away.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:34.470
Craft beer is now
10% of the US market.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.380
Actually, when I
started, people said,

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.360
how are you going to compete
with the giant breweries?

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.630
And I said, well, I'm not
going to compete with them.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.560
I'm competing with the imports.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.360
We're making
import-quality beer,

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.370
and we're going to be competing
with the German, Belgium,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.310
and English imports.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:59.330
At that time-- 1988-- imports
were 3% of the US market.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.760
The other 97% was
national brands.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.470
And today, 26 years
later, imports

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.700
are 13% percent
of the US market.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.600
Craft beer is 10%, and the
two big national brewers--

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:22.320
AB InBev and MillerCoors--
have been pushed back to 74%.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.200
So actually what's
happened is better beer--

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.150
meaning imported
beer and craft beer--

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.900
have pushed into
the market share

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.670
that the big national
breweries used to have.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:39.610
And one reason why is because
these distributors opened up

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:40.820
to craft beer.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.140
Until about 10 years ago, the
Anheuser-Busch distributors

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.040
in America were
almost exclusively

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.710
selling Anheuser-Busch products.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.410
August Bush III
had a policy called

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:57.410
100% share of mine, in which
he gave financial incentives

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:03.250
to distributors to only sell
Anheuser-Busch products.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:10.050
And about 10 years ago, the
Anheuser-Busch distributors

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.780
saw what was happening
with craft beer

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.790
and saw the slow down in
the big national brands

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.930
and opened their doors
to craft brewers.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.180
That chapter in the book
is called Jailbreak,

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.300
and it's about the AB
distributors saying, OK,

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.220
you can keep your
financial incentives.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.400
We've got to get
into this category

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.530
because we're getting
killed by the MillerCoors

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.340
distributors that are
handling craft beer.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.970
And that was a huge change.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.360
Before that, when a
craft brewery would

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.710
go to a distributor,
a distributor

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.860
would say, OK, we'll
take this Brooklyn stuff,

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.510
but you have to sell it.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.470
We'll deliver it.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.860
You have to sell it.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.830
So we would go in, basically,
to a distributor on our knees

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:59.590
doing a presentation, begging
them to take our beer.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.740
Today, when we go
into a new state,

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.510
we've got the AB distributor,
the MillerCoors distributor,

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.470
probably a craft beer
distributor, and a wine

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.970
distributor begging
us to come with them,

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:18.010
because the large brewers
have lost an astounding

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.880
volume of beer, just
in the last five years.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.750
They've dropped 18
million barrels of beer.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.770
The whole craft segment is
about 16 million barrels,

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.810
so things are really
changing rapidly now.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.720
And I think one reason
why they are changing

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.570
is because we've been
at this for 50 years,

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:45.300
if you go back to the
beginning with Fritz.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.940
Another big factor
is social media.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.350
The internet happened
at the perfect moment

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:57.040
for craft brewers, and a bad
moment for the big brewers.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.750
Their domination
was really based

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:06.550
on controlling the media
through the three big networks.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.540
They could talk to
everyone in America

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.830
with their beer
commercials and jingles.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.690
All that's gone now.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.790
The media-- I don't have to
tell you guys-- has splintered.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.200
And you can start a
little brewery now

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.440
in the middle of
nowhere and reach

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.360
every one you want to reach
within a matter of days

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.880
for free.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.760
And that's like a sea change
in the way beer gets marketed.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.610
And even if you're a brewer
who doesn't know anything

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:43.050
about social media, the
beer enthusiasts who

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:48.510
write about beer and blog
about beer, they will find you,

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.880
and they will tell
the world about you.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.730
That's another huge reason
for this big change.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.970
Another change is our
association, the Brewers

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.420
Association.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.550
From like the 1980s, I've been
going to the Great American

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.870
Beer Festival and the
Craft Brewers Conference.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.630
Back in the '80s,
we were thrilled

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.350
if there were like 300 people
at the Craft Brewers Conference.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.610
This year, the
conference in Denver,

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.580
there were between
9,000 and 10,000 people

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.940
at the conference.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.940
I had to work to
find my friends.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.150
And through that association
and those gatherings

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.990
every year, I've learned
so much from my colleagues

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.920
around the country.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.450
I have friends all
over the country now

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:40.060
who-- I've grown up with
them in this business.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.580
We've learned from each other,
and we've exchanged ideas.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.950
And there's a
wonderful community

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:53.710
of craft brewers, which is
just an incredible advantage

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.340
for our segment.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.410
And our brewer's association--
actually the budget now

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:03.120
is $20 million a year,
and we're regulated

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.690
by the federal government and
all the state governments.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:11.170
So you've got to have a
strong seat at the table

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.620
to ensure that the
laws that are passed

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.630
are favorable to our segment.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:22.290
The last chapters of the book
are about the next generation

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.420
of brewers-- I call them
the third generation.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.990
And it's amazing to me-- there
are so many different business

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.800
models developing.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.160
People starting
little breweries,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.920
that their only
ambition is to be

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.150
the brewer in their community.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.960
And if the laws are right, and
you can have a little tap room,

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.500
you can make a pretty
good living with something

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.050
like that.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.580
I profile the Kodiak
Island Brewing Company

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.590
in Kodak Island, Alaska, which
is out toward the Aleutians.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.610
I think there are more bears
on Kodiak Island than there

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:01.160
are people.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.870
There are like 14,000
people I think.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:07.370
But Ben Millstein and his
wife run this brewery,

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.220
and they have a tap room.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:15.200
And it has become like the
social center of Kodiak Island,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.310
and then they
couldn't be happier

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.160
with what they're doing.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.430
There are also
gypsy brewers today,

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.110
which is people who are
passionate about beer,

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.140
have recipes for
beer, which they

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.430
get produced by
contract brewers.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.560
There's a lot of that going
on around the country.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.790
Craft brewers are
incredibly innovative.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:40.830
There's a brewery in Texas--
you can't have a brewery

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:44.260
restaurant, so there
are some guys in Houston

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.700
who started a brewery called
The Eighth Wonder Brewery.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.000
And then they
started a food truck,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.770
and they park the food truck
in front of the brewery.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:58.930
And people buy food and walk
into the brewery and buy beer.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.740
There are also a couple of
contract breweries-- one

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.870
in Connecticut and
one in Florida--

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.490
producing beer for a lot
of the gypsy brewers.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.360
The one in Florida
was started by guys

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.550
who were let go by
Anheuser-Busch when they got

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.860
bought by InBev a few years ago.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:23.350
So it's pretty incredible
what's happening.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:27.040
There are now 2,800
breweries across America.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.230
There another 2,000
on the drawing boards,

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.630
and I think there are
going to be winners

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.830
in all different categories,
different business

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.030
models, different
styles of beer,

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:46.740
different focus for the
beers that are being made.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:54.690
It's incredibly exciting, and
it's becoming a huge business.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.600
And I'm very proud to
have been part of that.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.240
Did I-- at the
beginning, did I tell you

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.960
that I used to be a
journalist and all that?

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.420
I thought I forgot that.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:11.540
So I started Brooklyn
Brewery in 1987,

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.940
really-- we didn't
sell beer till '88--

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.520
but I used to be a journalist.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.120
I started out of college.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.390
I had a degree in English.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.450
I tried teaching.

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.200
I almost had a
nervous breakdown.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.880
That's the hardest thing
I ever did in my life.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.970
And so I went to work for the
local newspaper in upstate New

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.530
York, and then I worked
for small newspapers

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.080
around New York City.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.560
I got my big chance, a job
with the Associated Press

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.930
in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.850
And for reasons I usually go
into after I've had about four

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.190
beers, I got in my head
I wanted to cover a war.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.720
And if you work for
AP, you can do that.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.210
So I started studying Arabic
and said I want to go to Beirut.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.540
And I learned there
aren't too many people who

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.930
want to go to Beirut
and cover wars,

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.840
so like a year after
I raised my hand,

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.930
I landed in Beirut as the Middle
East correspondent for AP.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.070
That was February, 1979.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.420
Within a few months,
I was in Iran

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.020
covering the revolution
and the hostage crisis.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:18.080
For you youngsters here,
that's the movie "Argo."

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.640
And then I got kicked out
of Iran by the government.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.490
I went back in
with the Iraqi army

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.560
when they invaded Iran in 1980.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.430
I covered that war
from the Iraqi side.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:34.550
I lived in Beirut, which was
crazy with the civil war going

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.640
on.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.860
Actually I was abducted
with the UN patrol

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.810
in South Lebanon in 1980.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.360
Very nasty incident.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.550
Two of the guys with me--
Irish UN peacekeepers--

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:50.090
were tortured and killed, and
one guy was shot five times.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.060
I carried him out, and he lived.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.570
Actually, I bet you
all know Vice Media.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:59.320
Yeah, of course, right?

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.340
Course you do.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.150
People over 30 don't know
anything about Vice Media.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.680
Vice Media is actually based
right across the street

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.640
from the brewery in
Brooklyn, and I just

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.320
recently wrote a story
for them in January,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:20.510
because about a year ago
Homeland Security contacted me.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:24.700
And they said the guy
who abducted me in 1980

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.750
is living in Detroit
running an ice cream truck.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:31.010
He's the Good Humor man.

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:32.330
So I said, you're kidding.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.430
And they said he's applied
for US citizenship,

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.580
and they want me to
testify against him.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.350
And I said absolutely.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.100
And it's a long story.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:44.980
Take a look at it.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.930
It's on Vice.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.680
Click the magazine
and put my name in,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.080
and you'll find the story.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.735
But I haven't had
to testify yet,

00:30:52.735 --> 00:30:54.360
so I don't know what's
going to happen.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:59.520
You'll see it's a
complicated story.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.590
Actually, Rupert Murdoch
invested $70 million

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.830
in Vice for 5%.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.380
It's really remarkable.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.160
And the guys at Vice
told me that Google

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.750
is about to do the
same thing, but I

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.320
don't know if anyone
knows anything about that.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.080
Google is buying
everything I think.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.510
So that was my background.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.260
I covered the Israeli
invasion, the massacres

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.440
in the refugee camps.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.450
I moved to Cairo.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:32.620
I was sitting behind
President Sadat

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.500
when he was killed
at the parade.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.980
So this was all great training
for starting a brewery

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.830
in Brooklyn and for
eventually writing

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.990
a couple books, one
about Brooklyn Brewery

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:46.880
and one about the
craft beer revolution.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.950
So thank you very much
for your attention.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.800
I'm surprised there
aren't more women here.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.000
I always say that at
events at the brewery,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.420
we get half women and half men.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.070
Maybe it's Monday, and
the beer, I don't know.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.990
But it's good to see the women.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.140
And thank you all
for coming out,

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.840
and I'm happy to
answer some questions.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.460
CALEB: So if you
guys have questions,

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.030
I'm going to ask
you to use the mic.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.340
AUDIENCE: What's your take
on craft brewers selling out

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.434
to larger distributors,
for instance, Goose Island.

00:32:26.434 --> 00:32:28.100
STEVE HINDY: Selling
out to big brewers.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.830
Yeah.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.670
I think it's kind of inevitable.

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:35.230
I mean, Goose Island--
actually, just last week I

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.560
did an event in Chicago with
John Hall, the founder of Goose

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.350
Island.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:43.000
John is-- he was 70 years
old when he sold out.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.800
His son wasn't interested
in staying in the company.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.030
So what are you going to do?

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.020
John's my friend.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.420
I accept it, but
Goose Island is now

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.470
totally controlled
by Anheuser-Busch.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:07.000
And that makes them the
enemy, to put it bluntly.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.180
CALEB: I have a
question for you, Steve.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.320
You said there were about 2,800
breweries in operation now

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.860
and about 2,000 on
the drawing board.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.820
Does that seem like
we're going to fill up,

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.630
like this is almost
too many breweries.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.700
It's hard to imagine
almost 2/3 more than now

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.260
and still having
space for everyone.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.510
STEVE HINDY: Yeah,
good question.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.038
I don't think so.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.700
The way the segment
is growing, I

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:40.520
think we're behind in
keeping up with the demand.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:46.010
And before prohibition,
there were 2,000 breweries

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:51.220
in America, and the population
was about 40 or 50 million.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.920
Today there are 325
million people in America.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.945
I think we can handle
5,000 breweries.

00:33:58.945 --> 00:34:02.010
So I don't think
that's a problem.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:07.210
The problem is
going to be-- we've

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.469
been-- you know
this word, but we've

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:13.260
been very disruptive to
the American beer industry.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.250
We butted heads
with the big guys.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.659
We butted heads with
the distributors.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:22.790
There are laws in place that
are very unfavorable to us.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.960
We're going to be butting
heads with the distributors

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.330
and the big guys
on a lot of issues.

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:30.870
And I'm excited about that.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:35.880
I think it's going to be great
fun, but it is disruptive.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.172
And there's going to be
more disruption I believe.

00:34:40.172 --> 00:34:41.630
AUDIENCE: I notice
that you started

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:45.550
to distribute Brooklyn
Brewery beer internationally.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.469
I was wondering if you have
a specific strategy for how

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:51.230
you want to start
exporting it, because I'm

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:54.199
sure that there's a lot of
different ways it can go.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:57.820
And also if you feel like
it's helpful to leverage

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.960
how popular Brooklyn even
has become as a brand,

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.260
because I feel like it has
international recognition

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.074
at this point too.

00:35:05.074 --> 00:35:06.490
STEVE HINDY: Yeah,
great question.

00:35:09.732 --> 00:35:12.940
We're in New York City,
so a lot of foreigners

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.990
come to New York City,
tourist and business people,

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:20.380
and we've had opportunities to
export from the very beginning.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.320
Actually, we started selling
beer in Japan in our first--

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.720
in 1988, our first
year in business.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.970
And we didn't have a strategy.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:37.260
But our rule was, if
you want us to ship you

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:44.050
beer in Tokyo or London or
Australia, you pay us first,

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.720
and then we'll ship the beer.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.750
It was pretty simple.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:56.040
And over the years, we've
gotten better and better quality

00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.240
importers to bring our beer
into different markets.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.340
Our partner right
now in Scandinavia

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:07.320
is Carlsberg, the number
four brewer in the world.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.440
And actually we just opened
a brewery in Stockholm

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.870
called the New Carnegie
Brewery with Carlsberg.

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:17.330
And please go to
visit if you're there.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:18.920
It's really cool.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.250
And we operate the brewery.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.970
We have a subsidiary
called Brooklyn Sweden.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.050
We hired the brewers.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:25.060
We hired the chef.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.670
And it's right on the water.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.260
There's a free ferry
that goes to it.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:36.230
And we're going to be announcing
a project like that in Asia

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.140
in the next week or 10 days.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.490
And I think we're going to
have a lot of opportunities

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:43.450
to export.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:46.470
About 30% of our
production, which

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:51.860
was 220,000 barrels last
year-- about 30% is export.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.090
And I think in the
next decade, exports

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:58.690
are going to be at
least 50% of our sales.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:03.630
We sell in 26
states, and because

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.540
of this export business,
which is good solid business--

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.720
we don't discount to export.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.410
We make good margin on that.

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:15.440
For that reason, we're
growing at like 25%,

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.000
and we see no hurry to try
to come to the West Coast

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.770
because of the good fortune
we're having heading east.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.110
And anyway all the
west coast brewers

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.840
are already in the East
Coast, as you may know

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.840
and now building breweries
in the East Coast.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.020
Yes, the name Brooklyn
has been amazing for us.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:40.370
And it's funny, because when
I started a lot of people

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:42.780
questioned naming
the beer Brooklyn.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:49.250
They said, geesh, the image is
not so great, including people

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:53.500
who-- like lifelong
Brooklyners questioned it.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.520
I said, no, I think
Brooklyn is a great name.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.660
So many immigrants
go through here,

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.870
and people have connections--
weird connections to Brooklyn.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:08.000
Now there are like 100
companies in Brooklyn

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.030
that have consumer products
with the name Brooklyn.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.310
Actually, I got to give a
lot of credit for that name

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.300
to my designer Milton Glaser.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.450
He's the guy who did the
I Love New York logo.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.360
Actually, they
call him the father

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.290
of American graphic design.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.150
Milton's an amazing guy.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:28.270
In the beginning, I wanted to
call the beer Brooklyn Eagle

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.350
Beer, after the old
Brooklyn Eagle newspaper,

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:34.920
edited by Walt Whitman, because
I used to be a newspaper man.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.240
And in my first
meeting with Milton,

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.830
I told him what I
wanted to call it,

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.370
and I told him I want
the Brooklyn Bridge,

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:44.720
and I want the Dodgers,
and I want all this stuff.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.160
And he said, well look,
we got Brooklyn here.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.930
Forget the eagle.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:51.750
Who needs an eagle
when you got Brooklyn?

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.160
Call it Brooklyn Beer.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.320
It fits.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.940
Brooklyn fits with beer.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:03.950
And he came up with our iconic
B logo, which-- it's brilliant.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:06.380
I have to admit, the first
time I saw it, I looked at it

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.840
and said, is that it?

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.730
And Milton said, look,
don't say a word.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.040
Take it home, put on
your kitchen table,

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.550
show it to your wife.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.790
Don't show it to a lot of
people-- just live with it.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:22.120
And I did that,
and it sunk in this

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:27.840
is a beautiful, simple image
and a great image for a brewery.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.960
So we love Brooklyn.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.210
And the Nets won yesterday.

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:36.070
Yes.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:40.010
AUDIENCE: So this is sort of the
flip side of that same question

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.980
about drinking locally.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.670
I mean, we've seen the rise
of the local food movement

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.560
over this same
period, and I guess

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.800
the question is, does local
beer go with local food?

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.220
I haven't seen that always
connected necessarily,

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:58.000
but is that part of
the movement or not?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.089
STEVE HINDY: It definitely
is part of what's going on.

00:40:01.089 --> 00:40:02.630
I think it's part
of what's happening

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:06.520
in a lot of food categories.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:14.550
But with beer, people want
to try different things.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:21.260
And so we sell most of
our beer in New York City.

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.440
Actually, our second
biggest market

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.240
is Sweden, if you
can believe that.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.410
It's a little bigger
than New Jersey for us.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:34.370
And I feel that we
have some unique beers.

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:38.920
Actually the two you're tasting
today-- Brooklyn Sorachi Ace is

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.160
made with a hop that was
developed in northern Japan,

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.170
now grown in Washington state.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.920
Anything but local,
but it's a beer

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.180
that is very special for us.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.080
Actually, we're coming out
with a low alcohol version

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.370
of that called Brooklyn
1/2 Ale later this year.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:58.850
So, yeah, part of
it is about local,

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:02.420
but it's also about
exploring different beers

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.130
from different places.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.270
And so I think there's
a place for both.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:12.580
Actually, it's very difficult
to do a strictly local beer.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:16.010
We have one beer called
Brooklyn Green Market Wheat

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:21.660
Beer, that we do with the
not-for-profit that runs the 53

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.370
farmers markets
in New York City.

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:30.580
And that beer is made
with 100% grain grown

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:33.080
within like 200 miles
of New York City.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.480
70% in New York state
and the other 30%

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.750
I think in Massachusetts.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:44.320
But it's very limited because
the production of grain

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.250
is very limited.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:50.360
So if you look at people
who are touting local,

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.330
often you'll find
their ingredients

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:55.250
are coming from
all over the world.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.300
So it'll be awhile
before I think

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.510
strictly local
beers are available.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.090
And we will be making one
when they are available.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:05.192
I can assure you.

00:42:05.192 --> 00:42:07.400
AUDIENCE: When the tables
turned on your conversation

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.750
with the bigger
distributors, and they're

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.583
knocking at your door
instead of vice versa,

00:42:10.583 --> 00:42:13.160
did that change your strategy
on how you ran the brewery,

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.800
how you brewed different beers?

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.130
Did you take bigger chances,
knowing that you have this

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:21.900
in into these other
distribution paths and channels?

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.850
STEVE HINDY: Did it
change our strategy?

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:29.530
Well, it certainly
increased our sales

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.440
when the big
wholesalers opened up.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.000
We were a little more confident.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.140
We just did like a $12
million expansion in Brooklyn,

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:45.460
and knowing that we had first
rate wholesalers handling

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:51.230
our beer made that a much
more comfortable decision.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:55.420
Our best selling beer is still
our first beer, Brooklyn Lager.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:59.230
It's about 50-- over
50% of our sales.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:03.020
The other 50% is a whole
range of different beers,

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.430
the special kind of
beers you have here,

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:10.040
regular seasonal beers like
Oktoberfest Pumpkin Ale, Summer

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.490
Ale, and that kind of thing.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:17.050
But part of the challenge
in managing distributors

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:23.540
now is teaching them to handle
a very complex portfolio.

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.380
Practically every
craft brewery now

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:29.570
has a very complex
portfolio of brands,

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:34.840
and the game is learning
how to present those

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.200
to the distributor
and get into the minds

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.886
of their sales people.

00:43:41.886 --> 00:43:43.636
AUDIENCE: Do you want
to tell us something

00:43:43.636 --> 00:43:45.510
about the beers that
we're [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:46.260
STEVE HINDY: Yeah.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:51.540
The Sorachi Ace is a
saison-style, a Belgian style.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.410
Our brewmaster,
Garrett Oliver, who's

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.330
written a couple a
great books, one called

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:59.200
"The Brewmaster's Table,"
and Garrett is also

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.420
the Editor-In-Chief of the
"Oxford Companion to Beer,"

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.540
which is the first ever
encyclopedia of beer,

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.940
published by Oxford
University Press.

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:11.690
When Garrett first tried
the Sorachi Ace hop,

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.450
he immediately in
his head said, I

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:18.060
got to make a saison
using this hop.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.950
And we first made it as
a brewmasters reserve,

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:25.820
which is a-- every quarter we
come up with a new draft beer.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.460
And then customers
subscribe to that program.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:33.650
So Sorachi Ace was a draft
beer like three years ago,

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:35.690
and it was incredibly popular.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:38.710
So we came out with this
bottle-conditioned version

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:40.750
of it in the 750.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:44.280
And later this
year, we'll come out

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.010
with a 12 ounce version
of that in a four pack.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.930
The other beer is
part of a series

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:55.340
we do quarterly called the
Brooklyn Quarterly Experiment,

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.580
and those are barrel-aged beers.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:02.620
So that other beer, I believe,
is a version of our Local 2,

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.660
which is like a Belgian double.

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.890
And it's got some
orange peel in it,

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:12.620
and it's been aged
in bourbon barrels

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.447
with a brettanomyces
yeast, which

00:45:14.447 --> 00:45:17.610
is a wild yeast that gives
you kind of funky flavors.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:21.710
But it's not over the top
with the funky flavors.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:22.720
It's pretty subtle.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.250
Actually, that beer is
fantastic with a lot of foods.

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:30.140
And so is Sorachi
for that matter.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.550
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could go over

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.880
the style of IPAs.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.660
They kind of epitomize
what craft beer

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.480
is to a lot of people.

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.515
And then Brooklyn Brewery's
relationship with hops.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:51.270
STEVE HINDY: Well, yeah,
IPA is the bestselling style

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:56.340
of craft beer now, and
the west coast brewers

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.010
are crazy about hops.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:03.450
I think west coast people, a lot
of them are crazy about hops.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.380
East coast, I mean,
Brooklyn Brewery,

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.590
we're a little
more about balance.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.900
We're not particularly looking
to blow your brains out

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.730
with the hops.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:17.980
I think Vinnie Cilurzo
at Russian River

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:21.650
was the first guy
to do a double IPA.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:23.920
I think a lot of people
credited him with that.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:30.860
And that's part of the beauty
of the craft beer revolution,

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:34.260
is the different kind of
regional styles of beers.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.440
We do have an IPA called
Brooklyn East India Pale

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:43.560
Ale, which Garrett, our
brewmaster, developed in 1994.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.660
And it's actually
extremely balanced.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.960
It doesn't come anywhere
near to competing in the blow

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.010
your brains out hop category.

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:57.780
We have a beer called Brooklyn
Blast, which is a double IPA,

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:02.900
and also is pretty balanced
compared to West Coast.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.340
But, you know,
vive la difference.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.090
AUDIENCE: I recently
became aware

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:12.270
of Dogfish Head's Ancient
Ale Wine doing crazy things

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.340
like resurrecting Nordic grog.

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.330
Are there other
examples of brewers

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:19.234
doing crazy unique
things like this?

00:47:19.234 --> 00:47:21.525
STEVE HINDY: Yeah, I think
there are a lot of examples.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:28.690
I did this reddit "ask me
anything" thing the other day.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:33.000
I responded to 146
people in two hours.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.800
And my favorite call-- or
email-- was from Brazil.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.240
And they asked me if I had
tried the new ant beer.

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:46.330
I said, you mean
it has ants in it?

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.340
And he said, yeah.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.480
And I said, no, I haven't.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.920
But I got to tell you,
it gives me the creeps.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.510
We've talked about--
I'd like to do--

00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:00.620
the world's foremost
Egyptologist, Dr. Kent Weeks,

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.140
is a friend of mine.

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.710
I got to know him when I
lived in Egypt years ago,

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.140
and I've always wanted to do
a beer based on the recipes

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:13.920
that they've found in
tombs in Egypt with Kent.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:19.030
But so far we haven't
been able to do that.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:21.350
There's also an interesting
beer that Rogue has,

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:24.700
which this also
gives me the creeps.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:28.220
The yeast in that
beer is cultured

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:33.481
from the brewmaster
John Mayer's beard.

00:48:33.481 --> 00:48:34.730
Doesn't that sound appetizing?

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:41.559
I doubt that's going to
set the world on fire.

00:48:41.559 --> 00:48:44.100
AUDIENCE: I had a question about
the distributor relationship

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.610
that you were
describing earlier.

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:50.272
As you said, the AB and
other guys' distributors

00:48:50.272 --> 00:48:51.730
are now willing to
take your stuff,

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.390
and when you go into a
new state with reputation

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.120
like Brooklyn has,
it makes sense

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:59.140
that they're asking
you to come to them.

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.735
What have you seen-- how
has that relationship gone

00:49:01.735 --> 00:49:03.110
for smaller
breweries that you've

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.650
seen starting up more recently?

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:07.320
Is there an in with
the distributors?

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.770
Does the three-tier system end
up hurting smaller breweries?

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.575
What do you see in that?

00:49:13.575 --> 00:49:17.190
STEVE HINDY: The
three-tier system--

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:21.820
a feature of the three-tier
system is the franchise law.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.480
The franchise law
has been in the news

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.680
lately because of
Elon Musk trying

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:30.530
to sell his Teslas
direct to consumers,

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:33.900
and some states saying no, you
can't do that in our state.

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.640
You have to go through a dealer.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.180
So that's what a
franchise law is.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:42.630
In the beer business,
the distributor

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:45.290
essentially owns your
brand, in most states.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:47.530
When you give it
to a distributor,

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:48.920
it's a captive brand.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:56.790
You can't get it back, unless
you can prove bad faith dealing

00:49:56.790 --> 00:50:00.100
on their part, which is
very difficult to prove.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.610
I understand why
that law is in place.

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:06.540
It really keeps the distributors
independent of the big brewers

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.850
coming in and essentially
strong arming them

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:15.510
into selling only the
big distributors' beers.

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:20.060
But it's very unfair, I
believe, for small brewers,

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.490
because if you get
with a distributor--

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:25.240
say you sign on with
a distributor who's

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.480
a startup craft beer
distributor, or a wine

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.510
distributor.

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:32.120
And you grow to a certain
level, and they can't really

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.150
take you beyond that.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:35.630
But you know you
could go beyond that.

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.680
So it makes it very difficult
to go to a bigger distributor,

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.730
to change distributors.

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:44.170
In New York, we got a
law passed that says

00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:47.590
if you're under 3% of the
distributor's business,

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:50.850
and you're under 300,000
barrels in production,

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:52.840
you can move to a
different distributor.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:56.510
You have to pay-- you have
to compensate the distributor

00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:59.270
before you leave, but
most new distributors

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.320
will pay for that kind of deal.

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.187
So that's called a carve
out of these franchise laws,

00:51:04.187 --> 00:51:06.020
and I'm hoping we're
going to be able to get

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.630
that in other states.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:11.470
I think it makes the
system much more fair.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:13.580
I'm not against franchise laws.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.770
I just think for the
smallest brewers,

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.864
you can end up in jail.

00:51:17.864 --> 00:51:18.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:24.730
STEVE HINDY: The distributor
takes you on and sits on you

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:28.830
so his competitor can't get
you, and that's not fair.

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:31.500
AUDIENCE: So do you feel that
the macro-brewers are getting

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.390
any more successful at
breaking into the craft beer

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.960
market with the crafty beers.

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:40.440
STEVE HINDY: There's an
index in the back of my book

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.680
in which I tried to do a
chronology of big brewer

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.330
efforts to play in our category.

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:48.070
And I think it's really
only in the last five years

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:52.810
that they've come to believe
that this thing is real.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:55.170
It's not going away.

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:59.490
But they've been fiddling around
with it since the mid-'80s.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:03.450
I think it's a compliment
to us that they're

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.170
playing in our segment.

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:07.110
MillerCoors has Blue Moon.

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:09.800
AB has Shock Top
and Goose Island.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.720
They just bought
Blue Point Brewery,

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:17.500
which is on Long Island,
New York, near Brooklyn.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:20.190
So they're playing
in the category.

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:21.200
It's a compliment.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.660
It's a challenge to us.

00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.530
I think it's a real
dilemma for them,

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:29.730
because the more they introduce
people to flavorful beer--

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:35.010
if a person is drinking
a Blue Moon tonight,

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:37.830
craft beer drinkers
are very-- actually I

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.090
don't like this word.

00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:41.380
The big guys call
them promiscuous.

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.360
They're not brand-loyal.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.660
They want to try new things.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:48.470
And I think if they're
drinking a Shock Top or a Blue

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:50.510
Moon or a Goose
Island, they are more

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:54.500
likely to drink a Brooklyn
Lager or one of our beers.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.540
So I think it's a very
tricky game for the big guys,

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.830
because the more
they promote flavor,

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:02.310
the more they undercut
their big brands, which

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.490
are not about flavor.

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:07.410
They were about power marketing.

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:10.880
And that game has
all changed now

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.040
with the splintering
of the media

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.910
and the internet, et cetera.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:18.220
So we'll see what happens.

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:21.700
Craft beer is like 10%
by volume, about 15,

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.590
16% by dollars.

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:28.810
I think it's going to be 30%
maybe in the next 20 years.

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:31.080
And when I say
craft beer, I'm only

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.390
saying based on the Brewer's
Association definition.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:42.610
If you add in the crafty beers,
it gets up above, close to 20%

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:43.440
already.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.790
Thank you all very much.

00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:46.340
