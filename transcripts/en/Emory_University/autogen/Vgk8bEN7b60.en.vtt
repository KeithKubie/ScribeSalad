University when States acquire nuclear

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.170
University when States acquire nuclear
 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.980
University when States acquire nuclear
weapons they are fairly successful and

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:07.990
weapons they are fairly successful and
 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.659
weapons they are fairly successful and
their international crises in terms of

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:09.669
their international crises in terms of
 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.339
their international crises in terms of
deterring their opponents their

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:11.349
deterring their opponents their
 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.839
deterring their opponents their
opponents tend to be much more

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
opponents tend to be much more
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.060
opponents tend to be much more
restrained in dealing with these nuclear

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070
restrained in dealing with these nuclear
 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.210

actors the implications from this hour

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220
actors the implications from this hour
 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.640
actors the implications from this hour
yes nuclear weapons can be a source of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650
yes nuclear weapons can be a source of
 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.910
yes nuclear weapons can be a source of
stability but by no means would it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920
stability but by no means would it
 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.440
stability but by no means would it
logically follow that we should actually

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450
logically follow that we should actually
 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.359
logically follow that we should actually
give nuclear weapons too many more

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369
give nuclear weapons too many more
 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.970
give nuclear weapons too many more
countries or even a select few countries

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980
countries or even a select few countries
 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.729
countries or even a select few countries
those states are at much greater risk to

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739
those states are at much greater risk to
 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.509
those states are at much greater risk to
be involved in international conflict

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519
be involved in international conflict
 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.369
be involved in international conflict
both as aggressors as well as defenders

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379
both as aggressors as well as defenders
 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.889
both as aggressors as well as defenders
and so proliferation itself is quite

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899
and so proliferation itself is quite
 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.160
and so proliferation itself is quite
dangerous yes it might be a less

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
dangerous yes it might be a less
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.209
dangerous yes it might be a less
likelihood of being involved in a major

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219
likelihood of being involved in a major
 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.200
likelihood of being involved in a major
regional war because it has weapons its

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
regional war because it has weapons its
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.639
regional war because it has weapons its
potential enemies such as is really the

United States are going to be more

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179
United States are going to be more
 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:56.790
United States are going to be more
restrained against them once they have

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800
restrained against them once they have
 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.649
restrained against them once they have
nuclear weapons basically there's going

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659
nuclear weapons basically there's going
 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:00:59.849
nuclear weapons basically there's going
to be very little to international

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859
to be very little to international
 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.879

community could do to push Iran towards
