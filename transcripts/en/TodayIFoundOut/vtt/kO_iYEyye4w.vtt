00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.879
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out YouTube channel.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:10.120
In the video today, we’re looking at whether
fish ever get thirsty.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.120
For fish, or at least teleost fish (which
make up about 96% of all fish), the desire

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.610
to drink is an urge that originates from the
hindbrain, whereas in land-based animals it

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.920
originates in the forebrain.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.600
It is generally thought from this that a fish
has no real ability to consciously feel thirst

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.410
as we or many other land-animals would understand
it; for them, it's just a natural reflex.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.510
So the short answer to whether fish ever get
thirsty is thought to be "no", at least not

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.870
on a conscious level.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.739
However, fish do need to take in water, but,
as with land animals, too much water can kill,

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.790
a particular problem when one is surrounded
by it!

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.399
Unsurprisingly, the processes by which this
is regulated in fish is quite fascinating,

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.399
and further answers the question of why most
fish must stay in either a saltwater or freshwater

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.079
environment exclusively.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.420
To begin with, we'll start with how exactly
fish drink.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.040
Like any other animal, fish need to maintain
a strict balance of water and salt (among

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.640
other minerals) in their system to remain
alive and flipping along.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.319
As they’re constantly surrounded by water,
the main issue for fish isn’t concerning

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:16.069
getting enough water in their bodies, but
regulating concentration of certain minerals,

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.590
of particular importance being things like
salt and potassium.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.590
For freshwater fish, their blood has a higher
concentration of salt than their surroundings

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.539
(hypertonic), which is a major problem.

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.230
While their skin is mostly impermeable (though
not completely), as their gills are in constant

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.750
contact with the surrounding water, which
is essential for them to breathe, water is

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.819
continually taken into the fish' bloodstream
via osmosis, with osmotic pressure being the

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.179
key driver here.

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.390
For the uninitiated, osmosis is the movement
of a solvent (in this case water) across semi-permeable

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.249
membranes (like cell walls), from areas of
lower solute concentration to areas of higher

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:52.789
solute concentration.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.969
This naturally equalizes the solute concentration
on both sides of the membrane.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.709
(This osmotic pressure is also why salt can
be used to preserve meat.)

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.689
For example, if you take a red blood cell
and place it in distilled water, thanks to

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.560
osmotic pressure and the fact that the cell
membrane is thin and semipermeable, the cell

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.430
with its relatively salty interior next to
the pure water will gradually absorb more

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.780
and more water until it explodes.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.010
On the flipside, if you place that same red
blood cell in water that is saltier than the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.500
cell’s interior liquid, the reverse will
happen and the cell will gradually lose water,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.250
shriveling up in the process.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.250
Place it in water that has the same solute
level as the cell, and nothing at all will

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.250
happen.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.230
(Certain sea-life, known as osmoconformers,
such as most marine invertebrates, actually

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.590
are more or less always in this state- maintaining
the same solute concentration internally as

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.040
the seawater they live in).

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.310
Thus, to regulate the large amount of water
entering its bloodstream diluting the concentration

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.510
of dissolved minerals, such as the ever important
salt, freshwater fish must urinate incredibly

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.510
often.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.549
(This is one of the reasons it’s advised
to clean a goldfish bowl regularly or install

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.549
a filter.

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.579
And, note, contrary to popular practice, you
should never, ever leave a goldfish in a small,

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.520
simple fish bowl for a variety of reasons,
see our video on the matter for more information).

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.739
Towards this end, freshwater fish have large
kidneys with a relatively expansive network

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.360
of capillaries, called the glomerulus, facilitating
faster urine production.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.549
This helps, but the fresh water fish also
need to take in relatively significant amounts

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.489
of salt to further aid in keeping their levels
high enough.

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.739
They are able to do this thanks to special
chloride secretory cells in their gills which

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.510
will actively draw salt from the surrounding
water and release it into the bloodstream,

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.790
at the same time osmotic pressure is drawing
more and more water into their system, diluting

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.790
the blood.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.409
The problem for saltwater fish is more or
less the exact opposite as freshwater fish,

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.920
and it should come as no surprise then that
their drinking and urinating habits likewise

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.260
go the other way.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.439
The saltwater fish have less salt in their
blood than the surrounding water (hypotonic).

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.510
So rather than absorbing water as it passes
through their gills, saltwater fish lose a

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.810
lot of water from their blood as they breathe
via the same osmotic pressure as mentioned

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.239
with the freshwater fish.

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.870
As a result, they must drink considerable
amounts of water through their mouths.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.999
However, again, because the part of the brain
that controls this is in the hindbrain, it's

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:16.410
generally thought this regular swallowing
of water is a reflex action performed without

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.699
a conscious thirst sensation.

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.580
Saltwater fish also don't urinate much at
all, in order to conserve water.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.040
Towards this end, they have very few, small
capillary networks making up their glomerulus,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040
unlike freshwater fish.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.120
However, the water the saltwater fish are
drinking has an awful lot of salt in it- much

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.460
more than they need.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.200
To get around this, the chloride secretory
cells of saltwater fish, rather than absorbing

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.600
salt from the surrounding water as with freshwater
fish, actively release it from the fish’s

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.080
body into the environment.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.560
This all combines to more or less automatically
keep the saltwater fish's salt levels in the

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.930
optimal range.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.410
As for fish that can migrate back and forth
from fresh water to seawater, their bodies

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.750
are capable of regulating both ways, but they
typically require an acclimation period between

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.750
the two.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.500
For instance, salmon start their lives in
freshwater, and as they begin to transition

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.210
to saltwater they'll naturally start drinking
more and more water, while their urine production

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.979
begins to rapidly drop.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.340
At the same time, a special enzyme results
in a reversal of the previous function of

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.650
their chloride secretory cells in their gills-
instead of absorbing salt from the environment,

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.750
the "pump" reverses, excreting it.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.460
Once their bodies have fully transitioned
(generally after a few days hanging out in

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.670
the intertidal zone), they are free to safely
venture out into the big blue.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.360
The same thing happens again in reverse when
they return to fresh water to spawn, spending

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.629
a few days acclimating in between until the
system has naturally switched and they can

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:55.090
safely head up stream.
