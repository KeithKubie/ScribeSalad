00:00:07.013 --> 00:00:09.584
You're standing at 
the ready inside the goal

00:00:09.584 --> 00:00:14.234
when suddenly, you feel an intense itch
on the back of your head.

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:17.942
We've all experienced the annoyance 
of an inconvenient itch,

00:00:17.942 --> 00:00:22.802
but have you ever pondered why
we itch in the first place?

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:27.634
The average person experiences
dozens of individual itches each day.

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:29.815
They can be triggered by all sorts
of things,

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:31.515
including allergic reactions,

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:32.515
dryness,

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:34.705
and even some diseases.

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:39.333
And then there are the mysterious ones
that pop up for no reason at all,

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.966
or just from talking about itching.

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:45.513
You're scratching your head right now,
aren't you?

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:50.057
Anyhow, let's take one of the most
common sources: bug bites.

00:00:50.057 --> 00:00:51.434
When a mosquito bites you,

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:55.795
it releases a compound into your body
called an anticoagulant

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:58.527
that prevents your blood from clotting.

00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:01.256
That compound, 
which we're mildly allergic to,

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:03.876
triggers the release of histamine,

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:06.985
a chemical that makes 
our capillaries swell.

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:08.935
This enables increased blood flow,

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.956
which helpfully accelerates 
the body's immune response

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:14.197
to this perceived threat.

00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:15.847
That explains the swelling,

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:19.777
and it's the same reason pollen
can make your eyes puff up.

00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:23.544
Histamine also activates the nerves
involved in itching,

00:01:23.544 --> 00:01:27.847
which is why bug bites make you scratch.

00:01:27.847 --> 00:01:31.696
But the itchy sensation itself
isn't yet fully understood.

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:33.429
In fact, much of what we do know

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.157
comes from studying 
the mechanics of itching in mice.

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:41.057
Researchers have discovered that
itch signals in their skin

00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:47.035
are transmitted via a subclass of
the nerves that are associated with pain.

00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:52.678
These dedicated nerves produce a molecule
called natriuretic polypetide B,

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:56.897
which triggers a signal that's carried
up the spinal cord to the brain,

00:01:56.897 --> 00:02:00.761
where it creates the feeling of an itch.

00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:04.387
When we scratch, the action of our
fingernails on the skin

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:10.138
causes a low level pain signal
that overrides the itching sensation.

00:02:10.138 --> 00:02:15.431
It's almost like a distraction,
which creates the sensation of relief.

00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:19.698
But is there actually an evolutionary
purpose to the itch,

00:02:19.698 --> 00:02:23.177
or is it simply there to annoy us?

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:28.248
The leading theory is that our skin
has evolved to be acutely aware of touch

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:32.429
so that we're equipped to deal with risks
from the outside world.

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:33.348
Think about it.

00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:37.180
Our automatic scratching response
would dislodge anything harmful

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.091
that's potentially lurking on our skin,

00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:41.459
like a harmful sting,

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.782
a biting insect,

00:02:42.782 --> 00:02:45.831
or the tendrils of a poisonous plant.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:49.431
This might explain why we don't
feel itching inside our bodies,

00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:50.912
like in our intestines,

00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:53.451
which is safe from these external threats,

00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:57.386
though imagine how 
maddening that would be.

00:02:57.386 --> 00:03:01.119
In some people, glitches in the pathways
responsible for all of this

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:06.069
can cause excessive itching
that can actually harm their health.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.460
One extreme example is a psychological
condition called delusory parasitosis

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.506
where people believe their bodies
are infested with mites or fleas

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:18.470
scurrying over and under their skin,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.310
making them itch incessantly.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.419
Another phenomenon 
called phantom itching

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.579
can occur in patients 
who've had amputations.

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.871
Because this injury has 
so severely damaged the nervous system,

00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.001
it confuses the body's normal 
nerve signaling

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:40.432
and creates sensations in limbs
that are no longer there.

00:03:40.432 --> 00:03:45.062
Doctors are now finding ways
to treat these itching anomalies.

00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:49.230
In amputees, mirrors are used to reflect
the remaining limb,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.601
which the patient scratches.

00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:53.961
That creates an illusion 
that tricks the brain

00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:58.608
into thinking the imaginary 
itch has been satisfied.

00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:02.183
Oddly enough, that actually works.

00:04:02.183 --> 00:04:05.831
Researchers are also searching
for the genes involved in itching

00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:09.323
and developing treatments to try
and block the pathway of an itch

00:04:09.323 --> 00:04:12.002
in extreme cases.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:16.502
If having an unscratchable itch
feels like your own personal hell,

00:04:16.502 --> 00:04:19.002
Dante agreed.

00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:21.442
The Italian poet wrote about
a section of hell

00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:28.662
where people were punished by being
left in pits to itch for all eternity.
