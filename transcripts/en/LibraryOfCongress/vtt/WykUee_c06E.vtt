[ Music ]

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.460
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Welcome everybody

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.760
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.140
I'm John Haskell the
Director of the Kluge Center

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.130
and we're a sponsor
of this event.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.880
In case you don't know, many
of you don't know anything

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.210
about the Kluge Center,
just a sentence on it,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.500
I set in this charter
the purpose

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.260
of the Kluge Center
is the bridge the gap

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.720
between scholarship on
the one hand, congress,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.520
other policymakers and the
interested public on the other.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.280
And the aim is to
contribute to the conversation

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.410
about the challenges facing
democracies in the 21st-century.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.680
Tonight's event, as
suggested by its title,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.730
is meant to enlighten
us about the political

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.790
and cultural significance
of Star Wars.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.980
I must emphasize though, that
I'm in no position to comment

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.950
as to whether it will
achieve that end,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.590
not only because the panel
hasn't really actually happened

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.270
yet, but also because
I've never seen any

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.570
of the Star Wars
movies [brief laughter].

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.400
With that, they're making a
documentary on me actually.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.740
With that, let's turn
to the panelists.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.870
First I want to introduce our
moderator, Colleen Shogan.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.170
Colleen will begin a new
position at the library

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.470
as the Assistant
Deputy Librarian

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.190
for Collections and Services.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.910
On Monday, she's searching
for an acronym, let her know

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.280
if you have one for her.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.020
She's a political scientist.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.500
She specializes in
American institutions

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.120
and she writes both
fiction and nonfiction.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.490
Her readers can decide whether
the distinction is clear.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.530
Colleen has been a Star
Wars fan since the age of 7.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.480
A longtime ago though
in a galaxy far,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.000
far away she taught
a course on Star Wars

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.990
at Phillips Andover Academy.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.290
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.590
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Recently she's blogged

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.890
on the politics of Han Solo.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.190
Her favorite Star
Wars character,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.570
however, is Darth Vader.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.870
I have to take it on faith

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.530
that she shares traits
with that gentleman.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.390
Bill Davies is right here.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.710
He is an Associate Professor in
the Department of Justice Law

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.670
and Criminology at
American University.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.240
He teaches a number of
classes on legal history

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.030
and jurist prudence where
he gets to draw analogies

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.390
between the fall of the
Roman and galactic republics,

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.780
Plato's guardians,
and Yoda's Jedi.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.840
Am I pronouncing that right?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.360
And how the colonial
rebels successfully,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.740
the colonial rebels sorry
about that, successfully beat

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.030
down the British Empire.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.560
He grew up in England
just a stone's throw away

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.260
from Pinewood Studios where
the Star Wars movies were

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.660
in large part filmed.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.310
Henry Jenkins over here,
Henry is currently Kluge Chair

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.480
of modern culture
here at the library

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.390
and he's the Provost Professor
of Communication, Journalism,

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.800
Cinematic Art and
Education at the University

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.100
of Southern California.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.940
He was the cofounder
and co-director

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.080
of the MIT Comparative
Media Studies Program.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.790
His podcast, "How do
you like it so far?",

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.750
examines the intersection
between pop culture

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.130
and a changing society

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.870
and he recently did a series
focused on the Last Jedi.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.770
As a college journalist,
he once turned

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.200
down a pre-released
interview with Carry Fisher,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.370
Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.510
because he thought Star Wars was
a really dumb name of a movie.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.190
[ Laughter ]

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.830
That's why we have the light
shining on him right now.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.610
Seth Masket and another
person dressed

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.430
in black here is the
Professor of Political Science

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.670
and Director of the
Center on American Politics

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.860
at the University of Denver.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.090
Seth during the summer of 18 was
a Kluge Chair in American Law

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.390
and Governance,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.930
an internationally recognized
scholar on the party system.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.020
He also written and lectured
extensively on the politics

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.740
of Star Wars including
even the politics

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.390
of the 1978 Holiday Special.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.110
Seth was not born at that,
however, he's been a fan

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.420
of the series since he was 8.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.630
Sadly, the most exciting
moment of his adult life was

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.600
when Mark Hamill retweeted him.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.990
Swara Salih right here, is
a data analyst at the Center

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.940
for Government Excellence
at Johns Hopkins which works

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.210
to help city governments
improve their data

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.340
and performance management
practices.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.220
He's also a cohost of
Beltway Banthas, the Star Wars

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.750
and Politics pod, I'm sure
I'm mispronouncing that,

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.610
podcast with his
conservative counterpart,

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.490
a gentleman named Stephen Kent.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.630
They discuss and analyze all
intersections of the film series

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.720
and U.S. politics, having
esteemed guests like John Lovett

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.530
and Seth Masket,
yeah, Seth Masket.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.820
Swara is also one of the
creators and organizers

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.470
of #SWRepMatters an
online celebration

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.450
and advocacy campaign for
diversity and inclusion

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.620
in a galaxy far, far away.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.290
Take it away Colleen.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.590
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Alright, cool.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.590
Great. I've been like
waiting for this all week,

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.960
probably like all month.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.520
So, thanks for coming.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.820
Just a few announcements;

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.690
we do have the film outside
today just, I know you all know,

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.780
but at 7:30 we will go
outside and we're going

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.060
to play Empire tonight
on the north lawn

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.440
and then tomorrow night at 7:30,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.570
we're going to play
Return of the Jedi.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.410
They're going to be
great nights both nights.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.690
I ask you to come back
and enjoy the Library

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.960
of Congress Star
Wars Under the Stars,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.000
and tomorrow also our
display of Star Wars items

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.350
from our collection
are going to be

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.640
in the Jefferson
Building from 1 PM to 6.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.150
So if you come a little
bit early for the movie,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.090
come and check out this
terrific display of materials

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.130
that we have from the Library
of Congress collection here

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.100
in the Jefferson Building
that will be on display

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.240
from 1 PM to 6 tomorrow.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.990
So, let's get started.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.840
So, what we're going
to do is start off

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.370
with a quick round robin just
for fun and then we'll get

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.130
into some political questions.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.030
So, first easy question;
favorite Star Wars film, Swara?

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.270
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Ah, is this on?

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.850
The Last Jedi.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.150
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Of all
the questions you said,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.450
you said this was
the one I stressed

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.750
about the most [brief laughter].

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.800
So, I will just say I've been
saying Empire Strikes Back

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.760
for years and now I'm
leaning Rogue One.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.450
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Oh, ooh.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.480
A convert, okay.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.720
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: For me it
was Empire Strikes Back

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.780
that hooked me, otherwise, it's
got to be Revenge of the Sith.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.080
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Oh, ooh.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.700
I like the prequel, okay.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.120
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: So, I
started, I wanted to sort

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.550
of say the People versus
George Lucas, but because I'm

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.400
in that one, but, but
I ended up with Empire,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.180
but I'm The Force Awakens
has really gaining on them

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.480
as I watched them all back

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.190
through again getting
ready for this.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.870
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay,
another quick question;

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.110
favorite Star Wars character?

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.410
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Rey.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.710
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Lando.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.350
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: This is
the one I stressed about.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.930
Okay, spur of the
moment Obi-Wan Kenobi.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.230
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Chewbacca.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.530
Us furballs have to stick
together [brief laughter].

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.270
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Alright, and
a couple more quick up or down

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.610
and maybe just a
sentence for why;

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.840
up or down Solo a
Star Wars' story.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.310
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Down.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.960
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Extremely down.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.260
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Up.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.000
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Yeah
I'm definitely up.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.950
I think the critics
didn't understand the role

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.550
of the backstory at all when
they responded to that film.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.850
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay, great.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.240
And even more controversial,
The Last Jedi.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.330
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih:
Stratospherically, up.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.130
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: I definitely
liked it, some parts more

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.270
than others, but
definitely a positive.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.670
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: It
was a catastrophic

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.930
down at the beginning
then it became an up

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.190
and now its teetering again.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.490
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.840
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: No,
I'm definitely up.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.480
It's flawed like been
incoherent like the rest

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.520
of the Star Wars films,
but I think it's much,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.970
much better than
its critics concede.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.270
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.920
So now pin it to the
theme of our panel today

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.930
which is politics and Star Wars.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.120
The first question very general,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.080
are these really
Star Wars films;

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.090
are these really
political films number one?

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.470
And number two, in recent years,
how much has Star Wars served

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.180
as a proxy for what's going

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.950
on in American politics
today recently?

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.720
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah,
politics has been embedded

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.610
in Star Wars from the start.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.000
In episode four, A New Hope you
have this small imperial counsel

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.640
talking about what's going
on with the galactic senate

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.820
about the emperor dissolving it.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.120
They're talking about
the politics

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.980
and the optics of
their operations.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.440
They talk about the
old republic;

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.030
it's all baked in there.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.770
George Lucas actually
intended the original trilogy

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.500
to be a sort of allegory
for how the U.S., us,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.640
was conducting itself abroad
specifically in Vietnam.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.920
When you look at in Return
of the Jedi at the Ewoks

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.830
of all things, he actually
intended that to be a sort

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:09.370
of allegory for the Vietcong and
Vietnam rebels where we were,

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.470
you know, doing a lot
of interference and,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.380
yeah he especially in the
prequel trilogy doubled

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.100
down on this making
clear obvious parallels

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.450
to what's going on
in Afghanistan, Iraq,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.690
the Middle East generally.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.730
What is interesting about that,
he started writing the story

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.900
for that before 9/11, before
the events of the war on terror

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.220
that unfolded later, so he was
actually writing concurrently

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.520
with that.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.370
This is a sort of running
theme for George Lucas,

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.910
the thread of a larger power
overtaking smaller powers

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:48.100
or smaller countries
or entities and, yeah,

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.080
it's been embedded
from the beginning.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.800
I think we just haven't
thought of it as much

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.780
in the original trilogy
until now with the prequels

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.080
and the sequel trilogy, because
it was so much more subtle

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.470
in the original trilogy.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.130
Now it's a lot more obvious,
you want to take that?

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.430
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Yeah.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.730
I mean, I, I agree.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.550
The, you know, in the original
trilogy it's a political

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.450
setting, but it is, it's a
vague enough political message

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.380
that you can read almost
anything you want into it.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.880
It's basically it's
a liberation story,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.600
it's not really making
too many enemies in that.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.840
It's when we get into the
prequels, which you know,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:30.010
I'm happy to diss just name
it, but those are and that's

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.930
where Lucas had given
pretty much free reign

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.080
to write what he wants and
those are just very overtly

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.380
political films.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.220
You actually have scenes
in several of the films

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.230
that take place in legislatures.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.630
You see voting in the
galactic legislature.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.700
How many films, how
many actions films,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.680
sci-fi films do you see
voting in a legislative body?

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.980
It is very rare.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.420
Several of the main
characters are senators.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.140
The chancellor is
a main character.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.040
You have a lot of people,
you know, Jedi leaders

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.790
who play also some
political role.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.160
Those are very, those are
overtly political films.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.630
I think Revenge of the Sith
was very clearly in a number

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.060
of ways designed as a pushback
against George W. Bush,

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.090
obviously the earlier films
were had other messages built

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.620
into them, but yeah,
I'd say he wants us

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.970
to be paying attention
to politics.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.260
He thinks what's going
on there is important.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.560
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Yeah, I
would definitely agree

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.960
with that categorization.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.190
I think the original trilogies
are less about politics and more

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.490
about you know classic
science fiction themes

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:34.310
like the human condition and the
power of love and forgiveness

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.130
and sacrifice and everything

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.940
that science fiction is really
designed to do is enable us

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.770
to explore what it
means to be human.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.830
The prequel trilogies are, as
has been said, overtly political

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.340
and I enjoy them for
that reason actually.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.990
The one thing that is missing

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.530
from the prequel
politics is the judiciary.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.050
We don't get any mention
of the courts and so.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.730
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: We got one
mention in episode one.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.030
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Yeah.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.330
And you get a clue of what was.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.770
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Why
would that be relevant?

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.580
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Maybe
they'll cover this gap

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.870
in the next episode, but a yeah
that's what's missing for me

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.340
as a legal scholar at least.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.780
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: As a
media scholar, I come at it

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.430
from slightly different angle
because while I'm interested

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.590
in the politics in the film,
I'm also very interested

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.290
in the politics around the film.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.670
So, my in my recent book "By Any
Media Necessary" we interviewed

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.720
about 200 young activists
and heard consistently

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.840
that the language of the
American politics was broken,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.720
but because it was exclusive,
it was inside the beltway,

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.450
it was hard to understand
for first-time voters

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.450
and it was repulsive in so
far as the partisanship cloud

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.850
in any discussion of the issues.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.410
What we found though was pop
culture provides that generation

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.050
with the language
they use to talk

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.680
about social change whether
it's a three finger salute

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.130
from Hunger Games or Princess
Leia at the Women's March.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.890
We're seeing a variety
of signs from that.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.490
This is what we call
the civic imagination,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.710
so the civic imagination how
do we imagine a better world?

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.140
How do we think of
ourselves as a civic agent?

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.630
And that's baked into this
mythological structure

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.430
of Star Wars to such a degree

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.090
that it has been a
particularly evocative text.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.660
Whether we're going to
talk about Ronald Reagan's,

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.910
whether he did or didn't mean
evil empire as an illusion

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.670
to Star Wars or whether the
Star Wars critique of Kennedy

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.680
that he later embraced
of his strategic missiles

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.440
or we could talk about the
use of the Hoth sequence

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.970
by protestors in Madison,

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.210
Wisconsin who use the
icy landscape to pick,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.290
to go after Scott Walker
and calling let's go after,

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.530
let's fight the imperial
Walkers.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:48.930
People even dressed up like
at that particular protest.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.100
So, we're seeing Star Wars
iconography crop up all

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.160
over the place in
contemporary American politics

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.070
and it is the way
we think today.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.380
It's not a new thing that we
use imagination for politics.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.140
I'd like to point to you the,

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.700
what I call the cosplay George
Washington in the Smithsonian.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.550
There's a statue of George
Washington wearing the toga.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.960
Unless he went to toga
parties at William and Mary,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.690
I don't think he actually
wore a toga, but it tells us

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.200
that there was a fantasy of
restoring classical democracy

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.560
that shaped the founding
fathers who wrote in pen names,

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.460
[inaudible] we call them
today of Roman orators

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.340
and Greek heroes to
fight for democracy.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.520
So, students today who are using
Star Wars characters to think

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.040
about social change,
are part of a continuum

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.360
where the imagination
always plays an active role

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.040
in how we think about
political change.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.340
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah,
what is Star Wars

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.330
but our modern mythology?

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.980
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: And if that's
case we're going to draw on it

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.480
for political discourse.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.870
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Absolutely.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.170
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay,

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.470
so let's talk a little
bit about the prequels.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.450
I actually re-watched the
prequels and I kind of like them

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.700
if you're looking at them from
a political science perspective,

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.220
but one thing that bothers
me is what we touched

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.710
on a little bit here, is
the separation of powers.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.210
So, may Seth you can
talk to us a little bit

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.730
about the legislature, the
galactic senate its strengths

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.290
and weaknesses and then
we can collectively talk

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.690
about what is the role,
I'm more and more confused

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.990
by the role of the Jedi.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.000
Is that supposed to be
the executive power?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.260
Who are they accountable
for and do we have to face

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.210
up to the fact that the Jedi
are partially responsible

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:27.230
for the fall of the Republic?

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.440
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Okay.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.740
So, easy hitter.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.720
When I teach actually
legislatures I usually start off

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.320
with the scene of
the legislature

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.440
in the galactic republic
from Phantom Menace and just,

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.910
you know, again like two minutes
of legislative behavior here

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.400
and I ask students to say,
well tell me what's missing,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.960
assuming this is an a
natural legislature,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.940
what should be here that isn't?

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.480
One of the things that's there

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.540
or that should be
there is parties.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.260
This is apparently an
enormous legislature.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.850
We never, we don't
know the exact size,

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.540
but there are thousands
maybe tens of thousands

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.660
of systems represented and they
don't seem very well-organized.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.430
One of the things that would
very likely emerge here is some

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.100
sort of party divisions
and we don't see that.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.080
We don't see any
sort of formal order

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.880
for the way things are done.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.340
There is queen Amidala who
gets to address the legislature

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.580
as a nonmember of
that legislature.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.290
If that happened this thing
wouldn't last a thousand

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.510
generations, it wouldn't last a
thousand years, I mean this is,

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.050
it's kind of a mess and
also there's no media as far

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.130
as we can tell and there's
some little floating droid.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:36.050
I don't know what that thing is,
but you know, they're talking

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.310
about a you know have
some members saying,

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.150
hey the trade federation
is invading my planet

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.300
and other members saying,
no, no they're not.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.830
And there's no finality
of that at all.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.140
They say, well maybe we should
have a report or maybe there,

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.880
you know, turn on
CNN or something

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.290
and you might have some sort
of inkling of what's going on.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.920
There's no evidence that
any of that occurs in there.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.180
So, there's a number
of important problems

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.500
with the way this
legislatures are run.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.010
Also, they just, you know, an
outside member when she gets

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.700
to speak calls for a vote of
no confidence in the leader

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.030
of the chain; this
is ridiculous.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:17.320
And then, in the second prequel
when they vote there's no ayes

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.940
or no's, there's just grunts.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.610
They just go like this and
that's presumably a vote either

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.010
for some piece of legislation.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.810
So, yeah, problems.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.110
Briefly.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.410
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Maybe
a lack of formal rules?

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.710
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: That's.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.010
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Immature institutions?

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.310
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.610
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Even though
it's a thousand generations old

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.910
that's a problem, okay.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.210
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.670
When George Lucas was writing
these films he wasn't thinking

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.970
of the specific rules.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.790
He was thinking what can I
put in for dramatic attention,

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.500
because Padme Amidala is one
of the main protagonists,

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.800
I'm going to have her be
pressured into calling

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.350
for a vote of no
confidence, but as you point

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.570
out Seth this makes
absolutely no sense.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.420
The system would fall apart in a
day if like any monarch or ruler

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.580
from any planet could
just barge in

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.940
and like demand whatever
they wanted.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:06.310
Yeah, George bless him, he
cares a lot about politics.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.720
He doesn't know how to
write politics very well

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.000
and I actually want to
suggest an article on NPR

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.660
by Tamara Keith and Scott
Detrow, the politics

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.280
of Star Wars make no sense.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.380
It is a very informative
and very entertaining read.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.680
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Well, all

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.260
that said he does
understand the symbolism

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.560
of the legislature branch.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.070
I mean, for me the great moment
in Revenge of the Sith is

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.540
when Yoda and Darth
Sidious are fighting

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.120
in the legislative chamber

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.400
and what is Darth Sidious
using as his weapon?

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.910
He's using the pods.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.210
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: The pods.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.650
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Yeah, the pods
that they used to deliberate

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.010
and for me that was a
great symbolic moment

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.260
that this is just a weapon for
Darth Sidious to gain power.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.510
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: So, I thought
I'd fill in a couple of examples

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:53.130
of how that translates back
to real world senate politics.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.790
So, Ted Cruz as some of you may
know is a hardcore Star Wars

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.450
fan, releases an ad for
his presidential campaign

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.090
where he turns the U.S.
Constitution into a light-saver.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.840
Goes after Obama who's ripping
up the constitution where a pack

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.210
of wild donkeys riding an
elephant charging into battle,

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.660
fights his way through
a pack of rhinos

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.970
and finally rescues the
Capitol from the control of,

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.630
so it's politics
everybody is incoherent

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.130
as what we're describing
in Star Wars itself.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.430
That it turned around though

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.460
when in one his campaign
appearances in New Hampshire,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.150
a young activist
Andrew Slack showed up,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.430
gave him a light-saver which
he loved and started waving it

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.270
around in front of the cameras
and the manger proceeded

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:42.350
to ask what kind of senator he
was, was he Organa or Palpatine?

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.270
In using the notion of the
dark force or dark money

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.840
as a metaphor to think about
the campaign finance reform

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.490
and the conversation
shutdown fairly quickly

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.210
as the Star Wars fan running
for President realized

00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.850
that he was probably on the
wrong side of that metaphor.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.570
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: One
more Ted Cruz story.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.680
He actually made, he
made I think during the,

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:12.210
yeah 2016 Election an ad where
he set himself in Hillary

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:16.420
and Barack Obama to the
trailer of The Force Awakens.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.010
He was setting himself as Rey,
he was setting Barack Obama

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:24.190
as Darth Vader and Hillary
as Kylo Ren and no offense,

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.350
Senator Cruz you are no Rey.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.410
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
And nobody wants

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.430
to touch my question
about the Jedi and.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.730
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Oh
yeah, oh yeah.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.030
Oh, definitely.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.330
This is like.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.630
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Alright.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.930
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: This is an
extremely important point,

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.720
because the Jedi as
they started out,

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.840
very spiritual religious
organization.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:50.050
They say, oh we are here
to help promote peace,

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.780
but in our own spiritual
way letting the will

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.710
of the force guide us.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.230
The force doesn't play
politics unfortunately.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.540
It is outside any
sort of institution.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:05.080
So, you know, my our theory
on our show for what happened

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.150
with the Jedi throughout the
generations of the republic is,

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.260
as the republic became
more and more consolidated

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.820
and needed some sort
of peacekeeping force

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.030
across these desperate systems,
the Jedi's first stepped

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:23.820
in increasingly they were
originally embroiled in for lack

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.040
of a better term,
earthly affairs

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.160
and they essentially became
a political institution

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.650
onto themselves, that
and they weren't even

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.490
in trying to the constitution.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.860
So, what you have in Revenge
of the Sith, what makes Windu

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.340
and the other Jedi trying
to arrest Palpatine,

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.520
what grounds do they
have to do that?

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.170
It's certainly not
in the constitution

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.040
like Palpatine probably
notes, or like just thinking

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.340
to himself, what are they doing?

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.640
Like even if you
weren't in Sith,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.400
you know this is something
else the Jedi are doing.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.320
They are discriminating
against the chancellor

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.790
for his role as affiliation.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.430
So, you know, there's
another question in there.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.820
Again, George wasn't
really thinking that much

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.530
about the rules,
but he gave a lot

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.900
of really great fodder
for us to dig into.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.270
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: I wrote
a piece a few years ago

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.570
about the role of the Jedi.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.000
So, as I, as I see them they
are a secretive powerful

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.300
religious order.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.870
They recruit children at a very
young age and indoctrinate them.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.010
They have this quasi
governing role

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.440
that are totally unaccountable.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.840
They're basically the Taliban.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.680
So, yeah anyway not
a fan, but yeah.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.340
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Okay, alright.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.370
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: For me the
Jedi are, looking at this

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.670
from a jurisprudence angle,

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.000
I think the Jedi is this weird
manifestation of concepts

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.710
of natural law, but there's
this underlying structure

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:51.500
to the universe that is morally
sound and we just need to work

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.860
out what these moral precepts
are and live our lives to them,

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.210
and the Jedi are this
manifestation in the real world

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:02.750
of natural law and Star Wars
is in a way it's a critique

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:07.360
of natural law in the sense that
as soon as these manifestations

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.740
of natural law have to interact

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.280
in the real world
then they fail.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.580
The become too rigid,
they become too absolute,

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.070
and it just can't deal
with the dirty reality

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.620
of everyday politics.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.640
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So,
so go ahead, go ahead.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.620
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Yeah,
I again playing my role

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.190
of bringing this back to the
realm of real world politics.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.390
One of the interesting
Jedi mobilizations was

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:33.180
by a group called the Rebel
Alliance which was concerned

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.780
with public education and they
discovered that May the 4th,

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:41.290
the official Star Wars holiday
was, it existed the same week

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.670
as Teacher Appreciation Week

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.870
and so they launched a campaign
called Teach us your [inaudible]

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.630
where people pay
tribute to their mentors.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.020
Now, I was bemused by this

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.320
because mentorship is maybe
not the most successful strike,

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.040
side of the Jedi's
role in society.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.330
I mean if I failed my
students as bad as most

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.760
of those teachers did
I would be probably

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.260
out of my job even with tenure.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.560
There's all kinds

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.710
of inappropriate
relationships modeled

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.370
on the Star War films
in terms of the Jedi.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.240
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: We'll move
onto the original trilogies.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.010
So, the theme, one of
the big political themes

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.020
of the original trilogy
is rebellion;

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.350
the theme of rebellion and one
thing that I've always struggled

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:24.810
with is how this
much, much smaller,

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:30.660
much less resource Rebel Force
is able to actually land punches

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.820
and made gains and ultimately
overthrow the empire,

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.900
this huge monolithic empire.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.630
And the empire is clearly a
bureaucratic organization.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.090
It's hierarchical.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.390
So, what does that tell us

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.320
that there is this
small force that's able

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.230
to overthrow the empire,
what does that tell us

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.640
about the empire as a regime
and maybe talk a little bit

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.170
about the theme of rebellion
and how that's been used

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.650
by politicians and
political protests, you know,

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.020
in the political context?

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.530
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: I'm
going to jump in on this.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:00.830
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Good.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.090
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: So, I actually
want to recommend on this piece

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.240
that Vox Mischiefs of Faction
written by Amy Erica Smith

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.540
who wrote, actually some
commentary on the Solo movie.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.030
This is the one, one
piece of praise I'll offer

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.640
for this film is that it shows
us the bureaucratic weakness

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.940
of the empire.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.390
This is, it's a government
that's actually not been

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.530
around very long by the time
we see these events unfold

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.910
and they're having
trouble staffing up.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.700
It's actually hard to
develop a bureaucracy.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.230
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: There's
not a lot of job security.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.530
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: There's not?

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.340
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: There's big
punishment if you screw up.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.640
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Yeah.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.940
Yeah.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.240
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yeah.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.540
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: You rise too
high it will choke you and then,

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.160
so it's actually fairly
hard to coordinate things

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.460
across great distances.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.110
One of the things
that is kind of,

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.540
well actually very inconsistent
across all these films,

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.130
is just how large this
universe is and how easy it is

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.840
to communicate and
to travel across it.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.580
In the early films it seems to
actually take a very long time.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.920
It's harder to administer
the outer rim planets

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.490
which is why slavery basically
existed there unchecked

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.230
for so long which is
why local war lords

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.000
and mob bosses basically have.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.300
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.600
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Free rein there.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.970
So, in many ways this is
actually a very vulnerable

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.740
system and you know the rebels
were pretty good at, you know,

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:21.390
finding its weak places, plus
you had the fact that the,

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:25.140
you know, when I think
very foolish things

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.020
that the emperor did was
dissolve the imperial senate.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.320
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.450
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Which was
obviously not a, you know,

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.600
not a very strong
or important body,

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.570
but it held a vital
symbolic role.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.550
It told people that if you have
problems there is a political

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.680
organization where you
can channel them and once

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.290
that was gone, it was really,

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.840
there was no political
solution to anything.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.090
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah, and they
were expecting the Death Star

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.430
along with the original
governors

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.660
to keep the local
systems in mind

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.170
like that was the exact
line in episode four, sorry.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.190
So, yeah, Seth you hit
the nail on the head.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.950
It's really about the
sheer magnitude of trying

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.570
to govern an entire
galaxy with hundreds

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.490
of thousands of systems
basically.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.410
The thing about the
republic is, this is just

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.410
like I know we're trying
to be general here,

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.700
but this is something
I've read around that,

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.680
it was initially started
as a sort of trade system.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.480
Like for planets to facilitate
like trade and economic stuff,

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.160
sorry, across the galaxy.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.530
So, when you get to the empire
that's trying to express

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.710
like a lot of control over
the galaxy then you run

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.090
into problems and then
you don't have the senate

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.430
that like Seth said,
was this sort of conduit

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.580
between the citizen
Rey and the executive.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.230
So, the rebel alliance
coming from various systems

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.980
like General Ackbar and his
compatriots from Mon Calamari,

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.330
Alderann other systems
I'm not going to go into,

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.090
but various across the
galaxy join together

00:27:55.090 --> 00:28:01.070
and found the weak spots in
this very poorly managed system

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.800
and they were effectively able
to dismantle the structure

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.270
from the inside with the final
victory being at Endor or Battle

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:13.010
of Jakku with like you know
have a battle front to.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.830
So, yeah it's like just be

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.350
like larger does not
always equal better.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.340
There in a lot of ways, it
fell like the Roman Empire

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:27.240
with its structural like
weaknesses and other empires

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.160
when you like look
through world history

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.450
and it was only a
matter of time really.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.090
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: I would add

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:39.640
that I think Lucas had the
experiences of the 1930s

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.340
with dictatorships
in Europe in mind

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.250
when he was thinking not
just about the appearance

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.290
of this [inaudible]
prison imperial offices,

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.700
but the way that this bloated
bureaucracy was functioning

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.450
and the main job for
these bureaucrats was not

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:53.820
to actually do their
job very well,

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.440
it was to please the
superior and make sure

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.020
that superior doesn't
strangle them to death.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.930
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah, that
was Palpatine's ruling style.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.830
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Exactly.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:06.130
What I really like about the
new novels, the Aftermath series

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.460
and the Throne novels is
that they, it really gets

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.430
into the details of
that, you really see some

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.290
of these horrible,
horrible bureaucrats.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.090
You always tend to
be depicted as a kind

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:20.640
of Hermann Goring very
overweight and selfish

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.150
and the horrible bureaucrat
who does whatever he can do

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.310
to make sure that he stays
in his position regardless

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:29.500
of any kind of merit of
any of his inferiors.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.060
And the one thing that really
stands out for me about Thrawn

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.480
in these books is that he
runs his ship as a meritocracy

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.720
and that's why it's
so much more efficient

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.410
and so much more
effective his ship compared

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.540
to the other imperial
as the other ships

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.650
in the imperial fleet.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:50.150
So, I really think that was a
part of Luke's ruling too is.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.450
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yeah,
what about the theme

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:52.750
of rebellion politically?

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.900
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Well, I
think we, there's no accident

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.060
that we're using the term "the
resistance" right now to talk

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.900
about progressive pushback
against Donald Trump, right?

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.440
And thanks to Princess Leia's
standing over my head right,

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.150
she has given us a
model for thinking

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.870
about an organization
that's intersectional,

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:12.660
that involves people
from a variety

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.670
of different backgrounds.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.040
We could say something about
her racism toward Wookies

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.130
in particular which
is problematic.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.450
&gt;&gt; She had just lost her
playmate give her a break.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.940
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Talk out for
people of [multiple speakers].

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.080
&gt;&gt; That's locker
room talk, that was.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.380
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: People [brief
laughter] need to be sort

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.960
of need better treatment
within the resistance,

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.950
but I think nevertheless, and
it's just locker room talk

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.030
because it results in
them not getting a medal

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.490
and having a stand
like everyone else.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.240
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: That's true.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.540
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Right?

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.840
That's justice for
Wookies hashtag.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.710
But, you know, but the
interesting thing is you can

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.870
move in you can be a fly or
can be a farm boy one day

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.610
and a commander in the
resistance movement the next,

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:59.360
right, that there's a certain
meritocracy in her sense

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.190
of command that results in
both Han and Luke and later Ray

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:07.340
and Finn being immediately
incorporated into that.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.400
There is a willingness to listen
to subordinance talk back.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.860
I think that's an
interesting model

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:18.150
of what a political organization
might do, but also a willingness

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.450
to put men in their place

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.860
which I think is also a really
interesting model in our

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.450
"Me Too" times up moment
to see what command looks

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.390
like over a resistance movement.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:30.690
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
This is a good segue

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.870
into our next discussion
which is about race and gender

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.040
and diversity in the
Star Wars universe.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.920
So, the first question,
you know, we see elements

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.500
of democracy in the
Star Wars universe.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.610
We see elements of
republicanism representiveness

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:46.210
in the Star Wars universe.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.960
Do we see elements, is the Star
Wars universe ever a liberal

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.790
society, a rights-based society
or is that just nonexistent

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.730
in the Star Wars universe?

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:01.250
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: So,
until the Disney era,

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:05.450
for the most part Star Wars
a franchise I have loved

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.520
with all my heart since I was 9,

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.360
has been mainly headlined
by white men.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.860
It's a, The Phantom has
always been very diverse,

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.800
but at the same time,
certain voices were only,

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.690
would be highlighted and
a lot of people of color

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.280
and women even like a
lot of women would be

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.280
out of the conversation
about this.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.470
I'm talking about both
the Star Wars universe

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.890
and The Phantom here; the
Disney era has made a lot

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.540
of great strides when you
look from The Force Awakens

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.670
to The Last Jedi, Solo,
Rogue One especially

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.380
with the super diverse cast.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.650
There's still strides to go on
with that and it's interesting

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:53.010
because George Lucas did
intend the Rebel Alliance

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:57.870
to be a multiracial or
multispecies coalition

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:01.500
against the "human
supremacist empire"

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.540
like the allegory was meant
to be that the empire was

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.040
like a Nazi organization
only promoting human rights

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.390
and not alien's rights and that
it was a metaphor George Lucas

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:12.690
was going for.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.510
It wasn't race-based, but
it was species-based and,

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.260
again, that was a metaphor.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.740
I'm not sure like with canon

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.670
like how much that's really
being digged into now,

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.390
but I do know that was like
very much in his thinking.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:30.780
And but it is still interesting,
because when you look

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.410
at the original trilogy films it
would only, it was mostly human.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:39.420
It wasn't until beside Chewbacca
it wasn't until episode six

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.980
when we saw aliens
in the Rebel Alliance

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.540
and we didn't even
really get that much talk

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.140
about the human supremacy
of the empire.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.620
It was something that you'd read
in books or George would talk

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.330
about maybe in some
interviews here and there.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:58.300
So, all of this is, it's very
interesting to think about.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.660
It can be uncomfortable
at times,

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.430
but it does necessitate
a discussion, again,

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:07.140
Star Wars when you look at the
films now they're making strides

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.320
at that can certainly
go further and I think

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.980
for on the women question
I think barely any

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.030
of the films pass
the Bechdel test.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:20.510
So, and if they do it's
only for like 30 seconds.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.530
There's a long way to go
in terms of it promoting a,

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:29.290
you know, I think this is
like tangential to being,

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.820
to being more liberal like
a more diverse society

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.750
when we're looking
at the discussion

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.040
of our politics today.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.340
So, as a.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.080
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: There's a
question that major characters

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.380
that are people of color, right?

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.680
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Right.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.980
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: I mean,
there are people of color

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.690
who are characters even in
the recent Star Wars movies,

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:46.990
but what are they doing?

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:49.130
How, you know, what is
their storylines things

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.430
like that, right?

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:51.900
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah, yeah it's
like I loved The Last Jedi.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:57.880
It's my favorite Star Wars
film, but I appreciate and agree

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.450
with a lot of the criticisms
of how it treats its people

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:05.240
of color and its women.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.280
You know, like I think
that it does try to dig

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.030
into some really
serious conversations

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.560
and I love Ryan Johnson.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.840
I think he's a brilliant
director, a brilliant writer.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.870
I think it would have helped a
lot if he happen to have a woman

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:23.240
of color a cowriter, a
co-director to look at some,

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.000
when you look at a lot of
the conversation in the media

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.930
about the film, this film
and some of the racial

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.510
and sex-based issues it has,

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.940
I think this would have
solved a lot of it.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:42.050
If he, if it and like Lucas
film, I don't, it has a bit

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:45.230
of a white man problem where
it is mostly white men creators

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.890
creating and writing these films
and I think it can be opened

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.630
up more especially,
you know, for example,

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.180
just have more women,
have more people of color,

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.070
have people of the
LGBT community.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:00.930
It's we're living in an era now
where people know so much more

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:05.430
about how their films are made
and, you know, it's like clear

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.710
on the screen when we're
watching them as well.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.390
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: So, I want to
recommend another blog post.

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:14.050
This is I believe by Sarah
Parkinson at the Monkey Cage.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:19.270
She did a little write up of
Rogue One noting that, you know,

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.420
one of the real innovations
of that film is

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.300
that it showed the
centrality of women

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.770
to the resistance movement.

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:29.760
Not necessarily as the lead
fighters, but the organizers

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.960
of it, the generals, the
people who are connected

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.260
from different systems

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.580
that actually put
this thing together.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.420
That includes people like Jyn
Erso, that includes Mon Mothma,

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.630
it incluse Leia and she notes

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.910
that this is actually a
familiar pattern in a lot

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.190
of resistance movements around
the world that we see today.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:48.060
So, you know, I don't know that
I would necessarily call that;

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.020
I mean that was a very good
film for representation.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.400
I don't know if I would
call it a feminist film

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.830
by a longshot, but it was.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:57.260
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Like Jyn's story
and this is criticism I've heard

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.900
from a lot of my women
friends is that a lot

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.170
of her plot is based
on the actions of men

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.770
or like her father in
particular, I mean I think,

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:07.420
I think she had a
great plot overall.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.750
I think it was very compelling

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:11.600
and I think she can be a
really great role model,

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.960
but I do understand
those criticisms as well.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.450
We should have women
writers for these films.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.320
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins:
No, absolutely.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.870
I mean the interesting
thing about the politics

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.700
of these films is
there's one contingent

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.450
who thinks it hasn't far enough
or far enough, fast enough

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:29.150
and we can look at Phantom
as a site which really has

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.450
for a longtime fought

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.160
for representational
politics even something

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.030
like cosplay which.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.630
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins:
Traditionally was about fidelity

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:40.550
to the original costume is
now being used as a tool

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:44.000
to help us imagine what a
more racially and diverse

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.280
or more gender of binary,
non-binary Star Wars might look

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.010
like and so it's a tool.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.790
Fan fiction has been a tool for
imagining other possibilities.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.160
Although the interesting
data there was coming

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.070
out of Force Awakens where you
have these characters of color,

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.940
the most popular pairing
in fan fiction has been Hux

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.390
and Rylo or Kylo Renaissance.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:10.690
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Oh.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:11.990
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Not any
of the characters of color,

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.680
so even fan fiction
has failed us.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.980
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yeah.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.280
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: In terms

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.580
of imagining what
diversity would look like.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.270
On the other side,
we have the people

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:22.440
who are angry fan
boys, so-called toxic.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.740
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.040
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins:
Fan masculinities

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.390
which from the very beginning
was hostile to the new films

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:30.840
with some good reason, right,
it's a very mixed group

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.480
that we're talking about.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.930
There's a lot of built-up
animosity, you know,

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:37.460
going back over a
variety of issues,

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.710
but a lot of them do
have to do with gender

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.910
and racial representational
issues.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:45.600
The media overblew some
parts of the story.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.190
It turns out the
#blackstormtropper was built

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:51.800
around a Lego movie that
had nothing to do with race

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.380
and a very small percentage

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.590
when you crunch the numbers
were racially, you know,

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.600
white supremacist posts, but
there is that discourse there

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.980
that people are looking at and
that we need to think about.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.130
So, there's a struggle
around the politics

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:08.110
of the film that's very real.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.540
The problem when the media
over-represents toxic phantom

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:14.400
and backlash, is it allows
the producer to say we need

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.470
to go slow because
our base is upset.

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:17.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:19.070
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins:
And it doesn't,

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:22.610
and the media is not covering
all of the progressive moves

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.470
to representational
politics in Finn.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:26.770
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: It's
like when we're looking

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.750
at The Last Jedi reaction
for example, when you look

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:35.150
at different metrics you have
something called cinema score

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:36.900
which pulls audiences directly

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.490
when they're coming
out of the movie.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:42.510
The Last Jedi got an A
grade on Rotten Tomatoes

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.880
which allows anyone
to go on and comment

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.690
and put whatever
rating they want.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:50.000
It had something
like a 45% rotten;

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.310
that is a coordinated
campaign to try

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:55.650
to dash the score of a film.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:56.950
You're absolutely right.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.430
It's like it's so
overblown, it's so frustrating

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:03.420
because the broad majority
of the public and when I talk

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:08.290
to people outside of hardcore
fandom, like a lot most liked

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:11.860
or loved the film; however,
I have friends that didn't

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.660
like the film as
well and that's fine.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.790
What they do is they
say, I don't like this.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:19.060
I'm moving along with my fandom.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.490
For example, I didn't like Solo.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:21.940
I'm just going to
leave it at that.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.790
I don't need to harp on
anyone else for loving it

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:26.660
and I do have friends
that love it.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.900
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: So, I
think what matters though is

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.200
that Finn is a Black.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.500
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yes.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.800
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Right?

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.100
I mean, I think Frantz Fanon
could write a whole book just

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.510
about Finn's journey

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.640
from someone whose peoples
have been conquered.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.100
He's enlisted into the service.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.420
He struggles with issues of
conscience and finally rebels,

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.650
but is torn between the desire
to get out of the system

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:50.510
and a desire to become a
hero in the system's terms,

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.210
and I think there's a
really powerful journey just

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.760
around the edges in terms
of thinking about what,

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.150
why it matters Finn takes place.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:59.890
Re-watching the films
getting ready for this,

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.350
though the moment that really
threw me out of my chair is

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:05.460
in the beginning of Sith,
there's a rolling credit

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.750
that tells us there would good
people on both sides [laughter].

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:11.590
Well, I kid you not.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.890
Unless this is another one

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.790
of George Lucas's
alteration of the text.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.090
&gt;&gt; Oh, George.

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:19.100
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: I'm assuming
it was there all along.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.310
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So, my
last question before we get;

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.610
I want to get to the audience

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:23.910
because I know you guys
have a lot of questions,

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:27.300
so we'll fast-forward here
to the sequel trilogy.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.850
Right now we know they're
filming episode nine.

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.670
There's not that much
information out there,

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:34.530
but they're filming episode nine
and the one thing we do know

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.620
about episode nine
is that it is going

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.450
to be the last episode
that's going to deal

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:39.750
with the Skywalker saga.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.490
That has been made very clear.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.470
So, I have a two-part
question for the panel

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:44.770
and this is the last question

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.580
and then we'll go
to the audience.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:51.650
How do you want the
Skywalker saga to end?

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.900
And how do you think the
Skywalker saga will end?

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.940
So, those are could be
two different questions;

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.160
how do you want it to end and
how do you think it is going

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.240
to end in episode nine?

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.540
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Ah, so.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.840
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
It's a toughie.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.790
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah, I
have been so in the middle

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.700
of this debate raging online.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.840
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Well this is your,

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.180
you're at the Library
of Congress.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.480
You're on record here.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.780
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah, so.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.080
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
This is part of.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.380
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yes,
yes exactly.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.680
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: This
is part of national okay?

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.980
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Exactly.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.280
Okay.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.580
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: No pressure.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.880
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: I view
the Skywalker's as Icarus,

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.900
flying too close
to the sun to talk

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.790
about another mythic reference.

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.140
I love Luke and Leia.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.420
They are two of my favorite
characters of all time,

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.820
but I think even they
would agree by the end

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:44.350
of The Last Jedi that their time
has passed, that what they need

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.730
to focus on is what's good
for the galaxy at large.

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:49.630
The Skywalker's are the
family we've been following

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.530
for so long, but there are
things far more important

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.760
than one single family.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.930
Kylo Ren who is a fascinating
conflicted character

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:00.230
in both The Force Awakens

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:04.070
and The Last Jedi has had
multiple times at going

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.720
to the other side or helping the
resistance or trying to atone

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.300
for the various sins
he has committed.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.510
There is maybe a chance
of redemption for him

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:18.600
in episode nine, but I
think I'm very much at 50/50

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.230
on whether it's going to happen.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.530
We will see.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.830
I think my ideal for episode
nine for the Skywalker saga

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:31.840
to be wrapped up, is for Rey to
lead a new order of Jedi for her

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.750
to undergo a journey of
understanding what it is

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:38.570
that she really wants to do in
this galaxy and how she wants

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:42.060
to contribute and to
let go of trying to live

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.090
up to another's legacy.

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:51.820
And for Kylo Ren, I don't know
what I want for him exactly.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:55.310
I think whatever happens
in the film I will like

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.460
and appreciate if
they do it well.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.240
I could see him dying, I
could see him being redeemed

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.090
and then dying, I could see
him going into exile as long

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.940
as they do it well, I'm for it.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:11.050
What I think will happen
if I'm trying to gauge

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.460
like chances here and there,

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.350
I think they will pull
a Vader with Kylo Ren.

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:19.200
I think that he will
be redeemed.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.240
He'll do some action
to help the resistance,

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:26.280
but then he will die following
the legacy of his grandfather

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.790
and potentially being welcomed
into the force ghost afterlife

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:33.280
by Luke, Kyoto, Obi-Wan
and Han again [laughter].

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.550
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: What music
is playing when that happens?

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.010
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Probably
The Force theme.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.270
They would definitely
play The Force theme.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.900
But honestly, as long
as Rey, Finn, Poe,

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.750
Rose and our resistance
heroes, as long as they get

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:50.520
to have their, you know,
shining moments in episode nine

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.440
and the story is really focused
on them and how they're going

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.060
to save the galaxy, I'm happy.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.360
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Thanks.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.410
So, one of the exciting
things I really enjoyed

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:04.140
about Solo was this discussion
or this nascent discussion

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:08.470
about droid rights, and I think
that really has a good potential

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:12.140
for a more neutral or a more
dispassionate discussion

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.460
about equality and
rights that we talked

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.370
about in the previous
discussion,

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:19.080
so I hope that continues
in the next movie.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.840
What do I see happening

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.270
after having just
finished the Thrawn novels?

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:32.020
Rey and Kylo Ren teaming up to
fight an invasion led by Thrawn

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:36.740
from the unknown regions and
Kylo Ren sacrificing himself

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.650
in the process to save Rey.

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.870
There we go.

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:42.840
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Well, I I said

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.990
that I though The Last Jedi
has been somewhat misunderstood

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:49.850
and to me part of what The Last
Jedi does incredibly well is

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:53.110
break the cycle of the Heroes
Journey or Monomyth all

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:55.980
of Joseph Campbell
that's drove so much

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.610
of Luke's own conceptions
of Star Wars,

00:45:58.610 --> 00:45:59.910
and I'm drawing here
a little bit

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:02.460
on a guy named Jeff Gomez who's
done a series of blog posts

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.500
about culturally we're
shifting from Heroes Journey

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.570
to a collective journey where
there are multiple protagonists,

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:12.040
multiple ways of
succeeding, multiple missions

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.180
and we form coalitions or
there's intersectionality

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.910
between characters

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:20.330
and characters can sometimes be
opposed and sometimes friends.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:23.710
So, the complexity of that
is part of what takes place

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.130
in The Last Jedi and
we see that pushback

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.390
and the hotshot masculinity
of just blowing

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:32.020
up things is not sufficient
that's put in its place

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.600
over the course of
the film which is one

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.390
of the many reasons why white
fan boys are often upset

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:40.460
by Last Jedi is that it
literally is saying you're not,

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:44.350
not only is the era of The Jedi
over, but the era of a kind

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:46.990
of masculine narrative
that's hero driven,

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:50.380
this has to give way to a
coalition centered narrative.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:54.560
So, I do think we're
going to see the coalition

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.740
of the new characters and
the passing of the torch.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.840
We already get it when Leia
says, who are you looking

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.490
at follow him at the end of
Jedi that that's a moment

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.790
of passing the torch that she
did, that Carrie Fisher did get

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:09.170
in while she was alive
and we can sort of see

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:11.920
that as a monumental
moment and we've built

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.710
across the three films
the passing of the torch

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:17.070
by each of those characters.

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.640
And on top of the joyride
thing, I would also point

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.040
to Rose's moment of
talking about animal rights,

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.740
because we have this
blurring of categories running

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.390
through Star Wars between
characters that are subhuman,

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:32.370
and I think Wookies are
treated and Ewoks are treated

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.390
as subhuman often in the
films and those characters

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:39.490
that are treated as animals
and the relations between them

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.030
and to some degree the poor
Chewbacca relationship sort

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:46.050
of starts to play with
that and Rose's moment

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:49.420
of rescuing the horse and
saying, or the creature.

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:50.720
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: The Fathier.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.360
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins:
Yes and saying free.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.660
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Nerd.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.420
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Is similarly
makes those questions open.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.300
So, we're now asking who
has rights in Star Wars

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.550
as we move toward a more
ensemble-based narrative

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.950
and less away from it
being a Skywalker saga.

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:07.250
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Seth?

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:09.110
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Ah, I'm
okay with us moving away

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.660
from the Skywalkers, but I
would just say that what the,

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.820
the most recent films have
done is they've been a way

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.050
to say goodbye to
the original heroes.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:22.150
Han Solo, Luke Skywalker
got really nice endings

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:25.820
and Leia deserved that and I
don't see anyway she's going

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:29.430
to get that now, and that
is, that's unfortunate

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.850
because she's deserving
of a good send off.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:35.220
I don't really know that
the right way to sort

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.170
of end that family's story.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.870
I had a, had a history
professor in college,

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:44.140
Slottman [phonetic] was his
name and he was always sort

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.440
of working, I don't know

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.410
if he ever finished it before he
passed away, but he was working

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:49.010
on some novel about
that he wanted

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:51.020
to call The Last
Haspur [phonetic].

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:54.000
And he just wanted just with
the last Haspur just advocating

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.140
getting in a limousine
and driving away.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:00.440
And it would be nice if the
last Skywalker could do that.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.740
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay, great.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:03.040
So, we're going to
go to the audience.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.340
Do we have a microphone?

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.610
Roswell has a microphone
if you raise your hand,

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.910
we'll take some questions.

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:12.950
&gt;&gt; So I like the prequels.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:15.570
I always have, but I
really fell in love

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:18.240
with the prequels even deeper
once I watched The Clone Wars.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.000
I thought that it
kind of enriched a lot

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.570
of the political
legal aspects of it.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.860
I mean, there's a court
scene in season five,

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.520
the Jedi they're immune

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.970
from prosecution while
they're a Jedi it's almost

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:32.010
like a ecclesiastical rights
you know in older times.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.590
Well, what was your
view of the politics

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:36.790
of specifically I
guess the prequels

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:38.210
in light of The Clone Wars?

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:39.700
Did that change for you?

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.000
Did that enrich you?

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.950
Like what was your view of that?

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:46.250
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: So, as someone

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:48.650
who watched The Clone
Wars only recently,

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.350
yeah it definitely enriched it.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:54.680
It, I love political dramas.

00:49:54.680 --> 00:50:00.700
Like for example, West Wing or
until the scumbag was removed,

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:05.830
House of Cards and yeah I find
it all really fascinating seeing

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:09.710
Padme, Bail Organa, Mon Mothma

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:13.400
and other senators
discuss the republics,

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:17.580
public health care
system; how does that work?

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.360
I have no idea.

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.260
But still, it's like really
fascinating to hear them talk

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:27.160
about the sort of
nuances of The Clone Wars.

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.690
You know, we've mentioned before
the line heroes on both sides,

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:34.530
there was actually an episode
of Clone Wars entitled Heroes

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:35.910
on Both Sides and it shows

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:39.030
that the separatists
are not just Count Dooku

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:42.990
and his scary looking
alien like in patriots.

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:45.570
It's or like the
commerce skilled.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:49.920
Like the [inaudible]
basically really bad metaphors

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.850
for East Asia as
a dominating force

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:56.680
that were even racially
tinged unfortunately.

00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:01.100
And like this episode showed
like yeah the separatists

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.830
as like just regular people.

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:05.630
planets that are
really dissatisfied

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:10.010
with the way the republic has
been run and why they're trying

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:13.000
to get out and what
rights they're seeking

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.400
and in this episode,
Padme goes with one

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.960
of our main characters Ahsoka

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.780
who is Anakin's apprentice
in The Clone Wars.

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.540
You might want if you're
interested, you might want

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.620
to check out this
series, and Ahsoka gets

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.270
to see hey these
aren't monsters.

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:31.560
These aren't our sworn enemies.

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.190
They're real people
with genuine grievances

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:37.610
and maybe we should hear them
out and maybe we can come

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:40.100
to a solution to this awful war.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.900
There are a lot of like episodes

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:45.780
like that throughout The Clone
Wars that deepen what each

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.380
of these individual
planets are going through.

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.250
It's not just in the
legislature, it's not just

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:54.420
in the senate, you actually see
what's happening to the people

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.650
and I, I; my relationship with
the prequels, I loved them

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.790
as kid, not so much growing up.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.500
I recognize them for
their many, many flaws.

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:05.780
But I really wish that
Clone Wars was the prequels.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.860
I really wish that we were
seeing these various planets

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.390
that Clone War showed
us in the actual films.

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:15.320
I think it would
have helped it a lot.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.670
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Can I
had something to that?

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:17.970
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Oh,
sure go ahead sorry.

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:19.460
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Actually
my favorite episode

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.190
of The Clone Wars series
is the trial of Ahsoka.

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:23.490
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: That
was so good.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.020
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.940
I mean, you get in
one not a court room,

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.530
I think it's the
headquarters of the Navy

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:34.150
because it's a military
trial a court-martial.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.110
You get in one room you
get Chancellor Palpatine,

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:39.020
you get Admiral talking at the
time and you get Pademe Amidala

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.290
and Ahsoka and I you
get Skywalker there

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:45.310
and for me that's a great scene

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:48.530
of just how different the
Jedi are from normal citizens

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:51.480
of the republic, but also just
how much power Palpatine is

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.930
exercising over the entire
political judicial process

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:57.660
by that point.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.760
&gt;&gt; You'll have to forgive
it's not very political,

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.020
but I just up or down on Jar
Jar and up or down on Rose?

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:05.320
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: On what?

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.620
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: What?

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.920
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: On?

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.220
&gt;&gt; Rose, Jar Jar and Rose?

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.520
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Oh.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.820
Down on Jar Jar,
but way up on Rose.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.120
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: I
have an interesting,

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.600
Ahmed Best who played Jar Jar
Binks was a guest on our podcast

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.000
and we had a long
discussion about this

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.260
and he posed a really
interesting challenge which was

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.660
that if, now I'm going
to lose his name,

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.040
Andy Serkis had played Jar Jar

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.190
and he had played Gollum
how would we respond

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.000
to those two characters?

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.280
And he was talking about Gollum
slathering on rocks and talking

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.250
about Master and so forth.

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:39.890
It would be politically
incredibly awkward

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:42.360
and difficult to imagine that.

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.090
The problem is I can't imagine
Andy Serkis being given the

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:48.750
lines that Jar Jar was
given in that film.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.020
Right? And watching it
again he sort of sold me

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.380
in the conversation,

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.970
but watching the film prequels
again, I just can't get there.

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:56.270
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Yeah, yeah for sure.

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:58.450
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: It is a
deeply problematic character.

00:53:58.450 --> 00:53:59.750
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yes.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:01.050
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: It's
that shows Lucas's roots

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:04.190
and menstrual humor of
the 40s and so forth.

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:07.290
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah, the
way Jar Jar was portrayed

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:09.600
and was not the best to be sure.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.400
So, I just wanted to like say
another note of that Ahmed Best.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:18.750
It was actually revealed
recently that he went

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.950
through era of depression after
the Phantom Menace with all

00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:25.090
of the Phantom discourse around
his character and, you know,

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:28.370
let's remember that these
are actors just doing a job

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:31.060
and it's the writers who
have created these things

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:34.780
that we may detest, so you
know, with all due respect

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.640
to Ahmed Best and of the; he
really did put incredible work

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.580
into the character even though
he don't really like him

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.670
that much, Jar Jar that is.

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:44.760
So, you know, with
all due respect to him

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.060
and everything he's
been through,

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.840
I'm going to give Jar
Jar a thumbs down,

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.810
but on the other
character of Rose Tico,

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:54.760
I give her again a
stratospheric thumbs up.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.060
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yes.

00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.360
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: I will
say though about Rose

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.510
and I love Rose as a character,
I wish they didn't have

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.320
that kiss in Last Jedi.

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.220
It just, it was completely
out of place in my opinion.

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.530
That's it.

00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:09.580
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: I yeah,
you probably said enough

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:13.320
about Jar Jar, just but
I'm a big fan of Rose.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.500
I, in particular her I
thought her contribution

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.180
to The Last Jedi just
saying you know it's not

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:22.480
about the bad people
we kill it's

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:24.480
about the good people we
save, that kind of turned

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.640
in many ways the entire
franchise on its head

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.300
in a really helpful way.

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.350
So, you know, if she
does nothing else,

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:32.630
I think that would be, that's an
important character right there.

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:34.140
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: And if we
want to talk about characters,

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.530
who actors who have
been harassed.

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:36.830
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yes.

00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:38.130
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins:
That's the latest.

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:39.430
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yes.

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:40.730
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins:
Story on harassment

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:43.360
where angry white fan boy rage
has just torn her life apart.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.680
But yeah, I think the
introduction of sisterhood

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.830
as a motif in the story is
another step toward decentering

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:53.040
the male narrative and
emphasizing other kinds

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.500
of relationships and we only
saw her sister very briefly

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.660
in the opening of The Last Jedi,
it's a really powerful sequence

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:02.850
of the scene them play with
her medal that goes back

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:06.180
to the sister I think
is particularly strong.

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.010
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: Yeah, the sister
does play a more important role

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:09.310
in normalization.

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:14.440
But a for me, Rose was important
in a strange way for me

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:18.460
because growing up as a white
British male, I you know,

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:20.520
I never had any problems
finding heroes

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.520
that looked me on the screen.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.930
But I'm now, I'm married
to a Korean American

00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:27.230
with a mixed race daughter

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:29.900
and for the first time I
had a real visceral sense

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.020
of just how important it was for
someone like my young daughter

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:36.280
to see someone that looked like
her on the screen and realize

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.650
that she could also immolate
this hero role that's played

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:40.950
in the movie.

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:42.390
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay, we
have time for one more question.

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:43.690
Go ahead.

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:47.680
&gt;&gt; Very simple question;
favorite light-saver fight?

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.050
Favorite light-saver fight.

00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:50.600
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Oh,
favorite light-saver fight.

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:51.990
Good question.

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:54.730
&gt;&gt; Seth Masket: Oh, can I?

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:56.250
Phantom Menace.

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.560
Yeah, not a good
film, but man is

00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.730
that a good light-saver
scene and, in fact, I,

00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:04.020
I'll argue that light-saver
scene actually makes the case

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.700
for the film better than
the film does [laughter].

00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:09.600
It's actually, it's
well-thought through.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.060
It's beautifully choreographed.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:14.190
The whole story of the
light-saver fight is

00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:17.660
that you know you have these
two Jedi who are supposed

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.110
to work together, but they're,

00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:21.950
and you have Darth
Maul basically trying

00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:23.780
to tar them apart, even
though he can't beat them

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.760
if they're working together,
so he's constantly trying

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.570
to draw one away from the other.

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:32.080
You see, you know, sometimes
they're trying to do sort

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.150
of innovative moves that kind
of fail and I think it's,

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:37.590
and you see the very
different Jedi versus set style

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:39.100
that absolutely beautiful.

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:41.000
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: And Jewel of
the Duel of the Fates the score

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.410
to the, it's mind blowing.

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:44.710
Mind blowing.

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:46.010
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: Yeah, and
when I said earlier that,

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:48.400
when I said earlier I didn't
want to interview the cast,

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.470
I also seen the trailer in
fairness the very first trailer

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:55.500
of Star Wars didn't have John
Williams' music attached to it.

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.100
&gt;&gt; Henry Jenkins: So, imagine
how different it would be

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.450
to experience Star Wars
without Williams' music.

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:01.750
&gt;&gt; Swara Salih: Yeah,

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:05.350
George Lucas called it the
secret sauce of Star Wars once.

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:07.940
Yeah, mine is actually
Return of the Jedi.

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:12.950
I think it's a very
emotionally charged beautifully

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:16.750
choreographed, beautifully
shot light-saver battle

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:19.520
between this father and
son who are battling

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.220
for each other's souls
effectively and you can tell

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:24.910
that it's not just that
they're light-savers

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:28.900
that are clashing even
if it is done very well,

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.990
it's their emotions,
it's their thoughts,

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:34.830
it's like they're projecting
telepathically to each other

00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:36.770
and Mark Hamill's expressions

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:39.580
and even Vader's expressions
even though he's in a mask,

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.930
it's like this is the fact
that I love about Darth Vader,

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:43.240
it's like you can always feel,

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.380
you can always tell what
he's thinking or feeling just

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.680
by looking at him and he's

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:51.060
like it's just the
same mask, but anyway.

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:54.700
Anyway, it I really love it.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.430
It's a been one of my favorites,

00:58:56.430 --> 00:59:00.650
it is my favorite basically my
whole life and it means a lot

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:02.670
to me, like in everything
it portrays.

00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:04.370
&gt;&gt; Bill Davies: For me
it's Revenge of the Sith.

00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:07.480
It's the two brothers
fighting, I just,

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.860
thinking about that
opening dialogue and then

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:14.860
when they start fighting, just
I got goose pimples right now.

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.160
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Alright.

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.050
Well, join me in
thanking everybody here

00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:20.510
on this panel today.

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:26.560
[ Applause ]

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:30.010
So, once again please join us
for Empire Strikes Back outside

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:33.440
in the North lawn at 7:30 and
then Return of the Jedi tomorrow

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:37.080

Thank you.
