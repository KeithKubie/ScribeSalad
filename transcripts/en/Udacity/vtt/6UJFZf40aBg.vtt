00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now I have a really challenging piece of software for you.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I would like you to augment this to print something entirely different,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which is the final solution.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is nothing to do with expand,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and you have to implement a new delta structure for this similar to expand.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Here is the output I would like to see.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
There is an arrow to the right, which is the optimal action to take in this cell over here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Again, this is ambiguous.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There might be a different optimal action that is equally good,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but my software picked the one to the right.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Here I want to go down.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This little v over here is an arrow down.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
An arrow to the right again, an arrow to the right, an arrow to the right,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
an arrow to the right, down, down, down.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In the end we find a star, which indicates the location of the goal.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let me modify the maze.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm closing up the wall over here, opening the wall down here, run it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here is my policy.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You can see in the grid this is the only way to make it to the grid over here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You should write for me a piece of software that outputs this specific thing over here.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Part of this is the delta name that I kind of brushed over before.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
These four symbols over here are the ones being used

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to indicate arrows to the top, left, down, and right.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
They correspond to the four actions over here: go up, left, down, and right.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So use those over here to print out the table over here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's very, very nontrivial to write this, as you will find out.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
In the end it's not much code, but you have to carefully think about how to cache actions

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and how to assign them to this table over here.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So take a while; do it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's challenging.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If you fail, not a big deal.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You can completely understand how the lecture works and not sure of the code

00:01:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
once you hit the submit button, and you move on.
