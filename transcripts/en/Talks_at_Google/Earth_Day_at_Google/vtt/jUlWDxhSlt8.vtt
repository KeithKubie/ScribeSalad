[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:05.640
MENG: Good morning, my friends.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.230
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.990
For those who do not
know me, my name is Meng.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.360
For those who know me,
my name is still Meng.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.020
The reason I told this joke
is about, I don't know,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.687
many years ago--

00:00:16.687 --> 00:00:17.561
MATTHIEU RICARD: Yes.

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.920
MENG: In 2007 or something,
back when even I was young,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.280
yeah, we did this together.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.500
I told this joke.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.610
Yeah, I told this joke.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.540
He still remembers.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.115
So, which is why, I
told this joke again.

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:31.260
Yeah, we are very
funny together.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.700
I think the last joke we
told each other was just now.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.410
So we talk about
changing the world.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.830
And he says, yeah, because
of you, the north and south

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.590
are switched.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.145
And I said, no, North and South
Pole are still the same, East

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:42.945
and West Pole, different.

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:44.320
MATTHIEU RICARD:
A very good one.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.000
MENG: Good one.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.580
Anyway, you all know Matthieu as
the happiest man in the world.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.659
But every time you say that,
Matthieu gets embarrassed.

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:57.700
So please don't say that.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.650
Please do not say
Matthieu Ricard is

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.340
the happiest man in the world.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.250
I repeat, do not
say, Matthiew Ricard

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.086
is the happiest
man in the world.

00:01:04.086 --> 00:01:05.290
MATTHIEU RICARD: Don't
think of a white bear.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.790
MENG: Don't think
of the white bear.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.620
Jokes aside, I'm so happy
to have you, my dear friend.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.082
Matthieu is, in my opinion,
a true gem in this world.

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:20.040
MATTHIEU RICARD: It is
getting worse and worse.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.720
MENG: It's getting worse, right.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.602
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:23.560
MENG: By the way, in the
email I sent them out,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.092
I call you a saint.

00:01:25.092 --> 00:01:26.800
MATTHIEU RICARD: Now
it's time to retire.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.556
MENG: He's a gem
for many reasons.

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:32.930
I think one of
the big reasons is

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.840
because he is the
best person who

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.120
is bridging East and West,
the best of ancient wisdom,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.850
Eastern wisdom with the
best of Western science.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.070
Because he has a PhD
in molecular genetics

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.390
under a Nobel Laureate
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.930
Yes, [INAUDIBLE], yes.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.500
I almost got it.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.144
And after his PhD, he
decided to become a monk.

00:01:57.144 --> 00:01:58.810
MATTHIEU RICARD: Not
immediately, right?

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.850
MENG: Not immediately, yeah.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.808
He said, when I grow up,
I'm going to be a monk

00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:02.670
and then he did.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.250
And then, he was
under the tutelage

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.070
of at least two
Tibetan masters--

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.630
two great masters, Kangyur
Rinpoche and Dilgo Khyentse

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.540
Rinpoche, yes?

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.560
And he has 60,000 hours
of meditation training

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.646
right now, thereabouts,
give or take 10,000.

00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:19.670
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.961
MENG: Yeah, what's 10,000
hours between friends, right?

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.840
And when I met you,
I think you were

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.740
the first person with
10,000 of meditation

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.990
able to be in an fMRI machine.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.460
You could be the person
to have spent the longest

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.920
time in an fMRI machine.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.460
MATTHIEU RICARD:
That's possible.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.210
MENG: Yes, contributed
greatly to science.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.609
And because he speaks the
language of East and West,

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.900
he speaks French, he speaks
English, he speaks science,

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.930
and he speaks Tibetan,
and he speaks wisdom.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.870
He's everything.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.340
And, on top of that, Matthieu
is a humanitarian leader,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.720
tireless, working for the world,
trying to feed hungry people,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.110
teach the illiterate.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.620
And, on top of that,
in person, if you ever

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.730
have an unrealistic expectation
about what a holy man should

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.330
be like, unrealistic,
unreasonable,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.427
he meets those expectations.

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:15.260
He's spoiling the market
for everybody else.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.765
So it's wonderful to
have you in this world--

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:23.890
MATTHIEU RICARD: Thank you.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.092
MENG: --and in Google.

00:03:25.092 --> 00:03:27.050
And my friends, please
welcome Matthieu Ricard.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.946
MATTHIEU RICARD: Thank you.

00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:29.894
Thank you.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.140
Thank you so much to
everyone here at Google.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.270
I'm so happy to be here, back
for the first-- third time.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.145
And since Meng likes
to make the same jokes,

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:46.790
at 10 years interval,
I recall also

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.140
that last time, he said that
since Google didn't exist

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.380
in 1967 when I
first went to India,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.110
so besides entering Google,
the next best thing I could do

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.800
is to spend 45 years
in the Himalayas.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.560
So I'm really happy to be back.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.610
Last time was a
talk on happiness.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.060
I find happiness pretty
boring, and especially,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.167
because the risk
is that we will try

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.500
to look for selfish happiness,
which is not only boring,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.200
but which is a
recipe for failure.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.420
And I want to say why.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.459
Because there are people,
smart philosophers,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.030
who make big statements.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.600
We, as sentient
beings, our main goal

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.380
is to live the full
span of our life.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.830
I mean, for those who
find taste in life.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.310
It's OK.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.870
Good.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.601
And therefore,
during this life, we

00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:39.100
are entitled to
look for well-being,

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.370
and flourishing of happiness.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.260
Oh, great.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.080
That sounds OK, so far.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.610
Therefore we should be selfish--
big, logical, and experiential

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.060
mistake.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.370
The idea that, well, if
you really want to survive,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.540
really want to be happy,
everyone for themselves,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.350
and we have a good
chance to achieve that.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.960
Why is that
fundamentally flawed?

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.480
First of all, on the
purely experiential aspect,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.250
if you think someone
who's thinking me,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.200
me, me, all day long, there's
a very miserable situation,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.230
because you feel so vulnerable.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.230
Anything that will be said
in terms of praise or blame,

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.130
of gain or loss, the
whole world becomes

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.370
either a potential threat
or some kind of instrument

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.300
that you hope to use to
maximize that selfish happiness.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.580
So then it's a completely
unbalanced situation.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.180
The world is not a
mail order catalog

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.090
for your desires, your
fancies, your hopes and fears.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.240
Plus, on top of that, within
the bubble of self-centeredness,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.760
it's pretty stuffy to
live in that bubble.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.680
And everything takes
huge proportions.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.950
It's like a storm
in a glass of water,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.900
and everything that
happens unsettles you.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.620
If you put a handful of salt in
this glass, it's undrinkable.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.110
Put it in a big
lake, no big deal.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.160
Put it in the ocean, you won't
even notice the difference.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.070
So a very narrow mind of me,
me, me is not very pleasant.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.470
And, of course, you will be a
pain to almost everyone that's

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.970
around you.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.840
But the other reason is why
it doesn't work is even,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.410
I would say, deeper.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.270
It's basically because it
puts you at odds with reality.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.320
You would assume, maybe I don't
have anything against others,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.960
but it's not my job.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.110
So let's try to
build my happiness

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.060
in that little bubble.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.570
It's easier if it's
only about my happiness,

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.930
not about everyone's happiness.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.436
How can I think of that?

00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:39.310
So I have nothing against
others being happy,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.030
but it's not my job.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.470
So that supposes that
we could function

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.800
as an independent bubble.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.040
And we would be some
kind of separate entity

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.220
from the rest of the
world of reality.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.569
But if you look at the
white sheet of paper,

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.110
the first thing you
could write on it

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.280
is others, others, others,
others, others others.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.446
I have a friend who teaches
at Harvard, Greg Norris.

00:07:03.446 --> 00:07:08.030
He studies how many things
are implicated and produced

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.880
in a white sheet of paper?

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.110
30 nations.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.999
A white sheet of paper
in France, white one.

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:15.540
There's wood that
comes from Finland.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.116
There's starch of potato
comes from Czechoslovakia.

00:07:18.116 --> 00:07:19.740
And then, of course,
the guy in Finland

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.470
and the whole history with his
grandparents and everything.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.750
So suddenly, the whole
thing-- others, others, others

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.950
are present in everything.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.870
So our happiness, our suffering
are so intimately intermingled

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.220
to this interdependence,
to the idea that we

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.460
could function as a separate
entity is bound to misfunction.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:45.020
Now if you look experientially
at the state of mind that

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:50.320
is full of warmheartedness,
benevolence, kindness,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.410
consideration, care,
empathy, altruistic love,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.570
wishing everyone
happiness, compassion.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.420
That means the wish
that they may cease

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.280
to suffer when they suffer.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.070
So these are the most
fulfilling states of mind.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.195
We need to remember, a
particularly filling time

00:08:09.195 --> 00:08:12.490
in our life is really a time of
unconditional love for a child

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.190
or for someone.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.840
Even the founders of
positive psychology,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.260
like Barbara
Frederickson, called love

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.960
in the sense of
positive resonance

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.640
with others the supreme emotion.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.279
Because among all
positive emotions,

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:28.320
it's the one that broadens
more your perspective,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.800
your way of seeing others.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.130
So first, it feels good.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.600
And, of course, if you are
warm, people usually like it.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.090
Even dogs would like
to stand next to you.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.120
They will sort of sense that
you are a good, nice person

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.309
to be with.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:45.370
And then it's also functional.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.230
Why?

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.600
Because then it is attuned
to the interdependence.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.010
If you realize that when
you wake up in the morning,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.551
I don't want to
suffer the whole day,

00:08:53.551 --> 00:08:55.250
and if possible, my whole life.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.690
And then it's not very
difficult to put yourself

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.690
in someone's mind.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.980
And so even if the
person is confused,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.810
doing exactly the
opposite what that person

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.018
should do to find well-being.

00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:07.790
But still, basically
do not want to suffer.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.560
So then that common humanity,
that common sentience,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.680
I would say, with other
sentient beings, like animals,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.040
creates this feeling
of interdependence,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.290
of the common wish to escape
suffering and find flourishing,

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.790
and therefore, if you value
your own wish for happiness,

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.895
how can you not value, and
therefore, be concerned?

00:09:26.895 --> 00:09:32.400
At least not neglect, or
disregard, or use an instrument

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.350
in a way that wish of others to
escape suffering and be happy.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.262
So on the individual
level, I think

00:09:39.262 --> 00:09:41.220
the pursuit of selfishness,
if it doesn't work,

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.150
the other one is
bound to succeed.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.280
But now, if we take the
little bit global picture

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.210
to see why this
notion of altruism

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:54.090
is something more than the
kind of noble utopia, some kind

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.310
of luxury that we could afford
when everything goes well.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.720
And people say, at
times of catastrophe--

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.930
and actually, we
could see in Nepal,

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.130
in every major catastrophe
of any kind, how

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.560
the first thing that happened
after the initial shock

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.100
of whatever might be--
a bomb or, in that case,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.690
an earthquake-- how
people got calm,

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:21.300
organized, incredible
solidarity, helping each other,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.580
bringing people to hospital.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.959
Most of the work is done
by local populations.

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:27.000
The rescuers, they come,
and they help with dogs,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.833
and stuff like that.

00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:31.650
But 95% of all that work
is not about looting,

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.140
is not about doing
terrible things.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:38.440
This is always, again and again,
the same pattern that occurs.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.290
So there's a hope that we
have that within our self,

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.550
and we can enhance that.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.800
So why in the global
picture is it so important?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.940
So if you think of the
situation of the world,

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:57.950
we are often, in the old days,
kind of being on the edge.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.086
And we could be in our own life.

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:01.960
We have to deal with
our mind, to begin with,

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.180
from morning till evening.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.750
And that mind can be your best
friend or your worst enemy.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.440
I mean, when people suffer
terribly within themselves,

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.710
even they are living
in a little paradise,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.490
it's the product, the
working of the mind.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.180
Those ruminations,
hopes, and fears

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.670
that lead to depression,
to despair is mind-made.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.590
And then, you can see people who
keep their joy of leaving even

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:32.270
in the face of seemingly
very adverse circumstances.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.809
So the power of
the mind-- it's not

00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:35.600
that we should neglect
our outer condition.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.100
And the last one
who would say that,

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.950
because I try to dedicate at
least a good part of my life

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.410
to-- we helped 41,000
people over last month

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.110
in the earthquake
area of 160 villages,

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.960
so the idea of remaining
to poverty, to whatever we

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.550
could do to improve others'
conditions, that's for granted.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.040
But, at the same time, we tend
to neglect the inner condition

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.920
for flourishing.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.400
And I'm fundamentally
convinced that altruistic love

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.530
is one of the main
contributors of that cluster

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.241
of human quality that leads
to well-being and flourishing.

00:12:11.241 --> 00:12:12.240
But there is challenges.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.390
There are challenges in society.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.530
There are plenty of
people who live in poverty

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.290
in the midst of plenty.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:26.050
And then, so we have all
these challenges in our lives.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.320
But if we look at
those challenges,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.660
basically, one of the most
serious ones in our times

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.480
is the difficulty we have to
reconcile three times scales.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.214
There is the short
term of the economy.

00:12:39.214 --> 00:12:40.630
Of course, the
economy says we are

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.410
making 10 years, 20 years plan.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.480
But nobody will buy bonds
that will mature in 100 years.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.860
And basically, if it's
not one day to the other,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.050
coming and going up
at the stock market,

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.800
it's the end of the month, the
end of the year balance sheet.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.200
That's what matters.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.370
If you turn to economies,
you should be altruistic.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.580
That's great, but that's not
what the economy is about.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.820
So there is this question
of the short term.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.600
And people say, if the
economy flourishes,

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.860
everything else will go
along as a sort of byproduct.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.640
But the fact is, you could be
in the most powerful and richest

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.580
nation and still, if people feel
miserable, what's the point?

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.400
So the idea that happiness
will come out of GDP

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.825
has been already shown
to be just a fallacy.

00:13:22.825 --> 00:13:25.090
It doesn't work like that.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:30.100
Then we have the midterm
in terms of time frame.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:30.840
That is what?

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.210
That is your life.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:36.950
That is a career, a family,
a generation, your lifetime.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.980
So how do you measure
that satisfaction,

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.260
or that sense of fulfillment,
or accomplishment?

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.220
First of all is
what is the quality

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.190
of life moment after moment?

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.390
How do you experience at
the working place, when

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.270
you study, when you
engage with others,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.920
what do you see deep within?

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.040
Sadness?

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.410
Despair?

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.810
Or joy to do what you do?

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:02.140
And then, if you look at 10
years, how rewarding was that?

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.400
How fulfilling was that?

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.740
I remember when I was doing
the book on happiness,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.430
meeting someone in Hong Kong.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.420
We said, 20 years ago, I
wanted to get $1 million.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.800
Now I've got $10 million, and
I wasted 20 years of my life,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.310
It's not that just the
pursuit of that, per se,

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.340
is wasting your life.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.130
But he found that it
has no meaning for him.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.116
So we need to get some kind
of satisfaction in our life.

00:14:25.116 --> 00:14:25.740
That's obvious.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.830
Otherwise, what's
the point going on?

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.706
But then there's
a new challenge.

00:14:29.706 --> 00:14:31.080
And, of course,
you guessed what.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.470
It's the long term.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.000
And that new challenge
is our impact

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.270
on the future generation.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.720
And that's new why?

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.810
10,000 years ago, there was
one to five million people

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.120
on earth.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.640
They could not do much damage.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.720
I mean, whether they were
doing, the earth's resilience

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.770
will repair that instantly.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.170
And then when came the
Industrial Revolution,

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.020
scientific technological
revolution,

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.040
giving us a
thousandfold more power

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.040
to influence our
environment, nobody

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.720
decided to ransack the planet.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.580
Therefore, we don't feel
individually responsible.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.070
Plus it's a certain timespan.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.130
Plus it's not really
visible day after day.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.270
It's visible on the longer term.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.150
And we are equipped
emotionally by evolution

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.430
to react to images of danger.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.500
If I said, there's
a rhinoceros coming

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.030
full-speed from this
door, everybody runs.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.810
If I said, there will be
a rhinoceros in 30 years,

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.840
everyone says, so what?

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.680
So in the '60s, '70s, when the
first data about global warming

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.800
came out, those scientists
went to the White House

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.202
and they told the
advisors, in 50 years,

00:15:38.202 --> 00:15:39.410
it's going to be a real mess.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.368
So they went, all right,
come back in 49 years.

00:15:41.368 --> 00:15:42.830
We'll see.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.370
But that's not the
way to proceed,

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.230
because 49 years will
be much too late.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.870
The tipping points
will have occurred,

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.749
and then we don't
see that happen.

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.790
A friend of mine, who is
a great environmentalist

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.880
says, if CO2 could
be pink, and we

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.090
saw the sky becoming
pinker every day,

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.770
we'd worry a little bit more.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.130
So it's hard to feel
it in one's flesh.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:07.590
But yet, it is absolutely
true that no matter how

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:10.700
complex scientifically,
politically, economically,

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.550
the question of
the environment is,

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.950
it is a matter of
selfishness versus altruism.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.410
I'm a Marxist.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.500
Not worry, not the Karl
tendency, the Groucho tendency.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.440
So Groucho said, why should I
care for future generations?

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.004
What did they do for me?

00:16:28.004 --> 00:16:29.780
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.340
But unfortunately, I heard
a serious version of it

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.370
by a US billionaire
saying on Fox News--

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.140
and maybe you heard of
that, Fox-- he says,

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.190
about the rising of
the oceans, which

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.640
is happening three millimeters
every year, no matter what.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.390
He says, I find absurd to change
my behavior now for something

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.340
that will happen in 100 years.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.230
So after me, never mind.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.840
So we won't be
there in 100 years.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.890
Maybe some of you, if you
live 120, or something.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.770
But, of course, there will
be billions and billions

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.600
of people who will say, you
knew, and yet, you did nothing.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.260
So it's not a trivial matter.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.790
And people say,
well, we'll adapt.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.550
Yes, of course, 200
million climate refugees,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.750
the wars because
of that, terrible

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.190
devastation, two, four,
six degree increase,

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.700
a complete upheaval
on the planet.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.420
We might adapt, but at the
cost of how much suffering?

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:27.020
So that's for, again, question
of altruism versus selfishness.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.640
So now, you'll get,
environmentally

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.302
speaking with economists,
this schizophrenic dialogue.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.760
They don't speak
the same language,

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.192
because someone
said in 50 years,

00:17:35.192 --> 00:17:36.400
you're going to get all that.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.608
And they say, no, I'm
interested in the balance sheet

00:17:38.608 --> 00:17:39.970
at the end of the year.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.900
So we need a common
concept, at least

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.330
of a platform of discussion.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.710
Over the last 10
years, I've been

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.620
going around meeting all
kinds of wonderful people,

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.620
psychologists,
environmentalists,

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.040
social workers,
spiritual men and women

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.990
of wisdom and compassion.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.430
I was seven times a day at
the World Economic Forum,

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.630
all kinds of weird places
for Buddhist monks.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.790
And yet, the common
thing, the only concept

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.670
that emerged through that,
and which I spent five or six

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.900
years researching for this
book, is a simple one-- having

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.790
more consideration for others.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.740
It's no rocket science.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.490
If you have more
consideration for others,

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:21.430
which is the
definition of altruism,

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.880
an intentional motivation
to benefit others,

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.580
full stop-- of course,
we have other thoughts

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.639
from time to time.

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:28.930
There's no question about that.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.800
Selfishness does
exist, but we do

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.680
have moments where we do
think in the altruistic way.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.310
So if you have more
consideration for others,

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.020
for sure, you will have
a more caring economics.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.700
That can be made into two
things that homo economicus,

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.900
maximizing their personal
preference cannot do,

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.110
poverty in the midst of plenty.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.720
The homo economicus would
never resolve that question.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.210
And the common goods, quality
of the air, of the atmosphere,

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.990
of democracy, of
all these things

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.710
that we can have in common,
but you could easily

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.920
be a free rider, do nothing
for that, and still benefit.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.040
But you need to step out of
maximizing personal interest

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.300
to take care of the environment.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.500
So we need caring economies.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.120
Then we need to work on
gross national happiness.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.620
I mean, provide better
conditions at the working

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.050
place, in education,
in transport,

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.290
everything that makes a
life that can be fulfilled.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.600
And then we need to care
for our future generations.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.600
So that concept at
least allows people

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.440
to come together, have a common
platform for a better world.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:37.295
So to illustrate that, we have
this idea of this limit here.

00:19:37.295 --> 00:19:38.670
And, of course,
if you say, well,

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.820
let's go on using all
the resources we have.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.260
At the current rate of
increasing of using resources,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.370
by 2050, we'll
need three planets.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.240
We don't have them?

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.110
It's, again, no rocket science.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.890
Still, people say, let's go
on, let's go on, let's go on.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.150
So let's go on is
like this president,

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.065
who about 10 years ago,
speaking about his country,

00:19:59.065 --> 00:20:01.650
he said, five years ago, we were
at the edge of the precipice.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.680
Now we made a big step forward.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.950
So you see what happens if this
guy makes a big step forward.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:12.290
So that's called illimited
material quantitative growth.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.520
It cannot work forever.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.470
So what does that
line correspond to

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.710
in terms of science?

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.290
So here we go to what some
scientists have defined

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.675
as the planetary boundaries.

00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:29.550
Well, we were in the Holocene,
a period of exceptional climate

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.030
stability for 12,000 years.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.470
It more or less
ended in the 1950s,

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:38.310
entering the Anthropocene, the
age of where human beings have

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.790
the major impact on the planet.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:44.990
So in 1900s, we were well
within the limit of safety.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.600
And safety means
we could actually

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.640
continue to prosper for
another 50,000 years, most

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.280
likely without big
upheavals, if we

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.680
were to keep those factors
within the limits of safety.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.650
And you can see them.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.480
That's what the main
most important--

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.460
they are quite related.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.640
If you increase CO2, you
will increase the acidity

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.560
of the ocean, and so forth.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.540
Now 1950 comes, so-called
the Great Acceleration.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.560
Some of those factors
are looming now

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.660
to be more looking
like dangerous.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.370
Now, hold your
breath, not too long.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.980
But imagine the next slide.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.460
And here we are.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.070
We have vastly overgone some
of the limits of safety.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.570
To give you one idea,
a very clear picture

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.530
of the loss of biodiversity,
at the current rate,

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.990
today, of losing
species forever--

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.380
it's not just diminishing,
or something-- losing them.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.650
In 2050, we will have lost 30%
of all species on the earth.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.360
And it will go on,
of course, over 2050.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.630
That would be the
sixth major extinction

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.070
since the apparition of
life on earth, the fifth one

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.750
being that of dinosaurs
and many other species.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.170
So that's not a small thing.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.150
And everyone will be
deeply affected, of course.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.330
So that's something
that we cannot ignore.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.390
It's coming very soon.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.050
This will be your children, your
grandchildren, and so forth.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.570
So what can we do about that?

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.380
Well, we could sit
like that, as I

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.890
do, in front of the Himalayas,
waiting for the glaciers

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:16.340
to melt. I have seen them
melting over the last 45 years,

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.550
before we had never
heard of global warming.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.490
Tibetans and Nepalese say
that, that they cannot only go

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.526
for one month over the ice in
the winter with their yaks,

00:22:24.526 --> 00:22:26.150
where they used to
go for three months.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:27.761
So it's, again, very clear.

00:22:27.761 --> 00:22:28.260
Why?

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.650
Because of this
Great Acceleration.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.190
Here's the loss of
biodiversity, of water use.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.860
And an interesting
one is methane.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.730
You say, why, methane?

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.450
Methane now come
mostly from livestock.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.030
The use of livestock
for meat production

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.150
has become now the
second major factor

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.605
of greenhouse gas effect.

00:22:46.605 --> 00:22:49.100
That may seem strange,
but that's the case.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.420
According to IPCC and
[INAUDIBLE] report,

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.420
after the habitations and
before transportation,

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.900
before the cows, the
planes, the sheep,

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.705
it is the whole
chain of production

00:22:59.705 --> 00:23:00.580
from meat production.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.650
That may seem strange, but it
is the case, 14% or 15% of that.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.180
And that's used
mostly to maintain

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.830
emission besides deforestations
and the other things.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.630
So methane is 20
times more active

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.170
than CO2 for
greenhouse gas effect.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:19.740
And that shows because of this
extreme level of consumption,

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:24.430
120 kilos of meat in
USA, 80 in Europe, only 3

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.850
in India, per head,
per habitant, per year.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.090
It's about 7 in Africa.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.910
Luxembourg has the
world record, 137 kilos.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.400
We don't know exactly why.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.760
That, of course, comes at
a price, an ethical price.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.910
there's about 65 billion land
animals killed every year.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:45.750
1,000 billion--
that's 1 trillion sea

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.590
animals for our consumption.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.950
Ethical problem,
but not only that.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.780
I mean, we do that
in all kinds of ways.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.830
And is it because
we are so selfish?

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.280
Because man is a wolf or man?

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.650
Well, of course some--
and first of all,

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.260
wolves are quite nice,
sociable animals.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.450
They're very sweet social
life, and the best friend

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.060
of man, dog, comes actually,
as you know, from wolves.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.030
So it's not a very
good comparison.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.580
But say, of course,
there are people

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.060
who manifest terrible cruelty.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:19.180
But the idea that we're all like
that, that's the big mistake.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.230
Is it true?

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.540
Look at this nice kid.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.620
It doesn't seem that is that
much of cruelty, at least,

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.930
potentially.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.400
And then we could also think
that we are psychologically

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.750
wired like that.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.840
Like Freud, we're to think
that we're all "rascals."

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.930
So if that was the case, that's
a good start in life, isn't it?

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.270
But is it really this case?

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:39.820
I know this guy for
quite some time.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.420
He doesn't look too
bad, to me, at least.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.770
And then if you look at
people, what is the greatest

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.660
joy than to cooperate?

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.960
Where I live in
Bhutan and Nepal,

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.760
like here in this Amish
community in the United States,

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.220
when time comes to build
a house, everybody comes.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.940
And not only you build
a house, but it's

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.070
[INAUDIBLE] celebrating,
of making a feast,

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.580
of being together.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.810
And it's well-known
that hunter-gatherers,

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.380
the main factor
of social life was

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.090
an equalitarian
cooperative community.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.940
And that's the great
joy of doing that.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.360
And not only human
beings do that.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.860
And someone said, please tell
them there's no photoshopping.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.530
That is the real thing.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.530
So then, also, we know what
is the struggle for life?

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.940
The survival of the fittest.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.670
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.890
MATTHIEU RICARD: But,
yes, that is true.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.560
But if you read
Darwin, first of all,

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.550
the survival of the fittest
is not Darwin's formula.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.200
It's Herbert Spencer,
the bulldog of Darwin.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.010
And that led rise
to social Darwinism,

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.690
like Enron type of competitions.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.390
But Darwin spoke so much
more about cooperation.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.790
He even considered
the possibility

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.610
of extending benevolence
to others and your kin

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.450
and even to other species.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.580
That's very clearly
expressed in Darwin.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.770
And I was really inspired
by discovering all that

00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:59.980
in Darwin's writing.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.355
In addition to that, the most
recent trend in evolution,

00:26:03.355 --> 00:26:06.160
like works of Martin
Nowak at Harvard,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.570
or the book "SuperCooperators,"
of [INAUDIBLE], that completely

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.280
changed his views about that, is
that yes, there is competition.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.390
Of course, we know that.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.540
I mean, there's no
need to write a book

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:20.950
in defense of selfishness,
or hurrah competition.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.340
But to show that--
and that's what

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.470
they have shown-- that even
though competition doubtlessly

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.500
exists, that cooperation
has been much more

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.820
creative throughout evolution to
go from one step of complexity

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.470
to another, from monocellular
to multicellular,

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.830
to different kinds of
symbiosis between animals,

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.010
up to social animals.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.380
So it is quite the case.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.370
And there was a survey
from the OECD in the 36

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.820
or so developed countries
proposing 10 factors that

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.910
would contribute to
well-being and asking people

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.190
what they thought about it.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.110
Income comes around
rank number six.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.060
So what's the matter
about the income?

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.891
Number one was quality
of human relationships.

00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:02.890
That's what people said.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:04.390
This makes the
biggest difference

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.450
to the quality of their
life in the family,

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.240
at work, in the social place.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.210
Do we feel trust?

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.970
Do we feel safe, and so forth?

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:16.070
So again, this is not only
reserved to human beings,

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.830
because we got that through
millions of years of evolution.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.670
If we have some quality, they
didn't come out of the blue.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.250
And if you look at the hotspots
for centenerians in the world,

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.815
like there's one
in Japan, they all

00:27:26.815 --> 00:27:28.925
tell you, the reason
we feel we live long

00:27:28.925 --> 00:27:31.920
is because from birth
throughout life and up to that,

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.020
we're always together.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.290
No one is left abandoned
somewhere in a corner.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:41.230
Now, yeah, I was surprised when
doing the research on the book

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.940
to find out that there are
quite more people than I thought

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:51.560
who thought, well,
basically, whatever you do,

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.700
scratch at the
surface an altruist,

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.240
and the selfish will bleed.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.910
If you're very smart.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.210
cynical enough, and
you really look,

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:04.530
you will find a selfish
explanation for any seemingly

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.480
altruistic behavior.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.380
So it's quite true that there
are hypocritical behavior

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.500
or just that you do
something calculating what

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.285
you're going to get in return.

00:28:16.285 --> 00:28:20.227
And you might make a big smile,
make a present to someone

00:28:20.227 --> 00:28:20.810
to cheat them.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.910
Or even not that bad,
but you could do just

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.520
to boost your
self-image, or whatever,

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.740
or just to relieve
you empathic distress.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.950
You see someone suffering.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:31.530
You have no way out.

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.370
It's not that much that you
care about that wounded person.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.160
But since you have
no way out, you

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.500
help because you can't
stand looking at that.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.090
I see with animals, if you show
terrible movies about animals,

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.150
people say, oh, I love animals.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:42.858
I can't see that.

00:28:42.858 --> 00:28:46.470
Well, if you love animals,
look at it, and do something.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:51.200
So the idea of you do something
to relieve your distress

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.450
is not fundamentally altruistic
because you think of relieving

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.510
your sort of tension.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:59.030
Yes, this being
said, everyone who

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.480
tried to find a
selfish explanation

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.420
for every human
behavior has failed.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.930
This is armchair science.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.920
There's not one single
scientific study

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.240
supporting the universal
selfishness hypothesis.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.610
Rather, the opposite,
people like Daniel Batson

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:18.510
spent 20 years devising
skillful experiments in the lab

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.790
in very nice,
controlled situations

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.300
to put people in very
specific situations

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.970
to see the outcome of a choice.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:28.150
And there's always the
significant people--

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.030
even if they have
an easy escape-- who

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:34.400
choose the altruistic, or
what you call empathic concern

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.720
solution.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.440
So his conclusion is after
20 years of research,

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.860
we cannot prove 100% the
altruistic hypothesis.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:48.761
But at least, there's no support
for the universal selfishness

00:29:48.761 --> 00:29:49.260
explanation.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.320
It's just simply ideology
or just imagination.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.585
Now, but just to tell you
some of the arguments,

00:29:55.585 --> 00:30:00.130
now they hear about someone
who did a very beautiful act

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:05.570
of generosity making a donation
to save 10 children anonymously

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.750
so nobody is there
to praise him.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.510
He's not going to get his name
in the newspaper, and so forth.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.360
But then he confides
to a friend,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.930
I felt so good doing that.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.805
And then you see when
people are working now

00:30:17.805 --> 00:30:20.979
in humanitarian activities,
they spend one month with us.

00:30:20.979 --> 00:30:22.520
And at the end,
here's what they say.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.370
Oh, I got more than I gave them.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:30.070
So those smart
psychologists, those

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.490
who defend universal
selfishness, they come and say,

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.300
look, you did that
for the warm glow.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.440
You say you need all that,
and you feel so good.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.900
And that's the thing
that you take out of it.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.000
So you just did
that to feel good.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.130
So is it true all the time?

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:48.050
So let's look at
this short movie.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.200
OK, so you think
this guy is saying,

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.430
the one who jumped
on the rail track,

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.295
I'm going to feel so
good when that's over.

00:31:09.295 --> 00:31:10.697
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:31:10.697 --> 00:31:12.405
MATTHIEU RICARD: But
that's not finished.

00:31:12.405 --> 00:31:15.560
because then you interview
those guys, and they say,

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.890
of course, I had to do that.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:17.780
I had no choice.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.920
This guy was going to die.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.560
I jumped and took it off.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.620
And then those smart guys, they
come again and say, hey, hey,

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.310
you had no choice, automatic
behavior, instinctive behavior.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.550
This is neither
altruistic nor selfish.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.360
You just did it like that.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.710
What does that mean?

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.300
Everyone I talk with
wishes it's going

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.310
to be serious about that
question, like Daniel

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.650
Batson said, of course
there's a choice.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.705
But that choice doesn't
take long to deliberate.

00:31:40.705 --> 00:31:43.420
No, it's like, it comes
with what you are,

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.170
but it's not that you are
behaving like a robot.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.000
And look at this
guy, is he going

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.520
to think for half
and hour, should

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.040
I stretch my hand or not?

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.920
Maybe if I break
his little finger,

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.700
the insurance company will sue
me, or something like that.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.590
So there is a choice,
but that choice

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.190
takes a fraction of a second.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:05.090
So you may say, I had no choice
because it was too obvious.

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:10.342
And by the way, this guy
had a choice, clear choice.

00:32:10.342 --> 00:32:11.800
Sorry, I don't have
the next slide.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.250
I don't know what happened next.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.190
Now, people had choice.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:20.120
In the Second World War, in
every persecution, genocide,

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.930
there were people who took
immense risk for themselves,

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.210
for their family,
over a long time.

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.480
They were certainly
not looking how

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.260
to feel good and
have the warm glow.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.970
There was terrible danger.

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:33.410
This is Pastor Andre
Trocme and his wife

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.470
in the village of
Chambon-sur-Lignon

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:38.340
in Haute-Loire, near the
Swiss border in France.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:43.640
Over the years, they saved
3,500 Jewish persons.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.300
They never closed
their door to anyone

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.350
who sought help and refuge.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.180
They had then to go
through Switzerland.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:52.480
They were over constant
threat of deportation

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.630
from the Gestapo, Even the
Vichy French government

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.080
was threatening them.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.610
They never made a concession.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.420
The whole village did that.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.830
And they certainly had the
choice, and they did it.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.739
So rather than say,
well, those are saints.

00:33:04.739 --> 00:33:06.030
Well, this was a whole village.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.440
They are not born as saints.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.240
There's no saint gene
or something like that.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.400
They just say that is the
most natural way to do.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.650
So instead of saying,
oh, those are incredibly

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.370
exceptional people,
it's better to try

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.360
to find that potential
within our self,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.320
because we do have
that potential.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.400
We do have the
potential for care,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.190
as this Chinese person,
who lost his two legs,

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:31.280
and all his life has
been helping sick people.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.390
And look, with the kind of joy.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.840
So when you see
someone with empathy,

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.260
like this woman with born
TB that we helped in Tibet,

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.690
of course, when you see
that, or even worse,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:46.730
when you see the extreme
form of deprivation,

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:49.675
of starvation, and
so forth, you feel

00:33:49.675 --> 00:33:52.210
a strong emotional
resonance or you

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:54.160
try to imagine yourself
in the place of that,

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.810
and that's called empathy.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:59.780
But empathy alone is not
enough, because what happens?

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.210
Imagine you are a nurse, or
a doctor, or social workers.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.860
I know of someone working with
the homeless in San Francisco.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.075
If you, day after day
after day, resonate

00:34:09.075 --> 00:34:11.060
with the suffering
of others, well,

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.600
neuroscience shows
that you do suffer.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.489
This is real suffering
in the brain.

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:16.560
There's no question.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.300
So it may be too much, asking
to suffer for 20 years--

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.120
morning, afternoon, and all the
time, so you lead to burnout.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.889
And by the way, 60% of all
medical personnel in the United

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:31.880
States have or will suffer
or burnout for their life.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.139
So is there a remedy to that?

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.219
So we studied that with
Tania Singer-- and of course,

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.075
there is this burnout
happening-- who

00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:41.130
is a neuroscientist, one of the
world's specialists of empathy,

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:44.790
and she asked me to come in
the MRI, one of the 120 hours

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:47.060
that I spent in an MRI machine.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.929
And she said, well,
just do your meditation,

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.610
and we'll see what happens.

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:54.243
So it was a special MRI
called real-time fMRI.

00:34:54.243 --> 00:34:55.909
You can see immediately
what's happened.

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:58.104
You don't have to
wait for weeks.

00:34:58.104 --> 00:35:00.270
And then after 10 minutes,
she said through the mic,

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.315
what are you doing?

00:35:01.315 --> 00:35:03.430
This is nothing we see
normally for empathy.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.181
I said, well, I'm meditating on
compassion and loving-kindness.

00:35:06.181 --> 00:35:07.680
She says, well,
basically, come out.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.360
We have to talk.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.030
It's not the same
areas of the brain.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.863
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:35:10.863 --> 00:35:13.510
MATTHIEU RICARD: So we talked,
and she was a bit annoyed,

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.960
because it was so different.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.715
And she said, couldn't
you do just empathy?

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:20.790
And so I thought of, well,
I said, OK, I can try,

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.370
push away your compassion.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.450
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:25.741
MATTHIEU RICARD: So when we
split after the Dalai Lama,

00:35:25.741 --> 00:35:26.950
he says, how is it possible?

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.000
You see all these
terrible things

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.800
and don't have compassion.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.110
I said, well, we just
tried to focus on suffering

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.290
and suffering only.

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:34.880
So I had seen a documentary
on the BBC the day

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.670
before on Romanian orphans.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.690
It was so dramatic.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.750
And all those type of movies,
like when I was in London

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.340
recently, I saw a photo
exhibit on the Vietnam War,

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.000
I mean, it's just if you look
at that for half an hour,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.600
you will fall quickly
in empathy and distress.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.070
So I tried for one
hour, doing that.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:56.020
And in the MRI, you have to
alternate to measure properly.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.710
So you do rest,
and then the state,

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.740
and then rest like 50 times.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.260
And after, well, I was
totally burned out.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.230
I mean, only resonating
with the distress,

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.130
I was feeling powerless,
almost like disgust.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.610
I didn't know how to deal
with those terrible suffering.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.170
It's all negative violence.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:17.359
And then at the end, it was
about 11:30 in the morning.

00:36:17.359 --> 00:36:18.900
Tania said through
the mic, would you

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.220
like to take a break for lunch?

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.000
Or would you like to move to
your compassion meditation?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.370
I said, please, let me do
the compassion meditation.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.100
I can't stand it anymore.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.880
So when I did that, it was
like breaking open a dam.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.400
I mean I felt that
outpour of affection,

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.700
embracing, like every
atom of suffering

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.080
was filled with an atom of love.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.990
I felt much stronger
actually in contrast

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.530
with this empathic distress.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:48.050
And it was completely
different, like day and night.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.420
And in the brain, of
course, it was so different

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.630
that we pursued the
study with other subjects

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.580
and eventually published
a paper showing

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.490
that that completely
different network of the brain

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.870
for empathy, empathic distress,
and for loving-kindness

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:05.065
and compassion is a more
positive sort of network

00:37:05.065 --> 00:37:10.590
of affiliation, maternal
love, sense of wholesomeness

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.760
and reward, positive
affect applied to suffering

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.210
in a constructive way.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.740
And now, Tania has been
doing a one-year program.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.210
We turned to the volunteers
to distinguish those.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:24.240
She studied mindfulness for
three months, perspective

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.700
taking for three
months, meta, which

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.520
is loving-kindness for three
months in different orders.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.540
And premier results
show that mindfulness

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.240
is great to reduce stress,
but it doesn't increase

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.740
your prosocial behavior.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.210
Hence, we need
caring mindfulness.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.050
You get two for
the price of one.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:42.570
Because to be caring,
you need to be mindful,

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:46.730
but you may not be necessarily
caring by just being mindful.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.320
Imagine a mindful
sniper, very mindful.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.330
He's always on the task,
never distracted, no emotions,

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.916
always non-judgmental
in the present moment.

00:37:56.916 --> 00:37:57.870
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.350
MATTHIEU RICARD: A mindful
psychopath, same thing.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.800
But you can't have a caring
sniper and a caring psychopath.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.900
So therefore, please
add those 6 letters

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.050
to any mindfulness meditation,
caring mindfulness, and that

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:10.600
would work out nicely.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.850
So anyway, the idea that it is
loving-kindness mediation that

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.000
really increases
prosocial behavior,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.950
and it is the
antidote to burnout.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.320
Because that very
positive mental state

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.480
applied to suffering,
this is basically

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.560
altruism applied to
suffering, compassion.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.790
That's kind of a balm, a much
bigger sort of thing that's

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:33.240
just empathy.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.980
Stand-alone empathy is
like an electric pump.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.720
Without water, it burns.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.580
But if you add this very
warmhearted feeling,

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.150
it is actually the
antidote to burnout.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:47.140
So that's why when you see very
warmhearted doctors on this,

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.750
naturally, people
feel it so good.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:50.785
And that can be trained.

00:38:50.785 --> 00:38:53.650
And that's the whole
point of what we do.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:58.170
That certainly comes from
my tender paternal love.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.980
But we can use that to enhance
it, to extend it to others.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.050
So now, very
quickly, let's assume

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.750
that altruism does exist.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:08.450
If you look at
the [INAUDIBLE], I

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.240
think it's pretty
strong evidence.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.350
But you say, so what?

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:15.150
You look at our world, the
strong narcissistic epidemic,

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.790
the individualistic
trends, and the world's

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:21.000
not going so, so well.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.330
Can we do something
using that potential?

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:28.270
So can we change individually,
and can society change?

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:32.160
So first, individually, this
is Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, one

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.620
of the Dalai Lama's teachers.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.370
I was fortunate to
spend 13 years with him.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:39.280
My friend Vivian was here,
so I spent many years.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.496
My first teacher,
Kangyur Rinpoche.

00:39:41.496 --> 00:39:42.870
And His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:45.806
here with Richard Davidson, the
neuroscientist from Madison--

00:39:45.806 --> 00:39:50.620
I think he came here-- who is
very interested in encouraging

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.250
these collaborations.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:55.500
So now then you've got
those who went to the lab

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.560
and were studying with EEG.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.860
And here's Mingyur
Rinpoche in the fMRI.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.249
And he characterized fMRI as
being four characteristics.

00:40:03.249 --> 00:40:03.790
It is narrow.

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:04.650
It is dark.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:05.700
It is noisy.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.840
And it is, what else?

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:13.040
It is cold, so not a very
good place to meditate.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.630
But nevertheless, you can try.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.170
And then recently,
I was in the lab

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.850
at Coma Lab in Liege in Belgium.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.330
This world specialist
on coma, he

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.150
wanted to study different
degrees of lucidity.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.780
So then they put me
with an EEG, and there

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.930
was something they call
transmagnetic cranial

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:33.730
stimulation that was bom,
bom, bom, for five hours.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:39.130
And then you have to
meditate on pure awareness

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.479
free from thoughts.

00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:42.270
And then at some point,
because I could not

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:44.760
hear, because on top of,
they put you a white noise.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.670
And white noise is just
this white-like noise

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.630
like, shhhh all the time.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.520
And then so I can't
hear any instruction,

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.620
so they came with a board,
don't blink your eyes.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.930
So I went like this, and
then another board came.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:00.390
Relax your facial muscles.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.180
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.240
MATTHIEU RICARD: Meditate.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.855
And then they said, could you
self-induce a state of topor?

00:41:07.855 --> 00:41:09.390
OK.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.380
I went really stupid.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.320
And then with all this
and bing, bing, bing.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.070
And then they said,
could you fall asleep?

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.160
No.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.950
After five hours, I managed
to fall asleep, so anyway.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:22.930
So here I come out of the MRI
after two and a half hours

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.680
at Richard Davidson's.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.630
And then what the
results were with people

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.160
with long-term meditation,
there was huge differences.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.560
On the bottom, you see
novice, not untrained people,

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.740
knowing with the EEG, trying to
practice compassion meditation.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.600
The pink line is when they rest.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.860
Nothing much happened.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.370
The blue line is
when we meditate.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:44.880
Nothing much happened either.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.230
On top, the yellow line
is the meditators at rest.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.537
In the rest, they rest.

00:41:49.537 --> 00:41:51.620
But when they're engaged
in compassion meditation,

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.130
you see this huge peak, in the
gamma rays of brain frequency

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:59.810
that is so big that it
was never observed before

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:01.070
in neuroscience.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.030
And since I was the
first guinea pig,

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.720
that crazy idea of the
happiest person in the world

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.894
came from a journalist who'd
never thought of a better idea,

00:42:09.894 --> 00:42:11.560
but it has nothing
to do with happiness.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.040
And there are seven
billion beings.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.755
And by the way, all the 20
others long-term meditators

00:42:15.755 --> 00:42:17.740
did exactly the same,
even better than me.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.030
So forget about that.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:21.825
So now if you look
at brain imaging,

00:42:21.825 --> 00:42:25.970
and you see on the left side,
the meditator is at rest

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:30.670
and the B shows
meditators engaging

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.370
in compassion meditations.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.340
Many areas of the brain
are strongly activated.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.400
Those are areas with a
sense of affiliation,

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.730
empathy, what I mentioned
before, positive affect.

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:44.670
On the right side, C is
the novice is at rest.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:45.950
Nothing happened.

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:47.760
D is novices in meditation.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.760
Nothing happened either.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.343
That's normal.

00:42:49.343 --> 00:42:50.890
They didn't train.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:52.450
You might say,
well, great for you,

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.440
60,000 hours of meditation.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.730
What about us?

00:42:55.730 --> 00:43:00.090
Hence the 10-second meditation
of my dear friend Meng.

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.030
Now, who can say they don't
have 10 seconds every hour?

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.350
So stop everything.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:05.540
Don't hug people.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.820
You might get a
little bit in trouble.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.495
But just think for 10
seconds, may they be happy.

00:43:10.495 --> 00:43:12.530
May they flourish in life.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:15.970
And so, if you do that, it
sort of sets up a stream.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.170
Actually, if you do not
necessarily 10 seconds,

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:22.310
but 20 minutes a day for
four weeks of mindfulness

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.100
meditation, and now I
think I'm sure you'd

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.480
get even better with
caring mindfulness,

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.860
you can see a structural
change in the brain,

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.660
in the hippocampus, which
is an area of the brain that

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.100
assimilates novelty when you're
training to something new,

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.630
whether it's playing chess,
or juggling, or mindfulness,

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:44.210
or altruisitc love,
your brain does change.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.170
It also changes your
prosocial behavior.

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:49.360
That's two weeks of
compassion meditation.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:53.250
And you see the prosocial
behavior, the blue stack,

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:58.020
is much higher than any other
psychological intervention.

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:02.220
And, at the same time, those
who are with this increased

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:07.330
prosocial behavior, they also
found a decrease in the size,

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:09.710
after two weeks,
of the amygdala,

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.940
this area of the brain brain
related to fear and anger.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.380
So that's quite remarkable.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.260
So don't be discouraged,
not only 10 seconds,

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.110
but 20 minutes a day does
make a difference very fast.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.490
You could even do that
with preschoolers, four

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:25.090
or five years old.

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:27.410
And you do some kind
of mindful breathing,

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.040
you see with a little stone.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.530
But it's a 10-week program
that Richard Davidson did also

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.280
in Madison, 40 minutes,
three times a week.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.620
Very simple intervention
about gratitude,

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:41.230
emotional intelligence, empathy,
feeling what the other feels,

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.731
and all kinds of
cooperative learning.

00:44:43.731 --> 00:44:45.230
I mean, I cannot
describe in detail.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.930
There's a nice
manual about that.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:50.230
But the fact is that even
this simple intervention

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:54.100
with four or five years old
leads to a significant increase

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.290
in prosocial behavior.

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.150
That's the blue line
compared to a control group.

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:01.550
But then comes the
ultimate scientific test,

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:02.730
the stickers test.

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.970
And that's unforgiving.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:08.110
So what you do, you determine
before the intervention

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:11.390
for each child in the class
who is their best friend.

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:14.540
And then that's the first photo
you see on the left and then

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.500
the child they cannot stand.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.420
And then you have
two other envelopes

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.567
with an image of an unknown
child and the sick child.

00:45:22.567 --> 00:45:25.150
And before the intervention, you
give them a bunch of stickers

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.510
and say, please give
it to anyone you want.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:28.320
So what happens?

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.320
They give to their best
friend almost everything.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.220
Now 10 weeks later,
you will say, well,

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:35.820
this is four or five years old.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.715
It's kind of a playful
intervention, no big deal.

00:45:38.715 --> 00:45:39.590
They get a good time.

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.085
But how can it change?

00:45:41.085 --> 00:45:44.870
This in-group, out-group
sort of discrimination.

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:46.950
Well, it changed in a big way.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:48.040
It levels down.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.170
They give practically
as much stickers

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:53.200
as their best friend and
their least [INAUDIBLE] child.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.850
So if you think of the
deleterious effect in society

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:01.340
of discrimination, whether
it's racist, ethnic, religious,

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.400
social class, if you
could level these

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.870
in a simple way
with young children,

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:08.230
what a service to society.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:09.240
So we do that in India.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.800
We have 25,000
kids in the school

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.970
that we built with
Carona Ascension.

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:17.110
So we introduced yoga
class, meditation class.

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:19.500
And one thing, for sure,
it increased the attendance

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.630
to school.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.030
Now, here's the other good
news that the possibility

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.970
of societal ways.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.864
So we always speak about
violence everywhere.

00:46:28.864 --> 00:46:30.280
In Marseilles, in
South of France,

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.620
you can buy a Kalashnikov for
800 euros almost everywhere.

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.780
I mean, and here, of course,
is much easier than in France.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:40.890
But still, what happens to
violence of other centuries?

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.610
So if you look at the
book of Steven Pinker,

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:46.450
there is a significant
decrease in violence,

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:49.055
no matter what violence
is still there and was

00:46:49.055 --> 00:46:50.470
what you see on TV.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.800
In Oxford, in 1350,
there was 100 homicides

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.780
per year per 100,000 habitants.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.590
Now it's 0.6.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:00.780
Now, in Europe, it
went down 5200 times.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.280
In Australia, as soon as
they banned personal arms,

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.820
it went down 10 times.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.030
It's only Sicily
that's about 12.

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.822
We don't know why.

00:47:07.822 --> 00:47:09.030
I think this is a good study.

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:10.950
It should be done there.

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:13.820
In any case,
basically, homicides

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.820
have been going down
steadily over the century.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.320
That's what the
data said, if you

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.760
look at abolition of torture.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.259
And if you look at the average
number of casualty per conflict

00:47:23.259 --> 00:47:25.300
all over the world, there
are two that are banks,

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.960
one in the United States,
one in Uppsala, in Sweden.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.890
If you look at all the
countries, of course

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:31.431
there are terrible
things happening--

00:47:31.431 --> 00:47:36.070
ISIS, South Sudan, the Iraq-Iran
war, a million people died.

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.320
But if you take all of
the countries worldwide,

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:42.390
divide by the number of victims,
it went from 50,000 average

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:43.640
to 1,000.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.470
So there's always something
somewhere terribly dramatic,

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:49.610
but globally, it has gone down.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:51.380
Domestic violence is
still the main cause

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.590
of violence in the world,
because it's 1 to 1.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:56.700
But the abuse and
violence, like in children

00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.050
in the United States, that
goes down by half in 20 years.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:01.490
So there is hope.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:02.550
Why is there hope?

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:04.195
And how you could
find the articulation

00:48:04.195 --> 00:48:08.010
point between individual
change and societal change.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.640
Another great discovery I
made while studying research

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.410
for the book is the notion
of evolution of cultures.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:19.140
But to get an altruistic
gene in every human being

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.930
might take 50,000 years.

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:22.890
It's too late for
the environment.

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:26.165
So evolution of culture
is a Darwinian process

00:48:26.165 --> 00:48:27.570
that is faster than genes.

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:29.945
There's actually a book called
that, "Faster Than Genes,"

00:48:29.945 --> 00:48:31.300
which is a very good one.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.570
And the evolution of
culture can happen over

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:37.760
a generation-- attitudes towards
war, attitudes towards women,

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.180
homophobia,
environment, name it.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.780
Cultures are
changing quite fast.

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.827
The slavery was abolished in
England in the 18th century.

00:48:47.827 --> 00:48:49.660
First of all, there
were 10 people who said,

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:50.840
slavery is an abomination.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.720
Everybody laughed.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.120
The Parliament said,
there's no way.

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.719
The British Empire
will economically

00:48:56.719 --> 00:48:57.760
collapse without slavery.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.620
We can't afford that.

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:02.050
10 years later,
it was abolished.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.410
Today, if you say, I'm against
slavery, people would say,

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:06.250
so what?

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:09.030
And people who would say,
how can you dare to say,

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:10.030
no, it was not too bad.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:11.740
No, economically,
it makes sense.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.550
Shall we put back slavery on?

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:16.410
Shall we deny voting
rights to women?

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:19.280
Of course, we cannot go back
on those cultural changes--

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.160
fortunately.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.680
So we made big progress
of civilization.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:25.990
So that's why this
was 10 people who

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:29.430
decided to start that company,
10 people who have decided

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:31.840
to promote the universal
declaration of human rights,

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.690
and they succeeded.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:36.450
So there can be tipping
points, a critical mass

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:38.470
of individual new ideas.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:40.930
And after a while,
ethically, you

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:45.200
can't feel comfortable if you
steal go against women and men

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.030
having the same sort
of gender issue,

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:50.320
having the same potential and
possibilities, and so forth.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.410
So that's why I think those
two individual changes,

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:57.930
societal changes, the
cumulative of our generation,

00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:01.300
we don't have to learn again
that slavery is totally bad.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:04.490
We're born in that sort
of ideas and culture.

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:08.070
So they'll fashion each other
like two knives sharpening

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:08.570
each other.

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:09.970
So there is a possibility.

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.260
So what can we do?

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.780
I can go back to my hermitage.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.180
That's a very nice time.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.090
That's what I see
in the morning.

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:18.660
But we need to promote
also caring economics.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.450
As I mentioned,
that's the only way

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:22.860
to remedy to poverty
in the midst of plenty

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.970
and take care of common goods,
especially the environment.

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:30.840
We need to enhance cooperation
within the enterprise.

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.520
It has been shown
again and again

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:37.280
that a company, a community,
and with this unconditional

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.545
cooperation, transparency
of information,

00:50:39.545 --> 00:50:44.530
of sharing, less hierarchy
that is not waterproof

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:46.565
is a company where
it's better to work--

00:50:46.565 --> 00:50:49.860
I think Google is probably
a good example of that--

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.740
and therefore, so
more prosperous.

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.530
It has been shown
again and again,

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:57.160
that a company where it's
nice to work, also do better.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.590
And we need more
cooperative learning

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:00.780
instead of competitive one.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:02.910
There's many areas
where we would

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:05.200
boost our level of cooperation.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.740
We need no more sustainable
development of growth.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:09.890
It's a bit suspicious.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.470
You always think of
quantitative growth.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:13.635
We need qualitative growth.

00:51:13.635 --> 00:51:15.010
So instead of
speaking of growth,

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:16.840
why not speak of harmony?

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.780
For now, sustainable harmony
means reducing inequalities.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.640
There are still 1.5 billion
people under the poverty line.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.640
That's not going to work
well if you keep that.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.080
Inequalities are
growing in all the OECD

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.720
countries last 30 years.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.530
This is very unhealthy.

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:34.720
Less trust is not harmonious.

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.780
And then harmony
for the future is

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.355
to remain in harmony within
the planetary boundaries

00:51:39.355 --> 00:51:42.315
so that we can continue to
prosper, bringing harmony

00:51:42.315 --> 00:51:46.930
with environment instead of
disrupting this equilibrium.

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:49.890
So sustainable harmony, I
think, is a powerful concept,

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:51.220
and we should use it.

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.530
We need local commitment.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:54.140
We need to do things ourselves.

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.360
And global
responsibility, we have

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.640
the WHO, which takes care
of epidemics, and so forth.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.780
No country can say,
there's a plague epidemic,

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:02.820
I'm not part of that.

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.639
We have to be part
of all things.

00:52:04.639 --> 00:52:05.930
Same thing for the environment.

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:08.179
There should be global
governance for the environment.

00:52:08.179 --> 00:52:09.470
There's no question.

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:11.590
We need to be
extending our altruism

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:13.890
to 1.3 million species.

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:21.530
We can't say they are just there
for our use, to distract us,

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.760
or to entertain us.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.640
They are our [INAUDIBLE]
in this world.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.430
They have a life.

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:29.800
They are subject of a life.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.260
They don't want to suffer.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.070
That needs to be respected.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:35.820
The natural equilibrium
needs to be respected.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:40.740
We are not the owner of
1.3 other billion species.

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:45.260
We live with them in a very
vast interdependent system.

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.300
And we need daring it.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:48.640
We need to dare altruism.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.410
We need to dare
that it does exist.

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:51.660
We have a potential for it.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.760
We can teach it at
school, because there's

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.260
a potential for that.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.740
Individually, we can change.

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:59.090
Society can become
more cooperative.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:02.320
We don't need to be afraid that
it's a lightweight concept.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:05.970
This is the core
most pragmatic answer

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:10.550
to our times'
different challenges.

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:13.264
So in terms of
animals, we can say,

00:53:13.264 --> 00:53:15.180
as then I'm sure that
"Animals are my friends.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.346
And I don't eat my friends."

00:53:16.346 --> 00:53:18.930
That is quite a good, nice way
to explain why you don't want

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:20.451
to eat fish in a restaurant.

00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:22.700
If they say, oh, you are
vegetarian, so you each fish.

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.410
I say, well, look,
everything that swims,

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:26.243
everything that runs,
everything that flies,

00:53:26.243 --> 00:53:28.070
they're all my friends.

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:31.640
So then you can also do,
say like Martin Luther King,

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.820
everyone must decide, a
man or woman, of course,

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:38.990
whether he or she will "walk in
the light of creative altruism

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:41.340
or in the darkness of
destructive selfishness.

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:42.990
It's up to us.

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.760
Someone like the Dalai
Lama shows us the part.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:49.800
We tried to implement that
and even turned activities.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.840
Now, we have now
developed 140 projects.

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.840
This is one of our clinics.

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.990
And we treat about
120,000 patients a year

00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:59.930
in Nepal, India, and Tibet.

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:02.320
This is the clinic that
we built in [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.380
with the help of the
Googlers here some years ago.

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.660
That was a wonderful initiative.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.640
We built a school
with bamboos in Nepal,

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:13.470
with a social
entrepreneur, 2,000 kids

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:16.640
in the school that we can
be build for a $150,000 is

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.807
a good return on investment.

00:54:17.807 --> 00:54:19.973
All made with bamboo, so
when there's an earthquake,

00:54:19.973 --> 00:54:21.180
it just moves a little bit.

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.890
In Tibet, we build a
number of dispensaries.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:25.570
Obviously, we need
a bridge here.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:27.300
That's our car.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.950
There's a road,
and there is river.

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:30.390
Nobody says, knows what.

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:33.245
So the drivers reciting
his mantra very fast.

00:54:33.245 --> 00:54:35.360
And so we built 18
bridges, including

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.490
one on the Yangtze
tree on the Mekong.

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:39.510
They all come from
Tibet, by the way.

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:41.240
We take care of the elderly.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.717
Here is finally the
happiest man in the world.

00:54:44.717 --> 00:54:45.300
We've got him.

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.860
And the happiest woman
is there as well.

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.675
So we've built a number
of schools there.

00:54:49.675 --> 00:54:53.910
And we're trying to favor
especially education of girls.

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:57.406
And we intervene in earthquake
areas, first in Tibet in 2010.

00:54:57.406 --> 00:54:59.030
There was 10,000
people who died there.

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:00.890
So we brought a lot of goods.

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:03.280
And this year, from
April, we started

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:08.200
building an earthquake resistant
school at 12,000 feet in Tibet.

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.840
It's a boarding
school for children.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.800
In Nepal, as you know,
the recent tragedy

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.740
so since we are in the place
with a clinic 50 people strong

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:21.530
and a monastery with
500 disciplined monks,

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:24.410
we could have teams
going to the villages.

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:28.930
And now, as I said, we helped
40,000 people in 160 villages

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:33.410
with food, with shelter,
and basic medical necessity.

00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:37.470
And then we're going to move
next, when the emergency is

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.220
over, to community
projects, rebuilding school,

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:42.470
rebuilding dispensary,
wherever it's needed.

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:44.930
This is our mascot,
the Corona girl,

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:47.570
I photographed her 12 years ago.

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:49.840
I'm not the [INAUDIBLE] of
"Gone Girl," so I thought

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.410
I should find her again.

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:52.974
And so I found her.

00:55:52.974 --> 00:55:54.640
And I learned her
name, and she's called

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.990
Beautiful Ocean of Turquoise.

00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:58.470
So this is our website.

00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:00.680
It's very easy to see
what we do and help us.

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.640
And we are very grateful
to Google to host me again

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.280
and also to have
helped us in the past.

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.660
And I know you'll continue
to help us, of course.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.320
So thank you so much.

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.530
And this was a few ideas.

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:13.620
We still have, I
think, 10 minutes or so

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.840
to have question and
answer before we break

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.048
for the so-called meditation.

00:56:27.299 --> 00:56:27.840
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.760
Thank you for your
wonderful talk.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.760
I'm wondering if you can talk a
little bit about enlightenment

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:36.030
and if that's even a
goal worth pursuing

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:38.590
or if that's a selfish goal.

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:41.070
Can you tell us a
little bit more, please?

00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:45.430
MATTHIEU RICARD: Well, that
question often is put to us.

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:47.455
Well, yeah, while in your
hermitage, practicing

00:56:47.455 --> 00:56:50.530
compassion or mindfulness,
whatever, ha, ha, ha,

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:53.449
is it not selfish to be
in this nice place facing

00:56:53.449 --> 00:56:55.490
the Himalayas, not you
have to think about paying

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:57.890
taxes and things like that?

00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:59.990
Well, I thought of it.

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:04.450
As far as my teachers
and the tradition

00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:07.640
which I've been following for
45 years, one of the main goals

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.860
is to get rid of selfishness
while doing this practice.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.750
So you cannot accuse someone
of being selfish if the goal

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:16.206
of what he's doing now is
to get rid of selfishness.

00:57:16.206 --> 00:57:17.580
It's like saying
to someone who's

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:20.700
building a big hospital,
what are you doing now

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.200
with all this construction
work, plumbery, electricity.

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.700
It doesn't help anyone.

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.319
Go and do surgery in the street.

00:57:27.319 --> 00:57:29.110
But, of course, when
the hospital is ready,

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:30.680
it's so much more powerful.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.700
So I think mindfulness is not
the ultimate sense of Buddhism.

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.840
It's a tool.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.610
The essence of Buddhism
is wisdom and compassion.

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:40.450
Now, to achieve that,
if you're not mindful,

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:41.970
you're just distracted.

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:44.060
So therefore, you
need whatever you do,

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:47.260
whether it's activity in
your workplace-- multitasking

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:51.930
has been shown to be a very
deficient way to do anything.

00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:54.240
They don't do anything
better in cognitive tasks,

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.680
including the speed
of switching tasks,

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.930
which would be the
quintessence of multitasking.

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:01.990
You just get a messy mind.

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:03.660
So the idea of
being concentrated,

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.010
even if you do many things
in the morning, each time,

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.910
fully on what you do, is kind
of the essence of mindfulness.

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:11.490
Now, on a personal
level, it also

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:13.930
helps you to have a
mind that is a bit more

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:17.160
clear, a little bit more
stable, a little bit more calm.

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.160
And that's also a better tool
to then cultivate qualities

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.270
like altruistic love
and others and also

00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:26.840
to deal with your hopes
and fears and ruminations.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:31.610
So it's basically a much more
optimal healthy state of mind

00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:36.390
than a confused, ruminating,
torn apart, divided,

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:38.490
conflicted mind, obviously.

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:42.450
So I think it's a very
beautiful and powerful tool.

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:44.725
But again, since
it's something that

00:58:44.725 --> 00:58:46.800
has become more and
more and more popular,

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.950
I think, and I've
mentioned that many times

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:50.910
to my good friend,
Jon Kabat-Zinn,

00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:55.820
please know, very explicitly
include the caring aspect

00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.510
of it, otherwise,
it could be misused

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:02.590
because any tool can be
use to harm or do good.

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:05.930
And again, we don't
want mindful snipers.

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:08.220
They are mindful, by the
way, but they are not caring.

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.570
So caring, I think,
it just simply dispels

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:13.180
all possible deviation.

00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:15.680
But otherwise, it's a very
wonderful and powerful tool.

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.590
This is secular, so
nobody can argue that it's

00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:20.530
something that is not for us.

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:23.720
MENG: The book is "Altruism,"
available where books are sold.

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:25.420
And my friend 's
Matthieu Ricard.

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.220
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:29.320
MATTHIEU RICARD: Thank you.

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.520
MENG: Thank you.

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:33.570
