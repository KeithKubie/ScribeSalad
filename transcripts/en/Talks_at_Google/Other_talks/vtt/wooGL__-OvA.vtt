[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I'd like to -- I'd like to

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.010
begin by introducing Dr. Henry Kissinger.
Let's roll the video.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.670
[music]

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.600
Your champagne, Mr. Benside.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.080
Thank you

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.880
[music]

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.400
You're siting in seat 2A. Wonder who will be sitting next to you in Seat 2B.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.400
[music]

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.440
Your seat, sir.

00:00:33.698 --> 00:00:34.872
Hey...

00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:36.152
Thank you.

00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:37.394
 Good evening

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:37.894
Good evening!

00:00:37.894 --> 00:00:39.220
You're Henry Kissinger.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.513
Ready for a good chat.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.440
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the real Dr. Kissinger. 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:31.360
[Applause]

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.420
Thank you, thank you, Henry.
If you looked at that ad with me, I'm carrying

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.770
your book when I get into the elevator.
The -- thank you, all, for coming.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.990
Dr. Kissinger and I have talked for a long
time about the future of the world. And I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.249
would argue that Dr. Kissinger is one of the
foremost experts on the future of the physical

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:05.140
world, how the world really works. And, of
course, his contributions to America and the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.259
world are without question.
I would also argue that we have a pretty strong

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.250
role here in the digital world. And it's the
combination of the physical and the digital

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.980
that will drive a lot of the future.
So we have agreed to have a conversation about

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:29.450
the two together. And Dr. Kissinger just published
an extraordinary book on the structure of

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.540
the world. I like to think of it as how the
world works.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.540
I, of course, wrote how Google works; right?
So perhaps we can start, Dr. Kissinger, by

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.920
saying how did you want to do this and why
are we here?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:56.080
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Well, I was brought
up in the nondigital world. And while I've

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:08.480
learned some of its instruments, my thinking
is shaped by the period before the interconnected

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.340
world.
So Eric and I have been meeting at various

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:23.380
conferences. And I've been fascinated by what
he knows. And I don't know whether he's been

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.840
fascinated by what I know, but it -- throughout
the conversation.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:41.189
And my grandchildren are so far ahead of me
in the digital world that it's embarrassing

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:46.810
to me.
So by exchanging ideas, Eric and I have fallen

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:58.010
into a rather extensive dialogue. And when
he suggested that we take it here into conversation,

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:05.049
I was very interested to do that. That's why
I'm here.

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:12.549
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: The -- in your book -- Let's
start by saying, you know, in your book, you

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.810
talk about the Westphalian system. I didn't
know what the Westphalian system was. But

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.560
in your book, you say it's relatively young
and it maybe is not permanent.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.000
How will the nation state evolve in this interconnected
world?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.560
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Well, I wrote this
book almost by accident. I was having dinner

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:52.270
with a friend from Yale, and I was talking
about the nature of leadership and about doing

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:01.810
some case histories on leaders. And he said,
why don't you put that aside and write about

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:10.530
something that really bothers you now. And
he said write about what problem bothers you

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.560
the most.
And so I concluded what bothers me most is

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:27.030
-- it's sort of grandiloquently called world
order. It arises the following way, in response

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:35.190
to your question, Eric.
What we consider the international system,

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:42.199
and what probably most of you consider the
international system is a number of states

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.030
in relation with each other that serve each
other with diplomats and that balance each

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.229
other. And there are certain rules. You cannot
cross borders and you can't intervene in international

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:01.330
affairs -- in domestic affairs.
So people think that that is the natural order

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:08.330
of the universe. It, however, has existed
only in the west, and only in western Europe,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.449
and only since about the middle of the 17th
century, when there was a 30 years' war in

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:22.449
Europe that killed a third of the population
with conventional weapons.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:34.039
And then a group of leaders got together in
the Westphalia, in Germany, with the Catholic

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:40.560
leaders in one town and the Protestant leaders
in another. Very few names of these leaders

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:50.000
have survived. But they constructed the system
that has lasted since then. And it's based

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.500
on the idea that a number of sovereign states
are going to balance each other through a

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:04.050
balance of power and that the balance of power
is maintained by a certain common system of

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:11.050
justice that is -- that the system is considered
not perfectly just, but just enough so that

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:21.210
nobody wants to overthrow the whole system
and seek a judgment within it. That's a -- in

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:29.930
China, that concept never existed. In China,
the idea of order was that China is the center

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:36.960
of the universe and every other state that
existed in the world was related to China

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.470
in some kind of a tributary system. Then you
could never really become Chinese, but you

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:49.259
could have closer or less close relationship
with China.

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:56.259
Then in the Islamic world, that was whatever
it's called is the autocratic system that

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:03.550
determined the hierarchy. Now for the first
time in history, the various regions of the

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:10.500
world are related to each other through technology,
and with instantaneous communication, and

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.879
so they can affect each other.
The Roman empire and the Chinese empire were

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:21.940
not part of the same world order. They didn't
know of each other. And they didn't know how

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.830
to interact with each other. So that's the
problem I was trying to deal with in this

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.820
book and that I think is one of the challenges
of our time.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:39.590
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So all of us are very excited
about globalization and, in particular, the

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:47.970
rise of two billion people going from poverty
into middle class, mostly in Asia. And, for

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.920
example, the vast majority of them will be
connected to the Internet, they'll be using

00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:02.320
smartphones, they will join our economic order.
As you know, before World War I, an economist

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:09.210
named Engel wrote essentially an article that
said that because of trade, there would never

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:17.110
be wars again. This book was written in 1909.
We all know what happened after that.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:29.330
So I make the same assumption, that the Westphalian
system plus this growth of modernity and commerce

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.450
and so forth means a world of less war, less
conflict.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:43.040
Am I wrong?
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Yes, you're probably

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:49.510
wrong.
[ Laughter ]

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:56.510
You're not totally -- you're not -- It's complicated.
You are right that, of course, there's instantaneous

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:06.680
communication. And beam know about what is
going on in other parts of the world. But

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:13.700
people don't only disagree with each other
because they disagree as to facts. They more

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:20.900
frequently disagree with each other because
they may agree on the facts, but they interpret

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:27.100
them differently.
And so that the relevance of facts to a problem

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.080
is sometimes more important than the facts
or at least as important as the facts themselves.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:42.560
So you take now the Middle East, the conflict
between Shia and Sunni interpretations of

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:52.000
Islam. They both accept the Koran. They both
accept the basic theology. The split occurred

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:09.760
about the fourth succession after the prophet.
And its bitterness has -- if anything, it

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:16.760
hasn't become more in the contemporary period,
but the technical means of bringing it to

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:24.830
others has increased.
So one really has to separate -- matters that

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:36.230
depend on factual conclusions I think it will
be easier to solve or at least be possible

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:45.470
to solve. Matters that depend on interpretation
and ideology or religion may become harder

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:54.590
to solve because of the means of spreading
the different views and making them clash

00:11:54.590 --> 00:12:05.370
with each other.
And so I think, actually, the frequency of

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.790
wars has declined.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Declined.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:14.000
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: I've seen a study to
that effect. I think there's a book out that

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.180
says that.
But the intensity of the consequences has

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.820
multiplied.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Do you think that in the technological

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:31.980
future, where more people are connected, there
will be more conflict because of this ideological

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.040
fight? It will be easier to fight? The example
I would offer is ISIS, which is a horrific

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:46.070
organization who are very effective at using
social media, even though they themselves

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:52.990
have shut down the Internet within their part
of Iraq.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:13:11.540
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: It's -- I think the
cultural differences, unless they can be diminished,

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:18.540
the mere interconnection does not necessarily
avoid conflicts.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:31.610
If you look around the world today, you have
the Middle East crisis or whatever you -- which

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:38.610
is really three or four different revolutions
occurring simultaneously, some against the

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:52.870
existing governments on the usual economic
issues, some on the Shia/Sunni spread, some

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:59.870
-- which would be the case in Syria -- of
ethnic groups, and over it all, a revolution

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:07.600
against a state system that was brought into
the area by the west in which the boundaries

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:14.600
were drawn in 1920, reflecting no historic
or cultural reality.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:23.670
So all of these revolutions are going on simultaneously.
Each of them, and especially ISIS, is trying

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:32.070
to use social media, and doing it extremely
effectively, vis-�-vis us for the purpose

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:41.500
of intimidating us and to show how serious
they are, and for the rest of the -- part

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:50.540
of the Muslim community, to show the ferocity
with which they stand up to the West, which

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:55.240
is, in itself, an attraction.
So I would say that the interconnectedness

00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:08.890
works both ways in this situation, which is
not an argument against interconnectedness;

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:14.540
it's an argument to try to learn from the
consequences of interconnectedness.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:26.830
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: As you know, China has a different
view of the digital world than America. And

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:37.070
you famously opened China. Extraordinary achievement.
If I take the view that China has a unique

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:46.200
view of itself, right, and I also take the
view that economic growth in China will mean

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:52.740
great prosperity for the Chinese, my naive
and optimistic view that that's positive for

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:58.270
the world, all the things that we've talked
about, what's -- what happens when China is

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:14.750
as strong as America?
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: One has to understand

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:27.200
how China looks at the world in order to -- And
you all have to understand, I am not a China

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:39.930
scholar. I arrived in China in 1971, essentially,
ignorant of China because President Nixon

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.470
sent me because I was on his staff and he
could keep an eye on me that way.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:49.410
[ Laughter ]
And anyone else he sent would be harder to

00:16:49.410 --> 00:17:06.449
control. And I couldn't tell the bureaucracy
what I was doing. So I had minimal preparation.

00:17:06.449 --> 00:17:17.089
And that became apparent in the first -- out
of my conversation with the Chinese premier,

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:23.910
who was Zhou Enlai. And I made a statement,
and I was going along nicely, and I was saying,

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:29.450
"So now I find myself here in this land of
mystery."

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:34.880
So he put up his hand and said, "What is so
mysterious about China?"

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:41.880
And I said something banal. And he said, think
about the following problem: There is a billion

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:49.100
of us, and it's not mysterious to us. Which
was a very profound -- really good point,

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:58.690
profound one.
So I tried over the succeeding years and over

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.390
100 visits to China since then to try to understand
how they think of themselves.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:20.670
Now, the Chinese -- the Chinese do not think
historically of conquering territory by force

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:29.440
and colonizing it then and holding it the
way the Europeans have and the way others

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.730
have.
The Chinese think, as a general rule, that

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:43.330
they will influence other societies by the
majesty of their performance, by the magnitude

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:52.170
of their efforts, and that they will then
draw them into a pattern of relationships

00:18:52.170 --> 00:19:01.280
that is based on cultural and psychological
domination, backed up by a military force

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:12.630
which will be used in -- a phrase I've often
heard -- to teach a lesson. Not to conquer

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.600
so much, although indirectly, that may be
a result.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:22.600
So that's a different way of thinking.
Now, what will China do?

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:32.570
Well, there are two ways, and it's of great
importance for our future.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:42.650
If it goes the traditional way, then China
will gradually spread its influence as its

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:49.650
power grows. And if the difference between
us gets too great, they will expect that other

00:19:50.180 --> 00:20:03.460
nations will recognize that fact and act accordingly.
If, however, the difference does not become

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:17.440
so great, if it's sort of an economics analysis
of the capitol, then we and the Chinese have

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:24.440
this challenge. If it goes the traditional
way and under normal, historic conflicts,

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:31.550
there will be a series of irritations that
go on over a period of time, one of which

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:39.090
somewhere along the line will lead to a confrontation.
That's the history of Europe with World War

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:49.690
I. They have had years, decades of confrontations,
each of which was settled, and then one worse

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:56.340
than any other suddenly blew up.
So that's one model.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:03.340
The other model would be that we now decide
at this stage, when Eric can still ask that

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:12.050
question as a future prospect, that both -- both
countries decide we want to avoid this. And

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:20.820
we will try to develop a partnership between
potential adversaries that work together on

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:30.900
some common problems. And, actually, at this
moment, both the Chinese and the American

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:37.920
presidents are saying they want to do that.
The trouble has been they haven't yet found

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:52.320
a way to do it. And one reason is that we,
the Americans, think every difficulty has

00:21:52.380 --> 00:22:02.140
a solution. And therefore, we segment the
world into problems. And each problem gets

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:08.610
solved with concentrated effort.
The Chinese and the political world don't

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:14.490
think this way. They think every solution
of a problem is an admissions ticket to another

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:23.970
set of problems. So you, therefore, have to
think conceptually and in terms of process.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:30.970
But right now, we are actually living through
a moment when the two sides are feeling their

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:42.100
way towards each other to bridge that gap.
And I don't know, one can't tell whether they'll

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:46.360
succeed.
So when the Chinese president comes here next

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:52.630
September, there are going to be a lot of
surface things that are going on. But the

00:22:52.630 --> 00:23:02.060
underlying issue will be, can they convince
each other that they're working together or

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:09.060
will they leave from each other thinking,
well, we'll manage the competition better

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:18.530
from outside.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So there's a technological

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:26.850
question in many of these areas, but the one
that confound me the most is what to do about

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:37.930
the spread of nuclear weapons.
You have written extensively on Iran and what's

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:47.490
going to happen in Iran.
And my amateur view of this is it's very difficult.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:53.300
And as we know, Persia is a very proud, very
old culture, very wealthy and sophisticated

00:23:53.300 --> 00:24:03.620
culture, very prideful. And the evidence is
that they want nuclear weapons.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:10.530
It seems to me that it's very difficult to
prevent a country that has the means and really

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:16.170
wants them.
Do you agree? Is there a way where we can

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:21.500
slow this down? Is there a way that technology
could change this? Is there something that

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:27.100
we could do because of the obvious concerns
here?

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:40.250
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Well, of course, one
question is why do they want nuclear weapons.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:49.690
And this probably has many answers, one of
which is that Iran, as you said, is an old

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:59.830
civilization. It's the one country that was
overrun by the Arabs in -- when Islam spread

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:06.590
around that part of the world that did not
adopt Arabic as a language, that maintained

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:16.120
its own language, maintained its own literature.
And then about a thousand years into that

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:24.340
process, adopted the Shiite version of Islam
in order to distinguish itself from the Turkish

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:32.220
Ottoman empire, which was at its borders.
So there is this great sense of identity in

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:39.220
Iran.
At the same time, they have adopted a Jihadist

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:51.180
version of Shia religion, the leadership has,
which is really not -- fairly indistinguishable

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:59.420
from the ISIS version, except that they don't
do such brutal demonstrations. But the objective

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:09.760
is essentially indistinguishable. So that
is the world in which they live.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:23.840
But let me get to the issue of nuclear weapons.
I've been writing on that subject since long

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:37.330
before most of you were born. And the fundamental
problem is this: When people ask me, what

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:43.460
was the problem that bothered me most when
I was in government, what caused me -- nothing

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:50.460
caused me sleepless nights. Well, what did
I worry about? It was what would I say if

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:56.480
the president says to me, we have come to
the limit of our diplomacy. Now do we go to

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:03.230
nuclear weapons?
And the reason it bothered me, as it should,

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:09.000
is because the consequences of the use of
nuclear weapons are so horrendous, that you

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.990
so transform the world, that it's a serious
question whether any person has the right

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:24.750
to take that responsibility to inflict that
level of devastation on mankind in relation

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:31.990
to one problem.
So this -- as long as the management of these

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:44.000
weapons was in the hands of a very few countries
that had similar risks, you could still imagine

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:50.530
how the world could manage. But once it spread
into areas in which the conflict between the

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:56.820
participants is extremely intense and in which
they may have religious conviction in which

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:05.570
the destruction of life may be an advance
towards a better life, and where the technology

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:14.100
is not enough elaborated so that you can develop
fail-safe systems and early warning so that

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:23.540
preemption gets built into the system, then
you have a really tough problem. And the challenge

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:34.250
for me in the Iranian weapon is that it will
almost mathematically produce the same desire

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:41.250
in other comparable countries in the region.
And when -- and if a weapon is ever used and

00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:49.059
we wake up and find that 100,000 people have
been killed in five minutes, that will affect

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:56.460
human consciousness, must affect human consciousness
around the world, also in relation to their

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:02.820
governments.
So my concern with the discussions now is

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:12.020
-- they're an extremely complicated technical
stuff that will be debated. But the key issue

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:24.850
to me is the propensity of the achievement
by Iran of nuclear capability, military capability

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:32.770
triggering the same thing in Saudi Arabia,
Egypt, Turkey. And then these countries face

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:41.730
each other. And then here we sit. We're trying
to produce stability. And I haven't even mentioned

00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:48.300
Israel, which is a potential target for all
of them.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:56.540
So that's what one should concern oneself
with in this Iranian negotiation.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:07.750
Could one keep them from doing it? You know,
if this were a seminar, you can say you can

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:15.590
theoretically do it by getting them into a
value system in which they don't want it,

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:25.660
which is unlikely, or by threatening them
with consequences that they don't want to

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:36.700
face. That opportunity, if it ever existed,
is past. So in this world, we will now have

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:46.350
to see -- we'll have to give it a chance for
the follow-on negotiations to succeed.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:55.120
But at the end of it will be the question,
if Iran winds up with nuclear weapons, so

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.760
will other countries. And then what will we
do?

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:09.920
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: If the point is past where
we can prevent it, then does it necessarily

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:22.380
have to happen?
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: You know, I weighed

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:36.460
-- because I don't think -- I think probably
yes. Because in most bureaucratic organizations,

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:47.290
at least most governmental bureaucratic organizations,
while you like to think of the long term,

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:54.290
you must deal with the short term. And all
the pressures of the short term will be to

00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:03.520
continue, while breaking with it would be
a major decision.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:11.640
I would think that probably -- we are probably
beyond the point where that program can be

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:21.880
stopped by -- stopped by American efforts,
probably. But I would respect the administration

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:37.960
for trying to stop it.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We need a better solution.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Maybe we can think of some technological solutions,
better detection, other ways of monitoring

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.990
and so forth. Maybe we can invent --
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: But the technological

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:57.750
solution will help you only if you have already
decided to do it. You -- The reason -- The

00:32:57.799 --> 00:33:10.900
Iranians started this program around 2000.
They stopped it temporarily when we invaded

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:24.500
Iraq, because they were afraid they were next
on the list. They resumed it when they realized

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:32.799
we were stuck in Iraq.
And every time they continue, they create

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:47.450
another interest group that is concerned with
continuing it. And so their basic argument

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:56.090
-- I would think that it would take really
overwhelming force to convince them that the

00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:02.350
cause would be too great.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: In this context, let's talk

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:15.960
about Russia. We -- if we go back to the Westphalian
system and order, the invasion of Crimea is

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:22.960
clearly a violation of a whole bunch of agreements.
The Russians are behaving in a way different

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:30.840
from the contract, if you will, the European
contract, as China are.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:37.240
We face, right, the technological industry
faces very significant restrictions in Russia

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:44.090
now for the Internet use. Twitter has been
under great attack. There are new laws that

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:51.090
are blocking certain technological solutions
in Russia. Russia itself is largely dependent

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:57.050
on oil and gas revenue, which is, in fact,
in trouble.

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:02.810
If China is a different structure than America
and Europe, what's Russia?

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:14.810
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Well, Russia has never
in its mind been fully part of the Westphalian

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:23.040
system, because it has had a totally different
history. And it's also a different animal.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:32.000
The Westphalian system was based on states
with a -- with fairly homogeneous populations

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:41.960
in relatively small areas, the European states,
with a very comparable culture.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:53.859
When the enlightenment started in Europe,
Russia was governed by Mongols. When America

00:35:53.859 --> 00:36:00.190
was discovered, it was still governed by Mongols.
When the Westphalian treaty was negotiated,

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:07.190
it was about the time that the present Russian
state emerged as a state. It had nothing to

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:14.760
do with Europe. It didn't enter Europe until
another hundred years later. And it's a territory

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:28.290
with nine time zones, so no European state
has had this geographic extent of Russia.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:41.200
So it is a country on an open plain under
threat of attack from both east and -- and

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:52.400
west. It has caused more wars, but it -- than
more countries. It has prevented, on the other

00:36:52.430 --> 00:37:02.050
hand, the domination of the world by Mongols,
by Swedes, by French, by Germans. So it's

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:14.370
a country that is obsessed with its security
and with its identity, which is culturally

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:24.740
European, geographically divided between continents.
So the perception of the current crisis in

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:33.860
Russia is totally different from our perception.
And Putin has 80% of public support. And I've

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:42.550
just been told of a poll that was taken in
February in which that percentage has remained

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:51.350
fairly constant, and where even 50% of the
opposition groups agree with him. Plus all

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:58.350
the others.
So one has to understand these realities.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:09.970
Crimea became part of Ukraine in 1954 only
-- when Ukraine was part of Russia because

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:19.250
Khrushchev assigned it to the Ukraine as part
of a power struggle inside the communist party.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:28.140
But that's not to justify what Russia did.
But it grew out of a -- this whole sequence

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:39.310
grew out of a crisis over how to perceive
the future of the Ukraine, which by Russians

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:46.310
is considered part of their patrimony, which
by Europeans, it's considered just another

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:57.360
state, and over the issue of what arrangements
for its security should be made.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:05.670
I will mention my own (indiscernible) view
of a (indiscernible) issue. If one looks at

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:12.670
the Ukraine as a strategic asset to one side
or the other, the following situation arises:

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:22.880
The -- If the eastern border of NATO is put
at the eastern border of Ukraine, it is within

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:29.900
200 miles of Stalingrad and 300 miles of Moscow,
and that -- given the historic experience

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:37.190
of Russia, it's hard to take. If the security
border of Russia is put at the western border

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:44.570
of Ukraine, it is along the border of Poland,
Hungary, Romania, and that's hard to take

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:51.000
for the West.
So my maybe simple-minded idea is Ukraine

00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:00.000
should be treated like Austria or Finland,
not part of a strategic system, but as a meeting

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000
place, as a place where the two sides can
cooperate. And if they can't cooperate, at

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.240
least not confront each other. That is the
underlying issue.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:23.550
How to get to a solution of it, you can't
-- If one looks at it entirely from the rules

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:28.830
of the Westphalian system, it's not a Putin
problem, it's a Russia problem.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.200
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Right.
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: How does Juan conceive

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:41.240
Russia? And even if one disagrees with my
particular interpretation of it, one has to

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:48.240
start with analysis of what Russia represents,
and then what we represent. Then we can see

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.340
what can be done.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So the reason I asked about

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:58.340
Russia was that one way to deal with Iran
is for Russia to put pressure on Iran. Another

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:04.220
-- as an example, one way to deal with North
Korea is to have China put pressure on North

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:09.760
Korea.
So in a multi-party world, could we see a

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:15.030
situation where the problems of North Korea
are resolved by pressure from China, and the

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:21.460
problems in Iran, which would negatively affect
Russia, are solved by pressure from Russia?

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:27.540
In other words, why don't they police the
terrible behaviors near their borders?

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:33.750
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Well, it's partly a
question of attitude.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:40.750
If we say we know what all the problems of
the world are and we are going to hand out

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.530
assignments, like school assignments, --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Right.

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.369
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: -- and you, Russia,
will take care of Iran, and you, China, take

00:41:46.369 --> 00:41:57.329
care of North Korea, it won't work.
And we have a tendency in that direction.

00:41:57.359 --> 00:42:10.210
But if we ask ourselves, from -- what would
be an interest over Russia towards nuclear

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:16.950
weapons on its borders, or China, from their
point of view, we would probably find that

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:23.950
on this point, what you described earlier,
the factual conclusions would be very close

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:31.609
to each other. That they don't want them,
for their reasons. So then it depends what

00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:39.449
our overall relationship is with these countries.
With Russia now in the middle of a conflict

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:50.619
over Ukraine, cooperation with America is
not a great motive to do anything. So their

00:42:50.619 --> 00:42:59.419
willingness to help vis-�-vis Iran is what
affected. Although no matter what we do, they

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:06.430
cannot want a nuclear -- The same is true
of China and North Korea. If we can develop

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:19.340
together some concept of how we deal with
the emergence of nuclear weapons in the world,

00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:27.340
because whatever our differences are, we should
be together on not having nuclear weapons

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:32.390
become conventional weapons for strategy.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: The math --

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.830
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: That's an opportunity,
actually.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:39.520
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: The math on nuclear weapons
is so horrific for the environment, pollution,

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:45.330
economics, human life, even in the areas that
are not part of the conflict zone, that it

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.900
would be a very, very tragic thing for the
world.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.070
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: I completely agree
with that.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:44:05.030
And it's -- The challenge for political leaders
is how you get from the recognition of a problem

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.710
to its solution.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So I wanted to finish by talking

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:15.349
about leadership and also technology a little
bit, and then have some questions from -- that

00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:24.629
have been submitted by our audience.
When I listen to the political leadership

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:34.180
in the world, they don't speak with this level
of understanding of world order, negotiation,

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:40.690
and so forth. They speak from the standpoint
of their doctrine. So the Chinese speak from,

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:44.270
"We're right and you're wrong." The Americans
says, "We're right and you're wrong," the

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:50.260
Europeans say, "We're right and you're wrong."
You've said before and you write in your book

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:57.230
about the importance of leadership and the
importance of negotiation.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:03.859
Why don't we have such strong leaders today?
Is technology making those leaders harder

00:45:03.859 --> 00:45:10.859
to find or easier to find? In other words,
why don't we have more -- I know you admire

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:16.910
President de Gaulle. I know you admire Lee
Kuan Yew, a number of people like that who

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:21.050
you view as great statesmen.
Why don't we have more leaders who can have

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:26.430
this discussion at this level and drive the
world to a safer place?

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:37.890
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: There are many -- obviously,
there are many reasons.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:47.890
It's not necessarily true that strong leaders
drive the world to a safer place, because

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:58.450
strong leaders may also produce visions that
unsettle the world.

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:06.930
To achieve what you are talking about, you
need strong leaders that recognize the same

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:13.770
problem. They don't have to come up with the
same solutions at first. Then the issue is

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:22.570
also what is a strong leader.
I think a strong leader, it's got to be somebody

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:37.610
who recognizes a vision and is -- and implements
it, even when the facts do not at first make

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:44.830
it obvious.
That's how Google was created. So that's what

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:58.660
happens here in the Valley.
That quality is harder to come by now, partly

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:10.770
because of the technology that you have created.
When I started being concerned with or getting

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:23.810
involved in the periphery of politics, I was
working with Nelson Rockefeller. He suffered

00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:30.869
from the illusion that you become president
by having the best program. So he spent a

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:42.960
lot of time on substance. And I had never
heard of focus groups. But now the technology

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:49.960
has developed to a point in which the -- how
to achieve immediate impact has become so

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:59.650
refined that you don't have time to concentrate
as much as you should on where you're going

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:06.650
to go. And you become so emotionally dependent
on confirmation by these groups and by the

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:15.980
social networks that you really don't know
what you can do as an effort beyond the consensus.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:32.890
And I think that's one of the reasons why
leaders now, candidates now have spent a lot

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:39.890
of their effort on things that are different
from what they have to do when they get into

00:48:40.599 --> 00:48:43.040
office.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: The --

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.329
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Now, there must be
a limit to my tactlessness.

00:48:45.329 --> 00:48:51.460
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: At Google, we like to hear.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:58.460
My final question, and then we'll come to
audience questions, is, when you look forward

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:07.660
and you understand technology from the people
around you and what you see, and you worry,

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:16.300
what do you want the technology industry to
do to make things better? We would answer,

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:21.880
right, so our answer is roughly the following:
We're going to get everyone connected. We're

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:28.410
going to give everyone an Internet connection
and a smartphone, hopefully Android. And they're

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:32.839
going to have all this information. Their
education system is going to be much stronger.

00:49:32.839 --> 00:49:38.280
They're going to be able to have better commerce,
have better globalization. We believe as an

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:43.890
industry that we are in a global movement
to get everyone connected and everyone empowered

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:48.060
so they can each -- each and every one of
them can be much better, much happier, much

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:56.460
better educated, happier, safer, et cetera.
What would you say to that challenge? What

00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:05.740
would you like us to do more of?
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: You know, you're an

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:12.800
important teacher to me of this technology,
because I don't get exposed to it in my normal

00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:20.349
-- and that's what -- and you've been kind
enough to invite me here on a number of occasions,

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:30.060
which has been an eye-opener to me.
What I would -- So when I criticize it, it's

00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:43.270
not the effort that is being done, it's the
implications of having such vast power.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:53.030
I'm -- interconnectedness is, of course -- I
think it's highly desirable. But your theory

00:50:53.050 --> 00:51:03.930
seems to be that everybody draws the same
conclusion from facts. And I think it's the

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:10.450
interpretation of facts and the definition
of their relevance that creates the really

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:21.170
differences. So a level of -- right now, nothing
like the ability that you have created, to

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:27.619
punch a button and to get information, has
ever existed. That's a fantastic development.

00:51:27.619 --> 00:51:44.170
It gives you a power, though, for altering
it, which is bound to get challenged. That's

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:51.170
inherent in the process.
But I'll put that issue aside.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:52:03.520
But when you create a humanity that is used
to this, for whom it becomes common, you could

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:12.080
say it develops a certain laziness about conceptions,
because you can always find out the facts,

00:52:12.119 --> 00:52:21.210
and you don't have to worry about their interconnectedness.
And it's in the interconnectedness of facts.

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:31.330
So what I would like to see you do is to go
from the level that you are now covering to,

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:42.850
okay, what does it mean? And with what other
set of facts and in relation to what objective

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:53.859
is relevant? And build the debate thing into
this. Obviously, if I knew how to do it, I'd

00:52:53.859 --> 00:52:58.589
be a very wealthy man.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You'd work here at Google.

00:52:58.589 --> 00:53:03.599
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: But that is what we

00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:07.490
need.
There's no point in complaining about the

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:16.050
existence of the search engines. They perform
this function of interconnecting us. Of course,

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:26.070
when I look at the order of things you display
about me, I would order it differently.

00:53:26.119 --> 00:53:30.970
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes. There are many people
on that list, Dr. Kissinger.

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:36.780
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: But that's a minor
-- that's --

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:46.860
This is what I would -- this is what I would
look for. This is what we need. And then it

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:56.210
-- we should try to create -- profound thinking
has occurred when people took a body of facts

00:53:56.210 --> 00:54:04.930
and challenged it and developed other theories
about it. And the danger is that when you

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.890
are so good at collecting facts, that you
(indiscernible) things.

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:16.589
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So the answer is, go up to
a higher level of understanding and meaning?

00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:21.730
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Yes. But what does
one really mean by that, one really ought

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:25.700
to discuss that. I can just tell you what
I think the issue is.

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:32.280
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I think we should -- we have
another ten minutes or so. Why don't we take

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.859
some audience questions.
We have an internal system where people have

00:54:35.859 --> 00:54:41.510
contributed questions. And let me read some
of the highest-rated ones.

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:46.349
The first one, in your excellent world order
book, you seem to portray nationalism as an

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:52.329
invented concept, which outlived its usefulness.
Would you agree with this assessment?

00:54:52.329 --> 00:54:57.589
If so, do you -- what would replace nationalism,
in your view?

00:54:57.589 --> 00:55:11.909
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: I don't know that.
That's what many of these crises are about.

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:22.790
And you see in Europe that nationalism declines
for the system, but it still exists within

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.240
the countries.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Right.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:32.710
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: For their internal.
So what I think will happen in the Middle

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:42.950
East is that sometime in this process, some
units will emerge that represent a political

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:53.060
consensus. They may not be nations at all
in our old sense. And in a way, that's what's

00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:58.550
happening around the world. And it's one of
the -- I don't know the answer to that question.

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:04.880
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Another question. This comes
to this question of sort of principle versus

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.970
negotiation.
How can the United States normalize relationship

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:18.400
with enemies, such as Iran, while not alienating
long-term allies, such as Israel and the Saudis?

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:27.200
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Well, when you normalize
relations, it must be because you have said

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:42.320
to yourself that conflict has run into a dead-end
and we want to open a new avenue, a new direction.

00:56:42.359 --> 00:56:50.790
You don't necessarily have to know where the
direction will take you.

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:59.579
I had the good fortune of being able to open
relations with China. I say good fortune because

00:56:59.579 --> 00:57:08.530
these events -- the constellation that made
that possible was not created by Nixon or

00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:23.770
me. We recognized it 
at once.
And so -- and I had other negotiations with

00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:34.490
adversaries, I think the first thing one needs
to know is the adversary's perception of the

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:46.990
world. And so because what one is trying to
reconcile is perceptions that were different

00:57:47.099 --> 00:57:53.619
enough to produce the previous conflict. And
so at a minimum, you want to reduce that conflict

00:57:53.619 --> 00:58:02.099
to a proportion so that you can work together,
or if it goes well, to develop objectives

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:13.480
which you can pursue together.
So there are different ways of doing this.

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:25.079
Some people think that the way to do this
is to take very tiny little steps and -- so

00:58:25.079 --> 00:58:35.799
get used to it. And I used to call it the
salami tactic of negotiation. You slice it

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:46.210
very thin.
My own view -- but this is -- is, I like -- I

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:55.410
would usually tell my opposite number, quite
accurately, what my objective was. Because

00:58:55.450 --> 00:59:02.450
my reasoning would be that there are a lot
of little things that happen all the time,

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:14.609
but if you want to achieve a consensus in
a direction, you should try to achieve a parallel

00:59:14.609 --> 00:59:21.220
interpretation, or at a minimum, the other
side should understand what you're trying

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:24.920
to do and not waste too much time analyzing
you.

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:29.570
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So, in other words, tell them
your world view and what you're trying to

00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:31.500
achieve?
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Tell them, I am here

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:34.480
to achieve this.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:41.480
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: And here is why I think
this might be desirable.

00:59:41.869 --> 00:59:50.849
And you must have experienced this more than
I. When you enter a negotiation, you often

00:59:50.849 --> 00:59:57.849
know what your bottom line is. And some people
will say just get there very slowly, because

00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:07.619
maybe you don't ever have to reach it. I usually
offered my bottom line right away.

01:00:07.619 --> 01:00:11.400
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Right up-front. Just right
up-front. You say, "This is what I want."

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.880
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Well, maybe 5%.
[ Laughter ]

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.950
To have a little margin so that it doesn't
look like an ultimatum.

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:23.990
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: (indiscernible) country, too.
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: But there must be lawyers

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:30.990
in this group who will tell me the exact opposite.
But that would be my approach.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.490
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Another question from our
audience.

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:42.490
Where do you see the USA-Cuba relationship
in five years, and 25 years?

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:59.180
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: They will be (indiscernible).
I don't have a -- the answer would have to

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:03.570
be, but where we will be in 25 years.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: With Cuba.

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:07.579
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: In two years.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: 25 years with Cuba.

01:01:07.579 --> 01:01:14.579
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: With Cuba.
I don't think Cuba is a big problem.

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:22.330
[ Laughter ]
I really don't. It's a -- the problem which

01:01:23.369 --> 01:01:35.500
we have talked ourselves into. But most of
the rest of the world doesn't care what our

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:42.170
relation with Cuba is.
I think we will -- But I would expect that

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:55.900
Cuba will not be a revolutionary state, that
we will have a normal relationship with Cuba.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:09.960
But Cuba is not a factor in world politics.
And it has some impact in Latin America, which

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:20.280
disappears once our relations are normalized.
It will be an advanced Caribbean state.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.680
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Let's have our final audience
question.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:32.089
The -- This is about domestic policy in America.
And as you know, there has been a great deal

01:02:32.089 --> 01:02:37.560
of discussion about the role of the presidency
and the Congress.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.839
Domestic policy -- politics in the U.S. is
becoming increasingly polarized. How does

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:47.579
this affect our relations and affect the rest
of the world?

01:02:47.579 --> 01:02:56.859
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: I think the polarization
is very bad for the relations with the rest

01:02:56.859 --> 01:03:00.530
of the world. Partly symbolically, and partly
actually.

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:07.530
Symbolically, because for the rest of the
world, America always has represented a certain

01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:15.000
elemental force which may do a lot of things
that are weird, but in the end, comes together

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.890
on great objectives.
And in a way, it does. When I was in government,

01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:28.960
we were going crazy about the energy problem.
And a lot of projects were started then in

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:39.290
the '70s that everybody said, well, it can
never work. And it didn't work then. But 30

01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:51.290
years later, it did work. And the energy revolution
is a huge event in our time which we take

01:03:51.440 --> 01:04:00.460
sort of for granted.
But we now have a deadline in government.

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:07.460
When I first entered government in the Nixon
administration, I thought life was horrible,

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:18.920
because we had the Vietnam protests. But still,
there were a certain number of senators to

01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:24.349
whom any president could go and say, "The
country needs this," and no matter what the

01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:34.170
party was, you could count on them to try
to shape it. Now, all the leading -- all the

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:43.610
leaders are sort of wrapped up in their own
constituencies and the constant need for re-election,

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:54.859
that this safety net for the government is
-- it's disappearing. Partly because so many

01:04:54.859 --> 01:05:03.499
people now think that you can become president
without serving any time in the Congress,

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:11.730
so that that's just a stepping-stone for them
to greater things. That's a problem we have

01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:23.570
to overcome. And I have to tell you right
away, I -- it's one thing to say there's a

01:05:23.579 --> 01:05:28.310
problem. That doesn't mean that one necessarily
knows all the answers to it, or any of the

01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:31.510
answers to?
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Well, perhaps we'll end up

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:35.869
with some Chinese views, that some problems
can be solved now, and some problems will

01:05:35.869 --> 01:05:42.869
be solved in the future.
I think you all know why this is an extraordinary

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:47.359
man and an extraordinary leader. And it's
extraordinary to me -- using "extraordinary"

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:54.060
a lot -- to have you here for a third time.
Thank you for your advice, your suggestions.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:57.810
And I can assure you that Googlers will be
working on working on meaning.

01:05:57.810 --> 01:06:01.330
So thank you very much, Dr. Kissinger.
&gt;&gt;Dr. Henry Kissinger: Thank you very much.
