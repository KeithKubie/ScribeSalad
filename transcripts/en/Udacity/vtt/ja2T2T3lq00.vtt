00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.350
So, we have these two festivals.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:01.705
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:01.705 --> 00:00:04.560
&gt;&gt; And these two attendees. Missy Music and Johnny Concert.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.650
&gt;&gt; I get it. We want to add this

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.130
like column, or this field onto our attendee object.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.905
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:11.905 --> 00:00:15.872
&gt;&gt; I, I want to just add a field? But I feel like something special has

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:19.018
to happen to get it to talk to, you know, and know about festivals or.

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:22.190
&gt;&gt; Well that's what so great about creating relationships in Salesforce.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.170
It's just as easy as everything else we've already been doing. So,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.740
you can go to the Objects Setup and just create a new field.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.140
&gt;&gt; New field?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.370
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.830
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Is this where the magic comes in in choosing a field type?

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.250
&gt;&gt; Right. And there's two types of relationship

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.280
fields in Salesforce. Lookup and Master Detail. we can

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.960
go into more detail about that later but,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.850
why don't we choose master detail just for now.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.760
&gt;&gt; Okay. You will tell me later?

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.060
&gt;&gt; I will, I promise.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.000
&gt;&gt; So,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.600
master detail relationship. Relationship makes sense, I like that and next.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.140
okay. So I'm guessing. Yeah, I'm going to relate this to festival.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.920
&gt;&gt; Exactly, nice.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what's all this about?

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.820
&gt;&gt; So again this is just going to create the label

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.560
for this field that'll be on the record detail page.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.890
&gt;&gt; This is like our column name over here?

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.420
&gt;&gt; Just like the column name, exactly.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.974
&gt;&gt; And so festival is good Okay,

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:23.510
it auto-did that. That was nice. So description,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.240
the name of the festival the attendee's going to.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.660
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.350
&gt;&gt; Okay, what's this one all about? Child relationship name.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.700
&gt;&gt; So again, that's just a unique API

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.490
name that's going to live in the database. It's more

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.510
for the code side of things, or if we

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.560
were trying to build something off of child records.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.000
&gt;&gt; And then should I just leave everything else?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.890
&gt;&gt; Leave everything else as default.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.390
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.960
we'll add the fields to the page layout?

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.340
&gt;&gt; So, it's going to automatically add it to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.200
the page layout because it's a required field.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.870
&gt;&gt; So, what's going on with this? Add

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.280
custom related list. So, what this is going to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.360
do is it's going to add a list of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.180
attendees to the record or the festival record.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.970
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.120
&gt;&gt; just like how in Attendees you can see

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.169
which festival they're going to go to, when you go

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.630
to the festival record you'll see a list of

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.470
all the attendees that are going to this festival.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.470
&gt;&gt;

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.710
Cool. And I can hit Save. oh, it's getting, it's getting mad at me.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.110
&gt;&gt; So, it's throwing this error because with master detail, when you create

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.880
this relationship, it becomes a required field. And since there are already two

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.420
&gt;&gt; Required field means like the attendee needs to have a festival?

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.120
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.370
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.630
&gt;&gt; And since there're already two attendees that were created, and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.660
they aren't related to a festival, you can't create this relationship.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.860
&gt;&gt; So, it's like protecting us from having

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.890
all these attendees that don't make sense anymore.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:39.610
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.780
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.870
&gt;&gt; And so, the way to get around this is, let's create a

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.480
look up relationship first because, in that case it won't be a required field.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.570
&gt;&gt; And then we can add them and then change it.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.080
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.550
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.740
&gt;&gt; So, let's go through that one more

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.030
time but choose look up relationship this time.
