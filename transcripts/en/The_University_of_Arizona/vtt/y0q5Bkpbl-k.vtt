00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.250
This building means
so many things.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.140
It means keeping a commitment.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.730
It means bringing better, more
efficient, and more coordinated

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.350
care for patients.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.230
It means giving our
faculty a home that they

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.570
can be really proud to work in.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.570
And it means a real
wonderful investment

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.850
in the city of Tucson.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.010
Well, the great thing
about a facility like this

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.350
is that it brings together
not only primary care,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.070
but subspecialties in a place
where patients have the most

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.390
convenience.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.650
So they meet with their
primary care physician.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.400
But if they need attention
from specialists,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.820
they don't have to go all over
town to get that kind of help.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.655
This will allow us to invest
in the technologies that

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:48.030
are going to make health care
easier so that life can get

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.450
better for our patients, really
emphasizing the human aspect

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.230
of health care.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.720
And this is what this building
does because it feels really

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.350
like home.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.140
And that's what we want
health care to feel like.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590
Another remarkable thing
about this building

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.330
is just part of
this transformation

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.700
of academic medicine
here in Tucson.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.500
And so this gives
us an opportunity

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.420
to take advantage of
all those discoveries,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.690
and new technologies, and
even new models of care,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.229
and apply them to the people
here in Tucson and of course,

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.770
all the people who
get referred to us

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.660
from around the state and
even this part of the country.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.840
So it's really an
exciting time for us

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.440
to be opening this new building.
