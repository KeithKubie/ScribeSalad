00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:10.438
Energy is not easy to define.

00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:12.053
Things have energy,

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:12.960
but you can't hold

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.822
a bushel of energy in your hands.

00:00:14.822 --> 00:00:16.483
You can see what it does,

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.804
but you can't see it directly.

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:20.615
There are different types of energy,

00:00:20.615 --> 00:00:21.916
but the differences between them

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:25.692
are manifested only in how they make stuff behave.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.045
We do know that the total amount

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.165
of all the different types of energy in the universe

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:31.366
is always the same.

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.546
And, for chemists, two important types of energy

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:35.107
are chemical potential energy

00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:36.886
and kinetic energy.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:39.721
Potential energy is energy waiting to happen.

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:41.801
Think of a stretched rubber band.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:42.629
If you cut it,

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.008
all that potential energy

00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:46.743
gets converted to kinetic energy,

00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:49.599
which is registered by you as pain.

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:50.850
Like a stretched rubber band,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.848
chemical bonds also store energy,

00:00:52.848 --> 00:00:54.102
and when those bonds are broken,

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:55.603
that potential energy gets converted

00:00:55.603 --> 00:00:57.116
to other types of energy,

00:00:57.116 --> 00:00:58.435
like heat or light,

00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:00.850
or gets used to make different bonds.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.497
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion,

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.623
and molecules are always moving.

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:07.614
They're not necessarily going somewhere,

00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:08.939
though they could be,

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.015
but they are vibrating,

00:01:10.015 --> 00:01:10.517
stretching,

00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:10.932
bending,

00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:12.372
and/or spinning.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.122
Take methane,

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:14.269
which is four hydrogens

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:15.678
attached to a central carbon,

00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:16.624
as an example.

00:01:16.624 --> 00:01:17.501
Drawn on paper,

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:19.799
it's just a still tetrahedron.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.467
But in real life, it's a jiggling mess.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:23.807
The kinetic energy of molecules

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:25.720
is exactly the same type of energy

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.120
as the energy you have

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.434
when you're moving around,

00:01:28.434 --> 00:01:30.058
except that you can be still

00:01:30.058 --> 00:01:31.820
and molecules can't.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.315
If you suck the kinetic energy

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:34.512
out of a group of molecules,

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:35.770
they'll move less,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.266
but they'll never fully stop.

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.017
Now, in any group of molecules,

00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:41.854
some will have more kinetic energy than others.

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:42.555
And if we calculate

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:44.520
the average kinetic energy of the group,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.334
we'd have a number mathematically related to

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:48.659
temperature.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.069
So, the more kinetic energy

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.376
a group of molecules has,

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:52.876
the higher its temperature.

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:54.562
And that means that on a hot day,

00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:56.231
the molecules in the air around you

00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:58.017
are spinning, stretching, bending,

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.196
and generally shooting around much faster

00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:02.322
than on a cold day.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:04.275
Now, hot and cold, by the way,

00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:05.645
are relative terms.

00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:07.141
They're always used to compare

00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:08.649
one thing to something else.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.869
So, on that hot summer day,

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.814
the air molecules have more kinetic energy

00:02:11.814 --> 00:02:14.604
than the molecules in your skin.

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:16.979
So, when those air molecules crash into you,

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:18.741
they transfer some of their energy

00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:20.493
to the molecules in your skin,

00:02:20.493 --> 00:02:22.811
and you feel that as heat.

00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:23.581
On a cold day,

00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.757
the air molecules have less kinetic energy

00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:27.108
than the molecules in your skin,

00:02:27.108 --> 00:02:29.481
so when you crash into those air molecules,

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:30.726
you actually transfer

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:33.232
some of your kinetic energy to them,

00:02:33.232 --> 00:02:35.973
and you feel that as cold.

00:02:35.973 --> 00:02:38.597
You can trace the path of energy around you.

00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:40.243
Try it at your next cookout.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:41.148
You burn charcoal

00:02:41.148 --> 00:02:43.145
and the release of that chemical potential energy

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:45.725
shows up as extreme heat and light.

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:47.273
The heat then makes the molecules

00:02:47.273 --> 00:02:50.056
of your burgers, your hot dogs, or your vegetables

00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:52.309
vibrate until their own bonds break

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:54.649
and new chemical structures are formed.

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.646
Too much heat and you have a charred mess;

00:02:56.646 --> 00:02:58.330
just enough and you have dinner.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.454
Once in your body,

00:02:59.454 --> 00:03:01.075
the food molecules in your delicious,

00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:02.297
or charred,

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:03.829
dinner get broken down,

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:04.816
and the energy released

00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:07.346
is used to either keep you alive right now

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:10.339
or it's stored for later in different molecules.

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:11.752
As night falls,

00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:13.217
the hot summer air cools

00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:15.855
and the flow of energy into you slows.

00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:18.551
Then, as the air reaches your skin temperature,

00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:19.812
for the briefest of moments,

00:03:19.812 --> 00:03:21.141
the flow stops.

00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:22.395
And then it starts up again

00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:23.640
in the opposite direction

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.358
as energy leaves the warmer surface of your skin

00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:29.058
to return to the universe around you,

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:31.726
that energy, neither created nor destroyed,

00:03:31.726 --> 00:03:33.620
but ever shape-shifting,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.230
the chameleon phoenix of our physical world.
