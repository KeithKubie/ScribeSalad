00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.400
- [Instructor] We've talked about things

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.850
that might drive inequality,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.440
things that Thomas Piketty

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.100
refers to as forces of divergence,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.910
but I always think about or at least what

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.650
some of what he cites is
forces of convergence,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.140
so forces of convergence

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.100
or things that might make
the world a more equal place,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.150
and the primary one that he cites

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.850
is one that's very close to my heart,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.220
and this is the spread of knowledge.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.560
Spread of knowledge.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.140
And what we have here
is a couple of charts

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.980
that show the spread of knowledge

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.920
at least on a macro basis,
on a regional basis,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.930
and show how it has been a driver

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.960
of starting to equalize global output.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.210
As we start in 1700, we see that,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.290
it's going from 1700 through
the Industrial Revolution,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.450
frankly as the West was
developing or industrializing,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.880
the West, Europe and America,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.880
became a larger and larger
percentage of global output,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.750
and Asia became a smaller
and smaller percentage.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.490
But then as you go into the
second half of the 20th century

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.623
and into the 21st century,
you see the dynamic change.

00:01:11.497 --> 00:01:13.660
Asia's percentage of world output

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.720
is increasing more and more,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.070
and that's arguably happening

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.260
because you've had a
transfer of knowledge,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.640
a diffusion of knowledge from the West

00:01:23.662 --> 00:01:26.360
to the East from modern
manufacturing techniques

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.780
and design techniques and
engineering techniques

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.240
and whatever else, and that's
why as we are in the beginning

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.530
of the 21st century Asia is turning into

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.010
a major industrial powerhouse.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.260
They've learned from the
West and in some dimensions

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.750
are even improving on some of
the knowledge from the West

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.810
to make themselves more
and more productive.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.160
So at least on a regional basis,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.100
this shows that the world
is becoming more equal

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.000
because of this spread of knowledge.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.050
And we could also see it
on a per capita basis,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.343
so this right over here,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.630
they're essentially plotting over time

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.710
per capita GDP as a
percentage of world average,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.900
so the world average right over here

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.920
is obviously 100% of the world average,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.140
so that's why it's just
a flat line at 100%.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.260
And we see as we go through
the Industrial Revolution,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.740
Europe and America, essentially the West,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.780
the West, its per capita GDP

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.560
becomes a larger and larger percentage

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.100
of the average per
capita GDP for the globe,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.470
but that was true until recently,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.490
until the last few decades.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.120
The last few decades as a
percentage, it's gone down.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.600
Now that doesn't mean that
per capita GDP is going down.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.560
It just means that its share

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.510
as a percentage of world
average is going down,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.830
and that's really because
Asia's per capita GDP

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.220
has been growing even faster

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.740
because of, once again,
that spread of knowledge.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.100
So at least this idea
of spread of knowledge,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.950
it does seem to be playing
out at a regional level.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.290
It's bringing, at least right now,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.700
it seems like Asia's participating
much more than Africa,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.780
but it's starting to bring the non-West,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.220
the East, more in line with the West

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.310
in terms of protective capacity

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.137
and wealth per person and per capita GDP,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.960
however you want to look at it.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.990
Now an interesting question,
that's at a regional level.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.120
What about an individual level?

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.570
And we'll talk about that
more in the next video.
