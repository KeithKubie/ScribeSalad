00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.330
You're listening to radiolab from New York public radio, public radio, W,

2
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.230
N Y,

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.150
c n n p r m Jetta boom Rod.

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.300
And I'm Robert Krulwich and this is radio lab. You ever wondered why it is, um,

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.040
that all living things die? I do wonder about that actually,

6
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.220
which it keeps me up at night, which always leads me to the next question.

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.890
Do we have to,

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.660
do I have to the topic of our show as a matter of fact and the natural place to

9
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:40.260
begin to look for an answer. [inaudible] is in a garage.

10
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.440
[inaudible] so here we are in your garage or ar in my garage.

11
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:54.180
The owner of this particular garage is one Leonard Hayflick. He is a biologist.

12
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.020
He takes me to the corner where he's got this about. So what,

13
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.450
describe what we're looking at here. Well,

14
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:05.220
what we're looking at is I barrel shaped a divides metal canister,

15
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.720
metal.

16
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.720
It side is shaped kind of like a thermos except big opening lid.

17
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.340
He twits off the top and that

18
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.940
out comes all of this smoke dry ice from Halloween is what it looks. Well,

19
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.890
this liquid hydrogen is used in a lot of movies.

20
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.120
He reaches his hand into the liquid nitrogen fog right into the bowels of this

21
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.640
canister and pulls out. And this is what I'd come to see.

22
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.390
Those are what some test tubes,

23
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.470
who boobs and which the samples are kept immediately there not much to look at.

24
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.990
If you know what's in there, it's almost holy. Each tube has millions,

25
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.190
a frozen human cells in there.

26
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.280
And these cells have completely changed how we think about mortality and

27
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.150
mortality. And You keep it in your garage. Yes. Why? I mean,

28
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:01.950
I think it's pretty cool, but why? Why it goes,

29
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:04.830
nobody else think of looking here. Oh, okay. Well, I want,

30
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.860
I certainly wouldn't divulge your address or anything, but just don't tell him.

31
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.950
No, of course I wouldn't, but it's in California is all I'll say. Well,

32
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:13.620
where else would you want me to put it in mind? But still, I don't know. I mean,

33
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:15.960
it's, uh, I imagined something like this.

34
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:19.890
You would find it in the middle third for Leonard Hayflick about 50 years ago.

35
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.600
I got the backstory, actually not in California. In Philly. Sound check.

36
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.360
Do you want to tell me where we are?

37
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.440
Where we're sitting on the 12th floor of the William Penn House in Philadelphia,

38
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:32.131
Pennsylvania,

39
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:37.131
which happens to be my mother's apartment who has just celebrated her hundredth

40
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:40.560
birthday just that day. Appropriately enough. In any case,

41
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:45.150
let's rewind to the 50s biology was facing a problem. Basic problem.

42
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.890
How do you study human cells? Cells are us.

43
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.540
It is what we are, but you can't exactly put a microscope up to your wrist.

44
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.660
I will. You know, I guess you could, but I wouldn't say it's impossible,

45
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.910
but it's certainly highly impractical what you can do instead,

46
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.200
and Hayflick was among the first to perfect. This is it. Well,

47
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:05.960
he explained it to me.

48
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.960
<v 1>If I take a tiny biopsy from any part of your anatomy that you're willing to</v>

49
00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:15.010
surrender to me, like say a flick of mine, like my wrist, your wrist,

50
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.930
kind of anywhere you want, the tip of your nose and to be your toe.

51
00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:18.980
I don't care where it is.

52
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.070
And then you raise a pyramid of skin by grabbing onto the tip of a hair,

53
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.510
pull it up, and then with the other hand, you'd take a sterile scalpel and y

54
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.200
the tip of that pyramid of skin off.

55
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.570
And I drop it into a test tube and I introduce an enzyme preparation called

56
00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:41.870
trypsin. And that material dissolves

57
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.000
<v 2>the cement that holds all the cells together.</v>

58
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.940
Think of your tissue as a brick wall.

59
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.560
And once I dropped that brick wall into my test of I need to dissolve the

60
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:54.370
mortar,

61
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.203
<v 1>right?</v>

62
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.360
And now I have your individual cells NFI feed them and treat them nicely.

63
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.140
They will divide

64
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.083
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

65
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.100
<v 1>Each cell produced two cells.</v>

66
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.883
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

67
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.900
<v 1>Each cell produced two cells to sell, to sell.</v>

68
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.010
Did you do the Badmouth?

69
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.470
You find that they'll cover the city of New York in about three weeks?

70
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.590
<v 0>I mean, you know, that's if you had a big enough petri dish. In any case,</v>

71
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:26.140
this process, it's called cell culturing,

72
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.050
is the simplest thing in the world these days.

73
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:32.800
I mean modern biologists can do it with their eyes close the back in Hayflick's

74
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:37.690
Day in the fifties it was very fuzzy because no one really understood the

75
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:41.710
mechanics of it. No one knew exactly what a cell liked or what it didn't like.

76
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:45.410
And so the people that were really good at getting the cells to divide from two

77
00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:49.640
and four and eight and 16 whatever. Yes, they, it was like they had the touch.

78
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.410
<v 1>They had what was called a green thumb.</v>

79
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.790
<v 0>There was a mystique about them because, you know, don't forget,</v>

80
00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:58.040
this was the early days. Biology,

81
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.080
<v 1>biology at that time was kind of a black art.</v>

82
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.521
Well,

83
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:07.810
I'm interested in the use of the term black art because that attribute was given

84
00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:12.811
to the field by a single individual who dominated the field for about 20 or 30

85
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:14.920
years. His name was Alexis corral.

86
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.710
He believed that the contamination of tissue cultures with airborne bacteria

87
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.800
could be eliminated or prevented by maintaining sterile circumstances.

88
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.680
That in his mind included everything being painted black

89
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.400
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

90
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.830
<v 1>no, don't ask me the rationale for that because I can't explain it. So Guthrie.</v>

91
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.040
I love it exactly.

92
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.630
All of his technicians on he himself were dressed from head to foot and black

93
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.990
and he had a gallery around the lab where reporters could wander to see these

94
00:05:50.451 --> 00:05:55.451
mystical black figures roaming the laboratory and keep Glor doing strange things

95
00:05:56.781 --> 00:06:01.280
with strange implements and ending up with cells growing.

96
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.040
It must've seemed like wishcraft on.

97
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.020
It didn't seem like they believed it was witchcraft,

98
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.110
especially because Alexis corral claimed to have kept a chick heart alive for 46

99
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:18.380
years at chick heart. Yes, the heart of a baby chicken.

100
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.300
It was a fragment of tissue from the chick heart, so for 46 years,

101
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:26.750
the cells divided and divided every couple of days. That's what was alleged.

102
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.620
Now, 46 years is a long time. Right?

103
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.260
So scientists thought that if they've gone this long,

104
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:35.120
they'll probably go forever

105
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.710
because of corral and a couple other scientists.

106
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.180
It was thought that cells are immortal under the proper conditions,

107
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.610
the grow indefinitely and corrals.

108
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:48.980
Little chicken heart seemed to be proof of this.

109
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.830
It just kept spewing new cells,

110
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.450
which he keep dividing into new bottles. The New York Post said, quote,

111
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.020
if all of the cells produced by Dr Carell from his cultured chicken heart were

112
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.190
kept together,

113
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.700
they would produce a rooster that could cross the Atlantic Ocean in a single

114
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.680
shoe.

115
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.513
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

116
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.220
<v 1>Well they wish I'd come up with that myself. Now,</v>

117
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.940
was that a quote that was made lovingly or admiringly or was that a sort of

118
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.570
sneers made to sell the New York Post, but two people bought it,

119
00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:31.730
I guess is what I'm asking. You're darn right. They bought it until it was tour

120
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.560
by me. Right. Well, that's the story that I want to get to next.

121
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.210
It happened by accident.

122
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.190
He did not set out to torpedo the rooster or the whole idea of cellular

123
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:47.800
immortality. It just kind of happened. He was in the lab.

124
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:51.160
It was the 50s he was just a kid and he becomes worried.

125
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.170
This was an ordinary worry at the time that his little cells would become

126
00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:58.000
contaminated. I knew at the time,

127
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.980
the cultured normal human tissue from adults,

128
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.450
you might grow simultaneously unwanted viruses because in adults,

129
00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:10.930
the viruses would sometimes sneak into the cells and hide there.

130
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.770
And I didn't want, of course, my cultures to be contaminated with these viruses.

131
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.470
So I zeroed in on human fetal tissue,

132
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.490
human fetal tissue as in from abortions,

133
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.480
sorry to ask an ignorant question, but it w abortion at that time was,

134
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.870
was it anything like the crazy political thornbush that is now no farm or

135
00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:34.690
rational? It was actually quite easy. He says he just picked up the phone,

136
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:38.680
called my friends at the University of Pennsylvania and said I want an fetuses

137
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:43.630
whenever they were surgically aborted and as you might expect when you put your

138
00:08:43.631 --> 00:08:48.490
order in for fetal tissue, you know, not when the phone will ring.

139
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.920
He never knew when the shipments would arrive.

140
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:55.810
I would receive maybe one feed is one week and then two weeks later, one.

141
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.130
So

142
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.210
<v 0>to keep track of things and this turns out to be key. He kept a log.</v>

143
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.130
Every time he'd get a new shipment,

144
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.300
he would jot down the arrival day and then drop the cells into the flask,

145
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.090
washed in divine, do the whole deal.

146
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.790
And then every couple of weeks he would come and check on them.

147
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.850
And that's when it started.

148
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.260
I began to realize that some of the cultures are unhappy. They stopped dividing.

149
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.060
At first it was just one, one batch. What were you thinking at this point? Uh,

150
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.390
I didn't know what to think because it's just an observation and it was just one

151
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:31.860
batch batch a, let's call it. Yeah. All right. No biggie. I'll see how it goes.

152
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:32.650
Come back.

153
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.470
<v 5>Okay. Uh,</v>

154
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:38.470
and a month later I find out that not only a is still not doing its thing,

155
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.140
but B and c aren't either.

156
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.630
<v 0>Now three batches of cells had gone. Caput said to myself,</v>

157
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.980
well that's peculiar.

158
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.070
Peculiar because here he'd done the same with these cells as he done with all

159
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:54.150
the others, put them in the same glasses, same solution, same conditions,

160
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.910
didn't add up. Now I have to find out what the cause is.

161
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.710
So I'll go back and look at my records.

162
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.760
And that is when it smacks him in the face.

163
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.870
What the thing that all three batches of sales hadn't come in,

164
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:11.760
and he knew this because he'd kept the logs, is that they were the oldest,

165
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.150
so to speak. He'd received each batch of fetal tissue from the hospital,

166
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:21.750
received it from the hospital roughly nine months ago.

167
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.760
At nine months or thereabouts,

168
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.550
they just kinda hit a wall and they stopped divide,

169
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.720
but the ones received one month, two, one three, one for my apartment.

170
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.080
Six months ago though sales were doing just fine, perfect, beautiful,

171
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.190
and he kept seeing this simultaneously.

172
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.840
Two thoughts enter his mind thought number one, this can't be an accident.

173
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.800
If it was a accident, it should be random thought. Number two,

174
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.090
wait a second. This has to be an accident because I had been taught by expert.

175
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:57.360
Its cells are in, they will grow forever. All right,

176
00:10:57.361 --> 00:10:58.380
fast forward a few months.

177
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:01.920
Those two conflicting thoughts are still fighting and out in Hayflick's mind.

178
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.320
Along comes the annual biology conference, your scientific meeting in the world.

179
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.380
That time the meeting was held in Atlantic city.

180
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.860
Hayflick and a few friends decided to hop in a car and crashed the meeting

181
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:15.630
because the featured speaker was a guy.

182
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:18.630
Hey flick really admired guy by the name of Ted puck

183
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.380
<v 5>because I want to hear what he has to say and I'm gonna.</v>

184
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.860
If I can get enough guts, I'm gonna be asking a question. Hmm.

185
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:30.440
I remembered this length like it was that big hole. The housing people,

186
00:11:30.441 --> 00:11:31.730
I'm sure it's in saturation,

187
00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:36.731
but huge or lots of people and I'm somewhere in a little listening to this talk.

188
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.920
You see the match previously developed single cells and at the end as is

189
00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:45.290
customary ask for questions. Are there any questions?

190
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.960
I timidly raised my hand.

191
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.530
<v 0>So yes. The young fellow at the center here you,</v>

192
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.490
<v 5>yes. And I ask him the question, Dr. Park,</v>

193
00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.510
have you ever found that the cells that you culture stop dividing?

194
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.480
<v 0>Did you want to give him a kind of that Gotcha. What were you thinking? I want,</v>

195
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.610
yeah,

196
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.690
<v 5>well I was ready to publish. I wanted to know whether I'm in trouble,</v>

197
00:12:09.691 --> 00:12:14.691
whether I have an artifact on my hands that nobody has seen because I do it

198
00:12:15.181 --> 00:12:18.540
right. I see. I'm still worried. Got It.

199
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.250
And so he says he looks at me, you know, like in the video.

200
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.580
Well of course the cell stopped dividing the occasion.

201
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.790
Of course I lose my sales occasionally,

202
00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:33.680
but I simply go back to the freezer and reconstitute.

203
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.680
<v 0>Meaning that when the cells stop dividing, which he just had been in,</v>

204
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.490
they do all the time. He just said that something happened. I don't know what.

205
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.160
I'll just go back to the freezer and get more. Well, that's not right,

206
00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:45.530
because if they stopped dividing, they might've just died.

207
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.130
It's not that he was cheating, it's that he thought he had screwed up. Oh,

208
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.670
then I know it was a Gotcha. Well, he didn't yell. Gotcha. Right at that moment,

209
00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:53.660
he just sat back down.

210
00:12:53.661 --> 00:12:58.661
But now he knew it was real because even the brilliant Ted puck had seen it too,

211
00:12:58.821 --> 00:13:00.920
but like everyone else for the past 60 years,

212
00:13:00.921 --> 00:13:05.510
he just hadn't recognized it for what it was.

213
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.630
I imagine in labs all over the country,

214
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.610
there must've been a lot of moments when cells stopped dividing and at every one

215
00:13:13.611 --> 00:13:16.760
of those moments you're saying the thought that popped into the technician's

216
00:13:16.761 --> 00:13:18.550
mind is I've got

217
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.390
<v 5>absolutely.</v>

218
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.720
<v 0>That seems like a crazy kind of mass delusion.</v>

219
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.940
<v 5>It's called dog Gerry know the definition of the word dog. Yeah,</v>

220
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.620
I've heard that word before. That's it.

221
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.610
The concept of mortality was absent from people's minds.

222
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.120
<v 0>Well, wait, if they didn't understand the idea of mortality,</v>

223
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.120
then w how did they,

224
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.680
the scientists explain getting older and moving towards death for pre

225
00:13:42.681 --> 00:13:43.514
torpedoing.

226
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.810
<v 6>Yeah. Radiation. What? Radiation?</v>

227
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.360
<v 0>Well, no, seriously.</v>

228
00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:53.450
I mean it was this idea that like stuff is happening outside the cell,

229
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.610
that the radiation is bombarding the cell,

230
00:13:55.611 --> 00:13:57.800
like gamma rays and Alpha rays and these kinds of things,

231
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.080
and then that somehow ages the cell.

232
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.350
So the trigger is outside the being not inside this owl.

233
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.820
<v 5>So my discovery and I pointed it out in that first paper,</v>

234
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.630
was to indicate that it's in the cell, not outside the cell.

235
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.130
That's where the action is.

236
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.150
<v 0>Hayflick argued that somewhere in the cell there,</v>

237
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.190
there's a counter one too. There's gotta be for something.

238
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.030
[inaudible] cell is the keeping track eight, nine,

239
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.140
10 11 because after about nine months of happy dividing in a petri dish,

240
00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:31.370
when the cell gets two 50 divisions, sometimes the few takes more.

241
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:33.470
If you takes less than 50 is the average.

242
00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:38.471
And when it reaches 54 45 little counter inside cell eight 49 50 says,

243
00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.970
50 is the magic number. Where did this number 50 come from?

244
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.940
<v 5>You'll have to ask God that question</v>

245
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:47.981
<v 0>nonetheless.</v>

246
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:52.970
Hayflick not God has his name forever attached to that number because it's

247
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:55.460
become known as the Hayflick limit.

248
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.713
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

249
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:01.531
<v 0>Now,</v>

250
00:15:01.531 --> 00:15:04.950
one of the interesting things Hayflick told me while we looked at a secret stash

251
00:15:04.951 --> 00:15:09.600
of fetal cells in his garage is that there is a way to tinker with the cellular

252
00:15:09.601 --> 00:15:12.270
counter. If you lower the temperature by say,

253
00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:17.190
putting the cells in liquid nitrogen as he has the dividing one will get slower

254
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.920
and slower and slower.

255
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.020
<v 7>I don't know,</v>

256
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.280
<v 0>until it stops at 250 degrees below zero,</v>

257
00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:29.790
the cells will not divide and they won't die.

258
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.830
They'll just wait for as long as you keep them frozen.

259
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.720
The cells I have in my freezer, I've been frozen for,

260
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.470
uh, 44 years, is that make them long.

261
00:15:43.471 --> 00:15:48.471
These cells are the longest frozen normal human cells in the world.

262
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.200
The fetal cells he's talking about incidentally,

263
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.960
are the ones that he used to discover the Hayflick limit.

264
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.920
He calls it WWI 38. What do we know

265
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:05.510
about the mother of the fetus that created WUI 38 she was a Swedish woman and

266
00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:13.101
she wanted an abortion because she had many children and was very poor.

267
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.840
Her husband was not a good father. And uh,

268
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.750
that's where this tissue came from. Here's the kicker.

269
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.780
After the Hayflick limit experiments, these cells,

270
00:16:24.781 --> 00:16:28.860
this particular strain was used to incubate and produce vaccines,

271
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.320
all different kinds. Polio, German, measles, measles, mumps,

272
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.620
rabies. In anybody born in the last 50 years,

273
00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:42.350
who's had any of these vaccines has had these cells in their body.

274
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.340
Numbers of people who have benefited from these vaccines now exceed 1 billion

275
00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:51.330
people. That's billion with a B billion with a B.

276
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:57.650
One aborted child creates a fleet of cells that vaccinate a billion people.

277
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.360
Think about that for a second.

278
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.300
And is it true that, that you have a cell line from, is it your daughter? Yes.

279
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.560
I also have cells in there from the amnion of my daughters, Susan Hayflick.

280
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.230
Do you keep them for purely scientific greens or is it sort of like stamp

281
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:16.890
collecting? You have them I,

282
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:22.010
well it would be is a scientist now herself and so I'll probably give the

283
00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:25.160
ampules to her so she can do with them. My true what she wishes.

284
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.100
But You keep them because it's your daughter mostly? Yes, mostly. Yeah, sure.

285
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.680
Yeah. That's really sweet. Here's the interesting thing, scientifically,

286
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.900
if you were to warm these cells up, give them some food.

287
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.580
<v 7>Oh,</v>

288
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.660
<v 0>they start to divide again by six and not only that,</v>

289
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:45.950
they pick up right where they left off. And even if you froze them again,

290
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.470
say the 1615 doubling 16 and kept them that way for a thousand million years,

291
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.090
wouldn't matter. Because as soon as you unfroze them off,

292
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.120
they'd go 1718 1920 on their way to 52 23 without missing a beat.

293
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.790
<v 5>What does that tell you? Tells you that the cells,</v>

294
00:18:06.791 --> 00:18:08.920
remember they have a memory

295
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.990
<v 0>somehow the cell always remembers where it is in the count to 50 oh self-care</v>

296
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.050
count. How do they do that? Oh, that's, and that was the next big question.

297
00:18:18.051 --> 00:18:21.440
So we set about to do a number of experiments. However,

298
00:18:21.441 --> 00:18:26.441
the next big breakthrough came in 1971 and not by Hayflick while he was doing

299
00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:31.100
his experiments in Philly, halfway across the world, the very same moment,

300
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:35.570
a Russian named Alexia love knockoff was attending a lecture to lecture in the

301
00:18:35.571 --> 00:18:36.800
house. Hey, flux research,

302
00:18:36.801 --> 00:18:39.800
and he left that lecture puzzled by this question that you asked.

303
00:18:39.801 --> 00:18:41.890
How do the cells remember [inaudible]?

304
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.970
<v 5>Have you ever been in Moscow? Well anyhow,</v>

305
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:46.890
so he ended the Moscow subway station,

306
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.720
went down to [inaudible] platform and suddenly he had an insight.

307
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.160
He had a brilliant insight. When you looked at the railroad track,

308
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.610
<v 0>the first thing you thought was those tracks look a lot like DNA.</v>

309
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.610
If you take real attraction, you twist it. Yeah, you got DNA. Okay,

310
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:07.410
say it some DNA and that DNA, his job is to count to 50 and then yell, ah,

311
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.700
well we know part of the DNA has the job of yelling, but the other stuff,

312
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.110
the rest of it, what if it's just a long sequence of nonsense?

313
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.940
Nonsense. What if every time that cellular copier comes along to copy the cell,

314
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.420
you lose one little piece of it. The nonsense. Well,

315
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:32.421
if you had say 50 pieces of nonsense as a buffer around the sense part,

316
00:19:32.611 --> 00:19:33.444
the switch,

317
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.340
well then it would take 50 copies to snowy all the nonsense until you left with

318
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:41.850
the switch, which would turn on and tell the Senate to stop

319
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.083
<v 8>fine.</v>

320
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.730
<v 0>Back in Philadelphia. As we were wrapping up that first interview,</v>

321
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:54.320
a question occurred to me, if we kind of understand how that off switch works,

322
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.200
shouldn't we theoretically be able to take her out,

323
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.270
had a tinker with when the switch gets switched?

324
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.860
<v 5>In theory, I suppose you could. Yeah, sure.</v>

325
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:06.420
And within that allow us to have a longer amount of cell divisions.

326
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.130
Well, that's certainly,

327
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:11.040
it doesn't violate any knowledge about the system of course.

328
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.910
<v 0>And wouldn't that theoretically give us something,</v>

329
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.790
whether it be extended life or something?

330
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.280
<v 5>Yes, certainly.</v>

331
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.470
<v 0>Hey, flicker clearly been asked this question a million times and he patiently</v>

332
00:20:23.471 --> 00:20:27.790
explained to me that there is a way right now that we can tinker with the timing

333
00:20:27.791 --> 00:20:31.810
of the switch. You take an enzyme called telomerase. Telomerase,

334
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:36.070
throw it into the mix and every time that cell gets copied and loses pieces of

335
00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:40.100
track, the telomerase enzyme comes along and adds in back on. Mm.

336
00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.830
And maintains the length constant. That way the track is always long.

337
00:20:44.831 --> 00:20:47.800
The stop switch never gets switched and the cell keep going

338
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.060
<v 5>and going and going. That's how they become mortal.</v>

339
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.880
So you're not going to tell me, well that's an articulate.

340
00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:59.770
Everybody would Tom rice. Yeah. And well if you volunteer,

341
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:02.770
we'll have a shot at it. Are you ready there? There must be.

342
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:05.050
If I were to go out and shout from your balcony right here,

343
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.220
I'm sure I get a hundred people who'd want to try.

344
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.990
Really not after I tell you what, you still don't know. What's that?

345
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.320
95% of all tumors contain telomerase,

346
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.110
which normal cells do not contain.

347
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.980
The single most distinguishing criteria between normal and cancer cells known

348
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:29.830
today is that fact.

349
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:35.070
<v 0>So the tradeoff for cellular immortality, at least in this case, is cancer.</v>

350
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.250
But here's the weird thing. If you look around,

351
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.600
you will see that our Hayflick limit of 50 is not the only one.

352
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.780
<v 1>We do know that if you look at the normal cells of a Galapagos tortoise,</v>

353
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.750
which has been reported in the literature, uh,

354
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.810
they undergo about 125 doublings, if I remember correctly.

355
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:59.970
So their Hayflick number is one 25 and ours is 50 apparently. Yes.

356
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.800
Does that correlate to the Galapagos turtle living twice as long? Well, it seem,

357
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:09.300
it seems to, but that comparison may be anecdotal. I'm not universal.

358
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.340
That's what Hayflick is up to these days.

359
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.880
He's become fascinated by animals who age differently than us,

360
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.490
who might have a doubling limit of, you know,

361
00:22:17.491 --> 00:22:22.491
200 500 or no limit at all are the whole class of animals that don't age will

362
00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:28.650
get like what the American lobster lobster doesn't age.

363
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.720
It either does not age or the rate is so slow.

364
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:38.370
We can't measure it. I don't even know how to imagine that. What does that mean?

365
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.400
That it does, what it means is that the animal gets bigger and bigger.

366
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.920
She's growth. Yes, there are lobsters that have been found. I are recently,

367
00:22:46.921 --> 00:22:49.110
I read about one of those over 50 pounds.

368
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:50.973
<v 4>Okay.</v>

369
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.370
<v 5>I looked it up. The largest lobster ever reported was close to yes.</v>

370
00:22:57.371 --> 00:23:02.371
50 pounds found in the 1950s just off the coast of New Jersey.

371
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.710
<v 0>Hey, New Jersey. Yep. How old? How old is a 50 pound lobster? Who knows?</v>

372
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.480
Occasion was wearing a Grover Cleveland for president button.

373
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:15.370
So I'm Jad Abumrad Robert Krulwich Radiolab. We'll be right back.

374
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.850
My name is AUC Srivastava and I'm calling from the University of Chicago.

375
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:26.330
Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by the

More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

379
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.760
ready? But what am I supposed to do? I don't have to do anything. Right.

380
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.200
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad up.

381
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.370
I'm Rod and I'm Robert Krulwich and today we're talking about aging.

382
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.820
<v 6>Yep. Thank you. I wonder why it is that that human beings live. Um,</v>

383
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.770
like what, how long do we live? About 70 years roughly. Something like that.

384
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:54.951
Yeah.

385
00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:59.951
So why 70 as opposed to seven or like 700 why that number?

386
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.310
Well, that's know. That's a good question because every,

387
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:08.630
apparently every creature has for some reason a sort of natural range.

388
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.730
So do you want to hear? Very cool one. Um,

389
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.090
how about a rat got a rat in your head? Yeah.

390
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.690
And a squirrel. The rat and the squirrel here you have two animals people call.

391
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.210
Oh, I have friends who call squirrels tree rats that Cynthia Kenyon from the

392
00:24:25.211 --> 00:24:28.370
University of California, San Francisco. I recently paid her a visit.

393
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.790
They're very similar to each other. They're rodents,

394
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.480
but Arat has a three year lifespan,

395
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.830
whereas a squirrel has a 25 year lifespan

396
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.100
and no one knows why. Really? There are theories, but no one really knows why.

397
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:51.350
I got the idea that maybe somehow lifespan was evolvable in the sense that there

398
00:24:51.351 --> 00:24:53.300
might be genes in the animal,

399
00:24:53.301 --> 00:24:57.350
which when change allow big leaps in lifespan to take place.

400
00:24:57.351 --> 00:25:00.470
So you figured that you could just hunt the jeans down. Exactly.

401
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.590
And this is exactly what she seems to have done,

402
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.950
but not with rats and squirrels. With what? What did I show you?

403
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:09.410
The incubator where we keep all the ones with worms,

404
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.880
little roundworms yet called the sea elegance. Actually,

405
00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.370
you can't see them with a naked eye. They're just a little speck.

406
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.160
But when you put them under a microscope, you see how beautiful they are.

407
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.490
So first I'm showing you here the normal warm when it's a young adult.

408
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.890
And what you can see is it's very active and it's healthy looking.

409
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.050
So we're looking at this in the dishes looking great, moving from,

410
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.140
it's a wiggle. It moves really nicely. Okay,

411
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.560
now let's fast forward two weeks.

412
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.080
Then she showed us a different set of words in a different dish.

413
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.710
These worms were 13 days, day 13 of adulthood.

414
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.040
They only lived to 14 just live two weeks here at the very,

415
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.370
very end of their lives. And what we see here as a dead one.

416
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.090
So one has already died and another one that's clearly in the nursing home,

417
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.170
just lying, still not moving at all. And you can tell immediately that it's old.

418
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.510
It looks kind of wrinkled and lethargic.

419
00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:10.010
And even if you've never seen a worm ever, you can tell that one is old,

420
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.410
so there you got it. You got a young worm, you have an old woman.

421
00:26:12.411 --> 00:26:16.100
Essentially what Cynthia Kenyon is trying to do is she's trying to hunt down the

422
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:21.101
gene that could turn that old worm backwards in time and make it look like a

423
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:26.900
young word. The worms have about 20,000 genes, so the idea is really simple.

424
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:30.710
You just go and change genes at random one by one,

425
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.310
one at a time and see whether any of these gene changes can extend life span.

426
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:38.120
How long did it take you to bump into a good one? Well, we, we actually,

427
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.260
we're really lucky to find a gene pretty quickly and we found that if we change

428
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:47.400
this one gene called Daf too, if we change this one gene called Daf too,

429
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.040
then the worms live twice as long as as they normally do.

430
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.170
<v 7>Just like that, pretty much really sheer luck.</v>

431
00:26:54.171 --> 00:26:59.171
She taken this worm and stretched its lifespan for 14 days all the way out to

432
00:26:59.541 --> 00:27:04.070
about 28 days. Just 28 yeah. It doesn't sound like a lot to you,

433
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.143
but to where I'm next.

434
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.400
<v 6>Wait, can you tell me like w w when you ran into it,</v>

435
00:27:09.401 --> 00:27:12.260
did you do a like a little war dance around the laboratory where you now?

436
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.950
That was amazing. I mean it was incredible. I had a,

437
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.860
a person in my lab who said Daft to his magic and she's right. Okay.

438
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.570
I'm going to show you these magic worms,

439
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.120
which are exactly the same as the normal worms,

440
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:26.400
except that we've changed one gene, the def two gene.

441
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.190
You remember that old wrinkly worm that we saw before?

442
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.750
The whim she's about to show me is the same age as a 13 day old.

443
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:36.240
Were you the old way? Okay. And it's bolting out of,

444
00:27:36.241 --> 00:27:40.290
it's bolting into the picture here. It looks young. It's moving.

445
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.510
It's very healthy. It's active. And actually if you take a microscope,

446
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.070
then you look at the tissues.

447
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.080
What you see is the tissues of the warm look young.

448
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.290
If you just look at that,

449
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.140
you just sit there and you just look at it and look at it and look at it and

450
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:58.590
just let it sink in what it means. It's really amazing.

451
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.480
It's really a very deep and fundamental.

452
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:06.410
You're looking at something that I guess wasn't supposed to happen in some funny

453
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:08.910
way. There was supposed to die.

454
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.980
Sure. What exactly is this gene doing to make them live longer? Well,

455
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.030
maybe I should, we should ask,

456
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:20.120
ask the question a different way because the worms that lived longer,

457
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.390
they didn't actually have this working gene, right?

458
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.970
When we make a mutation in the Daf two gene,

459
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.510
we damage it and that actually causes it not to work as well.

460
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.370
So that actually is kind of profound.

461
00:28:31.371 --> 00:28:34.970
That tells you right away that the worm has a gene in it that shortening the

462
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:39.920
worms lifespan, which is why she calls it the Green Murray Burgy,

463
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:44.300
the grim reaper gene. It's the gene that makes you,

464
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.960
if you're aware, right. So by damaging this gene,

465
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.170
Cynthia and her team essentially are taking the grim reaper

466
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.960
and knocking it out and stop that. Okay. So the question is,

467
00:28:59.961 --> 00:29:04.070
what exactly is the def to doing to make the cell age more quickly?

468
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.280
Here's where the story gets a little weird.

469
00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:13.570
Well, we found another gene whose name is also daft, but it's a different app.

470
00:29:13.571 --> 00:29:18.310
It's called deaf 16 and this is a gene whose normal function is to keep you

471
00:29:18.311 --> 00:29:19.144
young.

472
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.550
It's like a fountain of youth change to we there.

473
00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.480
There was a grim he virgin before, right?

474
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.150
And now there's a fountain of youth genes. That's what she discovered.

475
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.080
And inside the worms, these jeans are struggling with each other.

476
00:29:33.081 --> 00:29:35.100
Here's how it works. When it, when a worm ages,

477
00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:39.140
normally the Daf two receptor to kind of squash this,

478
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.930
the activity of Daf 16 it turns it

479
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:44.543
silence.

480
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.560
And so the worm ages, okay,

481
00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.600
so when you come along and you inhibit the activity of the deaf too,

482
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:58.410
or separate, oh, now you liberate Dev 16 right? It's free.

483
00:29:58.411 --> 00:30:02.190
It springs into action and it activates about a hundred genes

484
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:04.683
in the DNA.

485
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:09.870
These hundred genes each to a little tiny good thing for the cell.

486
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.750
And altogether it makes the cell live twice as long.

487
00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.140
[inaudible]. So let me just back up your show. There's the bay, there's the,

488
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.840
there's the, there's the bad gene, the gene that says, all right,

489
00:30:21.841 --> 00:30:25.320
everybody died. But the way that it tells everybody dies,

490
00:30:25.321 --> 00:30:27.660
it goes to particularly over to this little guy over in the corner,

491
00:30:27.661 --> 00:30:32.250
who's the good guy who's repairing and protecting and fighting disease.

492
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.170
And it says the conquered on the head,

493
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.400
like some kind of three stooges things is you shut up. Exactly.

494
00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.720
So if that good guy can stay vibrant,

495
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.140
then we are in the bowling game for a little while longer. Exactly. Very good.

496
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.900
And you can get a lifespan that may increase,

497
00:30:48.901 --> 00:30:53.210
say 100% like the one I mentioned even longer, even threefold. Three fold.

498
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:54.900
How would you do that? Well,

499
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.620
we found that the signals from the reproductive system affect aging.

500
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.730
It turns out Kenyon and her team found that if you steal away some of the worms,

501
00:31:02.731 --> 00:31:06.840
baby making powers, that alone makes them live longer if you do that.

502
00:31:06.841 --> 00:31:07.531
So what we did,

503
00:31:07.531 --> 00:31:11.550
and if you crippled the grim reaper genes and if you strengthen the fountain of

504
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.190
Youth Gene, the best possible change, we knew how to make,

505
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.420
well now we're talking,

506
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:20.490
we get incredibly healthy animals that are live to be

507
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:22.853
six times

508
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:25.060
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

509
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.750
<v 6>on average, which would be like 500 years for a human and they're so healthy.</v>

510
00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:30.000
It's incredible. Okay,

511
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.200
so that would be like Ben Franklin still being around playing golf. It's, yeah,

512
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.750
it would be, it's just blows your mind to think about it, which by the way,

513
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.090
that doesn't mean that it will ever be possible in humans.

514
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.880
And why do we turn there by the way, listening to this program. No,

515
00:31:42.881 --> 00:31:44.920
she kind of has to say that because she's a scientist.

516
00:31:44.921 --> 00:31:48.280
She doesn't know yet whether it affects us. Um, on the other hand,

517
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.590
she has started a company, yes, Elixir.

518
00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:54.010
And the company is making a pill and it's a pill for people. Interestingly,

519
00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:57.370
have you any notion of, of how much you could slow down the process though?

520
00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.430
We don't know. You know, we're just hoping that we can slow it down at all.

521
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.480
But just imagine used to be people would talk about that,

522
00:32:04.481 --> 00:32:09.481
but as the world of fairytales and fantasy and now it sort of reopens the quest

523
00:32:09.731 --> 00:32:11.950
for the found of youth in a new molecular way.

524
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.000
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

525
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.420
<v 6>how did the, wait a second though. What happens if she,</v>

526
00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:22.840
dare I say it succeeds with this little pill of hers.

527
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:27.460
Do we necessarily want a lot of 500 year old golfers hanging around?

528
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.980
Didn't the ones that not not getting out of the way. Oh, we're already,

529
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:33.220
they're gonna. In some places in the world, in Germany and in Japan,

530
00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:36.460
the population of older people has grown to the point where you,

531
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.460
if you're a middle aged or younger, you feel the oppression

532
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.610
<v 10>of having so many people to support [inaudible] for a second.</v>

533
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:47.360
Japan might be a canary in the coal mine as it were.

534
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.390
Sort of a glimpse of where we're all headed. Jocelyn Ford,

535
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:55.391
a reporter has been looking at aging societies in Asia and recently took a trip

536
00:32:55.471 --> 00:32:58.980
back to Japan where she used to live to see how they're dealing with things and

537
00:32:58.981 --> 00:33:00.030
I arrived in Japan.

538
00:33:00.031 --> 00:33:03.810
It was immediately obvious that that there was something different here.

539
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.970
I went into the closest little town to the airport and uh,

540
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.710
there was a festival street festival going on. I

541
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.240
went down the street and what really surprised me is I think it's treat families

542
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:19.290
and kids playing and you know, let's go out with a family.

543
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.410
But everyone was sitting around listening to the music was, um,

544
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.880
there were a lot of gray heads.

545
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.320
<v 4>I met a guy who was like 90 years old and he was on a bicycle</v>

546
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:36.700
and he cycled off. I felt it's a different society.

547
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:42.440
<v 10>Bottom line is this job in Japan easing is very fast.</v>

548
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:45.910
The fastest ever in the entire world. This guy banging the chalkboard,

549
00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.140
that's Hubo gala hero gala.

550
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.350
I'm a demographer at the neon university population research institute.

551
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.230
Where is that by the way? Is it in Tokyo, Tokyo?

552
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.940
And he said that the reason that Japan looks so old all of a sudden it's because

553
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.540
in part people are living longer. But that's not the big reason.

554
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:06.650
The big reason is that the birth rate is falling and Japanese population is

555
00:34:06.651 --> 00:34:10.510
shrinking. They're not having as many kids already. That's exactly it. I mean,

556
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.160
and this is something that's happening all over the developer world.

557
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.220
People are having smaller families and as a result,

558
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.820
there are fewer young people or older people right now. And in fact,

559
00:34:19.821 --> 00:34:24.670
the proportion of the elderly 65 and over is a more than 21% which are the

560
00:34:24.671 --> 00:34:28.880
highest anti world. 21% elderly. Can you imagine what that looks like? No,

561
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:30.620
just thank me. Thank Florida.

562
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.590
What do you think of when you think of Florida? Florida?

563
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.530
I think of beaches and I do. Well,

564
00:34:37.531 --> 00:34:41.010
that's where a lot of old folks go to retire. So I think it's of a lot of,

565
00:34:41.011 --> 00:34:44.430
you know, 70 and 80 year olds. Florida is the oldest state in the United States,

566
00:34:44.431 --> 00:34:47.920
but compared to Japan, it's young.

567
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:52.960
It's only 17% over 65 and Japan is 21% whoa.

568
00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.010
So imagine that all of Japan looks like Florida,

569
00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:02.150
just older and OCO expects that percentage to double in 40 years. Oh,

570
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.070
right now, I mean, can I read a picture, the future scenario,

571
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.710
but it's going to change.

572
00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.090
<v 4>I got some insight into that change back at the street fair.</v>

573
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.940
I went to get some tea and rice crackers. I in that shot,

574
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.800
it was a 103 year old.

575
00:35:19.801 --> 00:35:24.720
Granted I tried to talk to her but she couldn't really communicate,

576
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.830
but she didn't, I don't

577
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.980
<v 10>really know what was going on. Um, her daughter was in her sixties.</v>

578
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:39.310
His is the main caretaker under 16 in her sixties and she has to,

579
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:42.570
the granny can no longer get out of her wheelchair by herself.

580
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:47.370
She can't take a bath. She's completely dependent on her daughter like a baby.

581
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.160
But she's a lot heavier than a baby. And her,

582
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.310
her daughter had really strained her back and hurt herself.

583
00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.660
I mean the elder looking after the agent basically.

584
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.290
And that's probably the biggest, the biggest problem.

585
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:04.150
<v 11>The problem is that the caregivers, uh,</v>

586
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.330
primary of the caregivers is about a forties and 50s.

587
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.910
So we are sort of short on caregiver.

588
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.340
<v 10>That never occurred to me that from society's perspective, the reason kids are,</v>

589
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:18.060
are good or useful is so that they take care of the old people. Yeah.

590
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.280
Like government spokesman I, I spoke with you,

591
00:36:20.281 --> 00:36:23.280
thank you so much for making this tiny Gucci. He,

592
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.480
he was quite concerned about about that there was going to be a shortage of

593
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:32.481
labor as society ages and someone has got to fill the void in countries like the

594
00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:38.130
United States. We might import foreign labor. Sure.

595
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.290
Bringing immigrants care for the elderly, you know,

596
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.080
but in Japan it will happen only reluctantly.

597
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:49.160
It's not so simple because this society is still debating whether it's going to

598
00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:53.370
be a good thing or not to increase numbering immigrants.

599
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:58.380
We have decided to open our a, our labor market to some extent.

600
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.080
[inaudible] and other government spokesman first we'll start said the government

601
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:09.081
has decided they can allow more than 100 a hundred Filipino caregivers to come

602
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:12.950
into the country. Just a a hundred. Just A, a hundred. Huh?

603
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:17.730
I know what you're thinking. Is it basically, is it basically because Japan is,

604
00:37:17.731 --> 00:37:18.564
you know, phobic,

605
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:22.310
<v 11>well, um, let's put it this way.</v>

606
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.100
Japanese people tend to

607
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.850
have this island concept.

608
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:32.000
Having more international workers in our neighborhood.

609
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.010
Might I do that kind of tradition?

610
00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.440
I think that's what the Japanese people might be worried about.

611
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:42.110
What's wrong with that? Things change. I think basically the communication,

612
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:44.870
particularly when he's sick, I mean when you're bedridden,

613
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:49.400
if the nurses are foreign foreigners you have to communicate and it's very

614
00:37:49.401 --> 00:37:50.234
difficult.

615
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.350
<v 10>You know, some people might think that's xenophobic phobic, that people don't,</v>

616
00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:56.890
don't want to deal with foreigners. But that's not really what it's about. Um,

617
00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.110
people don't want to be a burden to anybody.

618
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.810
They don't want to depend on anybody. I don't want to

619
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:10.160
hop same button. If you say this is Mr Suga, he's a demographic researcher.

620
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.290
You just don't want to be a burden. No.

621
00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:17.780
This feeling that you shouldn't be a burden. It runs very deep physically,

622
00:38:17.781 --> 00:38:19.880
psychologically a ball swapped him.

623
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:25.270
I just prefer I will be helped not by any other people.

624
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:30.080
Why is that? Just a feeling?

625
00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:35.210
It might cause problems with them, with other people.

626
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.840
So you'd be more comfortable knowing that you're not putting anyone else causing

627
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:44.110
them trouble. Yep. Yep. Yep.

628
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.370
So if I will need some help from other people,

629
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.660
I might want to kill myself. That's how extreme it gets.

630
00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.520
This is a young man who's 30, he said,

631
00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.320
I would rather commit suicide than be taken care of by somebody who doesn't want

632
00:39:00.321 --> 00:39:03.590
to take care of me. Who, who I'd be a burden on. You know, uh,

633
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:08.180
there is a culture like two, 300 years ago in Japan,

634
00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:13.610
if all two hormones a life until like 60,

635
00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.840
70 years old. Then family, take this,

636
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:22.700
this old mothers to a mountain and stay there.

637
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.360
Make the modern state here it is a very long tradition in Japan of they call it,

638
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:29.970
uh,

639
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:34.970
or bass or busty Obamian is it grandma and stamens too.

640
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.980
To throw up, throw away your serious, have, have whole movies about this.

641
00:39:39.981 --> 00:39:40.814
In Japan,

642
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.490
there's one called [inaudible], the ballot of not Yammer.

643
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.940
It's set in a very poor rural village about a hundred years ago.

644
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:57.340
It tells the story of a son in his old mother up the mountain

645
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.360
on the way up. They pass by another son,

646
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.050
literally filling his father off of a cliff.

647
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.153
[inaudible]

648
00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.660
it makes a family happier.

649
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:21.960
So grandma stays in the mountain and starts. Yep. Yep.

650
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:26.660
Any family is happier because there's less of a burden, right?

651
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.000
It was understood among all the generations.

652
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.280
This was the way the problem was solved.

653
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.310
Not Anymore, obviously. Right? Right.

654
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:40.100
Japan is really quite socialist these days. They look after everyone in society,

655
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.790
but that idea is still out there. So what do you do today?

656
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.040
You don't want your kids to take care of you.

657
00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:50.370
You don't want foreigners to take care of you. Who's left? Well,

658
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:54.620
one solution is instead of having people do these jobs have machines,

659
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.630
machines, robots, robots,

660
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.120
you joking. It's not actually a joke. Um,

661
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:09.210
Panasonic and others are manufacturing robots as caregivers.

662
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.440
When you think about it, sort of make sense.

663
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:15.360
Why don't we automate the heavy duty [inaudible] welcome to meet all.

664
00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.870
If it did a bunch of labs and met with some scientists.

665
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:23.850
This Robert is connected to here. They've got robots that will,

666
00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:26.010
it looks like a dentist chair or your wheelchair,

667
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.600
where to go and how fast this is going.

668
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:32.310
There's a special pair of trousers that you can put on and if your legs are weak

669
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:37.310
and you can't walk, it will help you walk. There's a washing machine robot.

670
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.990
It looks like it's got a fancy handle.

671
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.830
It's actually for washing people or any of these natural use. Yes they are.

672
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.540
Will do not want to have to ask somebody to clean their diapers to wash their

673
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:50.510
bum. Right. I think for anybody in any society,

674
00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:55.940
that is a difficult thing to have to ask somebody more. I mean don't,

675
00:41:55.941 --> 00:41:57.710
you don't have to talk. You just press a button.

676
00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.320
Now this is where I start to get weirded out.

677
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.750
I went to a nursing home about an hour and a half outside of Tokyo,

678
00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.020
some to lots of people and must be sitting around.

679
00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:12.040
There's a television about three people are watching the TV ones looking out the

680
00:42:12.041 --> 00:42:12.580
window.

681
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:16.390
I walked in and there were a lot of old people just sitting around each keeping

682
00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.570
mostly to themselves, sitting very quietly.

683
00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:25.790
Oh talking. It was sort of sad in steps.

684
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.213
Pero the seal

685
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:33.410
pro is one of the world's first therapy robots get it? No.

686
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.843
What does that mean?

687
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:38.570
What they've done is they've made this are like a large stuffed animal,

688
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:43.610
white for really long eyelashes and flutters them at you and it squeals.

689
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.590
When Pearl came out, one of the grantees just lit up,

690
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.350
got so excited.

691
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.090
She peered into the seals eyes and she tried to talk to it

692
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:04.640
to come to puddle it. Same feeling, feeding her family,

693
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.000
come here. I was taken back.

694
00:43:08.001 --> 00:43:10.520
I mean it's not much more than a moving stuffed animal.

695
00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:14.210
And how could you look at it and see companies see something alive.

696
00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.690
See something comforting, feeling a little bit warm. Is Pero warm? Yes.

697
00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:24.350
I spoke to the developer, Mr she bought it for your warm blooded, Huh?

698
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.920
He said yeah,

699
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.580
they wanted a creature that would give them positive feedback but also sort of

700
00:43:28.581 --> 00:43:31.130
made them being stroked is good for puddle.

701
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.540
So part tried to be stroked by the owner like you're doing right now.

702
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.890
Did you program to want to be whole.

703
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:43.360
He also programmed them to respond to different names by call him as puddle.

704
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:49.030
If you give a new name like John or something or like Choco Chan and call it the

705
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:50.630
new name again, again

706
00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.710
the new name and start the response

707
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.840
so it's learning you down carefully because we don't want to hurt you. Oh,

708
00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:02.540
you want to be held again. They learn from their environment.

709
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:06.140
Now these are really rudimentary, you know, beginning baby robots,

710
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:09.410
but it worked, Jed, it worked.

711
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.880
They adored it. They were loving it and it was loving them in their minds.

712
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.240
I started to think maybe this is a solution.

713
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:34.200
People might actually be able to engineer compassion, engineer, companionship.

714
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.260
But then I started asking a lot of people around me,

715
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.820
it took an informal Straw poll.

716
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.730
Would you feel comfortable with a robot taking care of you?

717
00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:43.500
And most people said, no,

718
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:48.501
not really doing a lot [inaudible] like this woman [inaudible] she actually came

719
00:44:49.351 --> 00:44:51.710
up with a brilliant idea, which seems like a no brainer.

720
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.500
She has a nursing home which is together with a preschool.

721
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.400
Yes. That actually you to take a tour

722
00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:06.723
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

723
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:12.630
<v 10>you walk into the room and you are bombarded by these little parties and the</v>

724
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.820
flying around is just over the top.

725
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:17.993
<v 8>Well</v>

726
00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:23.260
<v 10>and it's a toxic in a few an old person in that environment,</v>

727
00:45:23.261 --> 00:45:27.330
you have no time whatsoever to dwell on the idea that you dying.

728
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.963
<v 8>Yeah,</v>

729
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.320
<v 10>the kids are, they demand your attention but you need, you</v>

730
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:37.450
need it again. But the first thing that you told us,

731
00:45:37.451 --> 00:45:40.120
the very beginning is that there are more old folks, the less kids. Well,

732
00:45:40.121 --> 00:45:42.850
what happens when these kids were listening to right now when they

733
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:48.470
[inaudible] there's just a bunch of old people around and there's going to be

734
00:45:48.471 --> 00:45:52.370
one kid left and they all go to visit that one kid. I mean that, that,

735
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:55.610
that can't work. You expect me to have an answer? We'll be,

736
00:45:55.611 --> 00:45:59.210
we should import kids. I don't know. No, I mean you're joking obviously,

737
00:45:59.211 --> 00:46:03.590
but when I guess what I'm asking is like w are we left at the end to to think

738
00:46:03.591 --> 00:46:07.790
that the society cannot support all of its members getting old.

739
00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:11.840
That somehow the old half to step out of the way that I think your thinking is

740
00:46:11.841 --> 00:46:15.920
basically old fashioned. They will be more old people in fewer young people.

741
00:46:15.921 --> 00:46:19.160
That's a fact. You're not going to turn the clock back on this.

742
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.850
Societies do change. People do come up with new ideas and right now,

743
00:46:22.851 --> 00:46:24.440
hey they're stabbing the dark after them,

744
00:46:24.441 --> 00:46:29.090
but one day they'll come up with a solution. So learn to deal with it.

745
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:32.150
Tammy, you just bitch slap me.

746
00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.500
What do you call it? Me. All the way across the Pacific Ocean.

747
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:39.860
Across the whole continent. Darn it.

748
00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.970
We got a break now cause they got to sort of pick up my ego here.

749
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.740
Radio lamp will continue in a moment.

750
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:53.160

756
00:47:16.571 --> 00:47:19.810
And in this hour we've been talking about aging mostly,

757
00:47:19.811 --> 00:47:24.811
but now we're going to turn our attention to the end of that aging process while

758
00:47:25.271 --> 00:47:26.980
you're talking about dying. Yes.

759
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.160
Maybe we've avoided that topic because that's generally

760
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.830
<v 13>how people deal with death, which is to avoid it. To deny it. Yeah.</v>

761
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:36.010
So this next piece is about actually a different way of dealing with death,

762
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.750
I should say, before we begin it,

763
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:41.890
that it does contain some graphic descriptions of the normal bodily process of

764
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:42.251
aging.

765
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:45.250
But if you have someone in the room who is squeamish or you don't think should

766
00:47:45.251 --> 00:47:48.160
hear these things and it's nothing, you know, terrible. It's just,

767
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.370
it's actually quite nasty. Yes. Nasty, nasty. Uh,

768
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.210
then maybe this is the time to shoot them out of the room.

769
00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.750
<v 0>This piece was produced by Lou old Koski. It's about one family,</v>

770
00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:04.350
three generations in introduce myself. This is Jeremiah the youngest. Um,

771
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:08.300
Jeremiah is Hagar. He's a filmmaker. So I don't know if Isaiah Zig are his dad.

772
00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:13.240
Isaiah is a muralist, his grandfather, I'm the grandson of Asher's.

773
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:16.310
They go, [inaudible] art is a health nut.

774
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:20.420
[inaudible] they flow all my shit.

775
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:24.710
This is a video of him that Jeremiah's shot of aster doing his daily exercise

776
00:48:24.711 --> 00:48:25.190
routine.

777
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:29.580
He's in his nineties he's jumping on a trampoline and counting each chunk.

778
00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.720
<v 14>How old are you now?</v>

779
00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:37.110
I'm 90 90 you're in healthy man for 90 yeah.

780
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.060
No healthy. When I'm 91 92 the great,

781
00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:46.180
great grandfather that I named lived to 100

782
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:51.190
<v 0>so you're going to live to 102 I don't know, but maybe</v>

783
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:57.110
at the age of 93 Asher began to decline

784
00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:01.250
<v 15>quickly. How did you deal with a man dying in your house?</v>

785
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.140
How do you deal with that?

786
00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:05.363
<v 4>Well,</v>

787
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:07.910
<v 15>you know my father and starts taking photos of him.</v>

788
00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:13.180
One of my modes of understanding was either drawing or photographing.

789
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.870
He was always taking pictures of my grandfather. Just see housings of slides.

790
00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.793
Thousands.

791
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:20.760
<v 4>Ah,</v>

792
00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.320
<v 0>that's how it went for awhile. Isaiah,</v>

793
00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:26.370
the dad would take care of his dad and take some photos. Wow.

794
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.940
Grandson Jeremiah basically looked the other way.

795
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.580
<v 15>Well, I never really knew my grandfather,</v>

796
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:36.770
<v 0>but then Isaiah got an idea. I thought to myself, challenged</v>

797
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:41.790
<v 15>this young boy to this duel who can take the most objective photographs of a</v>

798
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:45.124
dying man.

799
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:49.540
It wasn't like we threw down and like I pulled my camera out of my holster and

800
00:49:49.541 --> 00:49:52.300
he pulled his camera out of his holster. You know, it wasn't like that.

801
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:57.670
He was involved in my grandfather's death and I wasn't. And so he said,

802
00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.050
this is how I get involved.

803
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.850
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

804
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.370
<v 15>it's my senior year in high school. Um,</v>

805
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.990
and I was a bus boy in this restaurant down the street and I loved it.

806
00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.630
And I would bust tables til two or three in the morning and then I would get

807
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:12.160
drunk with people after work and then I would come back and I would take care of

808
00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:12.994
my grandpa.

809
00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:17.170
So I would lift them up and change the sheets because otherwise his bedsore

810
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:20.200
would burn more when he had this horrible bedsore you can see it in the

811
00:50:20.201 --> 00:50:24.400
photographs and he would hit me while I lifted him up and then I would

812
00:50:24.401 --> 00:50:26.530
photograph him cause I would want to sit with him.

813
00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:29.120
Cause when you're wanting calm him down and the way you sit with him,

814
00:50:29.121 --> 00:50:33.590
I mean my father was right, you have a camera. I mean that's how you cope.

815
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:38.570
Otherwise you're sitting with him and he's just looking at you during the

816
00:50:38.571 --> 00:50:39.020
contest.

817
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:43.490
Dad and son shared duties of taking care of Grandpa and at night they'd sit at

818
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:47.330
the kitchen table and compare photos. As soon as I took the first pictures,

819
00:50:47.331 --> 00:50:50.960
you knew mine were better than my father is because my father is or from far

820
00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:54.920
away. And there were snapshots and mine were like specific.

821
00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:59.570
Like I was fascinated with him dying. I wanted to know what it looked like.

822
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.870
And this went on for about a month. One that during which time,

823
00:51:02.871 --> 00:51:06.360
even Jeremiah's friends, all of his friends got involved. I,

824
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:11.400
the wee hours of the night I would wake up and I would see that they're

825
00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:16.070
surrounding my father or four or five young people.

826
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:21.050
Sure they were drinking beer and they were joking around, but they were there.

827
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:26.060
They were there while he was there. What I remember most was, uh,

828
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:29.340
you and your friends changing his sheets and, uh,

829
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:34.230
lifting them and moving them around. [inaudible] who else did it with you?

830
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:37.630
John Lincoln. Hey,

831
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:43.280
all became initiated into the most problematic event in our lives.

832
00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:51.420
It was an amazingly rare scene to see these teenagers attending to death.

833
00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:01.330
Well, this is a book of photographs of a, my father,

834
00:52:01.331 --> 00:52:06.331
your grandfather's last week of life in this very room.

835
00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:10.710
So the contest was a month long. Smart Guy. I am. Huh?

836
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:15.820
You're good. You know how to make the contest. I kept it gone for one month.

837
00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:20.930
Gotcha. Huh? Is that,

838
00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:25.600
can you describe this one pretty well? The feet look like they're,

839
00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:26.320
um,

840
00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:31.320
they were out in the desert that they'd been baked and cracked and dry,

841
00:52:33.791 --> 00:52:38.350
dry, dried out. I mean, look at them. They look like, I mean,

842
00:52:38.351 --> 00:52:42.370
look at the nail in the hell. It's wild. But I mean everything. It's like what?

843
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.120
I have these same legs. You stop touching photos.

844
00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:52.690
Well, I can almost feel him like feeling them. I feel you instead there,

845
00:52:56.290 --> 00:53:00.140
that's the bed. Bedsore that's what happens.

846
00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:06.520
Sure. Oh, it's awful. Awful, awful,

847
00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:11.360
awful, awful, awful man who prided himself on his health. Look what happened.

848
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.020
How does one describe that? It looks like riding me.

849
00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:22.360
I mean they just opened wounds and you're moving them around, moving around,

850
00:53:22.361 --> 00:53:24.130
but still it was impossible.

851
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.450
It's crazy to look at the too pink and then white,

852
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:31.050
green and then ground where it's rather white is the muscle isn't.

853
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.930
I took these photos in color because I'm black and white. You'd never get it.

854
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:37.080
You know, you'd never get how painful this must've been.

855
00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:39.960
His anus is all red.

856
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:45.360
I mean like really red and you can see the parts of it have broken and there's

857
00:53:46.291 --> 00:53:50.410
just blood gushing it and it's dried. I mean the blood is dried. Thank.

858
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:53.180
This is the last photo. This one

859
00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.780
you can see like the cognition just go on the mouth is a cake.

860
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.820
He's buried in his pillow. He knew it was over. It was just a matter of time.

861
00:54:05.821 --> 00:54:09.330
Now that's it. That's the closest I got him dying.

862
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.100
He wanted to live forever.

863
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.270
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

864
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:17.860
<v 15>the fix was in from the beginning.</v>

865
00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:24.160
The fix is that I was supposed to add. Sure, sure.

866
00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:27.500
How could it be any other way? I don't know. I could have taken that.

867
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:28.810
I could give it up. And you wanted me to,

868
00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:33.130
when it was a subterfuge to get you to be with your grandfather as much as

869
00:54:33.131 --> 00:54:37.810
possible. I thought it was a Fairfax. It wasn't, ah, can,

870
00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:41.740
can there ever, you all already couldn't take a good picture.

871
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:46.480
When a person is dying, it's very important that they're surrounded.

872
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.180
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

873
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:53.180
<v 1>they're surrounded by the light of life and you don't go in to the place of</v>

874
00:54:54.001 --> 00:54:54.834
oblivion

875
00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:58.420
<v 8>alone. Do you want me to be there?</v>

876
00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:03.710
I don't know at this point. I don't know. I'm not, I'm not at that place yet.

877
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:10.040
Well what does that mean with the camera? I mean, just be with me. Yeah.

878
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:14.600
Be with me. Be close to me. Be Soft with me. Yeah,

879
00:55:14.601 --> 00:55:17.190
I guess that's what it's about really. [inaudible]

880
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:37.650
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

881
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:42.470
<v 1>thanks to Lou l Koski for that story and to Isaiah and Jeremiah are,</v>

882
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:47.360
well, we've come to the end of our hour. I guess we should wrap, um,

883
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:51.060
we should mention the website. Yes. radiolab.org is the address.

884
00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:54.480
