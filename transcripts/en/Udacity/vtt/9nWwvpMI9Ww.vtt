So far, we've seen that when we have an equation. An equation like, for example,

00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:08.927
y equals 3 x minus 5, we can graph that equation. And when we graph that

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:13.617
equation, any point that we can pick out that lies along this line will satisfy

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.094
this equation. If we pick a point along here, like this one let's say, we can

00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:22.470
figure out its coordinates. Substitute them into x and y respectively, and then

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:26.763
find the two sides of the equation are equal to 1 another. In principle then, we

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:30.848
should be able to check whether or not a point is on the line of an equation

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:35.274
without having to look at the graph at all. As great as visual representations

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:38.954
are, algebra itself is super powerful. Let's test out this theory.
