idea that we've been beginning to

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:33.820
idea that we've been beginning to
 

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.950
idea that we've been beginning to
explore and in robotics and I think it

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:37.960
explore and in robotics and I think it
 

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.960
explore and in robotics and I think it
might have implications to architecture

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:39.970
might have implications to architecture
 

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.660
might have implications to architecture
as well so I and that's the idea of

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:42.670
as well so I and that's the idea of
 

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.340
as well so I and that's the idea of
self-reflection so let me explain a

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:44.350
self-reflection so let me explain a
 

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.860
self-reflection so let me explain a
little bit where we're coming from so

and this is just one picture of the web
of a reactive wall but there's many like

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:27.820
of a reactive wall but there's many like
 

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.960
of a reactive wall but there's many like
these and they correspond in a way to

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:30.970
these and they correspond in a way to
 

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.040
these and they correspond in a way to
something that in a kind of era in

someone like insect maybe and a lot of

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.290
someone like insect maybe and a lot of
 

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.340
someone like insect maybe and a lot of
interesting things happen and we've been

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:50.350
interesting things happen and we've been
 

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.450
interesting things happen and we've been
exploring that as well and so I want to

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:54.460
exploring that as well and so I want to
 

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.640
exploring that as well and so I want to
talk a little bit about the trend in

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:56.650
talk a little bit about the trend in
 

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.890
talk a little bit about the trend in
robotic and where I think this is going

00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:58.900
robotic and where I think this is going
 

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.810
robotic and where I think this is going
in some of the new ideas that are coming

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:00.820
in some of the new ideas that are coming
 

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.850
in some of the new ideas that are coming
out so in the early days of robotics and

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:02.860
out so in the early days of robotics and
 

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.370
out so in the early days of robotics and
most robotics still today our program

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:05.380
most robotics still today our program
 

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.340
most robotics still today our program
it's just a programmer sitting down

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:07.350
it's just a programmer sitting down
 

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.080
it's just a programmer sitting down
designing the robot and then writing a

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.090
designing the robot and then writing a
 

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.270
designing the robot and then writing a
program that makes a robot do something

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:12.280
program that makes a robot do something
 

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.620
program that makes a robot do something
very specific and that works very well

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:13.630
very specific and that works very well
 

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.900
very specific and that works very well
in a closed environment where everything

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:15.910
in a closed environment where everything
 

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.180
in a closed environment where everything
is the right place at the right time and

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:18.190
is the right place at the right time and
 

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.740
is the right place at the right time and
the robot works and the factory and

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:19.750
the robot works and the factory and
 

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.380
the robot works and the factory and
everything's all well but this kind of

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:22.390
everything's all well but this kind of
 

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.430
everything's all well but this kind of
robotics fails when things change when

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440
robotics fails when things change when
 

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.020
robotics fails when things change when
there is a need for adaptation which

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.030
there is a need for adaptation which
 

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.700
there is a need for adaptation which
something is not in the right place when

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:29.710
something is not in the right place when
 

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.370
something is not in the right place when
the ball falls off in those cases these

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:32.380
the ball falls off in those cases these
 

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.130
the ball falls off in those cases these
kinds of robots for them it's game over

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:35.140
kinds of robots for them it's game over
 

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.380
kinds of robots for them it's game over
they can't adapt or can react they can't

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:37.390
they can't adapt or can react they can't
 

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.120
they can't adapt or can react they can't
recover and so one of the biggest

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.130
recover and so one of the biggest
 

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.790
recover and so one of the biggest
challenges in robotics is to try to make

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800
challenges in robotics is to try to make
 

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.550
challenges in robotics is to try to make
machines that can adapt to new and

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560
machines that can adapt to new and
 

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.700
machines that can adapt to new and
unforeseen situations and we've been

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:47.710
unforeseen situations and we've been
 

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.890

project we did everything in simulation

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560
project we did everything in simulation
 

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.610
project we did everything in simulation
and we downloaded it and we crossed our

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620
and we downloaded it and we crossed our
 

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.189
and we downloaded it and we crossed our
fingers we hope that it worked but that

00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199
fingers we hope that it worked but that
 

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:39.350
fingers we hope that it worked but that
doesn't really scale because there is

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360
doesn't really scale because there is
 

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.110
doesn't really scale because there is
what we call engineering the reality gap

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120
what we call engineering the reality gap
 

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.579
what we call engineering the reality gap
you can have fantastic things in

00:13:43.579 --> 00:13:43.589
you can have fantastic things in
 

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:45.650
you can have fantastic things in
simulation but when you make them in

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.660
simulation but when you make them in
 

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.870

reality doesn't necessarily work because

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880
reality doesn't necessarily work because
 

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.460
reality doesn't necessarily work because
there's a gap between simulation and

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:49.470
there's a gap between simulation and
 

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.819
there's a gap between simulation and
reality and no matter how much time you

00:13:52.819 --> 00:13:52.829
reality and no matter how much time you
 

00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:54.410
reality and no matter how much time you
spend on your simulation is going to be

spend on your simulation is going to be
 

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.019
spend on your simulation is going to be
always this gap and it's going to be a

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:57.029
always this gap and it's going to be a
 

00:13:57.029 --> 00:13:59.329

I briefly showed you here we did

00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839
I briefly showed you here we did
 

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.960
I briefly showed you here we did
everything in reality but the challenge

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:02.970
everything in reality but the challenge
 

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.850
everything in reality but the challenge
there is that the robot needed to learn

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860
there is that the robot needed to learn
 

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.069
there is that the robot needed to learn
in reality and need to do lots of

00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079
in reality and need to do lots of
 

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.769
in reality and need to do lots of
physical trials and it took time and was

00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779
physical trials and it took time and was
 

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:11.480
physical trials and it took time and was
very expensive so that's a problem too

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:11.490
very expensive so that's a problem too
 

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.579
very expensive so that's a problem too
many physical trials when you have a

00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:13.589
many physical trials when you have a
 

00:14:13.589 --> 00:14:14.340
many physical trials when you have a
machine

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:14.350
machine
 

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.140
machine
or a system and you want to have it

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:16.150
or a system and you want to have it
 

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.300
or a system and you want to have it
learning reality just is too expensive

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:18.310
learning reality just is too expensive
 

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.030
learning reality just is too expensive
and too slow so the alternative and this

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040
and too slow so the alternative and this
 

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.410
and too slow so the alternative and this
is the basic idea of self-reflection

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:22.420
is the basic idea of self-reflection
 

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.620
is the basic idea of self-reflection
which I want to put forward today is

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:25.630
which I want to put forward today is
 

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.690
which I want to put forward today is
this idea that you start off with a

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:27.700
this idea that you start off with a
 

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.860
this idea that you start off with a
simulation and you use it to generate

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:31.870
simulation and you use it to generate
 

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.660
simulation and you use it to generate
machines and let's think about

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:33.670
machines and let's think about
 

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.670
machines and let's think about
structures not just machines any any

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680
structures not just machines any any
 

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.930
structures not just machines any any
kind of thing you want to actually

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:36.940
kind of thing you want to actually
 

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.510
kind of thing you want to actually
physically instantiate and then you try

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:39.520
physically instantiate and then you try
 

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.890
physically instantiate and then you try
it in reality you think the best thing

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:40.900
it in reality you think the best thing
 

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.720
it in reality you think the best thing
you have you tried in reality now

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:42.730
you have you tried in reality now
 

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.280
you have you tried in reality now
because the simulation is not going to

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:44.290
because the simulation is not going to
 

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.250
because the simulation is not going to
be good it to begin with probably the

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:47.260
be good it to begin with probably the
 

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.750
be good it to begin with probably the
thing you go to build is not going to

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:48.760
thing you go to build is not going to
 

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.480
thing you go to build is not going to
work very well but we're going to

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:51.490
work very well but we're going to
 

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.840
work very well but we're going to
collect data from the robot let's say

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:53.850
collect data from the robot let's say
 

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.820
collect data from the robot let's say
its experiences its actions and its

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:56.830
its experiences its actions and its
 

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.310
its experiences its actions and its
reaction so collect all this data and

00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320
reaction so collect all this data and
 

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.830
reaction so collect all this data and
now instead of just evolved in

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:01.840
now instead of just evolved in
 

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.680
now instead of just evolved in
structures we're going to evolve

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:03.690
structures we're going to evolve
 

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.170
structures we're going to evolve
simulators okay so in the first couple

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:07.180
simulators okay so in the first couple
 

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.060
simulators okay so in the first couple
examples i showed you revolve machines

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.070
examples i showed you revolve machines
 

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.030
examples i showed you revolve machines
now we're going to evolve also their

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040
now we're going to evolve also their
 

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.130
now we're going to evolve also their
simulators with a figure of merit of

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:14.140
simulators with a figure of merit of
 

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.010
simulators with a figure of merit of
simulators how well it explains reality

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:17.020
simulators how well it explains reality
 

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.080
simulators how well it explains reality
in retrospect so now we're basically

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.090
in retrospect so now we're basically
 

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.220
in retrospect so now we're basically
co-evolving machines and they're

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.230
co-evolving machines and they're
 

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.420
co-evolving machines and they're
simulators and i want to argue that that

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:24.430
simulators and i want to argue that that
 

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.340
simulators and i want to argue that that
is self reflection but the machine

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:26.350
is self reflection but the machine
 

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.920
is self reflection but the machine
actually tries to generate new

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:28.930
actually tries to generate new
 

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.290
actually tries to generate new
simulators that explain its own

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:31.300
simulators that explain its own
 

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.480
simulators that explain its own
experiences that is a basically a

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:33.490
experiences that is a basically a
 

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.370
experiences that is a basically a
process of self-reflection it's not that

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:35.380
process of self-reflection it's not that
 

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.040
process of self-reflection it's not that
an engineer and architect hand-coded a

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.050
an engineer and architect hand-coded a
 

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.030
an engineer and architect hand-coded a
simulator to let the Machine figure out

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040
simulator to let the Machine figure out
 

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.560
simulator to let the Machine figure out
what's going on but the machine does it

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:43.570
what's going on but the machine does it
 

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.270
what's going on but the machine does it
for itself so let me show you how that

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:45.280
for itself so let me show you how that
 

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.730
for itself so let me show you how that
works first for a simple robot and then

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:47.740
works first for a simple robot and then
 

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.320
works first for a simple robot and then
we'll try to see to project into the

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:49.330
we'll try to see to project into the
 

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.620
we'll try to see to project into the
future so this is a robot that we we

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:52.630
future so this is a robot that we we
 

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.170
future so this is a robot that we we
built it has four legs it has eight

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:55.180
built it has four legs it has eight
 

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.500
built it has four legs it has eight
motors two on each leg one of the hip

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:58.510
motors two on each leg one of the hip
 

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.750
motors two on each leg one of the hip
and one of the knee and it has two cells

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:00.760
and one of the knee and it has two cells
 

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.450
and one of the knee and it has two cells
tilt sensors that tell the robot house

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:03.460
tilt sensors that tell the robot house
 

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.860
tilt sensors that tell the robot house
tilted left and right forward and

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:04.870
tilted left and right forward and
 

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.680
tilted left and right forward and
backward okay very very sparse input now

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:07.690
backward okay very very sparse input now
 

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.710
backward okay very very sparse input now
this one what needs to learn how to walk

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720
this one what needs to learn how to walk
 

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.630
this one what needs to learn how to walk
now the challenge is that this robot

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:12.640
now the challenge is that this robot
 

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.120
now the challenge is that this robot
does not know that it has four legs all

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.130
does not know that it has four legs all
 

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.550
does not know that it has four legs all
that it knows is that it has eight

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560
that it knows is that it has eight
 

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.620
that it knows is that it has eight
mortars and it can feel the tilt angle

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:19.630
mortars and it can feel the tilt angle
 

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.300
mortars and it can feel the tilt angle
so imagine yourself sitting in a black

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:21.310
so imagine yourself sitting in a black
 

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.210
so imagine yourself sitting in a black
box with no windows and you have eight

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:24.220
box with no windows and you have eight
 

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.640
box with no windows and you have eight
knobs and you can turn the knobs and as

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:26.650
knobs and you can turn the knobs and as
 

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:27.160
knobs and you can turn the knobs and as
you

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:27.170
you
 

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.440
you
the knobs you can feel the Box leaning

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:29.450
the knobs you can feel the Box leaning
 

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.210
the knobs you can feel the Box leaning
left and right forward and backwards and

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:31.220
left and right forward and backwards and
 

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.030
left and right forward and backwards and
with that you have to learn how to make

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040
with that you have to learn how to make
 

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.150
with that you have to learn how to make
the Box move forward so that's what this

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160
the Box move forward so that's what this
 

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.850
the Box move forward so that's what this
robot feels like so to speak so the way

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:39.860
robot feels like so to speak so the way
 

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.310
robot feels like so to speak so the way
it works is that robot begins by doing a

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320
it works is that robot begins by doing a
 

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.449
it works is that robot begins by doing a
random motion and it then formulate

00:16:45.449 --> 00:16:45.459
random motion and it then formulate
 

00:16:45.459 --> 00:16:48.550
random motion and it then formulate
hypotheses about our model simulators

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560
hypotheses about our model simulators
 

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.560
hypotheses about our model simulators
these are these are hypotheses about

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:50.570
these are these are hypotheses about
 

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.000
these are these are hypotheses about
what it might look like and I'll show

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.010
what it might look like and I'll show
 

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.129
what it might look like and I'll show
you the movie in a second and you'll see

00:16:54.129 --> 00:16:54.139
you the movie in a second and you'll see
 

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:55.720
you the movie in a second and you'll see
that all the hypotheses all the

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:55.730
that all the hypotheses all the
 

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.430
that all the hypotheses all the
simulators that it generates for itself

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440
simulators that it generates for itself
 

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.420
simulators that it generates for itself
are wrong but they are in so far as the

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:01.430
are wrong but they are in so far as the
 

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.059
are wrong but they are in so far as the
robot knows they are all valid

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:04.069
robot knows they are all valid
 

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.860
robot knows they are all valid
hypothesis because they match its

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:05.870
hypothesis because they match its
 

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.120
hypothesis because they match its
experience you will know that they're

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.130
experience you will know that they're
 

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.799
experience you will know that they're
wrong because you happen to know what

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:08.809
wrong because you happen to know what
 

00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:11.230
wrong because you happen to know what
the robot actually looks like it will

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240
the robot actually looks like it will
 

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.630
the robot actually looks like it will
then and this is the key step it will

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640
then and this is the key step it will
 

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.669
then and this is the key step it will
figure out what's the best action to do

00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679
figure out what's the best action to do
 

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:18.970
figure out what's the best action to do
to cause the most disagreement between

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:18.980
to cause the most disagreement between
 

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.669
to cause the most disagreement between
predictions of these models why because

00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679
predictions of these models why because
 

00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:24.579
predictions of these models why because
the action that we will do the data it

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:24.589
the action that we will do the data it
 

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.880
the action that we will do the data it
will collect will then refute a rule out

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:27.890
will collect will then refute a rule out
 

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.169
will collect will then refute a rule out
some of the models and leave others

00:17:29.169 --> 00:17:29.179
some of the models and leave others
 

00:17:29.179 --> 00:17:30.940
some of the models and leave others
intact so we'll keep then we'll do a

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:30.950
intact so we'll keep then we'll do a
 

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.340
intact so we'll keep then we'll do a
physical experiment rule some of them

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:33.350
physical experiment rule some of them
 

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.440
physical experiment rule some of them
out and keep on going a circle until it

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.450
out and keep on going a circle until it
 

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.270
out and keep on going a circle until it
cannot disambiguate them anymore at

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280
cannot disambiguate them anymore at
 

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.890
cannot disambiguate them anymore at
which one it has a good simulation of

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:38.900
which one it has a good simulation of
 

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.470
which one it has a good simulation of
itself and then it can make this the

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.480
itself and then it can make this the
 

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.230
itself and then it can make this the
model in simulation move forward and

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240
model in simulation move forward and
 

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.000
model in simulation move forward and
because the model is pretty much correct

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.010
because the model is pretty much correct
 

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.310
because the model is pretty much correct
what makes the model move forward will

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320
what makes the model move forward will
 

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.710
what makes the model move forward will
make the robot move forward as well so

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720
make the robot move forward as well so
 

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.060
make the robot move forward as well so
here's an example of this thing working

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.070
here's an example of this thing working
 

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.250
here's an example of this thing working
and if I had more time I'd show you all

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:54.260
and if I had more time I'd show you all
 

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.840
and if I had more time I'd show you all
the failures as well but I'll skip

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:55.850
the failures as well but I'll skip
 

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.789
the failures as well but I'll skip
straight to the thing that works and

00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799
straight to the thing that works and
 

00:17:57.799 --> 00:18:00.070
straight to the thing that works and
this is this is the robot doing its

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080
this is this is the robot doing its
 

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.919
this is this is the robot doing its
first random action and now here are all

00:18:02.919 --> 00:18:02.929
first random action and now here are all
 

00:18:02.929 --> 00:18:05.289
first random action and now here are all
the policies that it's generating you

00:18:05.289 --> 00:18:05.299
the policies that it's generating you
 

00:18:05.299 --> 00:18:07.570
the policies that it's generating you
can see they're all wrong but it's kind

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:07.580
can see they're all wrong but it's kind
 

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.850
can see they're all wrong but it's kind
of figure out that they all make the

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:09.860
of figure out that they all make the
 

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.580
of figure out that they all make the
center of green block tilt in the same

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:12.590
center of green block tilt in the same
 

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.169
center of green block tilt in the same
way this is already ate that of 16

00:18:14.169 --> 00:18:14.179
way this is already ate that of 16
 

00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:16.270
way this is already ate that of 16
trials is beginning to figure out that

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280
trials is beginning to figure out that
 

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.250
trials is beginning to figure out that
it's got four legs doesn't quite know

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:18.260
it's got four legs doesn't quite know
 

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.310
it's got four legs doesn't quite know
how they're hooked up and where and this

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320
how they're hooked up and where and this
 

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.970
how they're hooked up and where and this
is ready the sixteenth trial out of 16

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:24.980
is ready the sixteenth trial out of 16
 

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.280
is ready the sixteenth trial out of 16
and it basically created a model of

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:27.290
and it basically created a model of
 

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.380
and it basically created a model of
itself ok now it's not a great model

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:29.390
itself ok now it's not a great model
 

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.930
itself ok now it's not a great model
it's not very accurate it's pretty

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:31.940
it's not very accurate it's pretty
 

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.560
it's not very accurate it's pretty
simple but nonetheless making that model

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:35.570
simple but nonetheless making that model
 

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.109
simple but nonetheless making that model
move forward will also make the robot

00:18:38.109 --> 00:18:38.119
move forward will also make the robot
 

00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:41.169
move forward will also make the robot
for we were hoping to for the robot to

00:18:41.169 --> 00:18:41.179
for we were hoping to for the robot to
 

00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:43.749
for we were hoping to for the robot to
generate some evil spider ewok but

00:18:43.749 --> 00:18:43.759
generate some evil spider ewok but
 

00:18:43.759 --> 00:19:10.959
generate some evil spider ewok but
instead cell then using that okay and

00:19:10.959 --> 00:19:10.969
instead cell then using that okay and
 

00:19:10.969 --> 00:19:16.359
instead cell then using that okay and
just to test it we remove the Lego watch

00:19:16.359 --> 00:19:16.369
just to test it we remove the Lego watch
 

00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:22.809
just to test it we remove the Lego watch
what happened so nothing happening try

00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:22.819
what happened so nothing happening try
 

00:19:22.819 --> 00:19:35.799
what happened so nothing happening try
this again the dynamics changed and then

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:35.809
this again the dynamics changed and then
 

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:38.049
this again the dynamics changed and then
it kind of internally begins to adapt it

00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:38.059
it kind of internally begins to adapt it
 

00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:39.699
it kind of internally begins to adapt it
small and basically lost the leg

00:19:39.699 --> 00:19:39.709
small and basically lost the leg
 

00:19:39.709 --> 00:19:42.069
small and basically lost the leg
internally if you look here it didn't

00:19:42.069 --> 00:19:42.079
internally if you look here it didn't
 

00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:43.539
internally if you look here it didn't
quite lose the leg it just made it very

00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:43.549
quite lose the leg it just made it very
 

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:46.419
quite lose the leg it just made it very
short and then because it still has to

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:46.429
short and then because it still has to
 

00:19:46.429 --> 00:19:47.829
short and then because it still has to
explain where all the eight motors are

00:19:47.829 --> 00:19:47.839
explain where all the eight motors are
 

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:50.109
explain where all the eight motors are
and then it figured out a way to move

00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:50.119
and then it figured out a way to move
 

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:52.689
and then it figured out a way to move
forward without legged again it's not a

00:19:52.689 --> 00:19:52.699
forward without legged again it's not a
 

00:19:52.699 --> 00:19:56.139
forward without legged again it's not a
great way moving forward but the basic

00:19:56.139 --> 00:19:56.149
great way moving forward but the basic
 

00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:57.849
great way moving forward but the basic
point here is that there was no sensor

00:19:57.849 --> 00:19:57.859
point here is that there was no sensor
 

00:19:57.859 --> 00:20:12.759
point here is that there was no sensor
that says

00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:12.769
 
 

00:20:12.769 --> 00:20:16.219
 
it's all about adaptation and if you

00:20:16.219 --> 00:20:16.229
it's all about adaptation and if you
 

00:20:16.229 --> 00:20:18.589
it's all about adaptation and if you
look at how this thing behaves red are

00:20:18.589 --> 00:20:18.599
look at how this thing behaves red are
 

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:22.039
look at how this thing behaves red are
the random models what a random control

00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:22.049
the random models what a random control
 

00:20:22.049 --> 00:20:24.680
the random models what a random control
that does black is what the self model

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:24.690
that does black is what the self model
 

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.379
that does black is what the self model
predicts and blue is where the robot

00:20:27.379 --> 00:20:27.389
predicts and blue is where the robot
 

00:20:27.389 --> 00:20:29.569
predicts and blue is where the robot
reaches in physical reality which

00:20:29.569 --> 00:20:29.579
reaches in physical reality which
 

00:20:29.579 --> 00:20:33.649
reaches in physical reality which
suggests that the self models are this

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:33.659
suggests that the self models are this
 

00:20:33.659 --> 00:20:35.599
suggests that the self models are this
is a robot from academia so the self

00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:35.609
is a robot from academia so the self
 

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:39.499
is a robot from academia so the self
models are inflated but nonetheless it

00:20:39.499 --> 00:20:39.509
models are inflated but nonetheless it
 

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:42.079
models are inflated but nonetheless it
allows the robot to move forward they're

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:42.089
allows the robot to move forward they're
 

00:20:42.089 --> 00:20:43.909
allows the robot to move forward they're
interesting ways which is interesting

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919
interesting ways which is interesting
 

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:45.529
interesting ways which is interesting
because it means that the self model

00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539
because it means that the self model
 

00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:47.569
because it means that the self model
doesn't have to be accurate in order to

00:20:47.569 --> 00:20:47.579
doesn't have to be accurate in order to
 

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:48.919
doesn't have to be accurate in order to
make the allow the machine before it has

make the allow the machine before it has
 

00:20:48.929 --> 00:20:51.139
make the allow the machine before it has
to be good enough to allow it to make

00:20:51.139 --> 00:20:51.149
to be good enough to allow it to make
 

00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:52.999
to be good enough to allow it to make
the right decisions and you can do that

00:20:52.999 --> 00:20:53.009
the right decisions and you can do that
 

00:20:53.009 --> 00:20:55.639
the right decisions and you can do that
with working now is having a robot model

00:20:55.639 --> 00:20:55.649
with working now is having a robot model
 

00:20:55.649 --> 00:20:58.279
with working now is having a robot model
another robot like theory of mine and so

00:20:58.279 --> 00:20:58.289
another robot like theory of mine and so
 

00:20:58.289 --> 00:20:59.930
another robot like theory of mine and so
forth of things like that so you're

00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940
forth of things like that so you're
 

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.669
forth of things like that so you're
probably by now asking yourself okay

00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679
probably by now asking yourself okay
 

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:03.469
probably by now asking yourself okay
this is cool but what I have to do with

00:21:03.469 --> 00:21:03.479
this is cool but what I have to do with
 

00:21:03.479 --> 00:21:06.079
this is cool but what I have to do with
architecture this is all robotics and I

want to take a step backwards and take

00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:07.859
want to take a step backwards and take
 

00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:09.229
want to take a step backwards and take
it for more in the cake if we're talking

00:21:09.229 --> 00:21:09.239
it for more in the cake if we're talking
 

00:21:09.239 --> 00:21:11.109
it for more in the cake if we're talking
about machines that can model themselves

00:21:11.109 --> 00:21:11.119
about machines that can model themselves
 

00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:13.969
about machines that can model themselves
what can we do with that and you know a

00:21:13.969 --> 00:21:13.979
what can we do with that and you know a
 

00:21:13.979 --> 00:21:16.339
what can we do with that and you know a
lot of I see in robot in architecture

00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:16.349
lot of I see in robot in architecture
 

00:21:16.349 --> 00:21:19.519

there's a lot of talk now about models

00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:19.529
there's a lot of talk now about models
 

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:20.930
there's a lot of talk now about models
of buildings and building green

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940
of buildings and building green
 

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.879

buildings that can turn off and on

00:21:22.879 --> 00:21:22.889
buildings that can turn off and on
 

00:21:22.889 --> 00:21:26.779

sensors to maintain an environment and

00:21:26.779 --> 00:21:26.789
sensors to maintain an environment and
 

00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:28.279
sensors to maintain an environment and
so forth is a lot of modeling and

00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:28.289
so forth is a lot of modeling and
 

00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:29.869
so forth is a lot of modeling and
simulation that has to go on but we're

00:21:29.869 --> 00:21:29.879
simulation that has to go on but we're
 

00:21:29.879 --> 00:21:31.669
simulation that has to go on but we're
still usually talking about simulation

00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679
still usually talking about simulation
 

00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:33.799
still usually talking about simulation
that some expert comes along you pay him

00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:33.809
that some expert comes along you pay him
 

00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:36.289
that some expert comes along you pay him
a lot of money and they create a model

00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299
a lot of money and they create a model
 

00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:37.699
a lot of money and they create a model
of your building and that model is

00:21:37.699 --> 00:21:37.709
of your building and that model is
 

00:21:37.709 --> 00:21:40.069
of your building and that model is
probably going to be wrong a year later

00:21:40.069 --> 00:21:40.079
probably going to be wrong a year later
 

00:21:40.079 --> 00:21:42.349
probably going to be wrong a year later
right because everything changes so how

00:21:42.349 --> 00:21:42.359
right because everything changes so how
 

00:21:42.359 --> 00:21:44.389
right because everything changes so how
about thinking about buildings and

00:21:44.389 --> 00:21:44.399
about thinking about buildings and
 

00:21:44.399 --> 00:21:45.979
about thinking about buildings and
things that can actually adapt and

00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:45.989
things that can actually adapt and
 

00:21:45.989 --> 00:21:47.899
things that can actually adapt and
create a model of themselves and we did

00:21:47.899 --> 00:21:47.909
create a model of themselves and we did
 

00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:50.119
create a model of themselves and we did
one simple experiment that's somewhat

00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:50.129
one simple experiment that's somewhat
 

00:21:50.129 --> 00:21:53.869

building this is a bridge I walk over

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:55.769
building this is a bridge I walk over
 

00:21:55.769 --> 00:21:58.459
building this is a bridge I walk over
when out when I cross when I walk to

00:21:58.459 --> 00:21:58.469

Cornell every morning until recently it

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:01.289
Cornell every morning until recently it
 

00:22:01.289 --> 00:22:04.190
Cornell every morning until recently it
was more like this and when you cross

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200
was more like this and when you cross
 

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.249
was more like this and when you cross
the bridge here you have a long time to

00:22:07.249 --> 00:22:07.259
the bridge here you have a long time to
 

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:11.239
the bridge here you have a long time to
think what would happen if one of the

00:22:11.239 --> 00:22:11.249
think what would happen if one of the
 

00:22:11.249 --> 00:22:12.580
think what would happen if one of the
bars would fail

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:12.590
bars would fail
 

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.299
bars would fail
and so we said okay let's take the same

00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:16.309
and so we said okay let's take the same
 

00:22:16.309 --> 00:22:18.580
and so we said okay let's take the same
ID and apply to a bridge so this time we

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:18.590
ID and apply to a bridge so this time we
 

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.350
ID and apply to a bridge so this time we
have a bridge you can barely see it here

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.360
have a bridge you can barely see it here
 

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.960
have a bridge you can barely see it here

percent weaker than it needs to be now
but this is a self modeling bridge so

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:27.140
but this is a self modeling bridge so
 

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.960
but this is a self modeling bridge so
what it does it has small vibrators

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:28.970
what it does it has small vibrators
 

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.000
what it does it has small vibrators
various places and these vibrators

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.010
various places and these vibrators
 

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.310
various places and these vibrators
vibrated the bridge and tiny amounts and

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320
vibrated the bridge and tiny amounts and
 

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.260
vibrated the bridge and tiny amounts and
then the bridge can sense the vibrations

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:35.270
then the bridge can sense the vibrations
 

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.810
then the bridge can sense the vibrations
and from that it can create hypotheses

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:37.820
and from that it can create hypotheses
 

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.840
and from that it can create hypotheses
about what it is how we're pieces

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:40.850
about what it is how we're pieces
 

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:42.430
about what it is how we're pieces
connecting and how they're connected and

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:42.440
connecting and how they're connected and
 

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.610
connecting and how they're connected and
it forms multiple hypotheses and then it

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:45.620
it forms multiple hypotheses and then it
 

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.830
it forms multiple hypotheses and then it
creates new vibrations to disambiguate

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840
creates new vibrations to disambiguate
 

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.230
creates new vibrations to disambiguate
to create to make these models disagree

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240
to create to make these models disagree
 

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.880
to create to make these models disagree
in their prediction just the same way we

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:51.890
in their prediction just the same way we
 

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.539
in their prediction just the same way we
had with the robot and we've shown in

00:22:55.539 --> 00:22:55.549
had with the robot and we've shown in
 

00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:58.120

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:02.169
simulation that this process the bridge
can identify the broken of the weak link

00:23:02.169 --> 00:23:02.179
can identify the broken of the weak link
 

00:23:02.179 --> 00:23:05.620
can identify the broken of the weak link
a lot faster and more accurately than

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:05.630
a lot faster and more accurately than
 

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.840
a lot faster and more accurately than
traditional civil engineering methods so

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:07.850
traditional civil engineering methods so
 

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.250
traditional civil engineering methods so
this is just an example I will take this

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:09.260
this is just an example I will take this
 

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:15.029
this is just an example I will take this
idea and apply it to a to a structure so

00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039
idea and apply it to a to a structure so
 

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:17.320
idea and apply it to a to a structure so
we've talked about self reflective

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:17.330
we've talked about self reflective
 

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.990
we've talked about self reflective
robotics self-reflecting structures so

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000
robotics self-reflecting structures so
 

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.549
robotics self-reflecting structures so
here's the the main point I'm going to

00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559
here's the the main point I'm going to
 

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:23.820
here's the the main point I'm going to
leave you with thinking about the future

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:23.830
leave you with thinking about the future
 

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.710
leave you with thinking about the future
you know can we make self-reflective

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720
you know can we make self-reflective
 

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.149
you know can we make self-reflective
architecture that basically we have

00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159
architecture that basically we have
 

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:31.750
architecture that basically we have
objects or buildings that act and sense

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760
objects or buildings that act and sense
 

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.120
objects or buildings that act and sense
and create using that data they create a

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:34.130
and create using that data they create a
 

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.180
and create using that data they create a
model of themselves they created self

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:37.190
model of themselves they created self
 

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.860
model of themselves they created self
simulation or self image that could be

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:38.870
simulation or self image that could be
 

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.600
simulation or self image that could be
of themselves of their environment and

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:40.610
of themselves of their environment and
 

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.139
of themselves of their environment and
of their users it's all together using

00:23:44.139 --> 00:23:44.149
of their users it's all together using
 

00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:45.940
of their users it's all together using
these models they can adapt to change

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:45.950
these models they can adapt to change
 

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.049
these models they can adapt to change
faster and we do that with fewer

00:23:50.049 --> 00:23:50.059
faster and we do that with fewer
 

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:51.730
faster and we do that with fewer
physical trials just like the robot

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:51.740
physical trials just like the robot
 

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.230
physical trials just like the robot
didn't have to do all these physical

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240
didn't have to do all these physical
 

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.230
didn't have to do all these physical
trials because it had the self model and

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240
trials because it had the self model and
 

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.060
trials because it had the self model and
finally how can we take this from these

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:58.070
finally how can we take this from these
 

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.029
finally how can we take this from these
simple structures and simple machines to

graphics so these are two sort of

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:10.390
graphics so these are two sort of
 

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.350

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.130
thinking of computers as a tool so the
way I want to approach this this idea of

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:29.140
way I want to approach this this idea of
 

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.870
way I want to approach this this idea of
throughput computing is to start out by

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880
throughput computing is to start out by
 

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.980
throughput computing is to start out by
asking the question how do you measure

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:31.990
asking the question how do you measure
 

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.409
asking the question how do you measure
speed and I'm talking about the speed of

00:25:34.409 --> 00:25:34.419
speed and I'm talking about the speed of
 

00:25:34.419 --> 00:25:38.310
speed and I'm talking about the speed of
a computer so the simplest way you sort

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320
a computer so the simplest way you sort
 

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.780
a computer so the simplest way you sort
of the intuitive way that you think

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:39.790
of the intuitive way that you think
 

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.909
of the intuitive way that you think
about speed as you say I have a task I

00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919
about speed as you say I have a task I
 

00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:44.970
about speed as you say I have a task I
want to you know launch a render job in

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:44.980
want to you know launch a render job in
 

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.180
want to you know launch a render job in
light weight or whatever it is and I

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:48.190
light weight or whatever it is and I
 

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.240
light weight or whatever it is and I
look at the clock when I start I wait an

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:51.250
look at the clock when I start I wait an
 

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.500
look at the clock when I start I wait an
hour and a half hurt to finish I look at

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:52.510
hour and a half hurt to finish I look at
 

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.549
hour and a half hurt to finish I look at
the clock when I'm done and I say okay

00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559
the clock when I'm done and I say okay
 

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:55.400
the clock when I'm done and I say okay
that task took an hour and a half and

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:55.410
that task took an hour and a half and
 

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.140
that task took an hour and a half and
then a year goes by i buy a faster

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:58.150
then a year goes by i buy a faster
 

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.419
then a year goes by i buy a faster
computer i round it again and it takes

00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:00.429
computer i round it again and it takes
 

00:26:00.429 --> 00:26:02.520
computer i round it again and it takes
45 minutes so okay it's twice as fast

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:02.530
45 minutes so okay it's twice as fast
 

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.250
45 minutes so okay it's twice as fast
very simple intuitive sort of way of

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:05.260
very simple intuitive sort of way of
 

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.310
very simple intuitive sort of way of
thinking about speed but there's another

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320
thinking about speed but there's another
 

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.340
thinking about speed but there's another
way of thinking about speed which is

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:11.350
way of thinking about speed which is
 

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.440
way of thinking about speed which is
maybe a little more subtle which is the

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:13.450
maybe a little more subtle which is the
 

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.360
maybe a little more subtle which is the
idea of instead of looking at a single

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:15.370
idea of instead of looking at a single
 

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.700
idea of instead of looking at a single
task and calculating how long that takes

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:17.710
task and calculating how long that takes
 

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.730
task and calculating how long that takes
is to think of throughput which is how

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:20.740
is to think of throughput which is how
 

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.880
is to think of throughput which is how
much can I do

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:21.890
much can I do
 

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.770
much can I do
second so thinking about sort of the

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:23.780
second so thinking about sort of the
 

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.000
second so thinking about sort of the
bulk rate at which I can do things and

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.010
bulk rate at which I can do things and
 

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.560
bulk rate at which I can do things and
so that the technical term for these the

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:29.570
so that the technical term for these the
 

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:32.260
so that the technical term for these the
first the first measurement is is called

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:32.270
first the first measurement is is called
 

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.420
first the first measurement is is called
latency and the second is known as

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:34.430
latency and the second is known as
 

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.730
latency and the second is known as
throughput these are sort of two

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:36.740
throughput these are sort of two
 

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.150
throughput these are sort of two
competing ways of thinking about how do

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:40.160
competing ways of thinking about how do
 

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.710
competing ways of thinking about how do
you measure the speed of a computing

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:41.720
you measure the speed of a computing
 

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.830
you measure the speed of a computing
device and they lead to very different

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840
device and they lead to very different
 

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.930
device and they lead to very different
places and so the point I want to talk

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:46.940
places and so the point I want to talk
 

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.100
places and so the point I want to talk
what I want to talk about today is

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:48.110
what I want to talk about today is
 

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:50.410
what I want to talk about today is
throughput and so if you start thinking

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:50.420
throughput and so if you start thinking
 

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.490
throughput and so if you start thinking
about through but where does this lead

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:51.500
about through but where does this lead
 

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.910
about through but where does this lead
you so if your measurement is how much

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:54.920
you so if your measurement is how much
 

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.580
you so if your measurement is how much
can I do it once or I'm sorry is how

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:57.590
can I do it once or I'm sorry is how
 

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.310
can I do it once or I'm sorry is how
much can I do in a given amount of time

00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.320
much can I do in a given amount of time
 

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.300
much can I do in a given amount of time
the sort of natural way that you would

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:01.310
the sort of natural way that you would
 

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.340
the sort of natural way that you would
think about doing improving this number

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:03.350
think about doing improving this number
 

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.170
think about doing improving this number
right is to do a lot a lot of things at

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:05.180
right is to do a lot a lot of things at
 

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.970
right is to do a lot a lot of things at
the same time and so there's this

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:06.980
the same time and so there's this
 

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.040
the same time and so there's this
inherent relationship between high

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.050
inherent relationship between high
 

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:11.410
inherent relationship between high
throughput and parallelism and by

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:11.420
throughput and parallelism and by
 

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.660
throughput and parallelism and by
parallelism I mean solving many problems

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:13.670
parallelism I mean solving many problems
 

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.180
parallelism I mean solving many problems
simultaneously and so if you design a

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:16.190
simultaneously and so if you design a
 

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.640
simultaneously and so if you design a
processor or a computer for

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:18.650
processor or a computer for
 

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.710
processor or a computer for
high-throughput the way that you

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720
high-throughput the way that you
 

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.000
high-throughput the way that you
typically think about this is you'd also

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.010
typically think about this is you'd also
 

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.800
typically think about this is you'd also
design it to have very high amount of

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:23.810
design it to have very high amount of
 

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.820
design it to have very high amount of
parallelism so here's kind of a simple

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:26.830
parallelism so here's kind of a simple
 

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.040
parallelism so here's kind of a simple
conceptual model so let's say I have a

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:30.050
conceptual model so let's say I have a
 

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.110
conceptual model so let's say I have a
glass with water and I want to drink it

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.120
glass with water and I want to drink it
 

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.570
glass with water and I want to drink it
as fast as possible so if all i care

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:34.580
as fast as possible so if all i care
 

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.880
as fast as possible so if all i care
about is latency the way that you might

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:36.890
about is latency the way that you might
 

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.580
about is latency the way that you might
think about improving your latency at

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:39.590
think about improving your latency at
 

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.650
think about improving your latency at
drinking this glass of water is you

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:41.660
drinking this glass of water is you
 

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.810
drinking this glass of water is you
would buy a really gigantic straw right

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:43.820
would buy a really gigantic straw right
 

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.570
would buy a really gigantic straw right
and you would you would suck on the

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:46.580
and you would you would suck on the
 

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.490
and you would you would suck on the
straw as fast as you possibly can to

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:48.500
straw as fast as you possibly can to
 

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.170
straw as fast as you possibly can to
slurp up all the water all at once and

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:52.180
slurp up all the water all at once and
 

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.980
slurp up all the water all at once and
if you were thinking about this in terms

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:53.990
if you were thinking about this in terms
 

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.990
if you were thinking about this in terms
of throughput it would take sort of the

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000
of throughput it would take sort of the
 

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.610
of throughput it would take sort of the
alternate approach which is I'd go to

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:57.620
alternate approach which is I'd go to
 

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.130
alternate approach which is I'd go to
the store i buy a pack of 100 straws I'd

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:00.140
the store i buy a pack of 100 straws I'd
 

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.230
the store i buy a pack of 100 straws I'd
stick them all in the cup and I suck

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240
stick them all in the cup and I suck
 

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.230
stick them all in the cup and I suck
through all them at once and this kind

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240
through all them at once and this kind
 

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.030
through all them at once and this kind
of illustrates that the two competing

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:07.040
of illustrates that the two competing
 

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.990
of illustrates that the two competing
ways that you would think about

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000
ways that you would think about
 

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.420
ways that you would think about
designing a processor in fact so a

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:10.430
designing a processor in fact so a
 

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.670
designing a processor in fact so a
latency processor it tends to be very

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:12.680
latency processor it tends to be very
 

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.980
latency processor it tends to be very
fast very efficient very well designed

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:14.990
fast very efficient very well designed
 

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.760
fast very efficient very well designed
very expensive very sophisticated and

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:18.770
very expensive very sophisticated and
 

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.290
very expensive very sophisticated and
very good at doing one thing really fast

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:20.300
very good at doing one thing really fast
 

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.780
very good at doing one thing really fast
and the throughput based architecture

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:21.790
and the throughput based architecture
 

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.670
and the throughput based architecture
you have lots of little simple chords so

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:24.680
you have lots of little simple chords so
 

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.740
you have lots of little simple chords so
these sort of simple straws and the key

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:26.750
these sort of simple straws and the key
 

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.850
these sort of simple straws and the key
thing is to build something that's

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:27.860
thing is to build something that's
 

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.340
thing is to build something that's
scalable so I can jam more straws into

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:30.350
scalable so I can jam more straws into
 

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.540
scalable so I can jam more straws into
this top right and it'll keep getting

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:31.550
this top right and it'll keep getting
 

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.310
this top right and it'll keep getting
faster and faster and they don't

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320
faster and faster and they don't
 

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.529
faster and faster and they don't
interfere with each other

00:28:34.529 --> 00:28:34.539
interfere with each other
 

00:28:34.539 --> 00:28:36.970
interfere with each other
carry the analogy too far i guess but

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:36.980
carry the analogy too far i guess but
 

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.090
carry the analogy too far i guess but
you sort of get the idea so I work in

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:40.100
you sort of get the idea so I work in
 

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.470
you sort of get the idea so I work in
Vidya that there's actually lots of

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.480
Vidya that there's actually lots of
 

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.330
Vidya that there's actually lots of
companies that are building processors

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:43.340
companies that are building processors
 

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.399
companies that are building processors
like this so I don't want to be like a

00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:45.409
like this so I don't want to be like a
 

00:28:45.409 --> 00:28:48.100
like this so I don't want to be like a
marketing shell it is great obviously

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:48.110
marketing shell it is great obviously
 

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.379
marketing shell it is great obviously
but but this is in the air and there's

00:28:50.379 --> 00:28:50.389
but but this is in the air and there's
 

00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:51.609
but but this is in the air and there's
lots of companies that are that are

00:28:51.609 --> 00:28:51.619
lots of companies that are that are
 

00:28:51.619 --> 00:28:54.940
lots of companies that are that are
thinking about computing in this way and

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:54.950
thinking about computing in this way and
 

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.909
thinking about computing in this way and
so our latest generation processor which

00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919
so our latest generation processor which
 

00:28:57.919 --> 00:29:00.340
so our latest generation processor which
is called Fermi is a great example of a

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:00.350
is called Fermi is a great example of a
 

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.919
is called Fermi is a great example of a
throughput based processor and it's

00:29:02.919 --> 00:29:02.929
throughput based processor and it's
 

00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:05.379
throughput based processor and it's
designed for throughput so you might

00:29:05.379 --> 00:29:05.389
designed for throughput so you might
 

00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:07.419
designed for throughput so you might
think of you go to the store and you buy

00:29:07.419 --> 00:29:07.429
think of you go to the store and you buy
 

00:29:07.429 --> 00:29:10.480
think of you go to the store and you buy
a dual core or quad core CPU it has two

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:10.490
a dual core or quad core CPU it has two
 

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.070
a dual core or quad core CPU it has two
or four core as well well our ship has

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080
or four core as well well our ship has
 

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.619
or four core as well well our ship has
512 cores and each of those pores can

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:14.629
512 cores and each of those pores can
 

00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:17.549
512 cores and each of those pores can
actually do 48 things at the same time

00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559
actually do 48 things at the same time
 

00:29:17.559 --> 00:29:20.710
actually do 48 things at the same time
so in total we can do 24,000 things at

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720
so in total we can do 24,000 things at
 

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.639
so in total we can do 24,000 things at
once at the same time on one chip and

00:29:24.639 --> 00:29:24.649
once at the same time on one chip and
 

00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:27.190
once at the same time on one chip and
these aren't expensive chips you know

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200
these aren't expensive chips you know
 

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.200
these aren't expensive chips you know
this is a this is a consumer commodity

00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:45.889
supercomputers what kind of processors
are they made from with very few

00:31:45.889 --> 00:31:45.899
are they made from with very few
 

00:31:45.899 --> 00:31:47.629

exceptions they're made from processors

00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639
exceptions they're made from processors
 

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:50.239
exceptions they're made from processors
that are designed for low latency not

00:31:50.249 --> 00:31:52.700
that are designed for low latency not
high throughput and its really only very

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:52.710
high throughput and its really only very
 

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.769
high throughput and its really only very
recently at the very top be sort of more

00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779
recently at the very top be sort of more
 

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:57.080
recently at the very top be sort of more
recent at the top end supercomputers

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:57.090

they're starting to use these throughput

00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919
they're starting to use these throughput
 

00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:02.210
they're starting to use these throughput
oriented processors and so one reason

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.220
oriented processors and so one reason
 

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.249
oriented processors and so one reason
that we can have one throughput oriental

00:32:04.249 --> 00:32:04.259
that we can have one throughput oriental
 

00:32:04.259 --> 00:32:06.440
that we can have one throughput oriental
processor that you know consumer level

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:06.450
processor that you know consumer level
 

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.599
processor that you know consumer level
inexpensive and it can do so well is

00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:08.609
inexpensive and it can do so well is
 

00:32:08.609 --> 00:32:11.509
inexpensive and it can do so well is
because it's actually designed to be

00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519
because it's actually designed to be
 

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:13.519
because it's actually designed to be

good at this kind of thing you know in
 

00:32:13.529 --> 00:32:15.349
good at this kind of thing you know in
the past we took these processors that

00:32:15.349 --> 00:32:15.359
the past we took these processors that
 

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:17.149
the past we took these processors that
were good at low latency and then use

00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159
were good at low latency and then use
 

00:32:17.159 --> 00:32:18.769
were good at low latency and then use
them to solve these these throughput

00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779
them to solve these these throughput
 

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:20.629
them to solve these these throughput
related problems and suddenly when you

00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:20.639
related problems and suddenly when you
 

00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:23.119
related problems and suddenly when you
it'sit's it really is a sea change in

00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:23.129
it'sit's it really is a sea change in
 

00:32:23.129 --> 00:32:24.259
it'sit's it really is a sea change in
computer science that's happening right

00:32:24.259 --> 00:32:24.269
computer science that's happening right
 

00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:26.690
computer science that's happening right
now is this recognition that throughput

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700
now is this recognition that throughput
 

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.460
now is this recognition that throughput
is really the way that you want to think

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:28.470
is really the way that you want to think
 

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.019
is really the way that you want to think
about the speed when you're solving very

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:30.029
about the speed when you're solving very
 

00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:34.489
about the speed when you're solving very
large math problems so the interesting

00:32:34.489 --> 00:32:34.499
large math problems so the interesting
 

00:32:34.499 --> 00:32:35.960
large math problems so the interesting
thing so you can go to the store and buy

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:35.970
thing so you can go to the store and buy
 

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.509
thing so you can go to the store and buy
spend 500 otters on this literally

00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519
spend 500 otters on this literally
 

00:32:38.519 --> 00:32:41.029
spend 500 otters on this literally
little mini supercomputer and the

00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039
little mini supercomputer and the
 

00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:42.379
little mini supercomputer and the
interesting question is what can you do

00:32:42.379 --> 00:32:42.389
interesting question is what can you do
 

00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:44.149
interesting question is what can you do
with it how does this affect you the

00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159
with it how does this affect you the
 

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:47.930
with it how does this affect you the
users of these tools so this is a just

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940
users of these tools so this is a just
 

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.989
users of these tools so this is a just
kind of show plotting along this axis is

00:32:50.989 --> 00:32:50.999
kind of show plotting along this axis is
 

00:32:50.999 --> 00:32:53.389
kind of show plotting along this axis is
the amount of processing power so how

00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399
the amount of processing power so how
 

00:32:53.399 --> 00:32:55.460
the amount of processing power so how
many operations per second process which

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:55.470
many operations per second process which
 

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.399
many operations per second process which
could do and kind of representation of

00:32:58.399 --> 00:32:58.409
could do and kind of representation of
 

00:32:58.409 --> 00:33:01.519
could do and kind of representation of
what kind of images you could create so

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:01.529
what kind of images you could create so
 

00:33:01.529 --> 00:33:02.769
what kind of images you could create so
if you take all these

00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:02.779
if you take all these
 

00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:05.539

called shaders programmable shading so
you could actually write a little

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:28.020
you could actually write a little
 

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.690
you could actually write a little
program that specified the color of

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700
program that specified the color of
 

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.370
program that specified the color of
every point and do much more interesting

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:31.380
every point and do much more interesting
 

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.350

please ok

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:03.450
 
 

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:04.879
 
so we're supposed to talk about the

00:34:04.879 --> 00:34:04.889
so we're supposed to talk about the
 

00:34:04.889 --> 00:34:06.590
so we're supposed to talk about the
future so i'm going to show you stuff

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600
future so i'm going to show you stuff
 

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.589
future so i'm going to show you stuff
that it just today and you can

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599
that it just today and you can
 

00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:12.849
that it just today and you can
extrapolate after the future so this is

00:34:12.849 --> 00:34:12.859
extrapolate after the future so this is
 

00:34:12.859 --> 00:34:16.310
extrapolate after the future so this is
so we just released a ray tracing

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320
so we just released a ray tracing
 

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.020
so we just released a ray tracing
library called optics and this is a demo

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:18.030
library called optics and this is a demo
 

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.339
library called optics and this is a demo
that we released you can actually

00:34:19.339 --> 00:34:19.349
that we released you can actually
 

00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:21.230
that we released you can actually
download from our website called design

garage which is just kind of showing off

00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:23.339
garage which is just kind of showing off
 

00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:26.119
garage which is just kind of showing off
as a proof of concept what you can do

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:26.129
as a proof of concept what you can do
 

00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:28.879
as a proof of concept what you can do
when you have this kind of power so

00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:28.889
when you have this kind of power so
 

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:31.970
when you have this kind of power so
design garage lets you take a car model

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980
design garage lets you take a car model
 

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.500
design garage lets you take a car model
and put it in an environment and play

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:33.510
and put it in an environment and play
 

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.690
and put it in an environment and play
with material parameters and

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700
with material parameters and
 

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.730
with material parameters and
interactively it generates these images

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740
interactively it generates these images
 

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:40.730
interactively it generates these images
and so you can see now we can move the

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740
and so you can see now we can move the
 

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:45.409
and so you can see now we can move the
camera and its interactive so as you

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419
camera and its interactive so as you
 

00:34:45.419 --> 00:34:47.750
camera and its interactive so as you
move around the quality goes down and

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760
move around the quality goes down and
 

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.730
move around the quality goes down and
then you hold still for a few seconds

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:49.740
then you hold still for a few seconds
 

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.030
then you hold still for a few seconds
and it converges to a more accurate

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040
and it converges to a more accurate
 

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.909
and it converges to a more accurate
solution so here's changing the the

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919
solution so here's changing the the
 

00:34:55.919 --> 00:34:58.220
solution so here's changing the the
skylight and so these are the kinds of

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.230
skylight and so these are the kinds of
 

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.170
skylight and so these are the kinds of
renders that people expect to take you

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180
renders that people expect to take you
 

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.880
renders that people expect to take you
know a few hours right if people have

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:01.890
know a few hours right if people have
 

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.470
know a few hours right if people have
played around with these high-end

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480
played around with these high-end
 

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.589
played around with these high-end
rendering packages the idea that this

00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599
rendering packages the idea that this
 

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:07.940
rendering packages the idea that this
could be interactive i think is kind of

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:07.950
could be interactive i think is kind of
 

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.260
could be interactive i think is kind of
mind-blowing to someone who's used to

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:09.270
mind-blowing to someone who's used to
 

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:12.040
mind-blowing to someone who's used to
running a full global illumination

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:12.050

polygons this is showing we can actually

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420
polygons this is showing we can actually
 

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.390
polygons this is showing we can actually
adjust the depth of field so stimulating

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400
adjust the depth of field so stimulating
 

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.819
adjust the depth of field so stimulating
different focal lengths and again it

00:35:22.819 --> 00:35:22.829
different focal lengths and again it
 

00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:24.650
different focal lengths and again it
starts out kind of you know low quality

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:24.660
starts out kind of you know low quality
 

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.630
starts out kind of you know low quality
but it converges in a couple seconds to

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640
but it converges in a couple seconds to
 

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.640
but it converges in a couple seconds to
something that that's it's actually

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:28.650
something that that's it's actually
 

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.910
something that that's it's actually
quite good so here we pulled in the

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920
quite good so here we pulled in the
 

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.920
quite good so here we pulled in the
focus and now back to the mid ground so

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:36.930
focus and now back to the mid ground so
 

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.660
focus and now back to the mid ground so
now this is showing actually editing

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:38.670
now this is showing actually editing
 

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.940
now this is showing actually editing
material so again we can interactively

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:40.950
material so again we can interactively
 

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.740
material so again we can interactively
change the color we can change the

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:42.750
change the color we can change the
 

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.950
change the color we can change the
specular color versus the diffuse color

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960

soft area lights and shadows for diffuse
 

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.820
soft area lights and shadows for diffuse
the few shapes this looks kind of like

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:19.830
the few shapes this looks kind of like
 

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.250
the few shapes this looks kind of like
architectural models I think and again

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260
architectural models I think and again
 

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.160
architectural models I think and again
showing its interactive so as you move

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.170
showing its interactive so as you move
 

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.050
showing its interactive so as you move
it goes to this lower quality and as

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060
it goes to this lower quality and as
 

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.510
it goes to this lower quality and as
soon as you let the cameras stop within

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520
soon as you let the cameras stop within
 

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.370
soon as you let the cameras stop within
a few seconds you have a basically final

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380
a few seconds you have a basically final
 

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.080
a few seconds you have a basically final
quality image again you know compare

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:33.090
quality image again you know compare
 

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:35.090
quality image again you know compare
this to what you would expect it where

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:35.100
this to what you would expect it where
 

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.340
this to what you would expect it where
these are maybe 20 minutes to an hour to

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:37.350
these are maybe 20 minutes to an hour to
 

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.630
these are maybe 20 minutes to an hour to
get an image and here it is literally

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640
get an image and here it is literally
 

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:48.660
get an image and here it is literally
interactive

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:48.670
 
 

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:53.550
 
so this is showing a different technique

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:53.560
so this is showing a different technique
 

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.710
so this is showing a different technique
recent work by some of my colleagues

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.720

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:00.950
different method for calculating these
 

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.120
different method for calculating these
kind of accurate global lighting models

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.130
kind of accurate global lighting models
 

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:06.160
kind of accurate global lighting models
at the point here is that there's only

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:06.170
at the point here is that there's only
 

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.470
at the point here is that there's only
two light sources so there's this light

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480
two light sources so there's this light
 

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.609
two light sources so there's this light
and there's this light and all

00:37:09.609 --> 00:37:09.619
and there's this light and all
 

00:37:09.619 --> 00:37:12.690
and there's this light and all
everything you see is completely

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:12.700
everything you see is completely
 

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.630
everything you see is completely
calculated interactively again and so so

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640
calculated interactively again and so so
 

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.140
calculated interactively again and so so
you have everything from classics you

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:20.150
you have everything from classics you
 

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:21.730
you have everything from classics you
see the color temperature shifts as we

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:21.740
see the color temperature shifts as we
 

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.920
see the color temperature shifts as we
as we move the lights around and we're

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:23.930
as we move the lights around and we're
 

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.210
as we move the lights around and we're
getting red reflection vs green

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:25.220
getting red reflection vs green
 

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.630
getting red reflection vs green
reflection as the caustic here changes

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640
reflection as the caustic here changes
 

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.070
reflection as the caustic here changes
and it spills more or less green light

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:30.080
and it spills more or less green light
 

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.030
and it spills more or less green light
into the room and all these really

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040
into the room and all these really
 

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.730
into the room and all these really
complicated effects of the relationships

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:33.740
complicated effects of the relationships
 

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.820

again totally computer to interactively

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:42.190
 
 

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:45.190
 
so that's kind of a simple synthetic

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200
so that's kind of a simple synthetic
 

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.570
so that's kind of a simple synthetic
case so let me just show a slightly more

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:48.580
case so let me just show a slightly more
 

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.890
case so let me just show a slightly more
interesting case so Morgan McGwire who

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:52.900
interesting case so Morgan McGwire who
 

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.530
interesting case so Morgan McGwire who
did this work put it in a game engine so

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:56.540
did this work put it in a game engine so
 

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.359
did this work put it in a game engine so
this is kind of cool this is a game

00:37:58.359 --> 00:37:58.369
this is kind of cool this is a game
 

00:37:58.369 --> 00:38:01.120
this is kind of cool this is a game
level in a game engine that that he's

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:01.130

been developing using this lighting

00:38:03.099 --> 00:38:03.109
been developing using this lighting
 

00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:05.349
been developing using this lighting
model and the cool thing about it is

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359
model and the cool thing about it is
 

00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:06.940
model and the cool thing about it is
there's only I think there's these three

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:06.950
there's only I think there's these three
 

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.740
there's only I think there's these three
spotlights and that's it so there's no

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:08.750
spotlights and that's it so there's no
 

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:11.290
spotlights and that's it so there's no
synthetic sheet you know ambient term

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:11.300

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.750
synthetic sheet you know ambient term
everywhere or these kind of hacks that

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760
everywhere or these kind of hacks that
 

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.010
everywhere or these kind of hacks that
people used to do in game engines

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:15.020
people used to do in game engines
 

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.960

there's real lighting there's three real

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:16.970
there's real lighting there's three real
 

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:19.660
there's real lighting there's three real
lights and that's it and and all of the

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:19.670
lights and that's it and and all of the
 

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.810
lights and that's it and and all of the
effects of bounce light I think there's

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:22.820
effects of bounce light I think there's
 

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.490
effects of bounce light I think there's
a here right so shining the light on the

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:27.500
a here right so shining the light on the
 

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.080
a here right so shining the light on the
wall and the walls red so you get this

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:29.090
wall and the walls red so you get this
 

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.030
wall and the walls red so you get this
warm glow off of the wall again all

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040
warm glow off of the wall again all
 

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.570
warm glow off of the wall again all
interactively and if you if you've ever

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:33.580
interactively and if you if you've ever
 

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.210
interactively and if you if you've ever
done lighting and like a CG environment

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:37.220
done lighting and like a CG environment
 

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.340
done lighting and like a CG environment
or if you have any familiarity with it

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:39.350
or if you have any familiarity with it
 

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.540
or if you have any familiarity with it
this is just a completely different way

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:40.550
this is just a completely different way
 

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.640
this is just a completely different way
of thinking about lighting the game

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:42.650
of thinking about lighting the game
 

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:45.640
of thinking about lighting the game
developers are not used to lighting the

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:45.650
developers are not used to lighting the
 

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:48.609
developers are not used to lighting the
way the real world works they're used to

00:38:48.609 --> 00:38:48.619
way the real world works they're used to
 

00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:51.370
way the real world works they're used to
hacking it and the idea is that as you

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:51.380
hacking it and the idea is that as you
 

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.870
hacking it and the idea is that as you
change when you have enough computing

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880
change when you have enough computing
 

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.890
change when you have enough computing
power you actually do these things

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:53.900
power you actually do these things
 

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.059
power you actually do these things
accurately

00:38:55.059 --> 00:38:55.069
accurately
 

00:38:55.069 --> 00:39:01.140
accurately
why so I'm going to show one more thing

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:01.150
 
 

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:07.539
 
this is some recent work yeah so this is

00:39:07.539 --> 00:39:07.549
this is some recent work yeah so this is
 

00:39:07.549 --> 00:39:12.880
this is some recent work yeah so this is
work that I've done recently applying

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:12.890
work that I've done recently applying
 

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:16.390
work that I've done recently applying
the same parallel processor throughput

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400
the same parallel processor throughput
 

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.329
the same parallel processor throughput
or any third processors to realistic

00:39:18.329 --> 00:39:18.339
or any third processors to realistic
 

00:39:18.339 --> 00:39:20.920
or any third processors to realistic
interactive fluid simulation so this is

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:20.930
interactive fluid simulation so this is
 

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.269
interactive fluid simulation so this is
actually being characters as captured

00:39:22.269 --> 00:39:22.279
actually being characters as captured
 

00:39:22.279 --> 00:39:27.370
actually being characters as captured
from a high-end gamercard basically a

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:27.380
from a high-end gamercard basically a
 

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:32.499
from a high-end gamercard basically a
gtx 285 295 now 285 and it's actually

00:39:32.499 --> 00:39:32.509
gtx 285 295 now 285 and it's actually
 

00:39:32.509 --> 00:39:34.599
gtx 285 295 now 285 and it's actually
calculating the fluid flow of air around

00:39:34.599 --> 00:39:34.609
calculating the fluid flow of air around
 

00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:36.489
calculating the fluid flow of air around
the car so it's a took this little

00:39:36.489 --> 00:39:36.499
the car so it's a took this little
 

00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:39.370
the car so it's a took this little
driving game and we added this this

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:39.380
driving game and we added this this
 

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.999
driving game and we added this this
model for for air flowing over the car

00:39:42.999 --> 00:39:43.009
model for for air flowing over the car
 

00:39:43.009 --> 00:39:44.829
model for for air flowing over the car
and added these these little smoke

00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:44.839
and added these these little smoke
 

00:39:44.839 --> 00:39:45.939
and added these these little smoke
trails behind it and so we're actually

00:39:45.939 --> 00:39:45.949
trails behind it and so we're actually
 

00:39:45.949 --> 00:39:49.239
trails behind it and so we're actually
simulating in a rather realistic way the

00:39:49.239 --> 00:39:49.249
simulating in a rather realistic way the
 

00:39:49.249 --> 00:39:54.339
simulating in a rather realistic way the
airflow behind the car and if you think

00:39:54.339 --> 00:39:54.349
airflow behind the car and if you think
 

00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:56.289
airflow behind the car and if you think
of this as a design tool you know the

00:39:56.289 --> 00:39:56.299
of this as a design tool you know the
 

00:39:56.299 --> 00:39:59.079
of this as a design tool you know the
idea that you can have these models and

00:39:59.079 --> 00:39:59.089
idea that you can have these models and
 

00:39:59.089 --> 00:40:02.219
idea that you can have these models and
instead of sending it off to some

00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:02.229
instead of sending it off to some
 

00:40:02.229 --> 00:40:04.539
instead of sending it off to some
computer aided design package where you

00:40:04.539 --> 00:40:04.549
computer aided design package where you
 

00:40:04.549 --> 00:40:06.999
computer aided design package where you
wait 12 hours to get a result back this

00:40:06.999 --> 00:40:07.009
wait 12 hours to get a result back this
 

00:40:07.009 --> 00:40:08.499
wait 12 hours to get a result back this
isn't accurate enough that you'd want to

00:40:08.499 --> 00:40:08.509
isn't accurate enough that you'd want to
 

00:40:08.509 --> 00:40:12.039
isn't accurate enough that you'd want to
you know use this to predict real air

00:40:12.039 --> 00:40:12.049
you know use this to predict real air
 

00:40:12.049 --> 00:40:13.689
you know use this to predict real air
flow but from from the perspective of

00:40:13.689 --> 00:40:13.699
flow but from from the perspective of
 

00:40:13.699 --> 00:40:16.359
flow but from from the perspective of
getting a sense of you know how how

00:40:16.359 --> 00:40:16.369
getting a sense of you know how how
 

00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:17.829
getting a sense of you know how how
objects interact with their environments

00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839
objects interact with their environments
 

00:40:17.839 --> 00:40:25.710
objects interact with their environments
these are very

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720
 
 

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.589
 
these are very computationally intensive

00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599
these are very computationally intensive
 

00:40:28.599 --> 00:40:31.170
these are very computationally intensive
problems but as computers get faster and

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:31.180
problems but as computers get faster and
 

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.430
problems but as computers get faster and
faster you can actually do more and more

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.440
faster you can actually do more and more

of this stuff interactively night and I

00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:33.849

think to a level already today that that

this is showing we can have three cars

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:40.150
this is showing we can have three cars
 

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.530
this is showing we can have three cars

actually my favorite demo so we took

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:51.310
actually my favorite demo so we took
 

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:52.950

leaves so we start with all these leaves

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760
leaves so we start with all these leaves
 

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.770

on the ground as you drive the car

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:01.780
on the ground as you drive the car
 

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.830

around it kicks up these leaves very

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:04.840
around it kicks up these leaves very
 

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.130

subtle effect but it's so realistic the

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:08.140
subtle effect but it's so realistic the

of pushes the leaves and I think what's

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:11.980
of pushes the leaves and I think what's
 

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.550
of pushes the leaves and I think what's
really cool about this is it the car

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560
really cool about this is it the car
 

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.280

none of this right if you're just

none of this right if you're just
 

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.500
none of this right if you're just
driving this car around you say okay

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:19.510
driving this car around you say okay
 

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.870
driving this car around you say okay
that's the real fun but because you feel

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:13.160
the computation of motion so if i have a
scarf that's moving through the air we

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:13.170
scarf that's moving through the air we
 

01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:15.200
scarf that's moving through the air we
can ask ourselves how does it move and

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:15.210
can ask ourselves how does it move and
 

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:17.480
can ask ourselves how does it move and
how can we compute that motion so what

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:17.490
how can we compute that motion so what
 

01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:19.160
how can we compute that motion so what
what sort of questions we need to ask

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:19.170
what sort of questions we need to ask
 

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.620

ourselves we need to ask what sort of
forces are acting on the scarf and how

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:24.810
forces are acting on the scarf and how
 

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:26.540
forces are acting on the scarf and how
are those forces propelling it forward

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:26.550
are those forces propelling it forward
 

01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:29.300

figuring out what parts of it can we

01:09:11.190 --> 01:09:11.200
figuring out what parts of it can we
 

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.820
figuring out what parts of it can we
safely throw away and then computing the

safely throw away and then computing the
 

01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:17.519
safely throw away and then computing the
rest of it as efficiently as possible so

01:09:17.519 --> 01:09:17.529
rest of it as efficiently as possible so
 

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:22.160
rest of it as efficiently as possible so
how does that relate to today's topic

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:22.170
 
 

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:27.180
 
well I was asked to think about and

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:27.190
well I was asked to think about and
 

01:09:27.190 --> 01:09:30.240
well I was asked to think about and
speak about design and what that has to

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:30.250
speak about design and what that has to
 

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.490
speak about design and what that has to
do with my field and in some sense I've

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:32.500
do with my field and in some sense I've
 

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.890
do with my field and in some sense I've
you design as a process of exploration

01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:34.900
you design as a process of exploration
 

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:36.840
you design as a process of exploration
this is coming from someone who has not

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:36.850
this is coming from someone who has not
 

01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:38.849
this is coming from someone who has not
been educated in design so it's a very

01:09:38.849 --> 01:09:38.859
been educated in design so it's a very
 

01:09:38.859 --> 01:09:41.910
been educated in design so it's a very
naive but it's my my approach to

01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920
naive but it's my my approach to
 

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.170
naive but it's my my approach to
thinking about it as a process of

01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:43.180
thinking about it as a process of
 

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:46.140
thinking about it as a process of
exploration I have some set of

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:46.150
exploration I have some set of
 

01:09:46.150 --> 01:09:48.840
exploration I have some set of
parameters it may be many parameters and

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:48.850
parameters it may be many parameters and
 

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:53.099
parameters it may be many parameters and
now I want to try to figure out within

01:09:53.099 --> 01:09:53.109
now I want to try to figure out within
 

01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:55.230
now I want to try to figure out within
the space of parameters what are

01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:55.240
the space of parameters what are
 

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.720
the space of parameters what are
interesting acceptable possibilities

01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:57.730
interesting acceptable possibilities
 

01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:59.640
interesting acceptable possibilities
what are not acceptable what violates a

01:09:59.640 --> 01:09:59.650
what are not acceptable what violates a
 

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:02.040
what are not acceptable what violates a
fire code what doesn't and I want to

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:02.050
fire code what doesn't and I want to
 

01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:06.330
fire code what doesn't and I want to
explore this space now typically the

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:06.340
explore this space now typically the
 

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:08.060
explore this space now typically the
space doesn't have two parameters

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:08.070
space doesn't have two parameters
 

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:11.040
space doesn't have two parameters
typically it has way too many parameters

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:11.050
typically it has way too many parameters
 

01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:12.990
typically it has way too many parameters
in fact it could have an infinite number

01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000
in fact it could have an infinite number
 

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
in fact it could have an infinite number
of parameters so we need to think of a

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:15.010
of parameters so we need to think of a
 

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:20.400
of parameters so we need to think of a
few strategies for addressing this now

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:20.410
few strategies for addressing this now
 

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:23.040
few strategies for addressing this now
just brainstorming this and that there's

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.050
just brainstorming this and that there's
 

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:25.530
just brainstorming this and that there's
kind of two strategies you might take

01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:25.540
kind of two strategies you might take
 

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.670
kind of two strategies you might take
one is to go parallel if we could only

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:28.680
one is to go parallel if we could only
 

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.460
one is to go parallel if we could only
figure out how to evaluate many possible

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:32.470
figure out how to evaluate many possible
 

01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:35.250
figure out how to evaluate many possible
designs all at the same time right so

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:35.260
designs all at the same time right so
 

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.340
designs all at the same time right so
how might you go about going parallel in

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:38.350
how might you go about going parallel in
 

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:41.370
how might you go about going parallel in
a design space exploration one way is

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:41.380
a design space exploration one way is
 

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.550
a design space exploration one way is
maybe to use parallel hardware right so

01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560
maybe to use parallel hardware right so
 

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.960
maybe to use parallel hardware right so
we heard a little bit about some

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:45.970
we heard a little bit about some
 

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.390
we heard a little bit about some
promising directions from that from

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:39.190
 
 

01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:41.700
 
right so a whole bunch of these have

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:41.710
right so a whole bunch of these have
 

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:44.280
right so a whole bunch of these have
been set up and what the system offers

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:44.290
been set up and what the system offers
 

01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:47.790
been set up and what the system offers
the user now is a sort of Google for

01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800
the user now is a sort of Google for
 

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.790
the user now is a sort of Google for
design space so what's going on here is

01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800
design space so what's going on here is
 

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.350
design space so what's going on here is
by drawing these red red boxes the user

01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360
by drawing these red red boxes the user
 

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.330
by drawing these red red boxes the user
is narrowing down to only those

01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:57.340
is narrowing down to only those
 

01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:59.939
is narrowing down to only those
trajectories that pass through the red

01:11:59.939 --> 01:11:59.949
trajectories that pass through the red
 

01:11:59.949 --> 01:12:03.000
trajectories that pass through the red
boxes and by drawing the sorry that's

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:03.010
boxes and by drawing the sorry that's
 

01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:04.950
boxes and by drawing the sorry that's
green I should have said green throat

01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960
green I should have said green throat
 

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.560
green I should have said green throat
and when drawing their red boxes the

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:07.570
and when drawing their red boxes the
 

01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:09.630
and when drawing their red boxes the
user is excluding those trajectories

01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:09.640
user is excluding those trajectories
 

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.180
user is excluding those trajectories
that go through those red boxes so you

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:12.190
that go through those red boxes so you
 

01:12:12.190 --> 01:12:14.880
that go through those red boxes so you
can look for trajectories of the stone

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:14.890
can look for trajectories of the stone
 

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:17.130
can look for trajectories of the stone
that pass through certain regions on

01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:17.140
that pass through certain regions on
 

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:20.340
that pass through certain regions on
Miss other regions and here's a another

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:20.350
Miss other regions and here's a another
 

01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:23.490
Miss other regions and here's a another
example where this sort of idea can help

01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:23.500
example where this sort of idea can help
 

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.790
example where this sort of idea can help
you to find physical but very

01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800
you to find physical but very
 

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.750
you to find physical but very
implausible trajectories of a person

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760
implausible trajectories of a person
 

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:34.229
implausible trajectories of a person
falling down stairs so here's a person

01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239
falling down stairs so here's a person
 

01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:36.330
falling down stairs so here's a person
falling down stairs and most of the

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:36.340
falling down stairs and most of the
 

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:39.240
falling down stairs and most of the
trajectories you see here are taking the

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:39.250
trajectories you see here are taking the
 

01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:41.610
trajectories you see here are taking the
person completely off the side of the

01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:41.620
person completely off the side of the
 

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.200
person completely off the side of the
stairs but sometimes you have these

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:43.210
stairs but sometimes you have these
 

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:50.100
stairs but sometimes you have these
unlikely scenarios where you can have

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:50.110
unlikely scenarios where you can have
 

01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:52.140
unlikely scenarios where you can have
these unlikely scenarios where the leg

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:52.150
these unlikely scenarios where the leg
 

01:12:52.150 --> 01:12:54.300
these unlikely scenarios where the leg
gets caught and so if one of the

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:54.310
gets caught and so if one of the
 

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:56.910
gets caught and so if one of the
trajectories happens to find the one

01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:56.920
trajectories happens to find the one
 

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.189
trajectories happens to find the one
where the leg gets cut the google search

01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199
where the leg gets cut the google search
 

01:12:59.199 --> 01:13:01.560
where the leg gets cut the google search
essentially allows you to hone in and

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:01.570
essentially allows you to hone in and
 

01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:03.959
essentially allows you to hone in and
that interesting trajectory so by having

01:13:03.959 --> 01:13:03.969
that interesting trajectory so by having
 

01:13:03.969 --> 01:13:06.240
that interesting trajectory so by having
the hardware just complete lots of

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:06.250
the hardware just complete lots of
 

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:09.930
the hardware just complete lots of
possible trajectories and then honing in

01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:09.940
possible trajectories and then honing in
 

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:11.189
possible trajectories and then honing in
on the ones you're interested in that's

01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199
on the ones you're interested in that's
 

01:13:11.199 --> 01:13:15.750
on the ones you're interested in that's
one possibility another thing that you

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760
one possibility another thing that you
 

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.870
one possibility another thing that you
might do is you might go parallel but

01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880
might do is you might go parallel but
 

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.209
might do is you might go parallel but
not in hardware but in the software that

01:13:21.209 --> 01:13:21.219
not in hardware but in the software that
 

01:13:21.219 --> 01:13:24.600
not in hardware but in the software that
is go parallel in a human sense so not

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:24.610
is go parallel in a human sense so not
 

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:27.060
is go parallel in a human sense so not
computer software but people software

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:27.070
computer software but people software
 

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:29.390
computer software but people software
and there's been a bunch of interesting

01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400
and there's been a bunch of interesting
 

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.650
and there's been a bunch of interesting
experiments in doing this and one of my

01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:31.660
experiments in doing this and one of my
 

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:34.260
experiments in doing this and one of my
favorites is the folded project so

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:34.270
favorites is the folded project so
 

01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:37.439
favorites is the folded project so
protein folding is extremely hard the

01:13:37.439 --> 01:13:37.449
protein folding is extremely hard the
 

01:13:37.449 --> 01:13:39.870
protein folding is extremely hard the
idea is you have some protein and you

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880
idea is you have some protein and you
 

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.459
idea is you have some protein and you
want to know what you have the formula

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:41.469
want to know what you have the formula
 

01:13:41.469 --> 01:13:42.930
want to know what you have the formula
for them you want to know what shape

01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:42.940
for them you want to know what shape
 

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.750
for them you want to know what shape
does it actually take and even super

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760
does it actually take and even super
 

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.760
does it actually take and even super
computers cannot solve this problem so

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:47.770
computers cannot solve this problem so
 

01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:50.850
computers cannot solve this problem so
the idea is maybe if we have many people

01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:50.860
the idea is maybe if we have many people
 

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.010
the idea is maybe if we have many people
working on it we can solve this

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:53.020
working on it we can solve this
 

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.380
working on it we can solve this
problem so there is some work from the

01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:55.390
problem so there is some work from the
 

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:57.600
problem so there is some work from the
University of Washington where you can

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:57.610
University of Washington where you can
 

01:13:57.610 --> 01:13:59.280
University of Washington where you can
basically go online and you can download

01:13:59.280 --> 01:13:59.290
basically go online and you can download
 

01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:01.620
basically go online and you can download
this game it's a really fun game it's

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:01.630
this game it's a really fun game it's
 

01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:05.460
this game it's a really fun game it's
called folded and let me see there

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:05.470
called folded and let me see there
 

01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:12.540
called folded and let me see there
should be sound here well we're not

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:12.550
should be sound here well we're not
 

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:14.400
should be sound here well we're not
going to get the sound but I baby oh

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:14.410
going to get the sound but I baby oh
 

01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:17.070
going to get the sound but I baby oh
there is a sound so as I go through

01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:17.080
there is a sound so as I go through
 

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.680
there is a sound so as I go through
these levels i'm actually playing with

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:19.690
these levels i'm actually playing with
 

01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:21.990
these levels i'm actually playing with
us and trying to fold the blue and i get

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000
us and trying to fold the blue and i get
 

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.090
us and trying to fold the blue and i get
feedback this is just a very simple

01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:24.100
feedback this is just a very simple
 

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:37.110
feedback this is just a very simple
tutorial level entertaining and so you

01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120
tutorial level entertaining and so you
 

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.650
tutorial level entertaining and so you
have you have tens of thousands of kids

01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:40.660
have you have tens of thousands of kids
 

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.780
have you have tens of thousands of kids
all over the world that are folding

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:42.790
all over the world that are folding
 

01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:44.310
all over the world that are folding
these proteins and the computer is

01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320
these proteins and the computer is
 

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.930
these proteins and the computer is
giving them feedback on how they're

01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:45.940
giving them feedback on how they're
 

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.970
giving them feedback on how they're
doing so that's another way to go

01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:47.980
doing so that's another way to go
 

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:54.120
doing so that's another way to go
parallel I need to get rid of this first

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:54.130
parallel I need to get rid of this first
 

01:14:54.130 --> 01:15:02.190
parallel I need to get rid of this first
okay so that's natural strategy number

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:02.200
okay so that's natural strategy number
 

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.460
okay so that's natural strategy number
one is go parallel strategy number two

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:05.470
one is go parallel strategy number two
 

01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:08.160
one is go parallel strategy number two
is to say well maybe we can make some

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:08.170
is to say well maybe we can make some
 

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:11.610
is to say well maybe we can make some
more intelligent decisions as we explore

01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:11.620
more intelligent decisions as we explore
 

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:14.850
more intelligent decisions as we explore
this design space so lubricate the

01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:14.860
this design space so lubricate the
 

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.130
this design space so lubricate the
design loop what I mean by that if you

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:17.140
design loop what I mean by that if you
 

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.230
design loop what I mean by that if you
think of a typical design loop is saying

01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:19.240
think of a typical design loop is saying
 

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.750
think of a typical design loop is saying
you have some idea you try it out you

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760
you have some idea you try it out you
 

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.400
you have some idea you try it out you
either build it you build a little

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:23.410
either build it you build a little
 

01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:26.610
either build it you build a little
mock-up of it you evaluate it you you

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:26.620
mock-up of it you evaluate it you you
 

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:28.650
mock-up of it you evaluate it you you
get a crit and then you go through and

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:28.660
get a crit and then you go through and
 

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.380
get a crit and then you go through and
revise it and make new ideas if we can

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:31.390
revise it and make new ideas if we can
 

01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:33.630
revise it and make new ideas if we can
speed this up somehow so of course we're

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:33.640
speed this up somehow so of course we're
 

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.910
speed this up somehow so of course we're
used to the idea that a computer can

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920
used to the idea that a computer can
 

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.460
used to the idea that a computer can
replace some of the building we can do

01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:38.470
replace some of the building we can do
 

01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:42.060
replace some of the building we can do
previz we can do some renderings we can

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:42.070
previz we can do some renderings we can
 

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:43.590
previz we can do some renderings we can
see how things will look maybe that can

01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600
see how things will look maybe that can
 

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.230
see how things will look maybe that can
save us time but can we get this loop to

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:46.240
save us time but can we get this loop to
 

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.950
save us time but can we get this loop to
be really fast can we really get it to

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:49.960
be really fast can we really get it to
 

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.150
be really fast can we really get it to
the point where we eliminate the

01:15:51.150 --> 01:15:51.160
the point where we eliminate the
 

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.430
the point where we eliminate the
distinction between all these stages and

01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440
distinction between all these stages and
 

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.430
distinction between all these stages and
it gets to be really fluid I think the

01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:56.440
it gets to be really fluid I think the
 

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.100
it gets to be really fluid I think the
way I kind of think about it is

01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:58.110
way I kind of think about it is
 

01:15:58.110 --> 01:16:00.750
way I kind of think about it is
interaction builds intuition if I gave

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760
interaction builds intuition if I gave
 

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.340
interaction builds intuition if I gave
you one of these little puzzles that you

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:02.350
you one of these little puzzles that you
 

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:05.620
you one of these little puzzles that you
have to pull apart and I said

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:05.630
have to pull apart and I said
 

01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:07.870
have to pull apart and I said
at this for two hours just in your head

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:07.880
at this for two hours just in your head
 

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.610
at this for two hours just in your head
just looking at it then pick it up and

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:09.620
just looking at it then pick it up and
 

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:12.040
just looking at it then pick it up and
solve it or if I gave you five minutes

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:12.050
solve it or if I gave you five minutes
 

01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:14.740
solve it or if I gave you five minutes
but you could play with it you have a

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:14.750
but you could play with it you have a
 

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:17.229
but you could play with it you have a
better chance if you played with it for

01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:17.239
better chance if you played with it for
 

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.760
better chance if you played with it for
five minutes then if you stared at it

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:18.770
five minutes then if you stared at it
 

01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:20.410
five minutes then if you stared at it
for two hours and then what made one

01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:20.420
for two hours and then what made one
 

01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.450
for two hours and then what made one
attempt at it so really interacting with

01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:22.460
attempt at it so really interacting with
 

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:30.129
attempt at it so really interacting with
the system builds a lot of intuition so

01:16:30.129 --> 01:16:30.139
the system builds a lot of intuition so
 

01:16:30.139 --> 01:16:32.560
the system builds a lot of intuition so
this is a mock-up of a project that

the idea is if you had a holographic

01:16:37.209 --> 01:16:37.219
the idea is if you had a holographic
 

01:16:37.219 --> 01:16:40.750
the idea is if you had a holographic
display if you had actual physical tiny

01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:40.760

01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199
and that you could edit then you could
 

01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:47.260
and that you could edit then you could
really work through a very quick process

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:47.270
really work through a very quick process

elements or physical construction so

01:17:29.919 --> 01:17:29.929
elements or physical construction so
 

01:17:29.929 --> 01:17:33.990

what you're seeing here is that as this

01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000
what you're seeing here is that as this
 

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.229
what you're seeing here is that as this
shape is edited which is just a

01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239
shape is edited which is just a
 

01:17:38.239 --> 01:17:41.110

what this shape does when you have

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:46.670
what this shape does when you have
 

01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:48.970
what this shape does when you have
gravity acting on it so you immediately

01:17:48.970 --> 01:17:48.980
gravity acting on it so you immediately
 

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:52.450
gravity acting on it so you immediately
get a as you edit the actual material

01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:52.460

you're seeing instant feedback and what

01:17:55.419 --> 01:17:55.429
you're seeing instant feedback and what
 

01:17:55.429 --> 01:17:57.910
you're seeing instant feedback and what
happens to the deformed shape under

now I also want you to look at this and

01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:05.060
now I also want you to look at this and

say this is a really neat idea this is
the state of the art and this is a very

the state of the art and this is a very
 

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.250
the state of the art and this is a very
very simple mesh in two dimensions so

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:12.260
very simple mesh in two dimensions so
 

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:14.500
very simple mesh in two dimensions so
we're really far out from being able to

we're really far out from being able to
 

01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:16.390
we're really far out from being able to
do this for a complex model at

this can help build intuition presumably
in the long run for things like

in the long run for things like
 

01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:49.570
in the long run for things like
understanding how different shapes

way again a very powerful idea to be
 

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:13.270
way again a very powerful idea to be
able to do this interactively still in

ends up in this staggering ball of
complexity right because essentially

01:25:45.279 --> 01:25:45.289
complexity right because essentially
 

01:25:45.289 --> 01:25:48.189
complexity right because essentially
what's happened is is that in the sort

01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199
what's happened is is that in the sort
 

01:25:48.199 --> 01:25:51.129
what's happened is is that in the sort

master builder paradigm essentially this

01:25:53.859 --> 01:25:53.869
master builder paradigm essentially this
 

01:25:53.869 --> 01:25:55.209
master builder paradigm essentially this
piece of software is attempting to

01:25:55.209 --> 01:25:55.219
piece of software is attempting to
 

01:25:55.219 --> 01:25:57.930
piece of software is attempting to
swallow the universe of complexity and

01:25:57.930 --> 01:25:57.940
swallow the universe of complexity and
 

01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.790
swallow the universe of complexity and
it's you know only one piece of software

01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800
it's you know only one piece of software
 

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.609
it's you know only one piece of software
so this is a huge challenge because

01:26:03.609 --> 01:26:03.619
so this is a huge challenge because
 

01:26:03.619 --> 01:26:05.949
so this is a huge challenge because
really you you don't want to experience

01:26:05.949 --> 01:26:05.959
really you you don't want to experience
 

01:26:05.959 --> 01:26:08.109
really you you don't want to experience
this sort of degeneration of descent

this sort of degeneration of descent
 

01:26:08.119 --> 01:26:11.080
this sort of degeneration of descent
into horrifying complexity as you start

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:11.090
into horrifying complexity as you start
 

01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:13.810

to manage these extremely densely
interconnected variables because in the

01:26:16.299 --> 01:26:16.309

vision at this time but the concern is
 

01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:43.899
vision at this time but the concern is
essentially that the architect is not

essentially that the architect is not
 

01:26:43.909 --> 01:26:46.330
essentially that the architect is not

01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:46.340
operating the silo of architecture but
 

01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:49.330

brings me to a quick question which is

01:27:06.189 --> 01:27:06.199
brings me to a quick question which is
 

01:27:06.199 --> 01:27:08.770
brings me to a quick question which is
what is architecture look like 10 years

01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:08.780
what is architecture look like 10 years
 

01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:13.000
what is architecture look like 10 years
from now so you know I'll say it right

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:13.010
from now so you know I'll say it right
 

01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:16.149
from now so you know I'll say it right
away I have no idea but what I'd like to

01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159
away I have no idea but what I'd like to
 

01:27:16.159 --> 01:27:19.209
away I have no idea but what I'd like to
do is take a few buzzwords so I think

01:27:19.209 --> 01:27:19.219
do is take a few buzzwords so I think
 

01:27:19.219 --> 01:27:22.569
do is take a few buzzwords so I think
clearly it will be distributed and it

01:27:22.569 --> 01:27:22.579
clearly it will be distributed and it
 

01:27:22.579 --> 01:27:26.020
clearly it will be distributed and it
will be approachable by scale by massive

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:26.030
will be approachable by scale by massive
 

01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:27.879
will be approachable by scale by massive
scale whether it is computational scale

01:27:27.879 --> 01:27:27.889
scale whether it is computational scale
 

01:27:27.889 --> 01:27:31.149
scale whether it is computational scale
or the scale of the problems that are

01:27:31.149 --> 01:27:31.159
or the scale of the problems that are
 

01:27:31.159 --> 01:27:31.780

so you know New York is pretty big city

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:34.730
so you know New York is pretty big city
 

01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:37.390
so you know New York is pretty big city

really interesting issues around
 

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.190
really interesting issues around
architectural design scale but also this

01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:54.200
architectural design scale but also this
 

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.500

so perhaps a scary environment

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:15.970
so perhaps a scary environment
 

01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:18.220
so perhaps a scary environment
integrated so will be an integrated

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:18.230

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:54.710
public and private clouds so those are
 

01:35:54.710 --> 01:35:58.210
public and private clouds so those are
the four deployment models so the goal

01:35:58.210 --> 01:35:58.220
the four deployment models so the goal
 

01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:01.720
the four deployment models so the goal
is to go from the very small all the way

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:01.730
is to go from the very small all the way
 

01:36:01.730 --> 01:36:06.130
is to go from the very small all the way
out to the very big right so scalability

01:36:06.130 --> 01:36:06.140
out to the very big right so scalability
 

01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:08.110
out to the very big right so scalability
so the thing that I wanted to get across

01:36:08.110 --> 01:36:08.120
so the thing that I wanted to get across
 

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:11.370
so the thing that I wanted to get across
to you is that scalability is not

01:36:11.370 --> 01:36:11.380
to you is that scalability is not
 

01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:15.250
to you is that scalability is not
compute constraint for long it may be

01:36:15.250 --> 01:36:15.260

compute constrained now but it will not
 

01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:21.580
compute constrained now but it will not
be for long and so what comes down to is

01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:21.590
be for long and so what comes down to is
 

01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:24.530
be for long and so what comes down to is
what are the fundamental limitations of

01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.540
what are the fundamental limitations of
 

01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:27.800
what are the fundamental limitations of
scalability in the cloud era so I think

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:27.810
scalability in the cloud era so I think
 

01:36:27.810 --> 01:36:29.540
scalability in the cloud era so I think
one of them is you pay attention to

01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:29.550
one of them is you pay attention to
 

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:33.380
one of them is you pay attention to
interfaces right so one interface that's

01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:33.390
interfaces right so one interface that's
 

01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:35.240

01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:18.070
accountability complexity so I talked
 

01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:20.729
accountability complexity so I talked
about some of these design systems

01:39:20.729 --> 01:39:20.739
about some of these design systems

understanding how do you even
 

01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:30.209
understanding how do you even
communicate that level of complexity

01:39:30.209 --> 01:39:30.219

scalability of organization so these are
some of the fundamental limits that we

01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840
some of the fundamental limits that we
 

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:42.109
some of the fundamental limits that we

to to ask some questions help us

to to ask some questions help us
speculate on what we just saw try to

01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:16.630
speculate on what we just saw try to
 

01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:22.410
speculate on what we just saw try to
make some meaning of all of this and so

01:40:22.410 --> 01:40:22.420
make some meaning of all of this and so
 

01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:24.450
make some meaning of all of this and so
I'll just make a quick observation but

01:40:24.450 --> 01:40:24.460
I'll just make a quick observation but
 

01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:26.310
I'll just make a quick observation but
very quickly we want to open the floor

01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320
very quickly we want to open the floor
 

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:32.040
very quickly we want to open the floor
to a few questions and we'll probably

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:32.050
to a few questions and we'll probably
 

01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:35.330
to a few questions and we'll probably
try to wrap up in about 15 minutes so

01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:35.340
try to wrap up in about 15 minutes so
 

01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:37.470
try to wrap up in about 15 minutes so
one of the things that I just wanted to

01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480
one of the things that I just wanted to
 

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.649
one of the things that I just wanted to
note maybe it goes without saying but

01:40:39.649 --> 01:40:39.659
note maybe it goes without saying but
 

01:40:39.659 --> 01:40:42.660
note maybe it goes without saying but
the aesthetic of the of the graphic

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:42.670
the aesthetic of the of the graphic
 

01:40:42.670 --> 01:40:45.000
the aesthetic of the of the graphic
presentations in the room tonight was

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:45.010
presentations in the room tonight was
 

01:40:45.010 --> 01:40:46.350
presentations in the room tonight was
probably different than anything we've

01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360
probably different than anything we've
 

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.819
probably different than anything we've
ever seen at least in a row in this room

01:40:50.819 --> 01:40:50.829
ever seen at least in a row in this room
 

01:40:50.829 --> 01:40:53.640
ever seen at least in a row in this room
and I think that's I think that's

01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:53.650
and I think that's I think that's
 

01:40:53.650 --> 01:40:55.169
and I think that's I think that's
interesting I don't know if that's a

01:40:55.169 --> 01:40:55.179
interesting I don't know if that's a
 

01:40:55.179 --> 01:40:57.959
interesting I don't know if that's a
certain message for the aesthetics of

01:40:57.959 --> 01:40:57.969
certain message for the aesthetics of
 

01:40:57.969 --> 01:41:01.290
certain message for the aesthetics of
the post parametric but certainly it

01:41:01.290 --> 01:41:01.300
the post parametric but certainly it
 

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:06.270
the post parametric but certainly it
suggests a certain kind of conceptual

01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:06.280
suggests a certain kind of conceptual
 

01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:08.430
suggests a certain kind of conceptual
and maybe even language issue in trying

01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:08.440
and maybe even language issue in trying
 

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:10.500
and maybe even language issue in trying
to think about the way that architects

01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:10.510
to think about the way that architects
 

01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:12.359
to think about the way that architects
and and computer scientists we're

01:41:12.359 --> 01:41:12.369
and and computer scientists we're
 

01:41:12.369 --> 01:41:15.209
and and computer scientists we're
talking very broadly now by saying that

01:41:15.209 --> 01:41:15.219
talking very broadly now by saying that
 

01:41:15.219 --> 01:41:17.000
talking very broadly now by saying that
everyone here is a computer scientist

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:17.010
everyone here is a computer scientist
 

01:41:17.010 --> 01:41:21.060
everyone here is a computer scientist
but but but that there's some issues of

01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:21.070
but but but that there's some issues of
 

01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:24.419
but but but that there's some issues of
kind of communicating and finding

01:41:24.419 --> 01:41:24.429
kind of communicating and finding
 

01:41:24.429 --> 01:41:26.310
kind of communicating and finding
graphic language and I certainly think

01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320
graphic language and I certainly think
 

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:30.359
graphic language and I certainly think
that the graphics were as compelling as

01:41:30.359 --> 01:41:30.369
that the graphics were as compelling as
 

01:41:30.369 --> 01:41:31.470
that the graphics were as compelling as
that the things that we do in

01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:31.480
that the things that we do in
 

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:33.509
that the things that we do in
architecture but it's actually not

01:41:33.509 --> 01:41:33.519
architecture but it's actually not
 

01:41:33.519 --> 01:41:37.049
architecture but it's actually not
exactly what we might have dreamed up if

01:41:37.049 --> 01:41:37.059
exactly what we might have dreamed up if
 

01:41:37.059 --> 01:41:38.729
exactly what we might have dreamed up if
we all collectively as architects

we all collectively as architects
 

01:41:38.739 --> 01:41:40.220
we all collectively as architects
thought about what would the post

01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:40.230
thought about what would the post
 

01:41:40.230 --> 01:41:44.669
thought about what would the post
parametric future look like with with

that as a kind of observation I think it

01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:47.230
that as a kind of observation I think it
 

01:41:47.230 --> 01:41:48.720
that as a kind of observation I think it
wouldn't necessarily make sense to try

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:48.730
wouldn't necessarily make sense to try
 

01:41:48.730 --> 01:41:51.209
wouldn't necessarily make sense to try
to summarize or make some great

01:41:51.209 --> 01:41:51.219
to summarize or make some great
 

01:41:51.219 --> 01:41:53.189
to summarize or make some great
conclusion about all of this stuff but

01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:53.199
conclusion about all of this stuff but
 

01:41:53.199 --> 01:41:55.229
conclusion about all of this stuff but
but I did want to bring us back to the

01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239
but I did want to bring us back to the
 

01:41:55.239 --> 01:41:59.879
but I did want to bring us back to the
idea of collaboration between fields and

01:41:59.879 --> 01:41:59.889
idea of collaboration between fields and
 

01:41:59.889 --> 01:42:01.680

think there's and I I imagine it's very
 

01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:03.820

languages who act as these sort of
translators and I think they're the

01:45:27.730 --> 01:45:27.740
translators and I think they're the
 

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:31.150

they're the reason that visual effects

01:45:31.150 --> 01:45:31.160
they're the reason that visual effects

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:57.650
that is that we're we want to design and
that's compounded with the fact that the

01:46:57.650 --> 01:46:57.660
that's compounded with the fact that the
 

01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:59.760
that's compounded with the fact that the
manufacturing tools now allows the

01:46:59.760 --> 01:46:59.770
manufacturing tools now allows the
 

01:46:59.770 --> 01:47:02.610
manufacturing tools now allows the
manufacture of things with such great

01:47:02.610 --> 01:47:02.620
manufacture of things with such great

the rate of exploration and we're trying

01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:18.190
the rate of exploration and we're trying
 

01:47:18.190 --> 01:47:20.100
the rate of exploration and we're trying
to do is have the machines explore

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:20.110
to do is have the machines explore
 

01:47:20.110 --> 01:47:23.310
to do is have the machines explore
themselves where to go next actually

01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:23.320

and I think in terms of manifesting very

01:48:51.569 --> 01:48:51.579
and I think in terms of manifesting very

01:49:27.169 --> 01:49:27.179
 
 

01:49:27.179 --> 01:49:30.169
 
yeah so the the big pattern that we

01:49:30.169 --> 01:49:30.179
yeah so the the big pattern that we
 

01:49:30.179 --> 01:49:31.969
yeah so the the big pattern that we
looked at in service oriented

01:49:31.969 --> 01:49:31.979
looked at in service oriented
 

01:49:31.979 --> 01:49:34.149
looked at in service oriented
architecture is this concept of

01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159
architecture is this concept of
 

01:49:34.159 --> 01:49:38.359
architecture is this concept of
externalizing essentially policy and so

01:49:38.359 --> 01:49:38.369
externalizing essentially policy and so
 

01:49:38.369 --> 01:49:40.489
externalizing essentially policy and so
this concept that the pattern and you

01:49:40.489 --> 01:49:40.499
this concept that the pattern and you
 

01:49:40.499 --> 01:49:43.160
this concept that the pattern and you
know I apologize for not translating it

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:43.170
know I apologize for not translating it
 

01:49:43.170 --> 01:49:45.109
know I apologize for not translating it
to architectural constructs but you know

01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119
to architectural constructs but you know
 

01:49:45.119 --> 01:49:47.179
to architectural constructs but you know
essentially what you do is you create

01:49:47.179 --> 01:49:47.189
essentially what you do is you create
 

01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:50.239
essentially what you do is you create
trust by building a framework so I'll

01:49:50.239 --> 01:49:50.249
trust by building a framework so I'll
 

01:49:50.249 --> 01:49:52.939
trust by building a framework so I'll
give you an example when people drive on

01:49:52.939 --> 01:49:52.949
give you an example when people drive on
 

01:49:52.949 --> 01:49:55.100
give you an example when people drive on
the roads they don't have an explicit

01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:55.110
the roads they don't have an explicit
 

01:49:55.110 --> 01:49:57.109
the roads they don't have an explicit
point-to-point trust relationship with

01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119
point-to-point trust relationship with
 

01:49:57.119 --> 01:49:59.479
point-to-point trust relationship with
every other driver on the road right

01:49:59.479 --> 01:49:59.489
every other driver on the road right
 

01:49:59.489 --> 01:50:01.580
every other driver on the road right
they have a trust in the framework right

01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:01.590
they have a trust in the framework right
 

01:50:01.590 --> 01:50:02.979
they have a trust in the framework right
and so what you do is you devise

01:50:02.979 --> 01:50:02.989
and so what you do is you devise
 

01:50:02.989 --> 01:50:05.239
and so what you do is you devise
frameworks and then you create

01:50:05.239 --> 01:50:05.249
frameworks and then you create
 

01:50:05.249 --> 01:50:07.669
frameworks and then you create
enforceability and then that way what

01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679
enforceability and then that way what
 

01:50:07.679 --> 01:50:09.350
enforceability and then that way what
happens is the integration of these

01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360
happens is the integration of these
 

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.359
happens is the integration of these
different intentionality right so I plan

01:50:11.359 --> 01:50:11.369
different intentionality right so I plan
 

01:50:11.369 --> 01:50:14.449
different intentionality right so I plan
to do X other person plans to do why we

01:50:14.449 --> 01:50:14.459
to do X other person plans to do why we
 

01:50:14.459 --> 01:50:17.750
to do X other person plans to do why we
have some kind of like legislation or

01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760
have some kind of like legislation or
 

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:19.399
have some kind of like legislation or
some kind of construct that allows these

01:50:19.399 --> 01:50:19.409
some kind of construct that allows these
 

01:50:19.409 --> 01:50:22.250
some kind of construct that allows these
things to cooperate so for example you

01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260
things to cooperate so for example you
 

01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:24.379
things to cooperate so for example you
know it's like sure you can have the air

01:50:24.379 --> 01:50:24.389
know it's like sure you can have the air
 

01:50:24.389 --> 01:50:25.879
know it's like sure you can have the air
volume in this building be a certain

01:50:25.879 --> 01:50:25.889
volume in this building be a certain
 

01:50:25.889 --> 01:50:27.439
volume in this building be a certain
size but if it exceeds a certain size

01:50:27.439 --> 01:50:27.449
size but if it exceeds a certain size
 

01:50:27.449 --> 01:50:29.299
size but if it exceeds a certain size
and all of a sudden some environmental

01:50:29.299 --> 01:50:29.309
and all of a sudden some environmental
 

01:50:29.309 --> 01:50:30.859

01:50:30.869 --> 01:50:32.390
regulation from the government click
Center you know so how do you get these

01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400
Center you know so how do you get these
 

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:35.839
Center you know so how do you get these
different very wrong metaphor but the

01:50:35.839 --> 01:50:35.849
different very wrong metaphor but the
 

01:50:35.849 --> 01:50:37.759
different very wrong metaphor but the
construct is the same which is how do

01:50:37.759 --> 01:50:37.769
construct is the same which is how do
 

01:50:37.769 --> 01:50:39.290
construct is the same which is how do
you get these different intentionality

01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:39.300
you get these different intentionality
 

01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.469
you get these different intentionality
xand constraint systems interlock and

01:50:41.469 --> 01:50:41.479
xand constraint systems interlock and
 

01:50:41.479 --> 01:50:43.819
xand constraint systems interlock and
you know if you could get them the

01:50:43.819 --> 01:50:43.829
you know if you could get them the
 

01:50:43.829 --> 01:50:46.219
you know if you could get them the
interlock in a model that had intuitive

01:50:46.219 --> 01:50:46.229
interlock in a model that had intuitive
 

01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:49.520
interlock in a model that had intuitive
interaction to it would be even better

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:49.530
interaction to it would be even better
 

01:50:49.530 --> 01:50:52.250

i'm going to add something there but

01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:52.260
i'm going to add something there but
 

01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:54.290
i'm going to add something there but
redundancy and I think Jonathan can

01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:54.300

speak a little bit more to that but

01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860
speak a little bit more to that but

many many different designs at the same
 

01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:03.709
many many different designs at the same
time so whenever you have a parallel

01:51:03.709 --> 01:51:03.719
time so whenever you have a parallel
 

01:51:03.719 --> 01:51:06.740

benefits of the parallelism is really

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:08.610
benefits of the parallelism is really
 

01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:11.510
benefits of the parallelism is really
hard right and you rarely reap a hundred

01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520
hard right and you rarely reap a hundred
 

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.709
hard right and you rarely reap a hundred
percent of the parallelism so if you

01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719
percent of the parallelism so if you
 

01:51:12.719 --> 01:51:14.899
percent of the parallelism so if you

then they'll say something that seemed

01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:03.750
then they'll say something that seemed
 

01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:05.450
then they'll say something that seemed
totally reasonable right like of course

01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:05.460
totally reasonable right like of course

totally reasonable right like of course
that's how something works and that's

01:53:06.979 --> 01:53:06.989
that's how something works and that's
 

01:53:06.989 --> 01:53:08.779
that's how something works and that's
the intuitive understanding other right

the intuitive understanding other right
but then they'll say but clearly this is

01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800
but then they'll say but clearly this is
 

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:12.080
but then they'll say but clearly this is
a better way to do it right and they'll

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:12.090
a better way to do it right and they'll
 

01:53:12.090 --> 01:53:14.419
a better way to do it right and they'll
say some kind of bizarre optimization

01:53:14.419 --> 01:53:14.429

computer science seems to be the

01:53:18.529 --> 01:53:18.539
computer science seems to be the
 

01:53:18.539 --> 01:53:20.870
computer science seems to be the
accumulation of all these optimizations

01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880
accumulation of all these optimizations
 

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:23.629
accumulation of all these optimizations
which is what makes it really hard to

away from that sense of being intuitive

01:53:31.009 --> 01:53:31.019
away from that sense of being intuitive

away from that sense of being intuitive
and I guess my question is once we pass

01:53:34.459 --> 01:53:34.469
and I guess my question is once we pass
 

01:53:34.469 --> 01:53:37.910
and I guess my question is once we pass
that real time barrier and once we start

01:54:44.909 --> 01:54:47.029
at the curriculum level in computer
science I guess I guess I'd like to

01:54:47.029 --> 01:54:47.039
science I guess I guess I'd like to
 

01:54:47.039 --> 01:54:49.399
science I guess I guess I'd like to
respond by saying that that's a kind of

01:54:49.399 --> 01:54:49.409
respond by saying that that's a kind of
 

01:54:49.409 --> 01:54:51.490
respond by saying that that's a kind of
a very computer science the answer

01:54:51.490 --> 01:54:51.500
a very computer science the answer
 

01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:55.210
a very computer science the answer
I think you know my crack at this thing

01:54:55.210 --> 01:54:55.220
I think you know my crack at this thing
 

01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:57.130
I think you know my crack at this thing
don't lose yeah like I get this thing is

01:54:57.130 --> 01:54:57.140
don't lose yeah like I get this thing is
 

01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:59.950
don't lose yeah like I get this thing is
is that the joy of what's happening with

01:54:59.950 --> 01:54:59.960
is that the joy of what's happening with
 

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:02.320
is that the joy of what's happening with
cloud is abstraction right so this

01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:02.330
cloud is abstraction right so this
 

01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:03.910
cloud is abstraction right so this
concept of cloud you notice

01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920
concept of cloud you notice
 

01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.070
concept of cloud you notice
infrastructure-as-a-service

01:55:05.070 --> 01:55:05.080
infrastructure-as-a-service
 

01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.330
infrastructure-as-a-service
software-as-a-service right

01:55:07.330 --> 01:55:07.340
software-as-a-service right
 

01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:08.830
software-as-a-service right
platform-as-a-service everything is the

01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840
platform-as-a-service everything is the
 

01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:10.930
platform-as-a-service everything is the
service so what is a surface the service

01:55:10.930 --> 01:55:10.940
service so what is a surface the service
 

01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:12.820
service so what is a surface the service
is basically I don't care how it gets

01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:12.830
is basically I don't care how it gets
 

01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:15.640
is basically I don't care how it gets
done you do it then you deliver it and

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:15.650
done you do it then you deliver it and
 

01:55:15.650 --> 01:55:17.350
done you do it then you deliver it and
I'm not even looking at you right that's

01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360
I'm not even looking at you right that's
 

01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.450
I'm not even looking at you right that's
what a service is right and so what that

01:55:19.450 --> 01:55:19.460
what a service is right and so what that
 

01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:21.430
what a service is right and so what that
means is that kind of abstraction I was

01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440
means is that kind of abstraction I was
 

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.780
means is that kind of abstraction I was
talking about about programming a

01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:22.790
talking about about programming a
 

01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:24.940
talking about about programming a
computer so I'm programming a computer

01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:24.950
computer so I'm programming a computer
 

01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:27.070
computer so I'm programming a computer
that's simpler than programming a

01:55:27.070 --> 01:55:27.080
that's simpler than programming a
 

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:29.050
that's simpler than programming a
gigantic network of computers right and

01:55:29.050 --> 01:55:29.060
gigantic network of computers right and
 

01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:31.680
gigantic network of computers right and
so what I'm really trying to say is with

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:31.690
so what I'm really trying to say is with
 

01:55:31.690 --> 01:55:35.080
so what I'm really trying to say is with
boundless compute capability I think

01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:35.090
boundless compute capability I think
 

01:55:35.090 --> 01:55:38.020
boundless compute capability I think
your hypothesis is true which is that

01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:38.030
your hypothesis is true which is that
 

01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:40.660
your hypothesis is true which is that
with a lot of compute power we can

01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:40.670
with a lot of compute power we can
 

01:55:40.670 --> 01:55:44.380
with a lot of compute power we can
present abstractions that are very very

01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:44.390
present abstractions that are very very
 

01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:46.540
present abstractions that are very very
simple but in fact our underlying

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:46.550
simple but in fact our underlying
 

01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:48.640
simple but in fact our underlying
there's a lot of complexity inside of it

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:48.650
there's a lot of complexity inside of it
 

01:55:48.650 --> 01:55:52.420
there's a lot of complexity inside of it
and that it's doing the work to make to

01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:52.430
and that it's doing the work to make to
 

01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:54.220
and that it's doing the work to make to
give you a very simple interface right

01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:54.230
give you a very simple interface right
 

01:55:54.230 --> 01:55:56.050
give you a very simple interface right
so I think it's possible but I think it

01:55:56.050 --> 01:55:56.060
so I think it's possible but I think it
 

01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:57.820
so I think it's possible but I think it
comes back to the means of production of

01:55:57.820 --> 01:55:57.830
comes back to the means of production of
 

01:55:57.830 --> 01:56:00.640
comes back to the means of production of
software which is you know that if you

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:00.650
software which is you know that if you
 

01:56:00.650 --> 01:56:02.920
software which is you know that if you
give people an economic reason to build

01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:02.930
give people an economic reason to build
 

01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:04.510
give people an economic reason to build
hideously complex pieces of software

01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520
hideously complex pieces of software
 

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:07.510
hideously complex pieces of software
they'll do that right so that's I think

01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520
they'll do that right so that's I think
 

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:10.090
they'll do that right so that's I think
what the closer to the issue I think

01:56:10.090 --> 01:56:10.100
what the closer to the issue I think
 

01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:13.780
what the closer to the issue I think
another aspect of that is computer

01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:13.790
another aspect of that is computer
 

01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:15.430
another aspect of that is computer
science is is difficult it's a difficult

01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440
science is is difficult it's a difficult
 

01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:17.290
science is is difficult it's a difficult
engineering field and like all

01:56:17.290 --> 01:56:17.300
engineering field and like all
 

01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:19.810
engineering field and like all
engineering fields the engineering

01:56:19.810 --> 01:56:19.820
engineering fields the engineering
 

01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:21.820
engineering fields the engineering
trade-offs are the hard part and they're

01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:21.830
trade-offs are the hard part and they're
 

01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:24.310
trade-offs are the hard part and they're
almost always on intuitive so in defense

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320
almost always on intuitive so in defense
 

01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:25.750
almost always on intuitive so in defense
of computer science i think is any worse

01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760
of computer science i think is any worse
 

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:28.540
of computer science i think is any worse
right like generally what makes

01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:28.550
right like generally what makes
 

01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:30.300
right like generally what makes
engineering a hard discipline is that

01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:30.310
engineering a hard discipline is that
 

01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:33.220
engineering a hard discipline is that
the easy answers tend to not be the best

01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:33.230
the easy answers tend to not be the best
 

01:56:33.230 --> 01:56:38.290
the easy answers tend to not be the best
answers so the advantage of more and

01:56:38.290 --> 01:56:38.300
answers so the advantage of more and
 

01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:41.080
answers so the advantage of more and
more powerful computers is that you can

01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:41.090
more powerful computers is that you can
 

01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:44.800
more powerful computers is that you can
actually hide all that complexity the

01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:44.810
actually hide all that complexity the
 

01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:46.690
actually hide all that complexity the
computer can do the hard work of

01:56:46.690 --> 01:56:46.700
computer can do the hard work of
 

01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:49.090
computer can do the hard work of
figuring out what's the optimal answer

01:56:49.090 --> 01:56:49.100
figuring out what's the optimal answer
 

01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:50.980
figuring out what's the optimal answer
what's you know what's the consequence

01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:50.990
what's you know what's the consequence
 

01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:53.440
what's you know what's the consequence
if you put in these parameters what do

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:53.450
if you put in these parameters what do
 

01:56:53.450 --> 01:56:55.870
if you put in these parameters what do
you get at the other end or it can let

01:56:55.870 --> 01:56:55.880
you get at the other end or it can let
 

01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:57.040
you get at the other end or it can let
you be intentional and say here's what

01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:57.050
you be intentional and say here's what
 

01:56:57.050 --> 01:56:58.990
you be intentional and say here's what
here's what I'm intending you tell me

01:56:58.990 --> 01:56:59.000
here's what I'm intending you tell me
 

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.490
here's what I'm intending you tell me
where in the dot design space will give

01:57:00.490 --> 01:57:00.500
where in the dot design space will give
 

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:01.090
where in the dot design space will give
me that answer

01:57:01.090 --> 01:57:01.100
me that answer
 

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:03.010
me that answer
I don't know where it is or you know

01:57:03.010 --> 01:57:03.020
I don't know where it is or you know
 

01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:05.350
I don't know where it is or you know
what a time and I was showing that the

01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360
what a time and I was showing that the
 

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:08.830
what a time and I was showing that the
idea that you can have a really

01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840
idea that you can have a really
 

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:12.610
idea that you can have a really
difficult to the the path from input

01:57:12.610 --> 01:57:12.620
difficult to the the path from input
 

01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:15.100
difficult to the the path from input
parameters to output result can be you

01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:15.110
parameters to output result can be you
 

01:57:15.110 --> 01:57:16.600
parameters to output result can be you
know really really complicated sequence

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:16.610
know really really complicated sequence
 

01:57:16.610 --> 01:57:18.160
know really really complicated sequence
of computations but you know if that's

01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:18.170
of computations but you know if that's
 

01:57:18.170 --> 01:57:20.320
of computations but you know if that's
interactive then you're sort of directly

01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:20.330
interactive then you're sort of directly
 

01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:21.520
interactive then you're sort of directly
it almost feels like you're directly

01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:21.530
it almost feels like you're directly
 

01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:23.230
it almost feels like you're directly
driving the output right instead of this

01:57:23.230 --> 01:57:23.240
driving the output right instead of this
 

01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.600
driving the output right instead of this
sort of process or input wait an hour to

01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:25.610
sort of process or input wait an hour to
 

01:57:25.610 --> 01:57:27.490
sort of process or input wait an hour to
get output and so I think as computers

01:57:27.490 --> 01:57:27.500
get output and so I think as computers
 

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:29.490
get output and so I think as computers
actually get faster and faster the

01:57:29.490 --> 01:57:29.500
actually get faster and faster the
 

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:32.260
actually get faster and faster the
intuition of of these complex systems

01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:32.270
intuition of of these complex systems
 

01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:34.060
intuition of of these complex systems
actually increases because you can

01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:34.070
actually increases because you can
 

01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:35.440
actually increases because you can
actually develop the intuition directly

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:35.450
actually develop the intuition directly
 

01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:38.050
actually develop the intuition directly
by playing with the system itself so I

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:38.060
by playing with the system itself so I
 

01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:40.600
by playing with the system itself so I
think it's actually hopeful as as

01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:40.610
think it's actually hopeful as as
 

01:57:40.610 --> 01:57:41.860
think it's actually hopeful as as
computers get faster and more

01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:41.870
computers get faster and more
 

01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:45.220
computers get faster and more
complicated for the naive users to

01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:45.230
complicated for the naive users to
 

01:57:45.230 --> 01:57:47.110
complicated for the naive users to
actually use complicated systems to do

01:57:47.110 --> 01:57:47.120
actually use complicated systems to do
 

01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:49.510
actually use complicated systems to do
interesting things let's take one more

01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520
interesting things let's take one more
 

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:54.670
interesting things let's take one more
question and then left to wrap up way in

01:57:54.670 --> 01:57:54.680
question and then left to wrap up way in
 

01:57:54.680 --> 01:58:02.300
question and then left to wrap up way in
the back back row highest hand

01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:02.310
 
 

01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:07.250
 
okay a great great lecture by the whole

01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:07.260
okay a great great lecture by the whole
 

01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.760
okay a great great lecture by the whole
panel so back here we've been kind of

01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:10.770
panel so back here we've been kind of
 

01:58:10.770 --> 01:58:12.560
panel so back here we've been kind of
wondering there's like a kind of

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:12.570
wondering there's like a kind of
 

01:58:12.570 --> 01:58:15.590
wondering there's like a kind of
underlying theme of utopia and dystopia

01:58:15.590 --> 01:58:15.600
underlying theme of utopia and dystopia
 

01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.020
underlying theme of utopia and dystopia
in a way right like there's an image of

01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:18.030
in a way right like there's an image of
 

01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:19.970
in a way right like there's an image of
Skynet right a company actually makes a

01:58:19.970 --> 01:58:19.980
Skynet right a company actually makes a
 

01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:23.630
Skynet right a company actually makes a
company called Skynet and with like a

01:58:23.630 --> 01:58:23.640
company called Skynet and with like a
 

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:26.450
company called Skynet and with like a
real kind of quote about possible

01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:26.460
real kind of quote about possible
 

01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:30.080
real kind of quote about possible
futures and I guess we're all wondering

01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:30.090
futures and I guess we're all wondering
 

01:58:30.090 --> 01:58:31.760
futures and I guess we're all wondering
that it seems like there's an end goal

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:31.770
that it seems like there's an end goal
 

01:58:31.770 --> 01:58:35.060
that it seems like there's an end goal
to some to some of the and in different

01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:35.070
to some to some of the and in different
 

01:58:35.070 --> 01:58:36.560
to some to some of the and in different
fields it seems to be like an end goal

01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:36.570
fields it seems to be like an end goal
 

01:58:36.570 --> 01:58:40.610
fields it seems to be like an end goal
liking at least in graphics right the

01:58:40.610 --> 01:58:40.620
liking at least in graphics right the
 

01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:43.100
liking at least in graphics right the
angle would be reality to some to some

01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:43.110
angle would be reality to some to some
 

01:58:43.110 --> 01:58:43.880
angle would be reality to some to some
degree right that we're going to

01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:43.890
degree right that we're going to
 

01:58:43.890 --> 01:58:46.040
degree right that we're going to
completely be able to simulate reality

01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:46.050
completely be able to simulate reality
 

01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:48.860
completely be able to simulate reality
in robotics it might be the autonomy of

01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:48.870
in robotics it might be the autonomy of
 

01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:51.770
in robotics it might be the autonomy of
a robot right it might be Autonomy's the

01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780
a robot right it might be Autonomy's the
 

01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:55.490
a robot right it might be Autonomy's the
end goal and I wonder I guess we're

01:58:55.490 --> 01:58:55.500
end goal and I wonder I guess we're
 

01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:58.250
end goal and I wonder I guess we're
wondering here like is is that something

01:58:58.250 --> 01:58:58.260
wondering here like is is that something
 

01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:01.760
wondering here like is is that something
that's conscious conscious to the minds

01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:01.770
that's conscious conscious to the minds
 

01:59:01.770 --> 01:59:04.760
that's conscious conscious to the minds
of people within those fields like the

01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:04.770
of people within those fields like the
 

01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:09.350
of people within those fields like the
kind of consequences of that and I don't

01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360
kind of consequences of that and I don't
 

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:11.450
kind of consequences of that and I don't
know I mean it's not the worst escape I

01:59:11.450 --> 01:59:11.460
know I mean it's not the worst escape I
 

01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:13.250
know I mean it's not the worst escape I
mean there's a kind of like promised to

01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.260
mean there's a kind of like promised to
 

01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:15.050
mean there's a kind of like promised to
everything but at the same time there's

01:59:15.050 --> 01:59:15.060
everything but at the same time there's
 

01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:17.150
everything but at the same time there's
a kind of like we've seen so many

01:59:17.150 --> 01:59:17.160
a kind of like we've seen so many
 

01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:19.910
a kind of like we've seen so many
scenarios that play out in very bad ways

01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920
scenarios that play out in very bad ways
 

01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:22.820
scenarios that play out in very bad ways
and I'm not and I'm not like a I'm not a

01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:22.830
and I'm not and I'm not like a I'm not a
 

01:59:22.830 --> 01:59:24.770

conspiracy theorist I mean you know I'm

01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:24.780
conspiracy theorist I mean you know I'm
 

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:27.530
conspiracy theorist I mean you know I'm
extremely hopeful about it but at the

01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:27.540
extremely hopeful about it but at the
 

01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:29.270
extremely hopeful about it but at the
same time like I'll show my dad a video

01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280
same time like I'll show my dad a video
 

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:31.490
same time like I'll show my dad a video
of a TED talk and he'll be like where's

01:59:31.490 --> 01:59:31.500
of a TED talk and he'll be like where's
 

01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:33.290
of a TED talk and he'll be like where's
this were like you know he's whatever

01:59:33.290 --> 01:59:33.300
this were like you know he's whatever
 

01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:34.790
this were like you know he's whatever
he's not up to date with technology with

01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800
he's not up to date with technology with
 

01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:36.470
he's not up to date with technology with
they'll just be like where is it going

01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480
they'll just be like where is it going
 

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:38.600
they'll just be like where is it going
you know where does it end in a way so i

01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:38.610
you know where does it end in a way so i
 

01:59:38.610 --> 01:59:40.490
you know where does it end in a way so i
was wondering like what are the goals I

01:59:40.490 --> 01:59:40.500
was wondering like what are the goals I
 

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:42.320
was wondering like what are the goals I
guess what are the angles is it even

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:42.330
guess what are the angles is it even
 

01:59:42.330 --> 01:59:44.810
guess what are the angles is it even
seen it in the profession or in the

01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:44.820
seen it in the profession or in the
 

01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:49.850
seen it in the profession or in the
fields so uh but the question seems to

01:59:49.850 --> 01:59:49.860
fields so uh but the question seems to
 

01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:52.040
fields so uh but the question seems to
be is tomorrow gonna be wonderful with

01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:52.050
be is tomorrow gonna be wonderful with
 

01:59:52.050 --> 01:59:53.870
be is tomorrow gonna be wonderful with
all our needs fulfilled and wonderful

01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880
all our needs fulfilled and wonderful
 

01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:55.910
all our needs fulfilled and wonderful
robotic doctors where is it going to be

01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920
robotic doctors where is it going to be
 

01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:58.970
robotic doctors where is it going to be
the day-to-day fight for life against

01:59:58.970 --> 01:59:58.980
the day-to-day fight for life against
 

01:59:58.980 --> 02:00:01.970
the day-to-day fight for life against
humanoid robot killer

02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980
 
 

02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:06.229
 
I can try to I can try to speak for

02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239
I can try to I can try to speak for
 

02:00:06.239 --> 02:00:10.490
I can try to I can try to speak for
robot as a designer hunter-killer but so

02:00:10.490 --> 02:00:10.500
robot as a designer hunter-killer but so
 

02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:14.150
robot as a designer hunter-killer but so
so the I think the direction is Alana me

02:00:14.150 --> 02:00:14.160
so the I think the direction is Alana me
 

02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:16.370
so the I think the direction is Alana me
but the end goal is not clear because

02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380
but the end goal is not clear because
 

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:19.360
but the end goal is not clear because
you don't know what how much autonomy

02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:19.370
you don't know what how much autonomy
 

02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:21.890
you don't know what how much autonomy
what kind of intelligence all these

02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:21.900
what kind of intelligence all these
 

02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:23.000
what kind of intelligence all these
things so it's not clear where it's

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:23.010
things so it's not clear where it's
 

02:00:23.010 --> 02:00:26.540
things so it's not clear where it's
going it's probably but we want to get

02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:26.550
going it's probably but we want to get
 

02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:31.790
going it's probably but we want to get
more autonomy and I think that it's a I

02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800
more autonomy and I think that it's a I
 

02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:33.890
more autonomy and I think that it's a I
used to think you know you don't need to

02:00:33.890 --> 02:00:33.900
used to think you know you don't need to
 

02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:36.160
used to think you know you don't need to
worry about it go worried about

02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:36.170
worry about it go worried about
 

02:00:36.170 --> 02:00:38.750
worry about it go worried about
genetically modified crops or something

02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760
genetically modified crops or something
 

02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:40.640
genetically modified crops or something
else but none of our robotics because

02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:40.650
else but none of our robotics because
 

02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:42.320
else but none of our robotics because
you can unplug them but the truth is it

02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:42.330
you can unplug them but the truth is it
 

02:00:42.330 --> 02:00:44.780
you can unplug them but the truth is it
is a powerful technology and I think the

02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:44.790
is a powerful technology and I think the
 

02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:47.060
is a powerful technology and I think the
only way to deal with it is to have

02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:47.070
only way to deal with it is to have
 

02:00:47.070 --> 02:00:48.680
only way to deal with it is to have
public discussions just like we have in

02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:48.690
public discussions just like we have in
 

02:00:48.690 --> 02:00:51.020
public discussions just like we have in
here you know here's what we're doing it

02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:51.030
here you know here's what we're doing it
 

02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:52.670
here you know here's what we're doing it
looks cool there's probably more

02:00:52.670 --> 02:00:52.680
looks cool there's probably more
 

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:55.550
looks cool there's probably more
benefits than harm and the potential but

02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560
benefits than harm and the potential but
 

02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:57.979
benefits than harm and the potential but
let's just keep it open and see where it

02:00:57.979 --> 02:00:57.989
let's just keep it open and see where it
 

02:00:57.989 --> 02:00:59.570
let's just keep it open and see where it
goes because nobody knows where it's

02:00:59.570 --> 02:00:59.580
goes because nobody knows where it's
 

02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:02.000
goes because nobody knows where it's
going let me just follow up with a quick

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:02.010
going let me just follow up with a quick
 

02:01:02.010 --> 02:01:03.740
going let me just follow up with a quick
comment which is you know what it

02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:03.750
comment which is you know what it
 

02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:05.960
comment which is you know what it
suggests in your comment suggests is is

02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:05.970
suggests in your comment suggests is is
 

02:01:05.970 --> 02:01:08.240
suggests in your comment suggests is is
that we're actually still not

02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:08.250
that we're actually still not
 

02:01:08.250 --> 02:01:10.310
that we're actually still not
necessarily in post parametric but we

02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320
necessarily in post parametric but we
 

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:13.010
necessarily in post parametric but we
may actually be in postmodern right

02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:13.020
may actually be in postmodern right
 

02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:14.870
may actually be in postmodern right
which is that you know one of the things

02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880
which is that you know one of the things
 

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:17.900
which is that you know one of the things
we need to really study is who whose

02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:17.910
we need to really study is who whose
 

02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:19.940
we need to really study is who whose
intention is served right because

02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:19.950
intention is served right because
 

02:01:19.950 --> 02:01:22.760
intention is served right because
ultimately these entities in their

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:22.770
ultimately these entities in their
 

02:01:22.770 --> 02:01:25.490
ultimately these entities in their
behaviors project an intentionality so

02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500
behaviors project an intentionality so
 

02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:27.410
behaviors project an intentionality so
if you're looking at a design space you

02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:27.420
if you're looking at a design space you
 

02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:28.910
if you're looking at a design space you
could look at a design space of what's

02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920
could look at a design space of what's
 

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:30.470
could look at a design space of what's
the most efficient way to create a green

02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:30.480
the most efficient way to create a green
 

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:32.540
the most efficient way to create a green
building that's an interesting design

02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:32.550
building that's an interesting design
 

02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:35.390
building that's an interesting design
space what's the most cost-effective way

02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400
space what's the most cost-effective way
 

02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:37.640
space what's the most cost-effective way
to kill 50 million people right that's a

02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:37.650
to kill 50 million people right that's a
 

02:01:37.650 --> 02:01:40.220
to kill 50 million people right that's a
different design space horrible dystopia

02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:40.230
different design space horrible dystopia
 

02:01:40.230 --> 02:01:42.170
different design space horrible dystopia
design space right but the thing that I

02:01:42.170 --> 02:01:42.180
design space right but the thing that I
 

02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:43.900
design space right but the thing that I
think ultimately have to consider is

02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:43.910
think ultimately have to consider is
 

02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:46.820
think ultimately have to consider is
whose intentions are being extended and

02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:46.830
whose intentions are being extended and
 

02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:49.280
whose intentions are being extended and
how do these systems serve those

02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:49.290
how do these systems serve those
 

02:01:49.290 --> 02:01:51.700
how do these systems serve those
intentions and I think your question is

02:01:51.700 --> 02:01:51.710
intentions and I think your question is
 

02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:54.890
intentions and I think your question is
extremely thoughtful because you know

02:01:54.890 --> 02:01:54.900
extremely thoughtful because you know
 

02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:56.060
extremely thoughtful because you know
everyone needs to examine those

02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:56.070
everyone needs to examine those
 

02:01:56.070 --> 02:02:00.110
everyone needs to examine those
questions yeah I to really really

02:02:00.110 --> 02:02:00.120
questions yeah I to really really
 

02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:01.490
questions yeah I to really really
appreciate the question because it

02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500
appreciate the question because it
 

02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:02.180
appreciate the question because it
indicate

02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:02.190
indicate
 

02:02:02.190 --> 02:02:03.950
indicate
the kind of moving from the means to the

02:02:03.950 --> 02:02:03.960
the kind of moving from the means to the
 

02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:08.479
the kind of moving from the means to the
ends and i think that the notion of post

02:02:08.479 --> 02:02:08.489
