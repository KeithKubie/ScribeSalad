00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.410
It's tempting to think that a classic movie
was always made to be just the way it is.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.950
But sometimes, there are scenes that were
planned and then scrapped, or even shot before

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.890
being deleted, that could have changed a movie
completely. For better or worse, here are

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.689
Screen Rant's&nbsp;10 Amazing Movie Scenes You
Will Never See.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.369
The Avengers: Age of Ultron
Fans used to think that they would never see

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.690
Spider-Man share the screen with Marvel's
Avengers, or see Captain Marvel join the MCU

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350
as early as they hoped. But according to Joss
Whedon, that was his original plan for the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.809
second Avengers team-up film. After he delivered
a script that would include Captain Marvel

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.401
and Spider-Man in Cap's New Avengers lineup
at the end of the movie, the studio heads

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.070
told him to change it, since the plan had
changed. By the time the movie was hitting

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.980
theaters, Marvel had announced not only a
Captain Marvel movie, but that Spider-Man

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.239
would be coming to Civil War. Understandably,
Whedon made his disappointment well known.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.129
The Dark Knight Rises
By the time the third Batman movie starts,

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.309
The Dent Act has been used to lock away hundreds
of criminals, all in the name of a lie about

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.970
Two-Face's real fate. But it's never actually
explained what the Dent Act did, or why repealing

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.170
it would be important. In a deleted scene,
it's revealed that the Act took away prisoner's

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.740
rights, including appeals. That would have
been explained when The Scarecrow was leading

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.040
Bane's new court, sentencing people to death
as punishment, completely turning the tables.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.229
Jurassic Park
As brilliant as an amusement park full of

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.700
dinosaurs might be, it was a disaster waiting
to happen. By the movie's end, John Hammond

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.909
realizes his mistake - but he didn't in the
original script. In the first version, Hammond

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.079
refused to see the error of his ways, holding
on to plans for a park in Europe and Japan.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.649
He even let the rest of the cast leave the
island in a helicopter after being attacked

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.469
by a T-rex, walking off into the jungle to
try to survive on his own. Which means sequels

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.900
would have been a problem.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.180
Terminator 2: Judgement Day
The Terminator series is famous for its deleted

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.799
scenes and alternate endings, but one of the
coolest action sequences never even made it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.729
into production. Judgement Day opens with
a brief look at the future war between humans

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.150
and Skynet, but James Cameron originally planned
to show an even longer, more expansive sequence.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.980
It would have shown the humans defeating Skynet
for good, and even the re-programming of the

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.500
T-800 John Connor sends back to protect his
younger self. The scene was delivered in Terminator

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.120
Genisys, but fans would probably have preferred
to see Cameron's version.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.360
Watchmen
Zack Snyder's movie adaptation of Alan Moore's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.870
famous comic took a lot of heat for some changes
made, especially in the final act. But when

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.940
Terry Gilliam was attached to adapt the comic,
he had a different idea for the ending. Instead

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.599
of Ozymandias framing Dr. Manhattan for the
deaths of millions, he just convinced the

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.890
doctor to go back in time and stop his own
creation. He did, which led to the history

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.200
of our world, and sent the real heroes into
the pages of comic books. Pretty clever.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.209
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
The latest Star Wars movie wastes no time

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.930
in getting to the action, but the movie was
originally going to open with a much darker

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.319
scene - one tying the events directly to the
original trilogy. After the opening text crawl,

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.930
audiences would have seen Luke's severed hand
floating through space, still holding his

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.281
lightsaber. The shot was eventually cut, but
with the lightsaber showing up in the movie

00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:13.549
later, it raises some serious questions about
the actual storyline the writers had in mind.

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.909
Chronicle
Josh Trank's found footage movie was basically

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.360
a superhero origin story, minus the superhero.
In the finished cut, Matt takes out the villain,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.840
and heads off into the mountains of Tibet.
But the original ending would have blown comic

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.060
book fans' minds. Matt would have evolved
to the next stage of his powers, showing up&nbsp;two

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.319
years later&nbsp;as a full-blown superhero, saving
a Korean city from a massive flood with only

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.769
his mind. How's that for an origin story?

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.319
The Amazing Spider-Man 2
With Electro, Rhino, a new Green Goblin and

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.069
more, Andrew Garfield's second Spider-Man
movie was stuffed. But the movie was originally

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.860
planned to introduce Mary Jane Watson, Peter's
lifelong love, played by Shailene Woodley.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.300
Their scenes were actually shot, but director
Marc Webb decided it was better to keep Gwen

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.480
Stacy in the spotlight, and introduce Mary
Jane in the sequel. The sequel never came,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.610
which means fans will never know how Woodley's
MJ compared to those before or after.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.970
The Dark Knight Rises
The villain of the movie didnâ€™t amount to

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.349
the homerun performance of Heath Ledger's
Joker, but another deleted scene might have

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.390
helped him earn fans. The sequence would have
told an origin story of Bane, seeing the injuries

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.360
he sustained defending Talia al Ghul, the
first mask he wore, and even his training

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.480
in the League of Shadows. The training would
have called back to Bruce Wayne's in Batman

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.630
Begins, making their standoff in the last
chapter a perfect bookend to the trilogy as

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.380
a whole. Why it wasn't included is something
Christopher Nolan will have to explain (but

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.270
probably won't).

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.130
Back to the Future
Forget scenes, how about an entire movie you'll

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.541
never get to see? When the first photos of
Eric Stoltz on the set of Back to the Future

00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:47.530
started to appear, the full story came out
not long after. Stoltz had landed the part

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.720
of Marty McFly, but the studio soon realized
he wasn't the right fit. Rather than scrapping

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.220
the production, it continued on, filming the
other actors knowing full well Stoltz's sides

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.470
would need to be reshot. The evidence suggests
there's a cut of the movie, or most of it,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.360
starring Stoltz that fans won't ever get to
see.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.170
Those are the wildest, coolest, or weirdest
scenes that movie fans almost got to see,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.480
but probably never will. Which ones did we
miss? Let us know the planned-but-cancelled

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.170
movie scenes you'd kill to see, and remember
