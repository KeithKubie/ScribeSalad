00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.320
Every day, from Monday to Saturday,
more than 24 million people

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.520
work to maintain the socialist
machine of North Korea.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.640
This is the present-day result of
a unique political experiment

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.180
that’s been running
for almost 70 years.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.080
It’s all at the expense of an
isolated and subjugated people.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.520
Or, as those we spoke to
during our visit prefer to say,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.220
‘A people protected from the
outside world by the leader.’

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.680
‘The Sun of Korea’ is how the
great generals are referred to

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.360
in children’s songs.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.220
Kim Jong-un’s exact age is a
mystery, even to North Koreans.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.740
Like his father and grandfather
before him, the young general is

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.220
head of state in a country at war.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.540
A country with a growing economy.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.560
And a country which,
however cautiously,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.040
is gradually opening its doors
to investors and tourists.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.620
But at the same time, remains
inaccessible and mysterious.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.380
Pyongyang, the flatland.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.340
It’s the centre of power for
the North Korean regime.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.920
The capital city and the
face of the republic,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.160
it’s where we’ll spend
most of our time in this

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.120
almost completely unknown
and isolated country.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.700
A few months ago, biology
professor Kim Chol Ho was

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.720
given the keys to his new home.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.640
He now lives in one of the most
modern buildings in Pyongyang.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.180
At the entrance is a poster reminding
citizens that, at any time, they should

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.300
always be ready to show respect
to the great leader, Kim Jong-un.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.560
Inside, we’re given a warm welcome
by the proud owners of the large 240

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.640
metre flat.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.260
A gift from the marshal to
his indispensable scientists.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.460
‘It’s an incentive to work harder
and more quickly,’ says Chol Ho.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.000
A sickle, a hammer, and a brush in
the centre of Pyongyang symbolise

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.300
the solidity of the country’s only
political party to hold power.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.620
Almost 90% of all members of
parliament belong to the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.980
workers’ party.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.620
The remaining seats are taken by
representatives with the dependent

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.980
social democratic
and Chondoist parties,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.240
but have no real power.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.840
There’s also a handful of
so-called ‘independent’ members.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.020
The last parliamentary election
was held earlier this year.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.720
Kim Jong-un was re-elected as
a deputy with 100% of the vote

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.440
from the same assembly that chose
him as the country’s supreme leader.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.540
That was two weeks after the
death of his father, Kim Jong-il,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.760
eternal general secretary
of the workers’ party.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.680
Kim Kyo Sun is a farmer,
just like his father before him.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.280
He has worked at the Mikok
Collective Farm for 8 years.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.720
He joined after leaving the army

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.500
where 10 years of service is
obligatory for almost all men.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.200
Working to uphold the system and
achieving goals set by the government

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.800
is a question of honour.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.760
Agricultural workers are
constantly reminded of this

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.020
by propaganda that’s widely distributed
throughout the collective farms.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.860
Loudspeakers, broadcasting
rousing music and

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.500
speeches, call farmers
to their daily work.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.640
Students with revolutionary
flags and flowers

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.020
take turns to boost
the farmers’ morale.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.800
The slogans encourage
everyone to be patriots

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.880
and surpass the entire world.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.140
Or at least to follow the
Great Marshall’s example

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.740
and contribute as much effort as he
does, to ensure that his people thrive.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.620
Certificates on the offices
of this glass factory

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.920
proudly honour employees
of the month and year.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.940
Last month, Oh Yong Nam broke not a
single sheet of plate glass while packing.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.860
He considers that an acheivment.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.020
Students pursue the same goals.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.660
At least that’s what’s said
in front of a camera.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.860
‘To serve my country,’
says Ji Chung Hyok.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.980
In this case, he’s talking about
technological research.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.880
He’s on his way to study at
the country’s main library,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.040
‘The Grand People’s Study Palace.’

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.920
Even prisoners are bound
to contribute to the

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.200
stability and development of
the North Korean system.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.960
The exact number of convicts is
something else that’s kept secret.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.800
The punishment for any
felony is compulsory labour

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.400
or, for less serious offences,
community service.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.080
That’s what we were openly told by
Alejandro Cao de Benós, from Spain.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.500
As president of the Korean
Friendship Association,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.680
he cooperates with the government.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.160
He helped sort out all the issues
we had to face to enter the country,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.760
and he’ll accompany us
throughout this trip.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.580
Fields, construction sites, and mines
are the most common destinations

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.900
for prisoners sentenced
to punitive labour.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.040
A foreign ministry official recently
confirmed to a handful of journalists

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.900
that there are, indeed, special
camps for this kind of labour.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.700
Some agencies say, ‘Their
purpose is to reform criminals.’

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.580
High treason and subversion
carry the death penalty.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.340
General Jang Song-thaek
was executed last year.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.000
He was the young marshal’s uncle
and thought to have been his mentor,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.880
the second most important
figure in the country.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.320
A military tribunal
accused him of corruption,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.480
and plotting to topple the
revolutionary North Korean regime.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.480
Our visit ends in Pyongyang’s
victorious war museum.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.900
Special effects and music portray the
exploits of the People’s Army and their

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.060
struggle against their southern
neighbour and the United States.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.020
The latent conflict lasted
more than 60 years,

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.580
and North Korea commemorates the end of
military action with a grand annual parade,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.720
demonstrating its military prowess.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.740
‘Victory Day,’ as it’s known here,
marks the armistice in the Korean War.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.840
Last year saw the 70th
anniversary parade, where,

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.040
as well as missiles, tanks, and troops,

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.940
for the first time ever, Kim Jong-un used
the occasion to demonstrate to the world,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.360
that North Korea had successfully
produced its own drones.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.760
There are more than a million
soldiers in the regular army,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.420
not including the highly
militarised police.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.900
More than 15% of GDP
is spent on the military.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.000
Mangyongdae Revolutionary
School even prepares children.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.960
For the regime, the army is a source
of inspiration and above all, order,

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.940
defining the precise military way
in which the society is organised,

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.120
a society on constant
full combat alert.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.060
This is a country based
on military ideology,

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.300
absolutely everything is literally
imbued with combative spirit.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.300
A metro system more than a 100 metres
deep was constructed in the 1970s

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.700
with help from the USSR and China.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.220
This underground space
would serve as a refuge

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.120
in the event of a nuclear attack.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.220
A gigantic sculpture graces the
southern exit from Pyongyang,

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.400
where two women symbolise
Korean reunification.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.720
On official maps, North
and South are marked

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.060
as a single country called the
Korean People’s Democratic Republic.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.300
Just 3 hours drive along
a run down, but wide,

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.320
spectacularly clean and
practically empty road,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.360
takes you from
Pyongyang to the border.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.980
This highway with
limited access could also

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.620
be used for military maneuvers.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.380
From time to time, you
encounter army checkpoints,

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.940
where filming is strictly forbidden.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.320
Locals wait patiently in
line to show their permits

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.960
to pass through the barrier.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.600
Panmunjom village is where

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.700
Lieutenant Colonel Nam Tong Ho delivers

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.100
military history lectures for visitors.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.840
This would seem to
be one of the most

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.900
important tourist
attractions in the country.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.900
According to the guide,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.220
in this very hall and
at these very desks

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.700
on July the 27th, 1953,

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.900
North Korea and the USA
signed the armistice agreement

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.020
without the participation of the South.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.640
It was a precarious
non-aggression pact,

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.620
that should ultimately have
led to a final peace treaty,

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.120
but never did.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.960
There are no South
Korean soldiers to be seen

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.860
along that clearly marked
military border today.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.820
It’s said they keep it
under surveillance using

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.340
binoculars and cameras,

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.680
or remaining where tourists won’t see them.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.900
Technically, a state of war still exists

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.220
between the parties,

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.860
following the conflicts that resulted in

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.920
millions of casualties and
ravage to the peninsula.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.360
Several metres away, a group
of American Christians,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.600
some of South Korean descent,
pray for reunification.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.740
There are now huge differences
between the two sides,

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.280
historic, economic, and cultural.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.260
Even the language has begun to differ.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.460
But families living on
opposite sides of this divide

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.200
still try to preserve ties
between close relatives

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.520
torn apart by war.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.720
It’s a painful issue
that’s often used as a

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.660
bargaining chip in talks
between Pyongyang and Seoul.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.420
Dozens of people from the South,

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.460
all selected by drawing lots,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.320
came to the mountains in Compang
region in North Korea’s east coast

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.860
in search of brothers and sisters

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.140
nephews and even children they were never

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.080
given the opportunity to know.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.420
After several years, in February,

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.000
family members separated by war

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.700
are granted just 3 days to see each other.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.900
For many, it's their last chance.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.680
I don't, involve, any of the

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.880
politics or,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.240
any of the, um, religion part,

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.240
but we just wanted to;

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.280
this is a one country, and

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.520
this is a one people.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.900
On her second trip to the country in 8 years,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.920
Mrs. Lee met us in Kai Sung,

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.200
the next stop after our trip to the border.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.520
First trip was very sad.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.580
It was really dark,

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.660
no lights.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.560
You know, during the, um,

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.360
the meal time,

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.840
lights go off like 5-6 times,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.480
and there are no, um,

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.000
smiles on peoples' face,

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.080
but, um,

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.120
now I think it's, uh, economically changing,

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.340
but I think, uh,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.380
some,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.840
something life,

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.800
some kind of life is coming back.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.460
The differences between Kai Sung and Pyongyang are striking.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.380
This city is one of the few examples of

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.380
direct economic cooperation between North and South.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.740
The only joint industrial complex is based here.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.520
It encompasses over a hundred

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.200
South Korean companies,

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.140
employing 53 thousand North Koreans.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.220
Kernel Kim Chan-yun comes with us to the so-called "Demilitarized Zone,"

00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.240
which ironically is one of the most
heavily armed areas in the world.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.260
He's talking about the wall erected on the South Korean side.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:27.020
It was completed in 1979 and Washington
and Seoul deny its existence. Though they

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.020
do acknowledge there are certain
anti-tank facilities in place.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.970
This 4 kilometer wide natural barrier
divides the peninsula.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.000
South Korea looms in the distance. Seoul
is a little over 50 kilometers away.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:49.360
From here on the North Korean side, and
using the Colonel's binoculars, we're

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.460
able to see South Korean military bases,
flying UN flags on the opposite side.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:00.360
We can also see what the North Koreans
are talking about: a five meter high wall

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.360
stretching from east to west.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.240
Chan-yun can take pride in just how much trust the marshal vests in him,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.800
keeping him posted on the main border, and in his

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.440
40 years of continued service in the
People's Army.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.960
Revolutionary policy in the DPRK is
based on the principles of Songun,

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:13.710
meaning military first; a philosophy that
reached its heyday during Kim Jong Il's

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.620
reign, that lasted more than 20 years.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.260
The more time passes, the more complex
and controversial the concept becomes.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:30.390
A 170 meter tower keeps this fire burning
at the monument to Juche. Idealogically, a

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.320
permissive and slightly spiritual
adaptation of communism ascribed to Kim

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.360
Il-sung.

00:21:37.049 --> 00:21:42.149
It promotes national and personal self-reliance, or rather, reliance on the masses

00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:48.210
who are dubbed the masters of revolution
and national development. Although the

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:52.139
ideology may seem controversial and
mysterious, and even dangerous to

00:21:52.139 --> 00:21:52.980
foreigners,

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.980
it is constantly referred to.

00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:01.229
The state-endorsed image of utopian
self-reliance and self-sufficiency is in

00:22:01.229 --> 00:22:05.549
stark contrast to economic reality in
the country, which remains dependent on

00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:10.710
outside help and suffers from an acute
shortage of currency. Cargo ships sail

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.029
into the locks of the East China Sea
bringing goods from China, still the main

00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:18.210
supplier of provisions and aid received
through international assistance.

00:22:18.869 --> 00:22:23.849
Last year, more than 2 million people in
the DPRK benefited from United Nations

00:22:23.849 --> 00:22:26.630
aid.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.550
Chinese goods fill the model supermarket
shelves in Potonggang, alongside

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.090
locally manufactured products which
serve as an example of the country's

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.210
economic prowess.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:42.410
The closest estimate was from the Bank
of South Korea. According to Seoul, its

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:46.070
northern neighbor demonstrated 1.1
percent of economic growth in the last

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.450
year.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:53.840
However, as is so often the case, Pyongyang
has released no official data. Small

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.760
shops and food distribution centers
where local people pick up their monthly

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.800
food rations didn't feature in our
itinerary.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.230
We were also warned not to film
construction sites and especially

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:11.270
construction workers, many of whom are
servicemen. They told us that work when

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.330
smeared with cement, would give a false
impression of the country.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:19.640
However, we were allowed to film, from
afar, this footage of the Teachers Tower

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.810
in the capital,

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.140
along with the construction of a new
terminal building and tarmac at the

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.820
airport. Renovation of them made the
first football stadium and construction

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:34.430
of the five star Ryugyong hotel, housed
in the tallest building in Pyongyang;

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.820
which is still underway after 27 years of work;

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:43.500
plus many other buildings and complexes,
whose construction was initiated by

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.920
Kim Jong-un.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.200
So, we started construction of this museum in September

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.040
2012, and under the wise leadership
of the pristin,

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:26.239
I, I mean and the West leadership of the
marshal Kim Jong-un,

00:24:26.239 --> 00:24:31.100
we finished the construction within only
ten months. The museum and the weapons

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.340
expansions outside and all the
renovations,

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.499
the monuments, everything was now
within only 10 months time. The news

00:24:39.499 --> 00:24:43.159
block at the state-controlled TV channel
focuses entirely on the country's

00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:47.450
economy. The biggest share of North
Korea's GDP is from industry and mining,

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.679
followed by the service sector and
agriculture, which isn't enough to meet

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:55.759
the population's needs. Slightly over
fifteen percent of the land can be

00:24:55.759 --> 00:24:57.090
farmed.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:03.000
Tourism and disguised foreign investments
are sources of foreign currency badly

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.240
needed in the country living with
sanctions and economic war.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.770
Tourists are only allowed to pay in
Euros, US dollars, or Chinese yuan.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:16.170
They have to pay higher tourist prices.
The few foreigners who visit the country,

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:21.390
many of whom are Chinese, are constantly
accompanied by one or several "guides".

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:26.130
Tourists can't leave their room in the
47-story hotel, complete with five

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:30.600
restaurants and a souvenir shop and walk
unattended to the casino in the basement;

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:36.450
it's leased by a company from Macau. Only
twice did we get the chance to walk the

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.840
streets of Pyongyang. The rest of the
time we were chauffeur-driven in a

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.840
minivan.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.220
Every morning and night, several times a
day, this disturbing melody can be heard

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.669
playing on the many loud speakers in Pyongyang's railway station.

00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:12.500
Newcomers are immersed in a nightmarish
atmosphere: a funeral march serving to

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.500
remind all who pass through of the great
eternal generals.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.530
Every visitor to the capitol brings
flowers. They must pay their respect to

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:31.660
the colossal bronze statues standing at
the top of Mansu Hill. North Koreans say

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.880
that they are required to perform the
ceremony

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.880
each and every time they visit any city.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.740
A quite remarkable number of literary
works are attributed to the great

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.980
generals.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.520
The national library contains the
selected outstanding works of the

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.990
founder of the nation.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.860
There are more than seven hundred
volumes of Kim Il-sung's speeches, books,

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.780
and plays. One of the best known by the
eternal president is a speech calling on

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:11.549
the people to support his son, Kim
jong-Il, who would soon take over from

00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:14.549
his father.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:24.410
It's almost three years since Kim
Jong-il died. Throughout that time his

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.050
image has been closely linked with that
of his father,

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:32.600
the eternal president. Kimilsungia
orchids and Kimjongilia begonias grace

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.130
all public gardens and civic buildings.
Images captured by a camera have to be

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.000
perfect.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.600
The taking of partial pictures of the
general's statues or photographs marred by

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.150
lens flare is strictly forbidden.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:48.890
North Koreans all wear special insignia
near their hearts.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.580
The badges bear portraits of the leaders,
and among other things they show the

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.430
wearer's merit and how close they are to
the government.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.740
We were told that the hardest to obtain
depicts the smiling faces of

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.000
Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-Il together.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.320
Buildings are generously adorned with
their portraits. There are two separate

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.820
but identical halls,

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.120
each of which contain the leaders in
embalmed bodies.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.960
The council's own mausoleum represents
the apotheosis in the leader's cult.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.880
Photography inside is strictly
forbidden. Two seemingly endless moving

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.720
walkways are decorated with the generals'
pictures, portraying their lives and work.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:31.740
They lead to pharaonic marble holes,
containing the mummified leaders,

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.300
surrounded by treasured objects from
their respective eras: Armored trains

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.890
and cars, an array of medals and
decorations, even a huge map giving a

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:50.160
detailed account of their travels. North
Koreans dressed in their finest clothes

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:54.090
and flock in their hundreds to the mausoleum.
Earlier today, our film crew was among

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:54.600
them.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.100
We'd asked that North Korean worker for his
thoughts about the new leaders rule.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.840
Leaning on a cane,

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:12.240
Kim Jong-un reappeared in public after
being absent for a month and a half.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:18.300
North Korea's mass media attributed his
low profile to his indisposition. The

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.810
disappearance coincided with our visit,
although we only learned of it when we

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:26.160
left. The leader, though, didn't seem to
have become subject to rumor or gossip,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.680
and the few who are lucky enough to see
him at close quarters were thrilled.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.500
At that time, I were, it was too sudden to see, him.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.880
So, uh...uh...I can feel it, it was real,

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.740
so I thought, uh, it wasn't just like it was real, I felt like

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:04.740
"Is it, is it just a dream?" or something like that. 
Later he passed across in front of me

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.470
and then I knew that I really met him.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.400
In real life.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.300
For most though, daily contact with the exalted leader is

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.260
limited to the opening minutes of the
evening news broadcast, which is a rule

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.740
to report his latest activity. When Kim
Jong-un didn't appear in public,

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.760
the bulletins aired recordings of previous
official engagements.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.760
A sample of what was said when we

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.410
were able to interview people on the
street.

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.970
Even though this was outside our planned
itinerary, no spontaneous responses were

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:03.560
forthcoming. Our attendance carefully
selected the people we could talk to, and

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.300
particularly sensitive topics were very
much off limits.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.700
Ideological upbringing and loyalty to the regime begin with early childhood.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.620
The first kindergarten in North Korea
was reorganized during Kim Jong-il's rule.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.640
It's open from Monday to Saturday to
accommodate the children of working mothers.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.000
In one school whole, three and
four-year-olds put on a performance for newcomers.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.260
Five children sing a heroic song, telling
how their beloved leader became a steel commander,

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.200
because ever since he was a child, he
understood the importance of military force.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.080
During a revolutionary history lesson,
the teacher shows a model of a fantasy

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:11.460
paradise where they say Kim Il-sung was
born. They repeat the place and date of

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:15.760
his birth. "He was born in spring just
like magnolias," says the teacher.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.100
During a science lesson,

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:35.220
pupils are told a story about how the
great generals once sent children

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.560
tomatoes, pears, and grapes that they had
personally picked themselves.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.160
A squirrel and a hedgehog are the heroes
of the most popular children's cartoon.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.180
Agile and smart,

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.980
North Korean squirrels fight their
enemies: ferrets and mice.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.520
The quality of animation has been
acknowledged internationally.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:01.420
That's why overseas studios higher
Korean animators in Pyongyang at very low

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.420
rates to work on their films.

00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:10.589
The International Movie Festival in
Pyongyang provided the pretext that

00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:13.700
allowed our crew to secure an invitation
to enter North Korea.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.280
"The Flower Girl" represents the classics of North
Korean cinema.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.380
The screenplay was written by Kim Il-sung
when he was 20.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.950
It was made into a movie 40 years ago,
and is now one of the five greatest

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:10.840
revolutionary operas.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.350
It's the story of a young girl from a
poor family who was suppressed by a

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:17.350
wicked landlord during Japanese
occupation.

00:38:31.269 --> 00:38:35.649
On the banks of the Taedong river that
cuts through the city, everyday life

00:38:35.649 --> 00:38:39.759
overshadows the exotic and mysterious
atmosphere enveloping North Korea.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:54.920
Oblivious to the international headlines,
three boys try their luck at casting

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.520
lines from the riverside, while another
family takes to boating.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:10.460
Local teams are replaying a classic game,
a match between Barcelona and Real Madrid.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:15.120
But this is the volleyball version; it's
one of the most popular sports in the

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.370
country. People pay a visit to the Changyuan beauty and aesthetics parlor on

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:24.960
Wednesdays. A poster displayed near the
entrance to the salon features the

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.000
most popular women's hair styles.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.590
The women usually wear heels and will
never let their hair down if it's too

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:39.600
long. Among the styles most often
recommended by men's hair dresses, is the

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.760
one sported by the country's leader.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.760
There's no place for extravagance here
either.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.420
Excessive attention is paid to order,
cleanliness, and symmetry in the capital

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:53.220
city's streets.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.280
The harmony and serenity that prevail in
the city are there to conceal the

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.290
controlled lifestyle that North Koreans
must observe.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.020
The highly paternalistic policy of the
state prescribes exactly what citizens

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.600
must hear, read, and see.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:52.560
Using these computers in the People's
Palace of Education, access to the

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.779
country's intranet is easy.

00:40:54.779 --> 00:40:59.189
It's a localized network isolated from
the outside world full of sex in

00:40:59.189 --> 00:41:04.559
American propaganda as one North Korean
resident told us. The internet is

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.940
available to a select few: scientists and
research workers for example.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:00.040
In 2014, Pyongyang by night has little in
common with how it was described a few

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:00.740
years ago.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.000
The main avenues are brightly
illuminated with neon lights and street

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.720
lamps.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.859
Although smaller residential areas and
streets do succumb to darkness when

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.780
night falls.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.500
Some members of one very popular band,
graduated from this conservatory,

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.500
considered the most important in North Korea.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.200
They say that the five members of the
Moranbong Band were personally

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:07.190
hand-picked by the current leader, Kim
Jong-un. The first woman's pop band

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:11.120
looks more rebellious than its lyrics
actually suggest. This represents

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.300
something of a departure from the norm
in the country:

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.660
meticulously arranged and monotone
aesthetics.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.060
In Spain, and a year before preparing for this trip,

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.540
we spoke to Choe and other aerial
artists.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.300
Few ever represent their country
abroad like they do.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:40.520
Or even earn foreign currency for the system like workers laboring in the Middle East.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.860
Not many get the chance to see anything
beyond North Korea's tightly sealed borders.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.700
One plane filled with workers took off
for Kuwait on the day I was landed in Pyongyang.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:07.600
On our way to the hotel, we stared around
the unfamiliar streets, certain that we'd

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.940
be able to gain some insight into the
most unknown country in the world.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:20.320
Ten days later, we knew different. An
impermeable barrier separating us from

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.959
them blurs every story we hear about
this country, giving it a sense of

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.680
incompleteness. And that imprecision
holds true for the story you have just see too.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.380
Everything we heard lacked the millions
of voices and opinions needed to be credible.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:58.180
What really happens in this faraway land
ruled by one young marshal, is anyone's guess.
