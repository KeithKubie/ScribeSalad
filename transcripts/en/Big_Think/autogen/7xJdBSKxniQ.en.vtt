I think that the teacher and a leader
 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:09.750
I think that the teacher and a leader
they're all together you know I don't

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760
they're all together you know I don't

teaching the graduate students and the
 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.910
teaching the graduate students and the
postdocs partly by example partly we're

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920
postdocs partly by example partly we're
 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.029
postdocs partly by example partly we're
all in this together and and I think

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039
all in this together and and I think
 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.609
all in this together and and I think
that they they go together my hope is

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619
that they they go together my hope is
 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.859
that they they go together my hope is
that when people leave this lab you know

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869
that when people leave this lab you know
 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.720
that when people leave this lab you know
there are stronger better person people

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730
there are stronger better person people
 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.220

there that they're leaders themselves
and and that in fact has happened I mean

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:35.859
and and that in fact has happened I mean
 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.469
and and that in fact has happened I mean

mean to me the kinds of things I think
 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.590
mean to me the kinds of things I think
I'd probably do are try to impart to the

I'd probably do are try to impart to the
 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.170

the fact that you want to make an impact
 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.420
the fact that you want to make an impact

well and and and and and and and you

well and and and and and and and you
want to really think that almost

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500
want to really think that almost
 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.370
want to really think that almost
anything is possible and and I guess

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380
anything is possible and and I guess

finally the way I try to deal with
 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.200
finally the way I try to deal with
people for the most part is try to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210
people for the most part is try to
 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.640
people for the most part is try to
provide what I'll call positive

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650
provide what I'll call positive
 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.890
provide what I'll call positive

good I want to let them know it rather

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090
good I want to let them know it rather
 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.580

than say yelling at them and saying you

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590
than say yelling at them and saying you
 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.800
than say yelling at them and saying you
should work harder I want people to work

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810
should work harder I want people to work
 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.360
should work harder I want people to work
hard because they want to not because

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370
hard because they want to not because
 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.540
hard because they want to not because
they have to well well the way I try to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550
they have to well well the way I try to
 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.360
they have to well well the way I try to
foster this this idea of discovery and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370
foster this this idea of discovery and
 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.720

and you know if somebody comes in and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010
and you know if somebody comes in and
 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.980
and you know if somebody comes in and
they're doing a thesis I try to get them

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990
they're doing a thesis I try to get them
 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.780
they're doing a thesis I try to get them
to think about well what will be

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790
to think about well what will be
 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.360
to think about well what will be
important I might shape it you know in

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370
important I might shape it you know in
 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.490
important I might shape it you know in
some very general way but I want people

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500
some very general way but I want people
 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.590
some very general way but I want people
to just think I don't I don't want to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600
to just think I don't I don't want to
 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.520
to just think I don't I don't want to
just say here do this I die I want to be

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530
just say here do this I die I want to be
 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.040
just say here do this I die I want to be
a guide another way I sometimes think

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050
a guide another way I sometimes think
 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.259
a guide another way I sometimes think
about it is this because I'm dealing

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269
about it is this because I'm dealing
 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.599
about it is this because I'm dealing
with graduate students and postdocs and

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.609
with graduate students and postdocs and
 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.000
with graduate students and postdocs and
something so the way I offer

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
something so the way I offer
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.460
something so the way I offer
think about it is if somebody is a

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470
think about it is if somebody is a
 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.869
think about it is if somebody is a
graduate student or a postdoctoral

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879
graduate student or a postdoctoral
 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.630
graduate student or a postdoctoral
fellow almost their entire life up till

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
fellow almost their entire life up till
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.050
fellow almost their entire life up till
then

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060
then
 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.509
then
they've been judged shaped by grades or

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519
they've been judged shaped by grades or
 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.569
they've been judged shaped by grades or
other means by how well they give

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579
other means by how well they give
 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.110
other means by how well they give
answers to other people's questions but

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120
answers to other people's questions but
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.890
answers to other people's questions but
in life in my opinion what's really

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
in life in my opinion what's really
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.920
in life in my opinion what's really
important is not the answers as that you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930
important is not the answers as that you
 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.410
important is not the answers as that you
might give though that's important but

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420
might give though that's important but
 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.610
might give though that's important but
the really important thing is the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620
the really important thing is the
 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.770
the really important thing is the
questions you ask are you asking really

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
questions you ask are you asking really
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.270
questions you ask are you asking really
important questions or are you asking

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
important questions or are you asking
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.530
important questions or are you asking
medium important questions or

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540
medium important questions or
 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.479
medium important questions or
unimportant questions I think the key to

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489
unimportant questions I think the key to
 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.869
unimportant questions I think the key to
it is to help somebody go from somebody

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879
it is to help somebody go from somebody
 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.140
it is to help somebody go from somebody
who gives good answers to somebody who

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150
who gives good answers to somebody who
 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.210
who gives good answers to somebody who
asks good questions because in the end

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220
asks good questions because in the end
 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.360
asks good questions because in the end
questions are going to be what's key you

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370
questions are going to be what's key you
 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.430
questions are going to be what's key you
know so that that's really what I want

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440
know so that that's really what I want
 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.160
know so that that's really what I want
to say

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
to say
