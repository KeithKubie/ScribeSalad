00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.480
Move over rabbits!

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.190
A new Australian marsupial is the animal to
beat when it comes to marathon sex.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.889
Hello Everyone, welcome to DNews.

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.769
Im Crystal Dilworth, here to talk about sex
in the outback.

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.140
Animal sex in most cases, isn’t really any
weirder or more straightforward than human

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.140
sex.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.759
In fact, behaviorist Dr. Jason Goldman has
been quoted as saying: “for just about any

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.109
fantasy between consenting adults that might
be thought of as beyond conventional sexual

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.250
practices or decency as dictated by society,
you can bet that there’s a non-human species

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.690
for whom that particular behaviour is commonplace”
and that may be true, but a special marsupial

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.270
inhabitant of Australia may be showing us
up in dedication to the cause:

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.370
Genetic analysis of several Australian marsupial
mammals called Antechinus has facilitated

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.540
classification of a another new species - this
one named The Tasman Peninsula Dusky Antechinus.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.699
These animals are small mousy carnivores that
live in Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.550
but their claim to fame?

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.550
Suicidal sex.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.440
Yes, thats right, Antechinus males have sex
until they literally can’t do it anymore.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.850
Male Antechinus literally train for the task
of mating.Banking sperm and suppressing their

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.480
immune systems to give themselves more energy
for the marathon act of passing on their genetic

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.480
material.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.360
During a mating season that lasts only a few
weeks, testosterone fueled males engage in

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.540
what has been described as an “extreme form
of ‘speed-mating.’”

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.960
In that time males attempt to have sex with
as many females as possible, lasting for anywhere

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.720
from 12 -14 hours before their bodies literally
self-destruct.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.900
Scientists at Queensland University of Technology
say that these animals are biochemically driven

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.270
to give it their all before, ultimately, the
high level of testosterone triggers a malfunction

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.550
in the inhibition of stress hormones.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.970
Once stress hormones begin to flood the body,
the immune system of these overtaxed males

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.630
begin to collapse and the animal usually dies
of hemorrhage or infection before they can

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.250
see the fruits of their labor.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.160
What drives males to these extremes?

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.370
Scarcity of food and sexual competition.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.700
Antechinus aren't the only animals who mate
until they die, suicidal reproduction is called

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.489
“semelparity” and salmon, as well as some
frogs, lizards, and many insects reproduce

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.489
this way.

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.159
But while not rare in nature, it is unusual
to see semelparity in mammals, and all of

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.269
the species that exhibit this behavior are
insect eating marsupials.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.810
The narrow window of the mating season is
thought to follow the boom-bust nature of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.800
the insect life cycle, synchronizing Antechinus
reproduction so that females raise their young

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.909
at times when food is most abundant.

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.920
The intensity of the resulting sexual competition
also works out for females who benefit by

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.060
mating promiscuously and just letting the
best sperm win.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.840
This anomaly of evolution may sound like “all
play and no work” but the inefficiency of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.859
the mating practice combined with a severely
reduced natural habitat is cutting each generation

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.030
of antechinus population in half and scientists
have already requested this newly discovered

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.859
marsupial be placed on the threatened species
list.

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.989
Leading one to speculate that this may be
an evolutionary “dead end”

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.819
Is there any other weird animal behavior you
wanna know more about?

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.730
Let us know in the comments down below.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.870
