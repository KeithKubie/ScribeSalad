00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.640
Hello and welcome back to
another exciting episode

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.600
of Game On!, our show
for game developers.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.440
I'm your host Todd Kerpelman.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.460
I know it's been awhile
since our last episode

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.394
and I've missed you.

00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:13.310
Did you do something
different with your hair?

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.090
It looks nice.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.950
Anyway, this episode
is all about not

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.390
shipping broken games.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.280
Or I guess to put a more
positive spin on it,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.530
testing your game
for fun and profit.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.784
Mostly profit.

00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:27.200
And it's all done through the
magic of using Google Play's

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.590
alpha and beta services
to get your game out

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.372
in front of a large
audience before you publish.

00:00:32.372 --> 00:00:34.080
So I'd like to start
today by telling you

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.760
a little story about Don.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.520
See Don is a game
developer and he just

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.450
released the very first version
of his hotly anticipated game

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.200
to the world.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.766
He was so excited, he could
barely sleep that night.

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.390
And so when he woke up the next
morning, the first thing he did

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.540
was go out and check his
apps review page, which

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.110
looked a little
something like this.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.250
Huh?

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.630
What happened?

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.920
Well, Don did some
digging around

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.810
and he found out that due
to a font rendering error,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.430
the game crashed for any player
who had an E in their name.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.000
Well Don immediately
got together

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
with his team members, Alicia
Winkowski, Irwin Lin, and Chris

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.772
Fulbright and said,
how did we miss this?

00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:11.730
How could we have possibly
overlooked something

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.195
as completely obvious as--
OK, wait I think I see it.

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:15.570
None of us have
an E in our name.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.310
That's kind of a problem.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.010
That's when he
thought, huh, maybe we

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.218
should have tested this with
a bigger group of people

00:01:21.218 --> 00:01:23.100
before we launched this thing.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.792
But of course, that sets up its
own share of problems, right?

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:27.500
How are you going to
be sharing your game

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.416
with several dozen friends
and family members?

00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:31.544
Are you going to be
mailing APKs around?

00:01:31.544 --> 00:01:33.960
How are you going to make sure
that only these people have

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.460
access?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.251
How are you going to
make sure that they're

00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:37.510
looking at the latest version?

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.480
Do you have to mail them and
bug them each time you update

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.787
and hope that they then download
and resideload your APK?

00:01:43.787 --> 00:01:45.370
Come to think of it,
how are you going

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.890
to teach your
nontechnical users how

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.910
to sideload an APK
in the first place?

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.524
It can be a bit of a mess.

00:01:50.524 --> 00:01:53.190
And that brings us to one of the
best features of the Play Store

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.125
publishing process
that some of you

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:57.700
are overlooking, which frankly
is a real shame because it

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.030
was built for just
this situation.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.250
And that is our Alpha Beta
Staged Rollout process.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.890
Also sometimes
known as Alpha Beta

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.350
Canary because that makes
for a better looking acronym.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.260
This lets you easily test
out new apps and app updates

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.230
with large groups
of people before you

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.910
publish to the world.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.230
So let's see what this
process looks like.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.730
Now in the past
you're probably used

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.682
to just uploading your
APK into production,

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.390
where it gets published
to the Play Store

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.640
and is available to the world.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.180
And hurray, there's pixie dust.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.040
Or I suppose, if things
go badly, uh, oh my god.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.380
Everything's on fire, run.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.230
One of the two.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.140
Not sure.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.600
But you don't have to do that.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.360
So hang on their buddy, stay.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.080
You see, the
Developer Console also

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.990
lets you specify a
certain group of people

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.760
to be your alpha testers.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.160
This could be a Google group
or a Google+ community.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.300
For example, for my first
group of alpha testers,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.210
I might want this just to be the
employees in my organization.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.900
So I could publish-- so I
could define my alpha testers

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.864
to be this group and then
publish my APK just to them.

00:02:57.864 --> 00:02:59.780
Now assuming that all
goes well and we haven't

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.390
found any major
bugs, I could then

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.850
create a second group of
beta testers, maybe people

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.990
outside my company.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.030
And again, publish my
APK just to them next.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.270
Kind of similar
process as before.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.074
Now, as for how this
looks to your testers,

00:03:12.074 --> 00:03:14.490
you're just going to send them
a link to a page where they

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.229
can click on a button
to become a tester.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.270
And once they do that,
they can download the game

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.950
from the Play
Store just as if it

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.880
were a completely normal app.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.540
No weird sideloading involved.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.160
Access is completely handled
by your group settings.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.890
You can leave it open or
invite only, however you want.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.630
And all those concerns Don
had, they're basically solved.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.870
So where do you
get these testers?

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.200
Well, here's one fun example.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.340
The developers of CastleStorm
promoted their Android program

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.250
right on their site.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.090
So when you went and
visited their website,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.600
you would see this page, click
on this little green Play

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.490
Now button, took you
to their Google group,

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.370
which was open for
anybody to join.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.370
And they got a ton of great
beta testers this way.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.970
But don't forget about
your Google+ communities.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.600
These are often highly
engaged fans of your game.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.160
And they'd be really good
candidates for beta testers.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.600
Not only for any new
updates to existing games,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.760
but also for any new
product that you release.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.620
And by the way, this
is a fantastic way

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.260
to connect with your community.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.700
Getting early feedback on
new games or new updates

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.150
from your most dedicated
fans will provide you

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.430
with some fantastic insight from
people who quite frankly know

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.129
your game probably
better than you.

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.670
And it also makes them part of
the process and a collaborator

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.971
in your game.

00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:23.970
And then they can become
your biggest supporters

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.570
and your biggest advocates
in the outside world.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.690
Your players, they want
your games to be awesome.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.230
They're on your side.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.450
Don't be afraid to
engage with them.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.516
However you do it, assuming
everything goes well

00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:35.890
with your beta
test group, you're

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.560
going to push wrap
up to production.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.025
And then the world can
finally play your game.

00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:41.777
Now this is all great,
but what happens

00:04:41.777 --> 00:04:43.110
if you want to update your game?

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.932
Maybe you've got a
round of bug fixes,

00:04:44.932 --> 00:04:47.390
but you want to make sure this
bug fix doesn't accidentally

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.930
create a whole bunch of
bigger bugs in the process.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.210
It's been known to happen
to some game developers.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.450
Quite possibly ones in this room
giving presentations right now.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.670
So as you might
expect, alpha and beta

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.130
works similar for
game updates as well.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.240
I can upload a new
version of my game

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.411
to the alpha group and
all my alpha testers,

00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:07.660
they'll be able to grab the
latest version I have just

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.800
as if the app have been updated
normally for them in the Play

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.300
Store.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.470
In fact, in many situations,
your alpha testers

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.240
will just get the
update automatically.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.531
And then from there, I promote
my new version of my app

00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:19.180
to beta, have my beta testers
try it out and then push it

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.180
on to production, right?

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.670
Well, wait, stop,
stay there one second.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.370
See this time around, for
updates to an existing app,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.010
there's a shocking twist.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.760
Yes, that's right.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.860
Even our stock image
photography model is surprised.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.210
You see, instead of just
updating my app fully

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.690
on production, I
can do something

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.392
that's called a Staged Rollout.

00:05:36.392 --> 00:05:38.850
What this lets me do is push
out the new version of my game

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.480
to just a small
percentage of the market.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.160
This is a great way
to make extra sure

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.540
your game is going to work
well with a larger audience.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.310
It also turns out
is a nice way to see

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.280
what people who aren't
your friends and family

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.579
might think of your game.

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:52.120
Turns out your mom
might not actually

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.775
be your most objective customer.

00:05:53.775 --> 00:05:54.920
Sorry, Mom.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.200
So what this means is I can
have Version 2 of my game

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.360
out to a small fraction
of the world while having

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.934
Version 1 of my game
available to everybody else.

00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:03.600
And then as time goes
on and I'm feeling

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.300
fairly confident
about this update,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.070
I can expand that rollout
more and more and more

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.090
until the whole world
is finally ready to see

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.154
the update to my game.

00:06:14.154 --> 00:06:15.570
And the nice thing
is that you can

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.000
see your reviews, your crashes,
and your other stats broken out

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.410
by application version right
there in the Developer Console.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.760
So if your players
hate your update,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.287
you can see that right
away in the reviews.

00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:29.620
More importantly, you can
also set up your own analytics

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.300
to be broken out
by version number.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.050
So you can see if there are any
major problems with retention

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.690
or ARPDAU or ARPU
or any other custom

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.470
metrics you happen
to be tracking.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.940
For instance, if we find out
that nobody is completing

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.577
the tutorial in our v2
release, well that's

00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:45.410
a sign that something
is really wrong there.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.030
And we can fix that before
we push this update out

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.030
to the entire population.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.614
So this all sounds great right?

00:06:51.614 --> 00:06:53.780
Well, with that said, let
me address three responses

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.630
I've heard from developers
around Alpha Beta testing.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.450
The first is, well
I'm not sure I

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.783
want to use this because I
don't want to miss the chance

00:07:00.783 --> 00:07:02.000
to be a "Top Recent" game.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.590
And let me explain to you
what the concern is here.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.080
So imagine that you spent a lot
of time with your game in Alpha

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.660
and then Beta test stages.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.790
Then you're game
hits production here

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.430
and that's when it takes off.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.480
Well, do we qualify as
the "Top Recent" game?

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.090
We have spent a couple of
months in Alpha and Beta.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.190
And it's actually true.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.390
We used to start the
"Top Recent" time here,

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.200
when your game first pushed
to Alpha, which I think we all

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.750
agree makes no sense.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.220
So you'll be happy
to know we now

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.470
start the "Top
Recent" timer here,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.920
once your game has been
pushed to production.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.820
So if you hear of anybody who's
still afraid to Alpha test

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.290
because they're worried they're
going to miss their chance

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.990
to be on the "Top
Recent" list, let

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.570
them know we've
addressed this issue.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.210
They're working on
old info and they

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.460
don't need to be concerned
about this anymore.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.320
And in fact, what I'm also
excited to tell you-- and go

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.780
grab your business
analyst person

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.470
and tell them to
watch this part--

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.840
is that we are now calculating
the "Top Recent" list

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.020
per country.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.320
So if you want to launch
your product in say, Canada

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.300
first and then launch two
weeks later in the US,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.000
your "Top Recent"
window in the US

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.100
will be determined
by the time you first

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.340
launch there and not in Canada.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.200
And so you can launch
in different countries

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.240
at different times and
not worry about missing

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.657
the "Top Recent"
window elsewhere.

00:08:13.657 --> 00:08:16.031
See, your business analyst
person, they're really excited

00:08:16.031 --> 00:08:16.755
now aren't they?

00:08:16.755 --> 00:08:18.910
They're glad you grabbed them.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.410
So a second question
I sometimes get

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.344
is how do you add achievements
or leaderboards or game

00:08:23.344 --> 00:08:26.010
services-- other game services--
to a version of the game that's

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.080
in beta?

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.300
And it turns out these
days it's pretty easy.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.300
When you create a new
leaderboard or achievement

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.190
or quest or event or what have
you in Play game services,

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.980
it remains in an unpublished
state on our servers

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.900
that's only visible
to your testers.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.830
But if you go into the testers
portion of the Play Services

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.940
Developer Console,
right here, you

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.200
can see that you can easily add
alpha or beta testers as part

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.870
of the group that has access
to these unpublished features

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.110
on our servers.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.950
So if you're new APK has say
a new leaderboard and five

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.050
new achievements, you can simply
publish that updated client

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.230
to your Alpha group.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.282
And then, give those
same alpha testers access

00:09:01.282 --> 00:09:03.240
to this new achievement
and the new leaderboard

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.370
and achievements on the server.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.329
Your testers get to test
these new services out

00:09:07.329 --> 00:09:09.869
and then the general public will
see this mystery leaderboard

00:09:09.869 --> 00:09:11.550
or these mystery
achievements that they

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.140
can't seem to access or unlock.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.980
A third question I
sometimes get is, OK,

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.320
so is this what I should
be using for A/B testing?

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.400
And my answer is kind of, sort
of, but not really, it depends.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.750
Don't be confused by
these A/B letters.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.570
Alpha Beta testing is different
than the split testing people

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.150
sometimes refer
to as A/B testing.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.920
The point of Alpha
Beta Canary testing

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.336
is really to find
out if there are

00:09:34.336 --> 00:09:36.337
major problems with your
game before you launch.

00:09:36.337 --> 00:09:38.086
Now you could certainly
use it to find out

00:09:38.086 --> 00:09:40.190
if you've accidentally
broken your in-game economy

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.400
or if some new feature
has improved retention.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.230
But if you're looking to A/B
test small interface changes

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.600
or gameplay tweaks
or the wording

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.680
that you've put in
your purchase dialogue,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.930
it's not really best for that.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.770
You don't want your users
constantly downloading new APKs

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.800
and using up their
data plan every time

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.127
you want to test some
minor gameplay tweak.

00:09:58.127 --> 00:09:59.710
So instead, I highly
recommend looking

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.350
at tools like Google Tag
Manager, which basically allow

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.040
you to configure your game and
run all the A/B testing you

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.260
want in the cloud.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.160
Google Tag Manager is
a really great tool.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.940
I am a fan, but I
probably don't have time

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.856
to talk about it here.

00:10:10.856 --> 00:10:13.640
I'll have to cover that
in a future episode.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.320
So with all of that in
mind, Don, our intrepid game

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.260
developer, got into his
handy dandy time machine

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.240
and went back in time to the
week before his game launched.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.651
This time, instead of just
testing his game in house,

00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:27.150
he decided to launch it on the
beta channel to several dozen

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.690
of his closest friends.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.500
And that's where he found
and fixed several other bugs

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.179
that got missed by
his three person team.

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:35.970
With those bugs fixed,
he launched his game

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.140
to great fanfare.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.260
The reviews were way up.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.926
And just a few months
later, his company

00:10:39.926 --> 00:10:42.499
was acquired for $12 billion.

00:10:42.499 --> 00:10:44.790
Not because of the game
though, but because of the time

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.320
machine.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.850
Turns out those things,
they're really valuable.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.100
Anyway, if you are not in
the time machine business,

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.770
but you are in
the game business,

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.561
I'm hoping I've convinced
you at this point

00:10:53.561 --> 00:10:56.410
that Alpha Beta
Canary testing is

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.660
something you should be doing.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.618
It's generally pretty
easy to get started with.

00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:01.540
It's all part of the
Play Developer Console.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.190
But if you want to
see a walkthrough

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.220
or see me record a screen
capture or something,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.386
let me know in the comments.

00:11:06.386 --> 00:11:07.150
I'll do that.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.180
So that's it for this Game On!
episode on testing your app.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.200
Thanks for tuning in.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.230
Test your games with your
family and friends and fans

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.790
and let's start seeing
some great games out there.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.334
Bye.
