00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.730
 

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.740
Welcome back.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.500
I'm not going to do a bunch of
projectile motion problems,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.800
and this is because I think
you learn more just seeing

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.610
someone do it, and thinking
out loud,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.040
than all the formulas.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.570
I have a strange notion that I
might have done more harm than

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.700
good by confusing you with a lot
of what I did in the last

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.480
couple of videos, so hopefully
I can undo any damage if I

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.430
have done any, or even better--
hopefully, you did

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.530
learn from those, and we'll
just add to the learning.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.350
Let's start with a
general problem.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.150
Let's say that I'm at the top
of a cliff, and I jump--

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.750
instead of throwing something,
I just jump off the cliff.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.770
We won't worry about my motion
from side to side, but just

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.060
assume that I go
straight down.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.740
We could even think that someone
just dropped me off of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.750
the top of the cliff.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.670
I know these are getting kind
of morbid, but let's just

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.120
assume that nothing
bad happens to me.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.560
Let's say that at the top
of the cliff, my initial

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.160
velocity-- velocity initial-- is
going to be 0, because I'm

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.160
stationary before the person
drops me or before I jump.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:16.740
At the bottom of the cliff
my velocity is

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.730
100 meters per second.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.750
My question is, what is the
height of this cliff?

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.590
 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.970
I think this is a good time
to actually introduce the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.440
direction notion of
velocity, to show

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.200
you this scalar quantity.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.010
Let's assume up is positive,
and down is negative.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.160
My velocity is actually 100
meters per second down-- I

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.720
could have assumed
the opposite.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.480
The final velocity is 100 meters
per second down, and

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.860
since we're saying that down
is negative, and gravity is

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.210
always pulling you down, we're
going to say that our

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.030
acceleration is equal to
gravity, which is equal to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.935
minus 10 meters per
second squared.

00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:06.000
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.120
I just wrote that ahead of
times, because when we're

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.780
dealing with anything of
throwing or jumping or

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.340
anything on this planet, we
could just use this constant--

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.950
the actual number is 9.81, but
I want to be able to do this

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.110
without a calculator, so I'll
just stick with minus 10

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.060
meters per second squared.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.440
It's pulling me down, so that's
why the minus is there.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.400
My question is: I know my
initial velocity, I know my

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.700
final velocity, right before I
hit the ground or right when I

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.420
hit the ground, what's
the distance?

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.770
 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.010
In this circumstance, what
does distance represent?

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.060
Distance would be the height of
the cliff, and so how do we

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.310
figure this out?

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.400
 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.470
What's the only formula that
we know for distance, or

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.090
actually the change in distance,
but in this case,

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.990
it's the same thing.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.790
Change in distance is equal
to the average velocity.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.650
When you learned this in middle
school, or probably

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.580
even elementary school, you
didn't say average velocity,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.720
because you always assumed
velocity was constant-- the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.990
average and the instantaneous
velocity was

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.560
kind of the same thing.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.100
Now, since the velocity is
changing, we're going to say

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.790
the average velocity.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.350
So, the change in distance is
equal to the average velocity

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.210
times time.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.020
This should be intuitive
to you at this point.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.530
Velocity really is just distance
divided by time, or

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.290
actually, change in distance
divided by times change in

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.430
time-- or, change in
distance divided by

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.270
change in times is velocity.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.406
Let me actually change this
to change in time.

00:03:32.406 --> 00:03:35.030
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.145
Since we always assume-- or we
normally assume-- that we

00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:42.870
start at distance is equal to 0,
and we assume that start at

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.380
time is equal to 0, we can write
distance is equal to

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.970
velocity average times time.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.110
Maybe later on we'll do
situations where we're not

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.620
starting at time 0, or distance
0, and in that case,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.680
we will have to be a little more
formal and say change in

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.915
distance is equal to average
velocity the change in time.

00:04:02.915 --> 00:04:06.430
 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.250
This is a formula we know,
and let's see what

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.580
we can figure out.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.959
Can we figure out the
average velocity?

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.459
The average velocity is just
the average of the initial

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.940
velocity and the
final velocity.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.500
The average velocity is just
equal to the average of these

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.520
two numbers: so, minus 100 plus
0 over 2-- and I'm just

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.230
averaging the numbers-- equals
minus 50 meters per second.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.790
We were able to figure
that out, so can

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.040
we figure out time?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.250
 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.230
We know also that velocity,
or let's say the change in

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:57.020
velocity, is equal to the
final velocity minus the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.400
initial velocity.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.640
This is nothing fancy-- you
don't have to memorize this.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.390
This hopefully is intuitive to
you, that the change is just

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.755
the final velocity minus the
initial velocity, and that

00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:12.380
that equals acceleration
times time.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.920
So what's the change in velocity
in this situation?

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.815
Final velocity is minus 100
meters per second, and then

00:05:22.815 --> 00:05:27.260
the initial velocity is 0, so
the change in velocity is

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.290
equal to minus 100 meters
per second.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.030
I'm kind of jumping in and out
of the units, but I think you

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.780
get what I'm doing.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.230
That equals acceleration
times time-- what's the

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.560
acceleration?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.150
It's minus 10 meters per second
squared, because I'm

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.920
going straight down-- minus 10
meters per second squared

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.550
times time.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.365
This is a pretty straightforward
equation.

00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:54.400
Let's divide both sides by the
acceleration, by the minus 10

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.160
meters per second squared, and
you'll get time is equal to--

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.870
the negatives cancel out, as
they should, because negative

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.290
time is difficult, we're
assuming positive time, and

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.630
it's good we got a positive
time answer-- but the

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.410
negatives cancel out
and we get time

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.620
is equal to 10 seconds.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.560
There we have it: we figured out
time, we figured out the

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.030
average velocity, and so now we
can figure out the height

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.110
of the cliff.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.200
The distance is equal to the
average velocity minus 50

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.690
meters per second times
10 seconds.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.210
The distance-- this is going to
be an interesting notion to

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:45.240
you-- the distance it's going
to be minus 500 meters.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.930
This might not make a lot of
sense to you-- what does minus

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.510
500 meters mean?

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.660
This is actually right, because
this formula is

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.910
actually the change
in distance.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.780
 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.680
We said if we did it formally,
it would be

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.900
the change in distance.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:09.470
So if we have a cliff-- let me
change colors with it-- and if

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.780
we assume that we start at this
point right here, and

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:21.390
this distance is equal to 0,
then the ground, if this cliff

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.855
is 500 hundred meters high, your
final distance-- this is

00:07:24.855 --> 00:07:29.140
the initial distance-- your
final distance df is actually

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.760
going to be at minus
500 hundred meters.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.136
We could have done it the other
way around: we could

00:07:35.136 --> 00:07:37.930
have said this is plus 500
meters, and then this is 0,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.010
but all that matters is really
the change in distance.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.240
We're saying from the top of the
cliff to the ground, the

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.260
change in distance is
minus 500 meters.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.250
And minus, based on our
convention, we said minus is

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.990
down, so the change is 500
meters down, and that's height

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.380
of the cliff.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.370
That's pretty interesting.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:08:04.160
If you go to a 500 meter cliff--
500 is about 1,500

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.960
feet-- so that's roughly the
size of maybe a very tall

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.480
skyscraper, like the
World Trade Center

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.440
or the Sears Tower.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.860
If you jump off of something
like that, assuming no air

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.930
resistance, which is a big
assumption, or if you were to

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.110
drop a penny-- because a penny
has very little air

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.330
resistance-- if you were to drop
a penny off of the top of

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.800
Sears Tower or a building like
that, at the bottom it will be

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.600
going 100 meters per second.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.130
That's extremely fast, and
that's why you shouldn't be

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.520
doing it, because that is fast
enough to kill somebody, and I

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.830
don't want to give you any bad
ideas if you're a bad person.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.710
It's just interesting that
physics allows you to solve

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.950
these types of problems.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.760
In the next presentation, I'm
just going to keep doing

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.090
problems, and hopefully you'll
realize that everything really

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.880
just boils down to average
velocity-- change in velocity

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.830
is acceleration times time,
and change in distance is

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:03.380
equal to change in time times
average velocity, which we all

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.180
did just now.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.940
I'll see you in the
next presentation.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.900
