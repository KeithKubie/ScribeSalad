00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.170
I've got this source of a wave
right here that's moving to

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.150
the right at some velocity.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.510
So let's just say that the
velocity of the source-- let's

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.460
call it v sub s to the right--
so we're really going to do

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.180
what we do in the last video,
but we're going to do it in

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.630
more abstract terms so we can
come up with a generalized

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.160
formula for the observed
frequency.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.190
So that's how fast he's moving
to the right, and he's

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.400
emitting a wave. Let's say the
wave that he's emitting-- so

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.930
the velocity of wave--
let's call that v

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.270
sub w radially outward.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.510
We've got to give a magnitude
and a direction.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.760
So radially outward.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.660
That's the velocity of the wave,
and that wave is going

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.950
to have a period and a
frequency, but it's going to

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.550
have a period and a frequency
associated from the point of

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.630
view of the source.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.515
And we're going to
do everything.

00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:02.840
This is all classical
mechanics.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.959
We're not going to be talking
about relativistic speed, so

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.580
we don't have to worry about all
of the strange things that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.580
happen as things approach
the speed of light.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.670
So let's just say it has
some period of-- let me

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.130
write it this way.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.220
The source period, which is the
period of the wave from

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.890
the perspective of the source,
so the source period, we'll

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.850
call it t sub source, And the
source frequency, which would

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.400
just be-- we've learned,
hopefully it's intuitive now--

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.900
would be the inverse of this.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.790
So the source frequency would
be-- we'll call it f sub s.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.960
And these two things are the
inverse of each other.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.300
The inverse of the period
of a wave is its

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.060
frequency, vice versa.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.010
So let's think about what's
going to happen.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.930
Let's say at time equal zero,
he emits that first crest,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.430
that first pulse, so he's
just emitted it.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.540
You can't even see it because
it just got emitted.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.020
And now let's fast forward
t seconds.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.695
Let's say that this is in
seconds, so every t seconds,

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:09.410
it emits a new pulse.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.970
First of all, where is
that first pulse

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.800
after t sub s seconds?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.170
Well, you multiply the velocity
of that first pulse

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.650
times the time.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.780
Velocity times time is going
to give you a distance.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.200
If you don't believe me, I'll
show you an example.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.980
If I tell you the velocity is 5
meters per second, and let's

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.850
say that this period is 2
seconds, that's going to give

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.340
you 10 meters.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.580
The seconds cancel out.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.230
So to figure out how far that
wave will have gone after t

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.090
sub s seconds, you just multiply
t sub s times the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.830
velocity of the wave.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.160
And let's say it's
gotten over here.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.960
It's radially outward.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.080
So, I'll draw it radially
outward.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.690
That's my best attempt
at a circle.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.080
And this distance right here,
this radius right there, that

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.140
is equal to velocity
times time.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.780
The velocity of that first
pulse, v sub w, that's

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.510
actually the speed.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.630
I'm saying it's v sub
w radially outward.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.800
This isn't a vector quantity.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.750
This is just a number
you can imagine.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.450
v sub w times the period,
times t of s.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.780
I know it's abstract, but just
think, this is just the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.300
distance times the time.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.330
If this was moving at 10 meters
per second and if the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.190
period is 2 seconds,
this is how far.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.520
It will have gone 10 meters
after 2 seconds.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.635
Now, this thing we said
at the beginning of

00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:38.100
the video is moving.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.410
So although this is radially
outward from the point at

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.340
which it was emitted, this thing
isn't standing still.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.720
We saw this in the last video.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.690
This thing has also moved.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.540
How far?

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.700
Well, we do the same thing.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.330
We multiply its velocity times
the same number of time.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.770
Remember, we're saying what does
this look like after t

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.230
sub s seconds, or some period
of time t sub s.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.130
Well, this thing is moving
to the right.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.660
Let's say it's here.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.570
Let's say it's moved
right over here.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.470
In this video, we're assuming
that the velocity of our

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.440
source is strictly less than the
velocity of the wave. Some

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.750
pretty interesting things happen
right when they're

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.890
equal, and, obviously, when
it goes the other way.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.860
But we're going to assume that
it's strictly less than.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.150
The source is traveling slower
than the actual wave.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.290
But what is this distance?

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.980
Remember, we're talking
about-- let me do it

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.550
in orange as well.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.650
This orange reality is what's
happened after t sub s

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.160
seconds, you can say.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.360
So this distance right here.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.390
That distance right there--
I'll do it in a different

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.540
color-- is going to be the
velocity of the source.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.350
It's going to be v sub
s times the amount of

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.190
time that's gone by.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.340
And I said at the beginning,
that amount of time is the

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.480
period of the wave. That's
the time in question.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.340
So period of the wave t sub s.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.950
So after one period of the wave,
if that's 5 seconds,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.910
then we'll say, after 5 seconds,
the source has moved

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.800
this far, v sub s times t sub s,
and that first crest of our

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.300
wave has moved that far,
V sub w times t sub s.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300
Now, the time that we're talking
about, that's the

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.270
period of the wave
being emitted.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.810
So exactly after that amount of
time, this guy is ready to

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.960
emit the next crest.
He has gone

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.500
through exactly one cycle.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.390
So he is going to emit
something right now.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.680
So it's just getting emitted
right at that point.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.760
So what is the distance between
the crest that he

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.990
emitted t sub s seconds ago or
hours ago or microseconds ago,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.730
we don't know.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.650
What's the distance between this
crest and the one that

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.210
he's just emitting?

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.600
Well, they're going to move at
the same velocity, but this

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.810
guy is already out here, while
this guy is starting off from

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.260
the source's position.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.530
So the difference in their
distance, at least when you

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.630
look at it this way, is the
distance between the source

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.670
here and this crest.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.740
So what is this distance
right here?

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.790
What is that distance
right there?

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.270
Well, this whole radial
distance, we already said,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.090
this whole radial distance is
v sub w, the velocity of the

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.440
wave, times the period of the
wave from the perspective of

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.170
the source, and we're going to
subtract out how far the

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.540
source itself has moved.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.350
The source has moved in the
direction, in this case, if

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.910
we're looking at it from
this point of view,

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.050
of that wave front.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.140
So it's going to be minus v
sub s, the velocity of the

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.990
source, times the period of the
wave from the perspective

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.340
of the source.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.780
So let me ask you a question.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.900
If you're sitting right here, if
you're the observer, you're

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.730
this guy right here, you're
sitting right over there, and

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.680
you've just had that first
crest, at that exact moment

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.190
that first crest has passed you
by, how long are you going

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.720
to have to wait for
the next crest?

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.520
How long until this one that
this guy's emitting right now

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.010
is going to pass you by?

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.920
Well, it's going to have
to cover this distance.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.750
It's going to have to
cover that distance.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.650
Let me write this down.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.580
So the question I'm asking is
what is the period from the

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.060
point of view of this observer
that's right in the direction

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.320
of the movement of the source?

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.660
So the period from the point
of view of the observer is

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.180
going to be equal to the
distance that the next pulse

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.240
has to travel, which is that
business up there.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.900
So let me copy and paste that.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.390
So it's going to be that.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.150
Let me get rid of that.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.690
It shouldn't look like an equal
sign, so I can delete

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.540
that right over there.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.070
Or a negative sign.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.335
So it's going to be this
distance that the next pulse

00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:42.840
is going to travel, that one
that's going to be emitted

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.260
right at that moment, divided by
the speed of that pulse, or

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.310
the speed of the wave, or the
velocity the wave, and we know

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.400
what that is.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.565
That is v sub w.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.600
Now this gives us the period
of the observation.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:01.770
Now.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.850
If we wanted the frequency-- and
we can manipulate this a

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:04.190
little bit.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.980
Let's do that a little bit.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.940
So we can also write this.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.390
We could factor out the
period of the source.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.630
So t sub s we could
factor out.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:20.440
So it becomes t sub s times the
velocity of the wave minus

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.690
the velocity of the source, all
of that over the velocity

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.230
of the wave. And so just like
that, we've gotten our formula

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.309
for the observed period for this
observer who's sitting

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:38.270
right in the path of this moving
object as a function of

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.270
the actual period of this wave
source, the wave's velocity

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.930
and the velocity
of the source.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.670
Now, if we wanted the frequency,
we just take the

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.140
inverse of this.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.340
So let's do that.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.640
So the frequency of the
observer-- so this is how many

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.630
seconds it takes for him
to see the next cycle.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.110
If you want cycles per second,
you take the inverse.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.880
So the frequency of the observer
is just going to be

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.600
the inverse of this.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.060
So if we take the inverse of
this whole expression, we're

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:07.800
going to get 1 over t sub
s times v sub w over the

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.840
velocity of the wave minus
the velocity the source.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.740
And of course, 1 over the period
from the point of view

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.580
of the source, this
is the same thing.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.840
This right here is the
same thing as the

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.260
frequency of the source.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.070
So there you have it.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.160
We have our two relations.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.010
At least if you are in the path,
if the velocity of the

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.690
source is going in
your direction,

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.310
then we have our formulas.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.190
And I'll rewrite them, just
because the observed period of

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.600
the observer is going to be the
period from the point of

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.060
view of the source times the
velocity of the wave minus the

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.080
velocity of the source-- that's
the velocity of the

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.650
source-- divided by the velocity
of the wave itself.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:51.640
The frequency, from the point
of view of this observer, is

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.560
just the inverse of that,
which is the frequency.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.590
The inverse of the period is the
frequency from the point

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.840
of view of the source times
the velocity of the wave

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.730
divided by the velocity
of the wave minus the

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.450
velocity of the source.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.640
In the next video, I'll do the
exact same exercise, but I'll

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.400
just think about what happens to
the observer that's sitting

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.960
right there.
