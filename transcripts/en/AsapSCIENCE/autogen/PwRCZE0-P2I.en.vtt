00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.219
 Many people buy organic foods in the hope that they will feel healthy 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.220
 And the likelihood of having a positive impact on the environment. 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.860
 But are organic foods better for you and the environment in the first place? 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.000
 For plants, the term organic means basically something that grows without the use of artificial fertilizers or pesticides 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.520
 But this is a little tricky. 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.700
 As you can see, many consumers buy organic materials to avoid all pesticides 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 But the fact is that organic farmers can still use insecticides and fungicides to prevent insects from destroying their crops 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.500
 But provided they are not manufactured artificially. 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.719
 There are more than 20 chemicals approved for organic use in the United States 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.759
 Derived from natural sources such as plants 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.100
 But studies have shown that some natural pesticides are actually more healthily and environmentally hazardous than those made by man. 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.760
 Does not mean that all of them are bad but simply, "normal" does not always mean what is best for you or the environment. 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.040
 Moreover, not all organic foods are fully organic. 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.280
 If the label simply says "organic" it only contains 95% of the organic ingredients 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.300
 If the label says "made of organic ingredients" on products such as bread, which may contain only 70% 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.120
 While "containing organic ingredients" means that it may contain only 50%. 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.880
 When the label says "100% Organic" it contains only organic ingredients. 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 In my opinion, the term "products of uninhibited animals" is also required 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.650
 Only evidence of access to outdoor air for at least 5 minutes per day. Hey! 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.860
 Interestingly, a synthesis analysis was conducted in 2012 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.920
 Organic crop production was found to be 25 percent lower than the conventional ones 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.960
 Despite very different variations between crop types. 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.240
 For example, organic plant crops are usually 33% lower than conventional ones 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.460
 Putting more pressure on the natural environment as long as more agricultural land is required. 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.870
 However, organic legumes are only 5% lower 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.070
 Since they are more efficient in absorbing nitrogen than organic fertilizers 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:01.230
 Certainly, many organic farming practices such as cropping and mixed farming instead of using monoculture are better for soil and the environment. 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.630
 But are they the best for you? 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.370
 After analyzing 237 studies, the researchers concluded that organic fruits and vegetables are not more nutritious than traditionally grown food. 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.890
 However, long-term studies of purely organic diets are difficult 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.340
 Where most people eat a mixture of foods that contain inorganic ingredients. 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.960
 In terms of short-term organic diets, they show higher levels of carotenoids, polyphenols, 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.850
 Vitamin C and E, harmful cholesterol, antioxidant activity, signs of the immune system 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.540
 The semen quality is higher than ever before. But the differences are clinically slim. 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.920
 Children who have been placed in organic diets for 10 days have lower levels of organic phosphate in urine 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.780
 Which are associated with higher concentrations with neurological problems 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.520
 But both levels are orders of magnitude less than the amount needed to cause clinical damage 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.400
 Just because the thing is organic, it does not make it better. 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.800
 A bag of organic chips, for example, is still just a fried carbohydrate with very little nutritional value. 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.220
 What is most surprising is that organic foods have a higher rate of being dangerous. 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.040
 Although organic foods represent only 1% of farmland or area 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.060
 But they account for 7% of food units recalled in 2015. 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.520
 This year, for example, many flavors of CLIF plates were recalled from stores 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:23.100
 Because organic sunflower seeds are potentially contaminated with listeria, a type of bacteria that kills hundreds in the United States each year. 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.580
 Another study found coliform picteria in 10% of organic products, compared with 2% in traditional ones. 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.760
 The truth is, eating organic foods can be good for you, and sometimes it is better for the environment. 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.300
 But this is not important. 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.940
 Production methods vary greatly for both organic and traditional foods, from farm to farm 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.280
 Or from local farms to factory farms 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.490
 And they are most likely a combination of methods that will lead to the greatest results for your health and the environment. 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.240
 Organic and traditional foods can coexist and do not have to conflict with each other. 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.400
 Anyone who tells you 100% sure that one way is better than the other is ignoring science. 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.290
 When it comes to your health, they are really a combination of diet 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.930
 Exercise and other different lifestyles and, of course, your genetic genes. Translation: team translate autrjim @
