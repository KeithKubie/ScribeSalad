00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.050
It wasn't that long ago that computers
were these strange things you

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.210
put in a separate room.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.240
You loaded software on them from
something you got in the mail and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.330
you printed the output on paper.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.220
They were clearly abstract tools for
uncommon tasks.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.820
&gt;&gt; Nowadays, all these devices
talk to each other and to use.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.930
They're part of our daily lives,
and provide all sorts of value.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.460
&gt;From looking at movie
times to calling a taxi or

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.927
talking face to face with
a friend across the globe.

00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:29.070
&gt;&gt; &gt; And yet, much of how we interact
with computers is still abstract and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.960
specific to the device at hand.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.900
In fact, many people view the future
of computing as devices everywhere,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.020
floating screens, animated graphics
on every surface, cats and

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.750
dogs living together, pandemonium.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.210
&gt;&gt; But that's not what we
mean by ubiquitous computing

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.980
because it's not the device or the app
that's the most interesting thing here.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.790
The most interesting thing is solving
real problems for real people, and

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.670
then providing that solution anywhere
and everywhere they'd want or need it.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.150
That's what we mean by
truly ubiquitous computing.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.770
&gt;&gt; When we build for

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.970
real people, technology doesn't become
more visible, it becomes less visible.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.950
It blends into our lives and freezes
from learning obscure ways of doing

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.140
things, so that we can focus more on
what we're doing not how we're doing it.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.890
&gt;&gt; We hope you've fun learning
the design principles and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.290
building blocks for these new form
factors as we've had teaching them.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.230
&gt;&gt; Now, go out and make the world
an even cooler place to live in.
