00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.600
This work, Analogia, is by an Argentine

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.170
artist named Victor Grippo who was a very

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.860
important artist within the late 60s,

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.509
70s, into 80s in Argentina.

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.539
Having a work of art that has fresh

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.789
produce in the gallery is something that

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.159
requires constant vigilance, obviously

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.630
when you care for works of art you don't

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.509
want mold, pretty much every three weeks

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.370
we have to change out the potatoes and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.560
put new potatoes in, unlike a painting

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.910
that hangs on the wall and you just make

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.160
sure there's no dust and no one runs

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.720
into it, this really requires us to

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.270
really be on top of its wear and care

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.240
and the work analogy was one that was

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.670
created during a moment in Argentina's

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.290
history that was extremely complicated

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.990
politically; people had few freedoms,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.810
censorship, and quite frankly brutality

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.990
was actually the norm. What he's doing

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.610
is taking that very basic scientific

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.490
principle of energy being created by a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.350
potato which is of course the most basic

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.840
foodstuff, but what he meant was we are

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.370
all connected to each other

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.990
I mean, although each potato as people

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.610
said looks like it's imprisoned in this

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.220
box in fact it's each person in their

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.800
own place actually connects to his

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.720
neighbor and the wires creating the energy

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.500
are part of that; push the button and you

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.750
can activate it basically, create the

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.140
energy so this idea of community, despite

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.120
the oppressive regime, was something he

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.979
was actually very hopefully expressing

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:33.909
through science.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.340
We try in this gallery to give a sense of

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.110
so much of what was happening in the

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.390
world because it was a moment that was

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.520
absolutely extraordinary. Grippo

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.520
represents both the socio-political as

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.950
well as a materialistic example of what

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.210
was happening in the 60s in the

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.720
art world.
