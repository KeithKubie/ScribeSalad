1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
In the game of Thrones people,
dragons.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,450
Those aren't real drag and that's dope
as fuck. Did you watch last night?

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,990
I didn't. I did. Was it good?
Spoiler alert. It was awesome.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,690
It was awesome just to see everything.
I just want to see it.

5
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:17,280
I just was happy to see a new episode.

6
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm going to be so sad when that
show gets canceled. I'm such a Dork.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,600
You've watched it all the way up and about
doing the prequel or the beginning of

8
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:25,920
it for serious,

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,130
but they haven't [inaudible] whoever
the fuck people are that are doing it.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,570
You just keep doing things.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,350
Whoever those people that are writing
and producing it and putting it together

12
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:36,840
and and keep hiring those actors to
play different people. I don't care.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,650
I lost my way after like maybe three
seasons. How many seasons does it been on?

14
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:42,750
Like five. Fuck up. You lost your way.

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:47,340
Go back and start from scratch and learn
all the names of these places in the

16
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:52,120
make believe thing.
[inaudible] and the whatevers.

17
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,130
How much do I have to know Joe? I
know, but you know how to make bread.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,090
Just keep making it delicious bread.
I do. And you're doing simple.

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,480
A Martini. A little bread. A little run
and live your life. Yeah, we'll jog.

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,880
How much, why do I have to top five?
Do I have to control everything?

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,830
I would like to nef oh,
catch back up with it. Yeah,

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,920
it's good. Right? People like it.

23
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:19,050
So you're going to like let this whole
season play by without you being caught

24
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:23,790
up. I F I almost last night was just
going to watch, just jump, jump in.

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,030
Who cares if I was there
any show that you never get?

26
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:31,890
Like please tell me you gave up on the
walking dead. Yes. Thank you. Yeah,

27
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,030
I stopped that one.

28
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:37,320
Is there any show that you haven't
given up on that you've been steadfast?

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,570
That I stay whatever you binge. They
still watch? Uh, you haven't quit?

30
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,920
No, there's none that I'm currently
watching. I just watched Russian doll.

31
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,610
What does that, it's on Netflix. That
was good. Like an assassin or something.

32
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,380
Now she's, she's uh, she dies every
episode. It's like groundhog day.

33
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,700
Yeah, it was pretty good. And, uh,
no, I've seen all the big ones.

34
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,360
I don't know who's arc.
Ozark IA. One season of it.

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,840
You didn't watch season
two now was I supposed to?

36
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,390
I don't know how you just shut it off.
You don't want to know what happened.

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,830
I don't know.
I forget.
