00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:01.865
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what else can my

00:00:01.865 --> 00:00:05.040
23andM report tell me besides ancestry information?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.380
&gt;&gt; Well, one thing that I'd like to go and look at

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.355
next is to see what your DNA says about some of your traits.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.452
&gt;&gt; Okay. So where am I going to go to look at my traits?

00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:17.240
&gt;&gt; All right, so go up to My Results menu.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.940
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.540
&gt;&gt; And under there you'll see Traits and just click on the Traits. All right.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, cool.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.220
&gt;&gt; So here's a long list of traits,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.790
but as an example what I'd like to

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.620
focus on first is the report on lactose intolerance.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.710
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.110
&gt;&gt; and here's a column with stars and that, the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.833
number of stars there reflects how strong the science behind the report is. Not,

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:45.920
not, not so much, you know, your particular result, but how if,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.670
if the scientific literature is really

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.330
supportive of, of the connection between DNA

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.090
and, and the trait. Okay, scrolling down it looks

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.550
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.820
&gt;&gt; So lactose intolerance

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.270
&gt;&gt; So there's some background here on

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.480
lactose intolerance and then here are your results.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.940
&gt;&gt; It says I'm likely to be tolerant.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.910
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.360
&gt;&gt; Due to lactase persistence and.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.220
&gt;&gt; So you have your're homozygous for the A allele.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:18.650
&gt;&gt; that's the critical SNV here and you share that with your dad.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.040
Your dad also has two copies of the A, so this means you got an

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.928
A from your dad and an A from your mother. and having two copies there

00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:29.763
is, is making it most likely, according

00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:33.489
to the scientific literature, that you are going

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:39.260
to be tolerant of lactose and able to drink, continue to drink milk as an adult.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.715
&gt;&gt; I see and I notice here too that I'll be lactose tolerant

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:46.930
because I'm lactase persistent. And it looks like even if I

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.960
have only one A then I'm still lactase persistent, so can

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.140
you tell us if the A allele promotes lactase persistence even

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.410
in the heterozygous state. Is the A allele dominant or recessive?
