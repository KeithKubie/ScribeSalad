00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.610
 wilson net marin 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.469
 the team sees it by google launches 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.330
 and today's episode let's see how 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.350
 add action bar in your application 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.539
 android and tuning what is chumbar is a 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.519
 navigation pattern that will allow 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.699
 in all the screens you have a space 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.220
 reserved to show the user and items 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.820
 navigation and also some identity 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.469
 your application, but because 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.250
 had to use in-app crash 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.660
 android 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.969
 the first thing because the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.360
 most used navigation from your 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.730
 appearance on android 3.0 also because 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 becomes a dedicated space to give a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.780
 your app's visual identity and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.820
 also indicate to the user where it 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.199
 is that exact moment 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.680
 we have to think he's going to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.390
 important actions of your team and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.789
 thus allowing them to be accessed 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.739
 intuitively 50 you think a lot 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.769
 He will find what he has to do. 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.390
 screen and also clear how we spoke 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.150
 that it is well used with parents 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.340
 navigation and will offer support 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.299
 consistent with its epe and in relation 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.189
 operational system 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.500
 so the sun is already accustomed to seeing 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.570
 this type of navigation pattern in the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.450
 wet now then a classic example 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.540
 of the action bar was here in the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.880
 to the air navigation reserved for 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.950
 from navigation and we have on the right 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.930
 the actions that your application will take 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.119
 for each screen you can also have 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.820
 some actions on the bottom that the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.920
 split action bar case do not fit on top 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.009
 or has a smaller screen that is like some 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.570
 previously used versions of gmail 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.610
 Let's have a look at the left part. 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.130
 where are you seeing here this minor 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.720
 I think this is the smallest he can 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 to be empty in the truth that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.369
 mainly in the home or the screen 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.290
 application, it may have 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.450
 this sign of less than in Argentina the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.090
 diap navigation that when you are taken 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.369
 by a hierarchically superior screen 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.710
 until August at the moment example a screen 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.899
 details with a list screen 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.050
 for example and then we have here 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.870
 these three lists where it is to indicate the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.819
 droid layout that drawer 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.530
 that boy who comes from the left to 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.060
 and has been used by many 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.730
 android apps 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.140
 well then we have the icon that is one thing 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.450
 you have to pay close attention to your 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.250
 application that is a detail that is the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.319
 visual identity of your application 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.079
 can bennett explore a boat then 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.720
 try to avoid this, people are not 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.819
 cool to have an empty part he's in 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.000
 white in your action will then try 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.220
 avoid this is normal the default is the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.959
 use icon 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.030
 since you have invested heavily in your 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.879
 icon is identity duty only goes 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.709
 understand where you are in your app and 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.930
 you also have the option of using the logo 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.000
 if you have a logo that has the name 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.680
 application, or what gives you the most 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.720
 speed for you as the case of the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.370
 youtube also you can use 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.379
 just do not forget that soon to be a little 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.180
 the bigger one ends up taking up a little space 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.609
 in the navigation part 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.709
 then I'll close pages linking us 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.480
 We have the part where you will choose 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.220
 some way some other form of 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.870
 Navigation, come on, have a look. 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.819
 so bet on an isp ner that 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.280
 As you click on it, you can 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.900
 choose from multiple views such as 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.310
 example the google plan can only choose 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.919
 the circles 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.410
 I can have a title the screen title 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.590
 the application name is something that 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.389
 Identify is that moment I can have 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.430
 the tags also that we will see this 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.069
 in another episode where you will power 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.919
 organize your app's tags and 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.049
 also last but not least 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.359
 supports in the layout itself as per 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.359
 example black clouds on google drive 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.530
 that give the notion to the user in which folder 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.449
 from google drive 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.639
 he is in that good moment we go 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.319
 pass a share of actions here I have 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.079
 here are some icons that we call 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.849
 action items in this case I can 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.609
 use an icon 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.019
 the context icon or just the text you 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.569
 You have to choose which one looks better on your 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.519
 application is reminding 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.099
 I upload the minute as I click it there 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.139
 can give an option of other actions 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.199
 that item you clicked 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:16.049
 or even if you press and 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:18.720
 a tip that he who suddenly makes a 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.190
 specific training icon that is not 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.890
 so intuitive of canton has left 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.020
 impress and see if you have any tips 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.760
 After that you can also have some 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.830
 elements that it 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.170
 formed when they are actuated here is 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.640
 seeing the refresh case when she asks 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.650
 to upgrade and becomes an icon 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.860
 animated to indicate the user is 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.720
 some action or even some 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.640
 actions where I click on the search case is 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.940
 very common and he already had 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.010
 right in the box to search without 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.480
 need to go to another screen, right? 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.320
 so you already have to save space 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.690
 in its trunk and also here in part of the 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.060
 boss would check where we are here 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.790
 asking boss actions can use 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.710
 this option and when it clicks it opened - in 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.630
 there of the share options that have 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.290
 available to the user all this 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.090
 talking about actions in action a bar 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:12.360
 then we have to finally the menu 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.800
 or overflow boy is that we 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.540
 people in some articles that talk about 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.670
 goodbye that menu key that many 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.060
 We do not even have the 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.820
 menu physics so it will have there actions 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.340
 which are not so frequent and common 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.370
 your application and this case shows well 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.320
 For example, there are chaos 70 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.670
 settings or help 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.490
 are themes like time is no longer 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.960
 entering but it has an easy way to 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.030
 find this screen there 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.640
 now that you already know what it is 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.680
 steal and its main features 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.870
 let's see how to add it application 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.060
 android just a note that we are going 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.830
 consider the use of the 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.050
 remembers that you can then use 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.980
 action on by in previous applications to 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.870
 version 3 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.310
 Okay, so I had to create a 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:02.340
 class that extends from action activity 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.210
 then you will use or extend one of the 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.750
 themes 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.850
 tm point is that shares plaza tivit tem 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.330
 up to an example of how you will use 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.370
 this theme in your optics and there 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.580
 by default the system will use the 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.480
 icon of your app as a reference 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.670
 from chumbar 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.140
 if you want to use me the logo when 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.120
 We were explaining it now. 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.780
 you will have to use the attribute 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.450
 logo or application or on active 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.540
 yes action on will use the logo 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.950
 instead of the icon a look in the code 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.470
 to see in practice how this 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.420
 sequence that I just explained I 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.300
 I'm watching here I called 20 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.150
 is extending from action bar tite 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.530
 remembering the support hare 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.210
 but besides doing this it has to 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.220
 set up that I had to use the theme 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.550
 correct and this will then 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.270
 that you are here and here in the 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.640
 android tm 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.070
 in the case all looking directly at tm 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.010
 point is shared light 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.200
 you could use another theme inside 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.630
 space cinema or estenter create a 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.360
 theme your little boy then like 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.940
 is running on the device 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.230
 I have here so Edson goes demo with 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.930
 the default icon that did not win, and 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.150
 and I have here on the left the 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.430
 if the referendum were to be used 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.310
 this here is a more basic example 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.690
 simple to use to hit you 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.130
 noticed that the bar with a 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.320
 Bit empty, right? 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.240
 let's now how to add some 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.520
 items to your ex a bar 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.410
 you have to know is that the system will 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.860
 be a method a client menu options 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.610
 who will popular his bar with the seven 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.770
 items 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:45.010
 this is done what this method is going to 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.140
 inflate 11 menu file that will be 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.420
 in the part of services that goes then 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.490
 put the action and items in one place 

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.800
 good correspondent we are seeing here a 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.050
 example of a menu file where 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.180
 in this case an action sert 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.830
 It's there we know it's going to go 

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:04.330
 make an action the item that has the option 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:06.280
 and f 2.0 chan is called the action 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.450
 exactly speaking that this item is a 

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:11.710
 action item and that is the 

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.180
 compatibility with the 

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.400
 previous android because society 

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.130
 did not exist then let's define this 

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.500
 namespace of your application and there 

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:23.020
 yes not to have problem with compilation 

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.390
 good xml 

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.280
 after that I have to implement the 

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.340
 method a client menu options tap 

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:33.400
 screen that shows using the service - 

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.380
 a flyer making the influent of the file 

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:39.010
 that in the case that I called man 

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:41.440
 activity actions touch and return the menu 

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.420
 who has been inflated a patient bar goes 

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.190
 set your items 

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.350
 after that you have to treat when the 

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.420
 user clicks on one of the items for this 

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.820
 you will implement the options method 

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.560
 select item that it is called with 

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.110
 drinks selected 

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.600
 you go 

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.310
 Finishing was selected and range 

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.620
 instance of menu item that is passed 

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:03.110
 as a parameter executing jet method and 

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.630
 There you have it after that you have identified 

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:08.420
 and you have selected you perform the action 

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.579
 that you want a nomad then in the 

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.130
 implemented method where I make a 

00:09:10.579 --> 00:09:16.100
 switch exactly lisandro ghetti there you are 

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:20.300
 of the item was passed as parameter and 

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:22.010
 if it's a 717 case I'll do a search if 

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.470
 for peace action with landing 

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:27.410
 I do another action here and with this 

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.430
 I'll correctly handle the click on the 

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.220
 action or item 

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.079
 let's look at how it would look in code 

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.000
 this sequence of instructions that people 

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:38.120
 just show I have to first 

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.519
 the client options menu where I will do the 

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.829
 influence of the menu file and in 

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:45.079
 case or activity actions that will have 

00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:47.570
 so the items looking here in this 

00:09:45.079 --> 00:09:49.700
 file I have in the case two items o 

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.170
 first seven years that will never be 

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.240
 displayed with the action the item so that 

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.310
 the show as action as never like me 

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.709
 I spoke about situations that are not constant and 

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.839
 your application 

00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:02.060
 search action and put as show 

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:05.750
 Edson Alves or is always going to be 

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:07.670
 present in the action father then with you 

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.070
 then put the user click here 

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.560
 in our tivit I have argument 

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:15.860
 options item select that receives the same 

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.920
 item and then I do that is a point item 

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.930
 get the through a switch and in the case and 

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:25.430
 I checked the option that was you were from 

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:27.440
 7 or if it was 7 months and then take action 

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:30.459
 according to what the eyes selected 

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:33.620
 With that, you guys can already 

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:35.899
 use action multiple action items in 

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.910
 your android app in the next 

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:40.040
 videos we will present some 

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.380
 additional resources to further improve 

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:46.630
 more the user experience on your 

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.630
 application we will see the next debates
