00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920
next project is because it's possible
 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.550
next project is because it's possible
that it could be unbreakable so he

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560
that it could be unbreakable so he
 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.170
that it could be unbreakable so he
