I promise you the dawn is coming
one day the Batman will have to answer

00:15:40.499 --> 00:15:40.509
one day the Batman will have to answer
 

00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:43.499
one day the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken but to us not

00:15:43.499 --> 00:15:43.509
for the laws he's broken but to us not
 

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:46.290
for the laws he's broken but to us not
to this madman
