00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.370
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good evening.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.090
Welcome. Thanks for coming
to The Printed Instrument.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.980 position:56%
Tonight's panel presentation is part

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.490
of our Technofiles miniseries
exploring how technology influences

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.570
the ways we create, perform
and experience music.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.620
I'm Anne McLean from the
Library's music division.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.300
It's great for us to have such a
varied audience for this tonight

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.310
where we look at this
exploding field

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.280
of 3D manufacture and
reality computing.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.530 position:56%
And, just for curiosity, how many of
people in the audience are involved

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.270
with the field in some way?

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.570
Anybody? Yeah, a few.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.870
You know, great.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.570
Great. This is a vast and
exponentially growing universe,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.470 position:56%
really an ecosystem of technologies.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.810
Our speakers this evening will
be showcasing a variety of ways

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.210
in which the convergence

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.930
of this fascinating ecosystem
is creating new design

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.540
and restoration possibilities for
music creating and restoration.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.300
We'll start out with the path
connecting the world of 3D

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.430 position:56%
with music, an introduction to the
field from journalist Andrew Wheeler

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.290
and an quick, intriguing
overview from Tatjana Dzambazova

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.130
who is a technology whisperer
and Product Manager at Autodesk.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.890
Her current project there is the
Momento program empowering artists,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.940
scientists, curators, and
others to tell their stories

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.270
through the digitization
of capture reality.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.810
Robert Howe is a physician and
oboist currently associated

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.840
with the PhD program at
University of Connecticut at Storrs

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.550
and is interested in the study
and replication of early versions

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.170
of the oboe and saxophone.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.570
And, you have a treat in store.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.290
I won't say what that is.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.850
Eric Goldemburg is the cofounder
of MONAD Studio, a design

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.540
and research architecture
firm based in Miami.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.870
You may have seen some of his very
sculptural instruments in the press

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.540
over the past few months.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.800
His colleague Scott Hall on the end
will demonstrate a new 3D guitar

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.560
that they have designed together.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.220
He's an artist, a sculptor,
also an animator and musician.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.490
So, let me turn this over
to Andrew for a fascinating,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.600
very state of the technology
look at music in 3D.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.510
&gt;&gt; Andrew Wheeler: Thank you.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.220
[ Applause ]

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.520
Everybody hear me?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.240
Is that good?

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.930
All right.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.890
Let's start with a quote.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.590
Victor Hugo wrote, "Music expresses
that which cannot be said and on

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.130
which it, on which it is
impossible to be silent."

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.960
It's a real thrill for
me to be speaking here

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.950
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.350
You can see there in a
nice sketch up 3D model.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.500
This isn't the exact
building, of course, but.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.130
My name is Andrew Wheeler.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.430
I'm a journalist.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.360
My beat is 3D technology.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.010
For the last two years, I've been
covering technologies focused

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.930
around capturing reality, working
with spatial data, and using data

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.380
to interact with and
influence the physical world.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.080
I was very pleased and
surprised to receive a phone call

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.740
from Anne McLean to help
put together this edition

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.040
of Technofiles.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.430
I had just covered a story about
a 3D printed piezoelectric violin

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.520
from MONAD Studios that looked
like the type of instruments one

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.580
of H.R. Giger's monsters would
play as it watched the world burn.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.750
There it is.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.050
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.750
&gt;&gt; Anne and I started
talking about the ways

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.410
in which these technologies
are being used

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.010
to create fascinating possibilities

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.200
in very interesting
musical projects.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.560
We both knew the amazing work
being done at the University

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.770
of Connecticut using a combination
of computed tomography scans,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.800
3D software, and 3D printing.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.920
Bringing rare and sometimes
damaged instruments back

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.380
to life is an ongoing story

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.180
which you'll hear more
about from Dr. Howe.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.990
I also just began working on,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.790
with Autodesk on high level
concept called Reality Computing.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.310
This is real 2016 shameless
plug happening March 8th

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.000
and 9th in San Francisco.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.560
I knew form their amazing software

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.120
and many interesting cultural
projects including building an

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.440
online virtual tour of the
Smithsonian's collection,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.860
that they would definitely
have something great

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.620
to contribute to this panel.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.380
While we were brainstorming on the
phone one day, I began to think

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.150
about the relationship
between musicians

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.220
and the inventors of
musical instruments.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.740
I think it stems from an early
fascination I have with inventors.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.770
After all, I knew who
created the light bulb.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.800
Bing. I learned who created the
AC motor and enabled AC power.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.430
Bing. And, but it occurred to me
that I had never even wondered

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.900
about who invented the piano.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.410
It was the first instrument I was
lucky enough to take lessons on.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.710
Thanks, Dad.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.510
Right there.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.390
[ Laughter ]

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.620
But, I never thought
about who invented it.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.840
Right? It's a strange
thing to think about.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.510
So, then I, then I tried to
imagine an alternate universe

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.900
where the piano was never invented.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.150
I thought about things like,
well, what would Beethoven's

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.580
"Moonlight Sonata"
have sounded like,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.620
and how would it have
been delivered?

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.800
I guess maybe by harpsichord
or a string quartet.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.180
But, then a [inaudible]
notion popped into my head.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.890
I said, "Would Beethoven
have invented it at all?"

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.310
And, I think he would have,
but it was a striking question

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.030 position:56%
that got right to the heart of an
interesting and more profound query.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.550
At what points in history did newly
invented instruments find their way

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.250
into the hands of the
nominally talented musicians?

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.100
How did musicians of Beethoven's
caliber react to a new instrument?

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.660
How did Jimi Hendrix react
when he first got his hands

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.580
on a Fender Stratocaster?

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.700
Where are these encounters in
history, and were the inventors

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.650
of musical instruments
musicians themselves?

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.810
If we try to trace the evolution
of musical instruments back

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.980
to their origins, we sometimes
lose the trail of where they come

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.770
from and who invented them.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.190
The same thing happens
with music itself.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.910 position:56%
For all the tones written about
musical instruments in music theory,

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.980
the origins of music are
still relatively unknown.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.010
Now, I imagined a bunch of
early homo sapiens listening

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.380
to all the sounds of nature
and trying to imitate them.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.360
After all, we still have
hunters using animal calls.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.630
Except now, they aren't
required to perfect them vocally.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.480
They can just walk out in the
woods with a Bluetooth speaker,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.400
press play, hide, and
wait for the kill.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.940
Takes no talent.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.940
And, today, a talented
vocalist sells out stadiums,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.460
but maybe back then, a
talented vocalist could mimic

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.830
and consistently attract prey.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:14.370 position:56%
In the beginning, did music help,
did music evolve to help us survive,

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.530
or was it a way to
communicate with gods?

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.900
Hunting rituals, harvest
rituals, spiritual rituals,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.050
these are all possible explanations
for why music came to exist.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.410
But, in the end, no one
knows where music comes from.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.790
And, it turns out that the
historical relationship

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.440
between makers and musicians is
similarly difficult to trace,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.460
but there's one fantastic
example of a maker

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.310
and musician who's virtuosity

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.430
and inventiveness changed
the world of music forever.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.990
Pantaleon Hebenstreit was employed
as a violinist, keyboard musician,

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.680
and dance instructor in Leipzig.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.260
He constructed, developed, and
mastered a unique, enlarged version

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.990
of the hammered dulcimer in 1697.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.680
In 1705, he traveled to
France, and created a sensation

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.520
with his unique instrument
and playing.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.230
Louis XIV was so astonished
by his performance

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.370
and the instrument
itself that he ordered it

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.150
to be called the Pantaleon
from then on.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.230
This was quite an anomaly
at the time

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.430
because the hammered keyboard
instruments were not nearly

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.340
as popular as plucked
string keyboard instruments.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.240
The harpsichord enjoyed huge
popularity in the Baroque Period,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.500
but by 1709, an Italian harpsichord
maker named Bartolomeo Cristofori

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.750
thought it was time to
update the harpsichord.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.450
He published a remarkable design

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.290
of what eventually would
become the pianoforte.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.040
The keyboard design principle
was the same, but his series

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.130
of hammers striking the strings
rather than plucking them opened

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.130
up a whole new range
of possibilities

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.930
for composers and performers.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.090 position:56%
This changed, this transformed music
performance and composition forever.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.310
And, those conceived and
born in Italy, it was,

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.220
the piano was developed over
the next four years in Germany.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.570
The famous organ builder
Gottfried Silbermann went

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.520
through several iterations
of a grand piano with a vocal

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.880
and harsh critic named
Johann Sebastian Bach

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.720
who preferred his organs.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.790
Now, a remarkable innovation
to the piano

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.440
by a maker named Johann Andreas
Stein caught the attention

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.460
of another musical luminary.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:38.740 position:56%
In a letter to his father written in
1777, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.620
"His instruments distinguish
themselves by an escapement.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.030
Not one in a hundred makers
troubles himself about that,

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.320
but without an escapement, a
piano clatters and leaves a sound.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.680 position:56%
When one presses the keys, his
hammers fall down in the very moment

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.030
in which they bounce
against the string,

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.170
whether one holds the
key down or releases it."

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:05.770
In 1821, Sebastian Erard invented
the double escapement action

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:10.460
which incorporated a repetition
lever, also called a balancier,

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.610
that permitted repeating a note
even if the key had not yet risen

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.150
to its maximum vertical position.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.400
This facilitated rapid
playing of repeated notes,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.930
a musical device exploited
by Franz Liszt.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.790
When the invention became
public as revised by Henri Herz,

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.150
the double escapement action
gradually became standard

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.860
in grand pianos and
is still incorporated

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.210
into all grand pianos
currently produced.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.300
Still, no one knows
where music comes from,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.240
but it is a clear example
of a musician

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.530
who invented his own
instrument, performed on it,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.120
and inspired the creation of one

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.380
of the most popular
instruments of all time.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.480
Tonight, we have musicians
and makers from MONAD studios

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.540
and the University of Connecticut
as well as a trained architect

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.170
and technology whisperer who
believes in the power of technology

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.650
to help people of all
disciplines and ages find, express,

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.940
and amplify their own creativity.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.450
But, before we hear from them,
I want to take a few minutes

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.630
to introduce you to the technology
that is empowering musicians,

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.370
artists, architects,
and everyone else

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.650
to create their own
printed instruments.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:30.560
All right.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.460
Exhibit A, Concordia University
student Caleb Loughlin.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.560
Now, Caleb, Caleb wanted
an electric guitar.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.410
He could not afford it.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.600
So, he leveraged the
university system,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.640
enrolled in a technology course
to gain access to the 3D printer,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.280
and he downloaded STL
files off the internet.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.720 position:56%
He printed four pieces of an
electric guitar body, added strings,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.930
wiring, and a neck, and he had a
fully functioning electric guitar

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.480
made with finishing
processes in 24 hours.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.510
He also turned it in and
got an A, by the way.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.210
[ Laughter ]

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.310
Next up, we've a 3D
printed metallophone.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.430
Now, metallophones are
notoriously difficult

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.230
to create even by traditional
methods.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.380
And, this was a project that
involved research from Colombia,

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.540
MIT, Harvard, and Disney Research.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.260
I don't really know who's
involved there, but.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.760
The point was, they wanted to, they
wanted to create a metallophone

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.700
that was shaped like
animals, and they did it.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.410
And, it was called, they
called it the zoolophone.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.780
Good name, I guess.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.280
This is probably the toughest
saxophone of all time.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.780
The guys from Industrial
Technological Research Institute

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:56.980
in Taiwan 3D printed this saxophone
from Titanium which is remarkable,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.300
and the printer they used
was originally marketed

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.780 position:56%
for jewelry manufacturing, but it
actually prints to, I think it's 50,

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.120
50 microns or the width
of a human hair.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.770
Very fine, very remarkable.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.610
I'm not here to sort of cheerlead
3D printing all the way though.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.240
If you actually see metal
3D printing in action,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.730
it takes quite a lot of sort
of traditional band sawing

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.820
and machining to actually
remove it from the build plate.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.770
So, it's not just, you
know, it's not a catch all.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.780
It's not, not that easy.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:34.380
Next, we have 3D printed
Indian tabla drums.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.400
So, this is interesting because you
have a new technology being used

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.220
to create a very old instrument,

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:46.890
and this instrument traces
back to around 200 BC.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.750
Next example is this.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.180
These guys are here.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.030
This is MONAD Studios
Hornucopian Dronepipe,

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.960
and this is a really
interesting example

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.250
because it shows really
what 3D software

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.220
and 3D printing can do together
which is open up the field entirely

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.380
to creating new instruments
which I thought was a very,

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.680
sort of, interesting idea.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.980
And, that doesn't mean
you can't do it

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:15.520
with traditional methods,
but look at that thing.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.680
It looks like a black wave being,
like, thrown over his shoulder.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.610
We'll have a performance
from Scott later tonight.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.110
Okay, god.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.210
3D printed electric violin.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.180
So, this guy calls
it a 3Dvarius, right?

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:37.270 position:56%
His name is Laurant Bernadac, and
he spent years iterating in software

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.130
and 3D printing which is
another fascinating sort of use

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.890
that you could probably apply
if you're a maker of, you know,

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.420 position:56%
instruments in that traditional way.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.500
You could probably apply
that to your practice.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.950
But, anyway, so he designed it over
and over, and what his goal was

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.070 position:56%
to make it sound like a Stradivarius

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:57.230
which is quite a lofty
and insane goal.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.800
And, I heard the sound of it.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.030
Not at all like a Stradivarius.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.040
[ Laughter ]

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.400
But, I applaud him for
trying and, you know,

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.700
wish him luck in the future.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.000
I don't know what else
to say about it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.290
But, it's very cool, and this is
printed with stereolithography.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.010
And, this is a, I'm sure most of
you are familiar with 3D printing

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.730
as fuse deposition modeling which
is the thing that sort of looks

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.850
like a automated glue gun.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.470
Just sort of spits out
plastic in what looks

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.100
like a little toaster oven.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.140
By the way, the technology
in there is all the same.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.460
You got to a 3D printing show, and
it basically looks like you have,

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.380
you know, the same technology in
the Witness Protection Program.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.310
They all have different outsides.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:48.190
Okay. So, in conclusion, we may
not know where music comes from,

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.670 position:56%
but I hope after tonight, we'll have
a better idea of where it's going.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.470
Thank you.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.060
[ Applause ]

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.220
&gt;&gt; Tatjana Dzambazova: So, my
father was a composer, is still,

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.170
and [inaudible] orchestra.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.560
And, I grew up in a house where
we had pretty much every single

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.260
instrument that I never played.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.550
So, tonight, I will not
talk about any of that.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.620
I'll leave the music to those
who understand better than me.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.440
But, I will talk about what
I understand quite well

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.990
which is technology.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.300
And, we'll start with a video
that is quite high level

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.510
and very visionary to kind
of get things started.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:44.040
[ Music ]

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.730
I think that the divide
between what's analog

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:50.040
and what's digital
is starting to merge.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:55.730
Our physical world is so
unimaginably rich in texture

00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.990
and in depth, but until very
recently, our digital experiences

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.040 position:56%
for the most part, have been limited
to flat, 2D impressions of reality.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.450
Today, innovative technologies
like 3D printing, web go,

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:10.810
virtual reality, and augmented
reality are all redefining the ways

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.040
we can experience and
recreate the world around us.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.650
So, what do all of these
revolutionary technologies have

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.950
in common?

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:25.610
They all require high
quality, 3D digital models.

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.040
What does it take to
make a 3D digital model?

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:34.520 position:56%
You can create a model from scratch,
geometrically constructing it

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.440
by extruding and revolving
with nerves,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.800
meshes, [inaudible] and solids.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.490
It's a laborious process
requiring complex software

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.790
and high end knowledge.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:51.970
Alternatively, you can capture
the analog world as it exists.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.300
This can be achieved with
specialized 3D scanners,

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.770
but this type of hardware
is prohibitively expensive

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.070
and also requires immense
technical expertise.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:01.620
Every day, technology's becoming
more accessible and easier to use,

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:08.860 position:56%
but the difficulty of generating
high quality 3D assets has kept this

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.160
trend out of the world
of 3D, until now.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:18.590 position:56%
A new process called photogrammetry
utilizes state of the art algorithms

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.040
to convert regular to default
as directly into 3D data.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.060
With smart sensors that are
now ubiquitous and new software

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.110
that is exceptionally easy
to use, anyone with access

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.240
to a modern smartphone or
a camera can now capture

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:37.040
and create a high quality,
ready to use 3D digital model.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:45.170 position:56%
What stories can be told when we can
all digitize the world around us?

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.200
For artists, being able
to easily capture, modify,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.040
and recreate physical assets opens
up a universe of possibilities.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:56.130
When we can sculpt any object,
environment, or living thing,

00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:00.040
the entire world becomes
clay in our hands.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.180
For marine biologists, it's helping
them better understand the world's

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.040
everchanging oceans.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.860
For the first time ever,
using photogrammetry,

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:14.180
scientist can measure
coral resistance

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.480
with astonishing accuracy.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.790
Not only does this enable
us to document the state

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:26.200
of existing corals, but
with repeated scanning,

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.240
we can actually observe ecological
changes as they happen over time.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.760
The Buddhas of Bamiyan

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.520
in Afghanistan were
glorious sketches carved

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.940
into a massive cliff
over 1000 years ago.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.800
In 2001, they were destroyed
forever when they were dynamited

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.920
in an act of religious extremism.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:50.060
Like so many times in our
history, an invaluable piece

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.040
of human heritage had been lost.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.920
Except, this time, we decided
to search for the lost sketches

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.610
in a place that previously
nobody would have ever thought

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.050
to look, the web.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:09.360
Between Facebook, Flickr, and
Google images, there are thousands

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.530
of photos of the Bamiyan
Buddhas taken by tourists

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.040
through the decades and from
almost every possible angle.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.120
Using photogrammetry and hundreds
of these crowd sourced images,

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:23.640
the team was able to digitally
reconstruct the Bamiyan Buddhas

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.040 position:56%
in a gloriously detailed 3D replica.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.720
One which now celebrates
the story of humanity,

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:37.040 position:56%
of all of us together preserving a
vital legacy for future generations.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:43.190
In the near future, we will be
able to digitize our entire planet

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.490
as it exists in every moment.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.790
This four dimensional impression

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:52.870 position:56%
of our world will enable future
generations to literally scroll back

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.340
and see what was really going
on in this particular part

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.640
of the world at that time.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.810
We'll digitize ourselves
as well, giving our great,

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.000
great grandchildren the chance

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.040
to see us the way we were
when we were their age.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:12.730
By being able to better
document our achievements as well

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.890
as our mistakes, we will help
new generations build a future

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.190
for themselves that
we can't even imagine.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.720
Some stories are simply
too big to be told

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.040
by one person or one
group of people.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:29.890
From passive listeners to active
participants, we all have the power

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.070
to take initiative in this frontier
of democratized capturing creation.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:39.690
We're able to connect dots
differently to find deeper meanings

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:40.990
in the patterns that
emerge and, consequently,

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.290
we're able to begin
asking better questions.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:46.680 position:56%
These new stories can be experienced
differently in all [inaudible] ways

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.610
across time, across
geography, across culture,

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:55.070 position:56%
and most importantly, these
stories will mean so much more to us

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.510
because we were part of their
creation in the first place.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:20.050
[ Music ]

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.980
And, to show you that
this is not just a vision,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.780
let's take a look at
couple of projects.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.850
This is the common raven, the most
intelligent bird on the planet,

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.370 position:56%
and lately he's having a lot of fun.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.510
He's basically focusing on the
desert tortoises, and unfortunately

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:39.660
and sadly, these images
are very often to be seen

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.440
in the California desert.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.230
The raven attacks the baby
tortoises, and basically,

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.790
we're down to one last
generation of tortoises.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.600
If we don't save this generation,

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.360
this species in the
California desert will be gone.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.030
Why is this happening?

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.830
Because the ravens have
explosion of population.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.470
They're about 50 times
more than they used to be.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:01.770
And, who is guilty?

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.300
Of course, we humans.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.960
We create a lot of garbage.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.890
We destroy the habitat.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.180
We create a lot of imbalance.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.260
So, who will fix the problem?

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.460
The two people who actually
have a very good idea.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.120
Using technology, they thought
they can outsmart the ravens.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.570
Those two people are Dr.
William Boarman and Tim Shields

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.560
from Hardshell Labs, and they said,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.170
"Let's make a technotortoise
[phonetic]."

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:28.240
Basically, making fake tortoises,
placing them in the desert,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.960
and teaching the ravens something
better than what he does.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.260
How they do that?

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.960 position:56%
They simply leverage the new sensors

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.300
which is basically super high
quality cameras on your phone

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.980
or just any pocket camera.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.180
They take bunch of pictures
of real tortoise shells,

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.040
and then using the software that
I'm helping them with, Momento,

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.720
they basically create
3D digital models.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.190
And then, they print.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.410
These are just some print replicas.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.920
Which one is the true one,
and which one is the fake?

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.750
Probably it's not easy to tell.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:04.920
And then, the idea is to put
the [inaudible] on top of each

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.840
of the turtles so that when a
raven attacks, it sprays something

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.470
like a pepper spray
that will not kill him.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.930
It's biodegradable.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.940
But being smart as a raven
is, after three attempts,

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.690
he will say, "I'm out of here, man.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.440
I'm not going to touch
this thing anymore."

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.600
So, that's really their idea.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.100
They opened a Kickstarter campaign

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.220
because they're raising money
not only to do this but also

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.200
to make the ravens,
the tortoises move

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.390
like with a little
[inaudible] robots,

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:37.080
etc. This is the very reason why
I left architecture 15 years ago

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.520 position:56%
and then moved to be in technologies
because I really wanted to be a part

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.680
of a team that creates technologies

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.080
to enable small players
to play the big game.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.560 position:56%
Bill and Tim do not have much money.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.430
A tortoise researcher, you can
imagine how much that is paid

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.540
or how much funding there is there.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.980
But, leveraging technology, they
are inventing the conservation

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.680
preservation 2.0, and
this is really beautiful.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.140
The next story is about Dr. Louis
Leakey who is the third generation

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.730
of the famous Leakey family
that for three generations

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:13.460
and six decades has been
operating in Tanzania and Kenya,

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.730
basically telling the
story of the human origins.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.310
They have found thousands
and thousands of fossils

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:23.940
of the first hominids and
humans and animals and tools.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.350
And, for years, they wanted
to share their knowledge

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.650
with the world, but how?

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.010
How many people go to Kenya?

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.950
They are in the Museum of
Nairobi, but it's not easy

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.970
for other scientists, let alone
for teachers who teach that,

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.590
or for aficionados just to see it.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:42.860
So, Louise was at TED,
and she saw a photo booth

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.240
in which we were demonstrating
how you can use normal photography

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.630
to create 3D digital
models of the fossils.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.730
And, she loved it, and she started
testing, and she learned how

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.700
to create beautiful, 3D
digital models out of the photos

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:04.310
that with very small means, and
she herself and couple of members

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.460
of her team are doing to
digitize the collection.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.290
And, they started putting
the collection online.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.610
The site is called
africanfossils.org,

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:17.980
and you can go there and you
can basically start exploring.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.810
If you're a scientist, you
can search by a fossil number.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.370
If you're just a teacher,
you can start looking,

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.700
showing the kids how it looks like.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.450
And, you know, instead of asking
kids to open a book at second page

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:36.310
and learn about something, they
can actually digitally touch it,

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:41.300
explore it, look in the detail,
compare them, etc. Louise

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.450
and her team are also allowing you
to download the 3D digital model

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:49.140
so that if you have a 3D printer
in the school or download patterns

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.540
that are cardboard patterns
to assemble them like a puzzle

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.550
into the different skulls.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.570
This is an experiential learning.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.020
Instead of just from a book,
you actually can touch it,

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.080
you can feel it, you can compare,
wow, this guy had a bigger brain.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.730
This guy was, you know.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.870
So, she is, in a way,
not only archiving

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.180
and salvaging what her family has
been doing for three generations,

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.120
but also introducing a new form

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.790
of a much more interesting
way to educate.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.990 position:56%
The next story is about, the
color's a little bit faded out here,

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:25.120
but it's a museum in Sweden, a
Mediterranean museum in Sweden.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.670
They wanted to use tech to
make kind of new experiences

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:33.190
about upcoming Egyptian collection
that they were going to open.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:38.170
So, they had this [inaudible]
that they gave to us,

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:42.880
and basically what the team did
was made the tomography or CAT scan

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.140
of the mummified body
and then the rest

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.890
of the sarcophagi and
the cartonnage.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.760
We just took photography out of.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.730 position:56%
In the end, we ended up with a 3D
digital models of the mummified body

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.400
of the first, the cartonnage of the
first sarcophagi and the second.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:04.960
Basically, a 3D digitized
replica of the entire artifact.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.480
And, why did we do that?

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.680
Well, they worked with
Interspectral,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.820
a company that really
specializes on these new type

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:18.460
of interactive experiences on a
table that actually was placed just

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.370
in front of the glass behind which
the mummy was kind of dusting.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.910
And, this table enables you

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.750
to basically digitally unwrap
the mummy, slice through it,

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.220
look into the finest details
of every of the hieroglyphs

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.580
or of the pearls, etc. And,
obviously, because it was 3D

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.290
and digitized, we could also
make 3D printed replicas

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.740
out of the sarcophagus.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.750
But, there was something
even more interesting.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.670
While they did the CAT
scanning of the mummified body,

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:50.830
they found 120 hidden amulets
under the wrappings of the mummy.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.380
Without needing to unwrap them,
we could actually print them

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.840
and see them in real life.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.300
We actually printed the
negative and then they cast it

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.300
in bronze down the amulets.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.760
Quite amazing, right?

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.090
So, these guys are introducing
new experiences and tactile.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.060 position:56%
You have a new digital touching, and
then you have touching of something

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.580
that you are not ever
going to be allowed

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.600
to touch unless you
unwrap the mummy, right?

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.930
The next one is closest to you.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.610
Two years ago, we started a
project with the Smithsonian.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.230
Needless to say, biggest
collection of museum in the world.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:28.320
90 museums, 137 million objects.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.290
Catastrophe, right?

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.990 position:56%
And, for those of you who like going
to museum like me, you only see 2%

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.430
because there is no space.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.180
You don't get enough buildings
here, so a lot of the stuff is

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.600
in storage rooms, etc. And, a
very smart, young energized team

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.540
in the Smithsonian decided there
must be a solution to this.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.570
How can we show the collections
that we have to the whole world,

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.440
not only those who come
to museums and see 2%,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.270
but everything to everybody?

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.530
And, thus, how to engage
the kids of today who think

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.530
that computers are everything,
and they find that, you know,

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:03.880
museums are kind of archaic
institutions, in their opinion.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.090
So, this team started
digitizing some iconic pieces

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.190
from different museums,
and at that moment, we met.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:17.220
And we conceptualized together a
solution that will bring museums

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.330
on the cloud, accessible
to everybody online.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:24.110
And, this was a prototype
that we together did.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.800
It's called the Smithsonian
X 3D in which we started

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.630
with about 20 iconic objects
from as small as a bit

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.450
to as big as a supernova remnant.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:36.780
And, basically, the idea
was to put them in a browser

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.840 position:56%
and let people explore it while also
following what the curators have

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.020
spent their entire lives
with those artifacts can tell

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.330
about those subjects.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.630
We have a couple of rules.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.110
We wanted the objects to be
as beautiful as in real life

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.220
and not as in second life.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.830
Then, we wanted to offer some
tools that scientists can use,

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:59.370
that curators can do for
researching, for comparing,

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:03.090
for measuring, sectioning through.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:04.980
Some objects are more interesting

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.160
with what's happening
inside that outside.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.840
Profiling, then allow curators
to define hot zones and hot spots

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.170
to get additional explanation
and create tours on their own.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:19.780
So, here is a little video
that I made, but you're welcome

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.080
to explore it on your own.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.870
It's called Smithsonian X 3D.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:26.570
This is one of the two life
masks from around Lincoln.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.020
As you can see, you
can change the setting.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.320
You can see it in 3D.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.620
you can explore it.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.920
Imagine you're a teacher.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.220
You're teaching about the mammoth.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.650
Instead of saying, "Open
book on page 130," you say,

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.660
"Download the Smithsonian digital
mammoth and tell me how big was it.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.150
How tall was his leg?"

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:46.910
etc. And, but also we wanted to use
this artifacts to make some fun,

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:50.600
to make art, for example, a sticker
for a t-shirt out of the mammoth,

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.090
etc. This is my favorite project

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:57.320
because this is a single cosmic
Buddha, unique in the world,

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.750
and the relief was so shallow that
it was not possible to read it.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.680
When we showed the curator

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.030
that he actually can make
the relief deeper just

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:08.540
because it was digitized,
he was sold because this is

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.370
where you see how technology today
can help you research a little bit

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.340
deeper, a little bit different
and present and explain

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.070
about our past achievements
or about details

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.820
of our inventions in
a new, different way.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.390
Obviously, again, because
everything is in 3D,

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:30.240 position:56%
researchers are using 3D printouts
in order not to touch the originals,

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.490
but also using them for education.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.430
We even use some other software
that's not for 3D printing

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.730
but for cardboard making.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:41.950
One to 3D make, to make one on one
crates for different objects just

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.760
by making the negative of the
object and then making the crate.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.060
These, I personally made.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.620 position:56%
It was, it costed me about $70 and
three hours of my time versus couple

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.550
of thousand dollars of a crate,
for shipping, and for archiving,

00:32:54.550 --> 00:33:00.990
etc. And, this is all possible with
this new ways of either digitizing

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.980
or designing or making things.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.050
Smithsonian definitely paved the
path of the future of the museums,

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.630 position:56%
the future of experience, the future

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.050
of education, the future
of curation.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:15.090
So, this all sounds very
simple and easy, but actually,

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.380
when all of these pioneers
started to do that,

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:21.180 position:56%
realizing the opportunities of the
technologies, it was very difficult.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.840
They had to learn super many
software that they, as curators

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.130
or scientists, was like,
I'm not mechanical engineer.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.480
I cannot use this.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.720
it was a very difficult
process and very complex.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.700
These led us to the idea by
working with these people

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.670
who knew what they wanted to create
a product that we call Momento

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:43.140
that basically enables you, either
from photos or from laser scans

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.690
or structuralized scanners,
in the most easy way.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.990
This is shown with photos.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:48.960
You just take bunch of photos.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.600
You load them in the software, and
then the software converts them

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.080
into a 3D digital replica.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.180
At first, when you receive it,
you receive something like this,

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.790
and you say, wait a second.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.620
I took photos of the
sculpture, and I got that mess.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.260
But, actually, the
sculpture is in the middle.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.840
Obviously, the photos did
not know how far to go,

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.230
so they were just capturing
everything.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.200
But, then we made bunch of
[inaudible] really easily.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.760
Clean up the environment, then
close the holes if you wanted to.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:21.110 position:56%
You print it to be, so it's like a
3D photoshop, making 3D photography.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.120
But then, that photography can be
turned into the real world back

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:31.190
to CNC, to 3D printing, etc.
So, why does this matter to you,

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:35.940 position:56%
and how does this relate to anything
that you came for here tonight?

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:41.320
Well, all of these pioneers have
recognized new opportunities opened

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.620
with advanced technology.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.710
In particular, with
the following trends.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:49.240
The trends of ubiquitous
sensors, the trends of new ways

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.140
to fabrication, to
CNC, to 3D printing,

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:56.590
and trends of the powerful 3D web
and augmented through anything,

00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:00.360
mixed reality, smart
mobiles, etc. So,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.350
what do I mean by ubiquitous
sensors?

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:05.100
Well, we're live in
an age of sensors.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.720
Sensors are any photo camera
on your phone, on your iPad,

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.700
on your pocket camera, big camera.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.120
Something that used to cost
couple of thousand dollar camera,

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.580
now that quality sensor,
you have it on every phone

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.050 position:56%
that you guys have here in the room.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:19.460
But, there are also
other types of sensors.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.890
There is something that
we call structure light

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:25.740
which is basically photo with a
projector, and then laser scanners.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.990
They vary in price and, but
they all have the same trend.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.130
They become cheaper and better.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:33.430
So, they become ubiquitous.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.090
They become accessible.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.200
The second trend is about
the new way of making things,

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.820
the new fabrication methods.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.610
For a long time now,

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:45.200
digital fabrication methods
have exchanged the analog method

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.660
of cutting and chopping, etc. We
have now what we call CNC machines,

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.500
Computer Numerically
Controlled machines

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.790
that usually require a digital
file to make something awesome.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.780
And, the one that is most famous
is obviously the additive one,

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.180
the 3D printers.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.450
And 3D printers are not interesting
because hey you can buy them

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.440
and put them at home
and make, you know,

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.780
plastic ducks and iPhone covers.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.670
How many of those can we make?

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.450
But, it's more interesting

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:16.040
because you don't need
knowledge to use them.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.430
They're affordable.

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:20.000
They allow for distributive
manufacturing,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.480
meaning that they can be in
many places in the world,

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.040
and instead of I design something.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.340
I want to make it.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.350
I have to order it from China,
from America, from wherever.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:30.760
It can be locally made.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.220
But, most interestingly about
all the different effects

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.620
in 3D printing is that
complexity comes for free.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.190
A printer does not care
if you're printing a box

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.780
or if you're printing
something super beautiful,

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.650
just like what you will
see later being done.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.590
And, this, now, leads us to
the effect that to understand

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:51.020
that until now, we
have been designing

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.080
for subtractive manufacturing
method.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.970
Now, we have the opportunity
to revisit how we design things

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:01.680
and to start, maybe, designing with
algorithms and leveraging the fact

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.570
that this 3D printers can
print very complex structures.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:09.850
So, something like a bike
stand can be much, much lighter

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.930
and much sturdier if it is make
out of [inaudible] structure,

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.080
but that was not possible
to be done until now

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.370
in the ways we were manufacturing.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:21.060
This has a huge impact
on the world of design.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.910
And, the last trend that
I spoke of is the 3D web,

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:30.170
the web go technologies, the
oculus rifts in Microsoft Lenses,

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:35.760
and all of these new ways allow
us to experience in a new way.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.090
So, to conclude, scientists,
researchers, curators, doctors,

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:43.860
designers, artists of all kinds,

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.440
they will have much
more fun in the future.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.100
They will be able to push
their professions to new limits

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:55.250
that they never thought they
could do, and this concept

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:58.610
of which we call rip, fix, burn.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:37:59.910
Rip the reality.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:03.720
Fix it, mix it, change it, and then
reburn it back with 3D printing

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.990
or CNC or rip, fix, learn.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.460
Educate in a new way.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.760
Teach in a new way.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.060
Experience in a new way.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.350
I believe will affect
every aspect of our lives.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.150
Thank you so much.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:19.040
[ Applause ]

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.340
&gt;&gt; Robert Howe: Well, thank
you for your attention.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.340
I'm Robert Howe, and it's a
great pleasure to be invited here

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:29.160
on behalf of my colleagues in the
UConn Digital Musicology Group.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.070 position:56%
Before I go any further, I'd like to
thank the people who have helped us

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.890 position:56%
with this project, and besides those
many people who are listed here,

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.740
I have to also mention Greg
Case and Jeffrey Emerich

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.810
of the Coast Guard Band and
Ian Jackson of the University

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.110
of Connecticut for their help

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:47.660
in play testing the
mouthpieces that we created.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.580
This is my second appearance
here at the Madison Building.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.290
The first being at the American
Musical Instrument Society meeting

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.050
six years ago.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:58.560
Then, as now, my talk
concerned the study

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.690
of antique woodwind instruments.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:03.040
That time, I was talking about the
baroque oboe, and now I'm talking

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.080
about the early saxophone.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.310
And, the relearning of the
techniques necessary to play them

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.670
in the fashion of their time.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.770
This is a whole field
of music study,

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:16.790 position:56%
the so-called period music movement,
and it's one that I'm very involved

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:22.500
in as a, sort of, an outside
talented amateur and student.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.860
So, I'm interested in woodwinds,

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.180
and a woodwind is typically
blown with a reed.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.690
The mouthpiece and the
attached reed are the key

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.300
to understanding the
woodwind, how it sounds,

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.820
how it behaves acoustically
and musically.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.010 position:56%
For the reasons shown on this slide,

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:41.840
period woodwind artists have been
hampered by the lack of specimens

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.460
with a lack of data
on the construction

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.510
of early mouthpieces and reeds.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.620
For 40 years now, we've been
reviving the baroque oboe,

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.880
but we still are not completely
sure, for example, how the players

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.590
of the day made their reeds.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:40:00.390
Looking at the earliest saxophones,
we have a substantial number

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.940
of specimens, at least 100
that are in playing condition.

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:07.520
In my own efforts playing
these instruments,

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.730
one notes a very profound
of the mouthpiece.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.850
In these two specimens,
the tenor plays very well

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.920
with the original mouthpiece
which we're fortunate to have.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.610
But, no modern mouthpiece,
even those that are said

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.120
to copy Sax's designs,
have been suitable.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.530
So, I wrote to the guy
that sells the mouthpieces

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.570
that he says are copied after Sax's
designs, and he says, "Oh, no.

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.600
I've never seen one, but this
is what I think they should be

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.000
from what I've read."

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.910
Well, he's doing the best he can,
but, you know, as for the alto

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:41.740 position:56%
on the right, I have found no modern
mouthpiece which permits this horn

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.490
to play at a suitable pitch that
would have been at the time,

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.790
nor one that permits it to
play in tune with itself.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:51.650
And, the antique mouthpiece that
I received with it which is not

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:55.710
of Sax's manufacture doesn't do
any better than the modern one.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:59.080
And, this tells us that
Sax had some unique element

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.780
in his mouthpiece design
which has not been carried

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:05.680
down to modern times or elements.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.600
The surviving sax, saxophone
mouthpieces are very few

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.510
and have not been systematically
studies.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.630
Being extremely fortunate
to have access

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:17.870
to the tenor saxophone
mouthpiece and the instrument

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:19.910
with which it was built, I wondered

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.610
if I could determine
the characteristics

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:23.330
that make it successful.

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:26.500
If I could replicate it, and
if one could then apply those

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.720
characteristics to other
species of saxophone,

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.820
soprano, alto, and baritone.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.580
But, first, I wondered, is
this a legitimate exercise.

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:38.990
Is it correct to derive mouthpieces
for other species from the tenor?

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:45.780 position:56%
And, going back to first sources,
Sax's 1846 patent for the Saxophone,

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.560
displays the mouthpiece
very prominently.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.640
It's shown thrice on the
document with the mouthpieces

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.190
on the two specimens
that are sketched being

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.290
essentially identical.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.150
This one on the left is
what we would call, now,

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.890
a baritone saxophone, and the form

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.140
on the right never made
it into production.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:09.570
But, he answered my question
as to whether it was legitimate

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.060
to scale them up and scale them
down in his own patent application.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.060
There's the answer.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:21.040
Now, as a physician by day, I deal
with medical imaging every day

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.420
of my life, and I have an
interest in ultrasound and CT.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.750
And, I've been using CT to look

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.590
at the fine details of
woodwind manufacture.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:34.250 position:56%
Micro CT, that is to say CT with
pixel sizes in the micrometer range,

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.190
1/1000 of a millimeter, allows us

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.590
to study objects with
extreme precision.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:43.430
And, of course, any CT allows us
to view the anatomy of an object

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:46.550
from any point of view
without taking measurements

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.380
and without doing anything that
might damage the instruments.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.300
And, just to clarify for everyone,

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.860
what's the difference
between x-ray and CT?

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.120
The gentleman on the left is
being subject to an x-ray.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.090
There's a plate behind him
and a beam is going to go

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:03.370
through his chest and
expose the plate.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:10.130
It's instantaneous, but it only
gives you a 2D object, oh, 2D view.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:14.300
The woman on the right who's
going to be subject to a CT,

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.930
that torus has beams, has
beams that are going to come

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.770
from all directions around her,

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:21.910
and then there are
detectors on the other side.

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:28.890 position:56%
So, just as you were displaying here
with the cameras, we'll get a myriad

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:33.090
of views which are then summed by
the computer to create a 3D file

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:36.850
that can be viewed from
any desired object.

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:42.330 position:56%
So, to do the work on the saxophone,
I needed an expert in micro CT,

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:47.880 position:56%
and I was fortunate to find Dr. Sina
Shahbazmohamadi who is the director,

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.700
now, if imaging at the Chase Labs
at University of Connecticut.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:56.710
And, my advisor, Richard Bass,
helped out also from musicological

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.740
and administrative points of view.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.900
Then, we were very,
we are very fortunate

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.520
that Sina's wife Zahra
[assumed spelling],

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.810
who is also a mechanical engineer,
was able to become our consultant

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.540
for additive manufacture.

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:10.100
We did some initial work on
the instruments that Richard

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.710
and I are holding, the curved
English horn and the recorder,

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:17.140 position:56%
and then you can see that Dr.
Shahbazmohamadi is holding the tenor

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.930
saxophone in question with one
of our replicated mouthpieces.

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:24.430
In his, in his micro CT work,

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:28.350
Sina used the standard industrial
equipment at two labs a UConn,

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.440
and he performed our
data manipulation.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.880
Here to show you how
that's done on the right.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.600
On the leftmost part of the
image, there's the x-ray source.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:41.560
Then, in the middle, that
orange yellow thing is the tie

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.130
on an oboe reed, and
it's in a holder

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:48.050
which will rotate 1/1000th
of a circle.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:49.910
Then, the ten second
exposure's taken.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:54.020
Then, it moves 1/1000th of a circle
so as to get that myriad of views

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.410
that we need for the CT analysis.

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:59.780
And then, the detector
is on the far right.

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.880
Sina and I were, then,
able to do manipulation

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.500
and clarification of the data.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.040
We benefitted very much
from the advantages

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:15.210
of micro computed tomography,
and the last one, of course,

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.370
the last two are the ones that are
of substantial importance to us

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:19.830
in a saxophone mouthpiece.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.680
The internal geometry is
notoriously difficult to measure,

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.800
and we could translate
it into some form

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.510
for added manufacture
of computerized milling.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:35.340
The disadvantages of micro CT,
however are not, are not trivial.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.930
The greatest one being
the limited specimen size.

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.800
The largest specimen that
our machine can handle is ten

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.680
centimeters in dimension, so we
are obliged, for something as small

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.330
as a saxophone mouthpiece,
to take two views and then

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:52.880
to stitch them digitally.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.180
Y'all should take this for granted.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.260
Here's how additive
manufacture works.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.340
You take a CAD file.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:02.830 position:56%
You create another file out of
that, and you lay it down in layers.

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:05.620
It's the creation of an object by
applying thin layer of material,

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.150
one atop the other, rather

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:09.850
than removing material
from a larger block.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.790
So, instead of taking a piece
of stone and removing everything

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:15.390
that doesn't look like a
bunny, you take nothing

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:18.020
and you add all the stuff
that does look like a bunny,

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.640
and you end up with a bunny.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.760
But, the important thing's that
it permits extreme precision

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.630
and unlimited numbers of copies.

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:31.150
This is, this is a
low complexity machine

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:35.050
at work, probably making a bunny.

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:38.920
So, here's the foot joint on
the left of an antique recorder

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.770
by Cahuzac [assumed spelling] circa
1750, and then there's a copy made

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:44.920
by a professional recorder maker,

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.090
and then there's four identical
copies that Sina and I made.

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.140
My daughter, Katherine, is
going to pass some of those

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.970
around for you all to inspect.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:57.340
Please understand that the joints
she's passing around are early,

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.720
early iterations and that our
quality control has gotten better.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.020
But, they'll give you an
idea of what they are.

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:07.850 position:56%
The four on the right are, you know,
they were produced just as easily

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:09.150
as making one would have been.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:10.920
It's just a matter of telling
the machine how many times

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.390
to lay it down, and you can
make it, you can take a plate

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:18.220
and make 100 at time if you want.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.500
In our first presentation of
this project, Sina demonstrated

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:27.370
that the micro CT and additive
manufacture copies were actually

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:31.100
closer to the original
than the copies made

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.050
by a professional recorder maker.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:40.610 position:56%
And, he also demonstrated, by taking
CTs of our copies and comparing them

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:45.670
to CTs of the original and of the
artisan copy, that the dimensions

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:49.740
that are hardest to
take by a craftsman,

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.980
particularly the internal
diameters of tone holes

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.810
where you're measuring
at a deep level.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.700
Those showed the greatest
advantage for micro CT.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:03.730
So, the method had an error of
less than 1% in all dimensions.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:07.990
It was within the error
of my measurements.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.560
So, here's the anatomy of
a saxophone mouthpiece,

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.030
and look particularly at
the upper one on the left.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:15.640
It shows the tip opening.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.930
That's the place where the air goes

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:21.520
through between the
reed and the mouthpiece.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.180
And, the reed has its excursion
between this position you see

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.740
and the tip of the mouthpiece.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.520
If the reed is too soft,

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.480
the player's breath will just blow
it shut and no sound will issue.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.740
Look on the lower one
at the lay and rails.

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.390
You see those slender pieces there?

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:45.910
Here's the mouthpiece from b
flat tenor saxophone 39116,

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:50.200
and you see the surface
rendering that we took by CT.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.330
Look at the detail
that CT gives you.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.760
You can even see, you can
compare the color on here

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.780
where the grain differs and
that's picked up on the CT.

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:07.030
Taking slices of CT
is called a tomogram.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.160
It's a leftover term from
traditional radiology,

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.870 position:56%
and here's some transverse tomograms
from the saxophone mouthpiece.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:17.100
So, in the center of that
baffle area that I showed you

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:22.750 position:56%
between the two rails, you can see
that the inside, it's not spherical.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.050
It's not circular.

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:27.320
It has a fairly complicated,
handmade shape.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.420
Whereas, down in the shank
that goes on to the neck

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.820
of the instrument, it's
perfectly circular.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.670
And, the join between those two,

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:42.220
those two chambers,
is fairly abrupt.

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.780
We could also see, and I don't
show it here, at the very bottom,

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:51.300
take the left image, the piece on
the left, the tongue sticking up.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.420
At the very tip of that,
there's a complicated anatomy

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.150
of several curve's intersection
which is probably from the way

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.550
that it's hand fabricated
that hasn't been recognized

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:04.540
by modern makers, and
I think may be part

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.710
of the what is unique
about the sax design.

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:15.410 position:56%
I spent, I spent a few hours wasting
time trying to take measurements

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:19.430 position:56%
by hand, and as you can see, you can
get very, very fine measurements,

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.760
but you can see the very, very
tedious to do that and to turn

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:26.640
that into a reamer to create
a mouthpiece would be of,

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.700
would be just prohibitively
difficult to get accurate,

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.870
accurate milling and
creation, unless, of course,

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:35.270
you use the digital method.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:41.050 position:56%
So, it made more sense to us to go
directly to a computerized 3D source

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.670
such as additive manufacture.

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:48.380
So, Zahra made a rough copy for
us, and it's not shown here.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.810
And, we were very pleased
by its utility.

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:54.600
It played okay, so we did
just like you were saying.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.000
I needed a, I was overseas
and I needed it.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.070 position:56%
So, we sent the data to a company in
France, and then they overnighted it

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:06.240
to me in Brussels, and a had a
working copy like 16 hours later.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.900
A day and 16 hours later.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:12.090
It just took no time at all,
and the son of a gun plays.

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:14.760
It plays wonderfully.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:20.180
It plays better than the
original which suggests

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:24.450
that there may be either a
bias on my part or a matter

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:27.200
of the material that's being used.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.720
Perhaps the latter.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.780
So, very pleased by
these initial results.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.520
I measured the bore of each species
of Adolf Sax's saxophone, soprano,

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.080
alto, tenor, and baritone.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:44.970
And, using tenor as 100%, I scaled
the mouthpiece designs up and down

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:48.540
to the relative bore sizes, and we
created a family of mouthpieces.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:52.260
Katie's going to pass around
some of the soprano mouthpieces,

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:56.600
just showing how I made
them at 76%, 78%, 72%.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.650
We tried different sizes
until we found the one

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:02.600
that gave us the best acoustical
results on the instrument.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.360 position:56%
When you, when you study this,
don't only, don't just look at them.

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.440
Also, feel them, and you'll feel
one of the flaws for this method,

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.360
and we'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.880
So, how do they play?

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.970
You will ask, how do they play?

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:20.210
Well, I have here Adolf Sax's
soprano 32194 from 1866,

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:22.310
and I'm going to play it first
with a modern mouthpiece and then

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:23.610
with our UConn mouthpiece.

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:26.740
And, I ask you to pardon
my not having warmed up.

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.340
This is the treat to which
Anne referred, and the treat is

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.510
that I'll only play
it for a short time.

[ Laughter ]

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:45.760

mouthpiece from the 1990s.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.050
Yeah, this is the original
instrument.

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:52.260
1866. Not quite in
perfect condition.

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.810
It has, you'll hear
there's a few leaks on it,

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:57.610
but enough to make the point.

[ Music ]

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.350
There's a modern mouthpiece in it.

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.820
And with our copy here.

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.560
This is very, the ligature
doesn't quite fit,

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.510
so it's a fussy thing to get right.

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:35.190
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:36.490
The other one's called ebonite.

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:37.830
It's a plastic.

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:42.930
It's been used for
mouthpieces for 130 years.

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:45.730 position:56%
When that material became available,

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:48.920
manufacturers abandoned
wooden mouthpieces overnight

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:52.310
because it's stable, and
the mouthpiece, you know,

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:56.020
is the part that's in your mouth
and it warps and cracks and chips.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.820
And, a stable one's a good thing.

00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:02.140
[ Music ]

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.970

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:26.580
[ Music ]

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:31.970
It's a softer, more covered mellow
sound than a modern would give,

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:35.600
and we were very fortunate
to have the cooperation

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:42.200 position:56%
from our performance people at UConn
who gave up a week out their lives

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.790
to work intensively on this.

00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:45.090
I'm going to start this now.

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:49.020
I hope it's not too loud, but this
is the UConn faculty saxophonists

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:52.240
and a graduate student with
yours truly playing tenor.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.990
Just for 20 seconds
of quartet from 1856.

00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:01.510
&gt;&gt; We touch one, and it's like,
you know, an unbelievable honor.

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:25.090
[ Music ]

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:27.430
So, that's what they sound like.

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:29.840
So, the soprano worked fine.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.550
The problematic alto that I
showed you before was tamed

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:33.850
by the mouthpiece.

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:36.800
It plays in tune, and it played at
the correct pitches, saxes time,

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.380
and I had a slide showing that.

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:44.330 position:56%
So, here's the family we created,
and this is a fellow that I just met

00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:48.050
at a music shop playing
on one of my mouthpieces.

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.630
And, this is the problematic alto
with the mouthpiece that I got

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:57.210
with it which doesn't work, but
it plays beautifully at A438

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:59.050
with the UConn mouthpiece.

00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:01.990
The tenor, as I say, plays as
well or better with the replica

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:05.550
than with the original, and the
baritone plays just magnificently.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:07.910
It sounded great.

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:13.480 position:56%
Now, there are differences, and this
is why we do period music is to find

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.600
out what is different and learn
from it and then be able to do it.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.470 position:56%
The tip opening on the sax original.

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:21.460
Go back to that slide I showed you
of saxophone mouthpiece anatomy.

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:23.770 position:56%
The tip opening is very, very small,

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.900
about 1/3 of what it is
on modern mouthpieces.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:30.260
This requires a harder reed,
so it doesn't just flap shut.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:33.180
And, a harder reed reduces the
responsiveness of the instrument,

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.340
but it enriches their sound.

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:38.970
So, the tenor and the soprano
also required narrower reeds

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:40.270
than are sold today.

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:41.570
And, I was fortunate to have a box

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.110
of specialty narrow tenor
saxophone reeds in my basement.

00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:45.580
I don't know why I
had them, but I did.

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:47.950
You know, if you live long enough,

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:50.490
everything you have will
eventually become useful.

00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:53.800
And, b flat clarinet reeds
turned out to work fine

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.870
on the soprano mouthpiece.

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:59.480
Now, the period saxophone
world is a small one,

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:04.000
and as word of our work got out,
new mouthpieces came to the fore.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.750
And so, I got some measurements
just with calipers, not with CT.

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:12.240
I was very pleased to find that
our measurements for the alto

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:17.140
and the baritone agreed within a
few percent with Sax's original.

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:21.590
For the soprano, however, Sax
didn't follow his own advice.

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:25.110
He didn't simply scale
down, scale down the bass.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:31.400
He made a squat, wide mouthpiece
which, of course, works wonderfully

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:35.590
and which is more of a model
for how things are done today.

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:36.890
But, it was interesting.

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:41.100
Although, you can see my dimensions
very, very much from the original,

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:45.950
the volume contained within it
is only 3% different, and that's,

00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:49.590
that's a major factor to
the intonation and pitch

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:51.800
of the instrument is the
volume within the mouthpiece.

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.240
So, Sax deviated from
his own design,

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:59.660
but his own design would have
worked perfectly well, we think.

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:02.850
There are flaws in the method, and
if you've had those mouthpieces

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:06.630
in your hands that I'm passing
around, you'll find on the lay,

00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:08.680
on the rails, there's
little irregularities.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:13.980 position:56%
And, this is, this is stepping
artifact, with additive manufacture,

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:17.220
each time you have a layer end
and the next one continues,

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:22.390
it's like little stepping stone,
and so it's a little bit imperfect.

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:24.290
Also, if you saw on the
recorder foot joints

00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:27.490
that we were passing around,
they're kind of rough and scaly

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:30.200
on the outside, and that's
a so-called grain artifact

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.080
that distorts surfaces.

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.020
We also find that one external
surface, the one that's

00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:39.070
on the manufacturing
plate, is perfectly smooth,

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:42.830
and the other ones have these
potential for artifacts.

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:44.180
And, one that's important, I think,

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:49.090
is that copying something
propagates any unrecognized changes

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:54.490
that have happened in it, and just
something we have to do carefully.

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:59.330
We've considered the numerous
directions for further research

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:02.010
in this, but right now,
we're limiting ourselves

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:04.090
to improving the mouthpiece
manufacture

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:06.300
and to getting our
current work published.

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:08.730
There's only, you know,
there's only 24 hours in a day,

00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:12.280
and we all have, we
all have business.

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.980
But, it's interesting to find
that there is a physician

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:21.060
out in Minnesota who has done
CT on a Stradivarius and broken

00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:24.830
down the images into individual
parts, and you can get a copy

00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:27.770
of this violin made by CNC milling
which is actually put together

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:32.370
by luthiers, not by
gynecologists or radiologists.

00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:34.960
And, they play perfectly well.

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.510 position:56%
There is substantial work being
done on string instruments which is,

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:39.700
of course, where the money
is in musical instruments,

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:44.920
and in some of the European labs.

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:49.010
We are very fortunate that our
work was published in our journal

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:51.880
of first choice before we
were even finished with it,

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.710
and I think this is in large part
because this is really something

00:59:55.710 --> 01:00:00.740
that required a university,
not a conservatory

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.040
and not a technical institute.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.200
You needed to have music
people and you needed

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.260
to have engineering
people and you needed

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.690
to have imaging people
to make this work.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:11.050
So, it's part of the
bringing together, I think,

01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:15.160
intellectually, of the project.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.310
So, in summary, we use micro
CT to create a data file

01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:21.970
of an Adolf Sax tenor
saxophone mouthpiece.

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.560
We modified the data
to create a family

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.460
of working mouthpieces
by additive manufacture.

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:30.320
The method works, and with
refinement, we will produce all

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.800
of the mouthpieces we need,
perhaps using CNC milling rather

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.100
than additive manufacture.

01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:40.930

told us that "it ain't

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:43.060

01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:53.910
that usually surround us, but the
certain space that they define

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:58.720
and we are smaller entity in
that space, as many as we may be.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.110
And, I just wanted to bring
all those surfaces much closer

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.410
to the body.

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:06.160
I think this whole presentation is
about that and the whole big part

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.980
of the motivation of doing music
instruments is more like going

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:14.960
into body prosthesis, prosthetics
on my part rather than the music

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:20.060
which I leave to my great partner
Scott here who's also a designer.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:25.730
And so, this is the cover of a
book that I've done recently called

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:30.430
"Pulsation in Architecture",
and it's my research

01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:35.050
on a certain obsession
about rhythmicity or rhythm

01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:39.420
in architecture, the perception
of rhythm or the sensate quality

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.160
of rhythms in architecture.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.370
Especially the kind of architecture
that's cropped since the last 20,

01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:49.680
15 years or so that's
very much influenced

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.160
by the digital technologies, where
there's a lot of like topology

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.540
and surface manipulation and such.

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.250
Let me just try something.

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:01.200
It's the images being
cropped a little bit.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.920
Just try something.

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:14.100
Good. So, I'm just
going to run through a,

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:17.700
just to give you a background
of this kind of 15 to 20 years

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:21.580 position:56%
of my own trajectory in architecture
associated with competition

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.980
and advanced digital design.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:25.930
I'm going to just show you
productivity projects and then move

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:28.810
on to what's interesting
for us tonight.

01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:33.540
So, this is a project that we
were invited to participate

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.270
in by the Museum of
Modern Art in New York.

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:39.900
They do this yearly program
called Young Architects Program,

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.730
and the PS1 in Queens.

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:47.060
And so, basically, I'm not going to
get too much into the architecture

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.580
because you guys did not
know that you were going

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:51.010
to get any architecture tonight.

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:54.140
So, I'm not going to force it
into you, but this is a project

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:58.470
where I think it's, for us it
was our first deliberate attempt

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:04.160
to really investigate a lot of
this idea of rhythm and rhythmicity

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.350
and rhythm perception
in the architecture.

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:09.770
And, of course, there's
their story, elevated tracks,

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:14.190
couple of blocks away from PS1,
and everybody that goes to PS1 has

01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:15.490
to take this train, mostly.

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:19.750
So, this is an expense that you
really have when you're going to go

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:24.510
to these, to these parties that
are held every Saturday with music

01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:27.340
and DJs and whatnot
at the open courtyards

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:30.910
that the PS1 Museum has in Queens.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:34.160
And, so what you see
here is the top view,

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.630
a plan view of what's
grey is existing museum.

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:41.180
Everything that's white is the
open courtyards that there are

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.200
that you have to traverse
in order to get

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.740
from the street to the institution.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:49.980
And, basically, where designing
is, it's a large installation slash

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.650
like large tent like structure

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:58.080
that will also host these
parties every weekend.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.060
And, I just feel like I have
to go faster through this.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:08.660
But, what you're seeing is, I think
this image is key in that the way,

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:11.920
it's about perception
because the way.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.450
This was probably, it's
2008, but I was trying

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:19.260
to photograph the train
tracks very quickly

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:20.770
because there were
cops that didn't like.

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:25.180
You can imagine a guy in New York
taking photos of the train tracks

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.420
for a long time and the
structures from the [inaudible].

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.020
And, really, they grabbed
me, and they had me.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:32.990
Lucky, they didn't
take away my photos,

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.600
but what I like about,
it's not that.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.590
It's the fact that
they're rather big, right?

01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:42.520
So, in order to capture that, I had
to do where there wasn't any kind

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.450
of technology such as
panorama or stitcher.

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:48.780
In the camera, I just
took many of these photos

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:51.040
and reconstructed like
[inaudible], right?

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.270
So, actually like that technique.

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:56.690
That was, I was using creatively
that technique all the time,

01:06:56.690 --> 01:07:00.270 position:56%
and the result is you don't get the
kind of smoothness or the continuity

01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:01.770
that a real train tracks have.

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:07.220
But, you get this kind of faceted,
disjointed sense of continuity

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:13.920
which nevertheless provides the
sense that what you actually see,

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.550
your psyche associates this in
a way to which you perceive it.

01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:18.950
But, it's completely
different, of course.

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:23.000
So, we decided to do our
project in the same manner.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.490
It actually start with something,

01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:29.750
because also because this
competition has a really low budget

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:33.160
for an architect, so and we were
very interested in curvature.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:38.190
All that you see tonight is a lot
of curves and topological surfaces.

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:41.130
We wanted to convey that with,

01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:44.190
but in very simple way
with faceted surfaces.

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:48.600
So, I tried to do the
same thing that was done

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.720
to the photographs [inaudible]
post operational procedure

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.020
to really start with that.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.570
So, this project is at the
aggregation of certain series

01:07:57.570 --> 01:08:03.640
of modules that they are rhythmical
but every single component

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.530
of that rhythm changes, right?

01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:08.270
So, it's kind of modulative
rhythm, and every single,

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:14.130
there's a basic component for
the space that has, is repeated,

01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:17.290
but no single element that form
part of a component is equal

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:21.780
because there's kind of this notion
of the overall movement, right?

01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:24.090
So, it's about different
speeds in perception.

01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:29.270 position:56%
There's a part where you go through
and if there's a straight trajectory

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:31.200
from the street into the
museum, they just kind

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.950
of bypass this project or there's
another part where these kind

01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:36.710
of lounge tools and
areas where there's much

01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:40.750
of a lounge-y, like
slower perception.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:44.340
That's kind of that space,
and there's all these cuts

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.820
that are produced by rupture

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.870
between the modules,
the [inaudible] project.

01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:51.420
Through those cuts, you can
traverse these two realms.

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.410
So, that would be in a
real view of the project.

01:08:55.410 --> 01:09:00.480
It latches on to an existing wall,
and that would, we didn't win.

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.970
We came in second.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.850
Unfortunately, the winner only
is the one that gets to build it,

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:09.640
but so as I was saying,

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.560
this [inaudible] is kind
of like about the body.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.350
So, we were obsessed with
the segmented animals

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:20.920
that have segmented bodies such
as the lobster which was really,

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.720
we were trying to see what kind
of intelligent logic is there

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.150
in the body of that animal that
we could appropriate or hack

01:09:27.150 --> 01:09:31.710
onto into two kind of,
but these are these kind

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:34.300
of rather large architectural body
that you could have it, right?

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.250 position:56%
So, this is actually the structures.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:38.180
Underneath that, and anyways.

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.710 position:56%
Moving on to the second architecture
project that I just only want

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.180
to throw in and background.

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.520
I'm not getting into it too much.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.360
This is a project with it for
my hometown from Buenos Aires,

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.440
Argentina for the port of
Buenos Aires, and it's a project

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.460
for a large performing arts center.

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.120
Much larger than previous
project, right?

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:59.820
So, I'm going to upwards in scale
in the architectural projects,

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:06.640
and this one really was trying
to index look, first observe

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:12.760
and understand an index effects of
turbulence in liquids and see what

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.090
of that could we also
appropriate for architecture

01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:23.920
and produce this project that
is set in a way that it's really

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.870
on the wharf on the main wharf that
gives access to the Puerto Madero,

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:32.550 position:56%
the main port which is former
industrial port transforming to kind

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:35.960
of cultural office
area in Bueno Aires.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:42.460
And, this is trying to set kind of
a first layer between the river,

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.590
the large river that Rio de la
Plata in Argentina and the port

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:48.710
where it's kind of like a
second horizon where this kind

01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:51.670
of rhythmical progression
with distortion is set up.

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:56.220
And, in that sense, architecture
has a lot of inherent repetition

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.120
within just look at anything
in a [inaudible] from facades

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.130
to the modulation of that wall.

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:03.750
You know, it's really
anything has to be panelized

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:05.420
so [inaudible] components.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:10.230
There's no single surface that
will be used, you know, that big.

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:15.910
So, taking on that given situation
and then using that as enhancing

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:19.280
that as an aesthetic and perceptual
device is what this projects

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.580
are doing.

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.870
And, again, I'm just bypassing
a lot and moving through it,

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:26.920
but it was also doing is
kind of offering itself as a,

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.590
more as a landscape
rather than as a building.

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:33.040
And, counterpoint existent
towers that kind

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.590
of punctuate the waterfront
of the city of Buenos Aires.

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:40.800
So, this becomes a very democratic,
very open surface that people can,

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.490
the rule from the project
is successful

01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:44.570
for events and things like this.

01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:47.860
So, the whole geometry
with all this pathways

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:51.810
and all these gangways is meant to
bring people into those surfaces.

01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:54.520 position:56%
And, in a way, it has several kinds.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:59.230
This is very convoluted
rhythm of juxtaposed ramps

01:11:59.230 --> 01:12:00.810
and whatnot that bring people in.

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:04.090
And then, there's very kind of
repetitive but with variation,

01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:07.470
linear rhythm is the
[inaudible] horizon, right?

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:09.320
Then, this is kind of
drawings that we do,

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.220
and part of architectural stuff.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:14.700
I mean, I call this, I mean I
naturally call this architecture.

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.450
I'm not sure that you
think these are,

01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:18.880
this is what you normally
associate with architecture.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.010
I don't see much of these in
the skyline in Washington.

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:24.310
I don't know.

01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:26.150
Maybe soon.

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:27.450
So, moving on with this.

01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:31.500
just for you to get a grasp that
what you will see next is sort

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.930
of coming from somewhere
and not from music, right?

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:39.010
So, that's kind of, that's the
reason I'm throwing it in today.

01:12:39.010 --> 01:12:44.730
Of course, you know, in
our perception of rhythm,

01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:48.040
I think goes hand in
hand with the notion

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.110
of sensuality and music in itself.

01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:55.600
I mean, it's probably legacies,
I mean lots and lots of books

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.770
that speak about these beyond
my own capacity to look into,

01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:06.570
but we find this idea of
rhythmic progressions also in many

01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:10.440
in formations in nature such
as the strangler fig trees

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.640
which are everywhere in Florida.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.550
They're fascinating and also
very time based processes

01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:23.790
which can observe from the
roots of trees that grow

01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:28.150
over existing trees and,
you know, kind of cohabitate

01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:29.450
and [inaudible] fight
for [inaudible]

01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:31.710
until the 200 years later.

01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:36.860
Maybe, the host tree takes over and
exhausts the parasite tree, sorry,

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:40.130
takes over the host tree, and you
get this kind of open lattices

01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:41.980
of depleted structures, right?

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:46.190
This one right here which are
absolutely wonderful and beautiful,

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:49.450
and it's kind of, I think I'm
giving up, I'm giving away a lot

01:13:49.450 --> 01:13:51.280
by showing you these images
because then everything else,

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.890
you'd think it's just
replications of these, right?

01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:55.370
And again, that's the only thing.

01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:59.020
This is a trick, as gentleman
presented before had his own trick.

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:02.310
Our trick is only thing we do
is we been copying this stuff

01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:04.200
in the workplace.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.250
The other project, the last
project I'm showing which is this,

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:09.660
is the growing much more in scale.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:15.830
This is a project for the, it's
in memorial for the victims

01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:19.990
of the tsunami that happened
in Thailand a few years ago,

01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:22.120
and it's 300 meters long.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.560
It's an international competition,

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.320
and it's part of a
much larger jungle.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:33.670 position:56%
The project was on a site that had a
very small drainage up on the right.

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:36.610
It's [inaudible] that
went down about 25,

01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:38.930
30 degrees down towards the beach.

01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:42.510
And, what we did is we decided
in order to do a memorial

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:46.130 position:56%
for such a dramatic event, to really
make a landscape project that was

01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:49.850
like a collection of courtyards and
that these courtyards would line

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:53.650
up stringed by these kind

01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:55.490
of [inaudible] channel
which [inaudible].

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.080
So, we made the presence
of water part

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.440
of the commemoration
of the dead, right?

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:04.950
So, and also what you see here
is many of those courtyards

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:08.640
and the green that you see is
the kind of interspatial spaces

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.610
between the courtyards where
[inaudible] colleges will grow

01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:13.780
and new life will be cultivated.

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:17.450
So, any case, it's a product
that is, that has a lot to do

01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:19.710
with repetition with, repetition

01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:21.770
with variation played
out throughout.

01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:25.340
There's no two single
instances that are the same

01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.240
in which this courtyards
are laid out.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.500
But, rather it's a collection
of multiple possible variations

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:36.690
out of a very simple initial unit
which is this courtyard here.

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:38.450
And then, ultimately has some.

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:39.750
This is the layout.

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:44.810
We have, you see, it's very long
pads, and there are some canopies

01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:48.080
that hold over this courtyard.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:51.120
And then, there are
those places where kind

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:57.180
of new natural growth
happens and going further

01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:01.530
into the details is typically
how we proceed with, you know,

01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:04.320
kind of excavating, give
much, much more detail.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.740
These canopies are also large
pouches that collect water and kind

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.330
of [inaudible] throughout
the project.

01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:13.110
So, it's kind of tubular.

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:18.170
Tubes that come out of
them that bring down water,

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:20.030
and they also become railings

01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:24.740
and they also become pathfinding
elements throughout the project,

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.040
right?

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.490
So, this comes in effect
of synthesis in that way,

01:16:29.490 --> 01:16:34.100
and in this project's the idea of
kind of second device that latches

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:39.070
onto its host and becomes
one with it, symbiotically.

01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:40.370
It's present.

01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:43.230
So, I'm just laying down
some of the tropes that were,

01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:47.110
are constantly part of what
we do when we do architecture

01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:52.650
that are there so that we kind of
can shift now and begin to look

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:57.060
at some of these things
that we have built recently.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.870
So, that was growing in
skill, and I would have go

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:02.400
down in scale significantly.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.620
This is a project that
was commissioned to us

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:10.560
for the Metropolitan Gallery in
one of these recent, very large,

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.160
three painting conferences
which has this,

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.970
some of these conferences
have an art section

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:18.380
and a fashion section and what not.

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.180
So, as an art section
slash architecture section

01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:25.860
that we were invited, and with
it, we produced some structure

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:27.980
that I don't know yet what it is.

01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:32.320
Honestly, I just don't
know that it has any use,

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.160
and it's also not a sculpture.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:37.230
In, but I guess people
call it a sculpture.

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:40.890
It's mostly an exploration
of rhythmical was

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:44.000
in which you can embed
different kinds

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.480
of rhythms within other rhythms.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:54.220
This project was done also
combining two digital fabrication

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:57.080
technologies, one is
the CNC milling,

01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.300
and the other one is 3D printing
[inaudible] position modeling.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:09.180
So, what you see here is
this larger kind of element.

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:16.210
Call it something, then receives
another layer of smaller rhythms

01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:20.810
that are embedded within
some of these cavities.

01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:24.110
In, throughout, I mean, this was
one of the first times that some

01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:32.310
of those more conceptual and more
speculative architecture projects

01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:36.800
have the chance to be explored
in, of course, very reduced scale.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.480 position:56%
But, the reason I wanted you to see
those architecture projects first is

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:44.450
because now the, exactly the
same techniques that are used

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:52.170
in 3D modeling, we use a software
called Maya from Autodesk.

01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:57.810
And, the same way we think about
those projects, now, is, in a way,

01:18:57.810 --> 01:18:59.290
it's a scaleless problem.

01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:02.540
You can shift scales with
not difficulty at all,

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:06.860
even some DNA types of lines
and moves and surfaces used

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:09.930
for a master plan, you can
use for a door handle, right?

01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:13.490
So, we definitely take advantage
of that, and, but it also,

01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:17.200
along the process of doing that,
you discover effects of [inaudible]

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.640 position:56%
and effects of machining and
programming how you want the machine

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.470
to cut certain materials.

01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:25.930
Or, in the case of the
CNC milling machine,

01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:28.080
the way the machine
operates is it moves

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.270
by sculpting away from
a solid piece.

01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:34.710
In this case, we used a
high density foam for that.

01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:39.450
Leaves a certain scoring
of the passes, and you can,

01:19:39.450 --> 01:19:42.740
we can play around with that,
play with different kinds

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.440
of ways to produce texture.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:48.840
So, there's I guess these
project was a way of, in a way,

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:53.740 position:56%
I guess the first time that I showed
or that Scott saw these, he told me,

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:56.380
but that is a music instrument.

01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:57.680
I said, "What the?"

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.140
I mean, I can't say that,
but you are absolutely right.

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:02.140
And, I think we were
communicating with Scott.

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:04.860
This was probably what,
three or more years ago?

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:07.850
There was a previous
version of these that where

01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:10.320
that conversation took place.

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:15.370
And, then, at some point, he
came to our studio in Miami,

01:20:15.370 --> 01:20:17.200
and he brought other things.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.910
He just kind of brought like
a strange person that has,

01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:22.860
I mean, he will play that.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:27.090
Plays like a musician, but he also
has any number of other wizardry

01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:29.140
with things that you wouldn't
think is coming from a musician.

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:33.840
But, it creates absolutely gorgeous
music out of something like this.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.790 position:56%
So, he saw the opportunities and
gets what was presently the project.

01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:42.110
Inherent in the project was all
this kind of experimentation

01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:46.140
with your kind of sensual
understanding of rhythm,

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:50.120
intuitive understanding of
rhythm which is coming from us.

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.750
And so, this project had
several different iterations.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:55.990
The last one was kind of
more like a coffee table,

01:20:55.990 --> 01:21:02.410
elevate about three or, I mean,
about four feet from the ground.

01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:07.900 position:56%
And so, we had an upper surface and
a downward surface and undercarriage

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:10.490
of sorts which sort
of were the same,

01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:13.970
but then the undercarriage
developed the legs and was kind

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:15.600
of much more interesting
in that way.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.310
And, in that case, again,
combining different,

01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:20.860
just playing around with
different [inaudible] technologies,

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:22.160
the legs were treated [inaudible].

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.510
So, they were, in a way,
like the project was kind

01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:27.040
of in still, on stilettos.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:33.480
In the, in, when this was put
on that, in the exhibition,

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.790
everybody was asking,
"So, can I sit on it?"

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:40.080
No! I mean, are you crazy, and
can, "What can I do with it?"

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.380
I don't know.

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:42.680
I mean, it's there, right?

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.690
So, just feel it.

01:21:44.690 --> 01:21:50.250 position:56%
So, and that is a reason why I think
it's not clear to me what it is

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:53.070
because I'm not sure it is
something of that scale.

01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:57.050
My mind maybe this is a large,
again, performing arts center

01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:58.350
and you're underneath it, right,

01:21:58.350 --> 01:22:01.330
and [inaudible] big columns
are supporting it, right?

01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:05.880
So, in a way, architecture's all
of the stuff that we've been doing

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:09.870 position:56%
that has to do with product design
and with objects is very impregnated

01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:14.810
with our ways of thinking
and conceiving architecture.

01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:19.420
And then, you can see how those
legs are really picking up on some

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:24.100
of the main lines of articulation
of the longitudinal rhythms

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:27.110
of this project and bring
down to much more detail.

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:32.570
The point that receives the
structural weight of a project

01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:34.470
and transmits it to the ground.

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:38.480
Ultimately, this is what
the upper surface looks

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.370
like with all these sort
of nestle different scales

01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:43.570
of rhythmical progressions.

01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:49.500 position:56%
And, this is probably my favorite
image where [inaudible] thinks that,

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.900 position:56%
okay, 3D printing or CNC
[inaudible] is about pushing buttons

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:56.340 position:56%
and transferring digital information
to physical constructions,

01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:01.210
and it's much more a kind of
craft involved, handcraft.

01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:06.330
Like, in this project, there was
a lot of selective sanding to kind

01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:11.240
of be able to leave that certain
kind of scalloping in some parts,

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.690
in a different kind of scale
of scalloping in others.

01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:19.100
To, so playing around with how
that would relate to the ultimate,

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:22.120
the uppermost layer of
repetitive 3D printer components.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:27.040
So, there's a lot of investment
to obtain those effects,

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:33.700
and when we sent this from Miami
to New York, what we sent along

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:36.370
with it was a mirror surface

01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:39.000
that would also reveal what
the undercarriage was like.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.300
And, as you can see,
this is a rendering.

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:43.330 position:56%
It's not a photo because, of course,
it arrived completely shattered.

01:23:43.330 --> 01:23:47.260
So, we learned that it, you
know, have it cut locally.

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:50.230 position:56%
You know, have a mirror cut locally.

01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:54.590
Those were, so that was kind of,
kind of playing around with ideas

01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:57.440
of symmetry, more than [inaudible].

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:02.750
And, like I said, this had
no, we had no use for it.

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:07.380 position:56%
So, I just, I guess it was something
about, so definitely about the vibe.

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:11.060
That give you an idea of
how big or small that was.

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:13.920
And, for, I don't know
for which bodies or what.

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.380
You know, this is, what you're
seeing here is we played

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.420
around a lot with imagery
when thinking about projects,

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:25.080
and we were invited,
commissioned to do another project

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:30.180
for a gallery called Design Matters
in L.A. And, this was a great brief

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:35.970
that curators of that show
have which combine sci-fi,

01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:37.800
architecture, and eroticism.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.100
So, perfect.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.400
Down our alley.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.410
So, that seemed to be things
going back to Giger, right?

01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:46.960
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.730
&gt;&gt; Eric Goldemberg: This
project, I think this,

01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:53.640
the first one we really began to
interact with Scott in terms of,

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:57.210
I mean, long distance conversations
about the possibilities

01:24:57.210 --> 01:25:01.690
of bringing sonic components to
the architectural installations

01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:03.960
that we're doing around this time.

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:08.690
And, at the same time, the curator
asked us to sort of get some images

01:25:08.690 --> 01:25:12.300
out so they could do their campaign
to raise funds for projects.

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:15.920 position:56%
So, our first way we were developing
the actual thing that was going

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.240
to be built, we created this
kind of affect like imagery

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.330
that would tell the
story of this project.

01:25:22.330 --> 01:25:26.330
So, I think these are the
possibility the best images about,

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:29.120
if not that one where I'm
on the [inaudible] project,

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:32.100
to tell about the relation,
the kind of prosthetics,

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:36.150
the way in which we begin to think
about in terms of prosthetics

01:25:36.150 --> 01:25:40.660
when we think about music and
producing objects, instruments.

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:44.470
So, that's kind of a façade,

01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:47.430
a view image of what the
structure we thought of making

01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:51.720
which was ordinarily not made
of, not yet, at least not

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.940
yet which was basically
a, you know, speakers.

01:25:55.940 --> 01:26:00.510
You know, typical Marshall style
of speaker is a vertical condition.

01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:06.010 position:56%
We thought of come tumbling down
the speaker and then holding that in

01:26:06.010 --> 01:26:09.490
and showed them, and I showed
them height with a kind

01:26:09.490 --> 01:26:12.890
of these typical structures
that you've seen us make before.

01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:16.000
And, since those are tubular
and they look like roots,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.510
we thought those were actually
the optimal opportunity

01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:22.850
for wind instruments to be part of,
for a wind [inaudible] to be part

01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:28.170
of this kind of complex instrument
which will include ultimately a DJ,

01:26:28.170 --> 01:26:30.530
will include Scott sitting on this

01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:35.360
and playing some strings
and blowing on it.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.490
And, that's a top view of that,

01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:40.150
so it'll have two types
of output for sound.

01:26:40.150 --> 01:26:43.690
One would be kind of, kind
of multidirectional surface

01:26:43.690 --> 01:26:45.600
of the grill of the speaker.

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:51.020
That won't be the directive
sounds coming out of those tubes.

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:52.950
And, we just went through
with that brief.

01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:54.750
We took it whole heartedly.

01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:58.050
[ Laughter ]

01:26:58.050 --> 01:27:01.920
So, but, you know, we take
these things kind of really,

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.990
we think it's important to
kind of convey the sensations

01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:09.270
of what you're working with in
that the architecture and the ways

01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:12.350
in which the body could
potentially interact

01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:15.250
with architecture are
absolutely interesting,

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:17.330
at least fascinating for us.

01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:21.450
And, these are some of the typical
tests that we do at our office.

01:27:21.450 --> 01:27:23.760
We have this MakerBot
machines and what not.

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.780
Also, have a lot of those
at FIU or we have a lab

01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:31.310
where [inaudible] has
provided a machine

01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:33.480 position:56%
so every two students can share one.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:36.050
We have like 38 machines or so.

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:37.350
So, it's great.

01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:38.650
It's a luxury.

01:27:38.650 --> 01:27:43.430
And so, these are smaller
prints, but then also playing

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:46.510
around these images that we were
asked to provide for, you know,

01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:47.810
participation of the show.

01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:49.110
We thought, okay.

01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:51.600
We're going to keep playing
around with scale, with the scale

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.120
of the object, and something
which was large enough

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.480
to hold the upper bodies, you
know, we reduced it completely

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:02.570
and snugly applied it to this body.

01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:03.870
And, that was kind of an intuition

01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:07.210
of what could be possible
in terms of prosthetics.

01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:10.250
It's kind of not yet trying to
produce an instrument in that way,

01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:12.970
but we're just envisioning
something that we did later.

01:28:12.970 --> 01:28:16.790
But, for that show, that is
the scale that was meant to be,

01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:18.880
in that small details
and that speaker.

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.820
And, that's going to
further work on the project,

01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.120
and the project gets refined.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.560
And, at some point, you
begin to develop the logic

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:29.200
of how you're going to produce the
parts of it in a logical assembly.

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:30.500
I think that's still going on.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:33.610
But, anyways, those are
more detailed images of it.

01:28:33.610 --> 01:28:36.690
What you see, kind of translucent
surface on we're looking

01:28:36.690 --> 01:28:39.790
from the top down, is the surface
of the speaker which is that.

01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:43.420
And then, you see these higher
surface here is where the,

01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.390
at the height of a
DJ cannot play there.

01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:49.420
He's [inaudible], and
that's that project.

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:53.700
Now, this is really the first, in
effect, project where we were able

01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:58.810
to collaborate with Scott, and
we also created, literally,

01:28:58.810 --> 01:29:00.360
we created a guitar for it.

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:05.270
So, that's really the first product
of our collaboration with him.

01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:10.090
But, this is a mural that was
created for, it's a sonic mural,

01:29:10.090 --> 01:29:13.730
really, created for Miami
Beach Urban Studios.

01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:15.140 position:56%
There's a really cool gallery there,

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:20.330
and this is about 18
feet long or so.

01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:28.440 position:56%
And, what, the thought of this was
to create a piece that would, again,

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.370
it kind of hosts to the component
which is the music instrument.

01:29:33.370 --> 01:29:36.760
The guitar would have two possible
positions, either on the left

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.460
or on the right, extreme left
or extreme right position

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:43.110
where they can actually be docked.

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:45.340
And, it's exactly the
negative form of the guitar

01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:47.920
that receives it, and you see here.

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:49.820
There on the left side.

01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:54.860
And, the musician, Scott, picks
it up and plays it and docks it

01:29:54.860 --> 01:30:00.280
in any number of feedback
experiments can be played while the

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:03.470
guitar is in its place or played.

01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:05.380
And, that is [inaudible].

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:08.670 position:56%
So, it's probably one of my favorite
images ever from MONAD Studio

01:30:08.670 --> 01:30:09.970
with Scott playing like this.

01:30:09.970 --> 01:30:14.800
And, that guitar was actually
done with a CNC machine.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.480
It's not a 3D printed guitar.

01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:22.000
It's a milled guitar, and what
you're seeing here is separate the

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.040
unit which is the neck which Scott
typically fabricates the functional

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:28.720
component of the guitar.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.800
And we work, you know, in
consultation and collaboration

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.940
with him to design the bodies
for guitars at our office.

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:40.020
But, this mural had
several sonic performances.

01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:43.290
One of them, I'm going to play a
little bit of how that sounded,

01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:46.240
is that those curves in the
variation and topographies

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.550
of the curves were done not
just an aesthetic device,

01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:52.680
but also as something functionally

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.930
that it could be played
with these transducers.

01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:59.790
So, through these, the
transducers are none other

01:30:59.790 --> 01:31:02.270
than speakers without
the cone, right?

01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:06.680 position:56%
So, the transducers can reach, you
can, you know, measure any frequency

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.430
of any object, and
through the transducers,

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:11.650
you can get some sort
of reading of that.

01:31:11.650 --> 01:31:16.350
And, in this case,
[inaudible] position [inaudible]

01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:20.140
through the transducers
to the surfaces,

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:23.360
and according to how they were
gesturing over the surfaces

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.090
and finding, sometimes, some
deeper cavities on the surfaces.

01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:28.870
And, this time will be amplified
in different ways, right?

01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:30.200
Finding the cone or
not finding the cone

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.820
as they move through the cavities.

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:35.930
And you see some more images
of the guitar, and critically,

01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:42.450
also these surfaces had scoring or
texture of the CNC milling machine.

01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:44.200 position:56%
And, that's really the very texture.

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.840
Some parts have heavily textured.

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:48.850
Some parts are much more
smooth, and that's by, you know,

01:31:48.850 --> 01:31:52.160
by choice how you send
it as an after effect.

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.760
That's at the end, Scott and
the composers play all together.

01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:01.660
They, what is interesting is
to, is that these surfaces

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:06.700
which are generated from
a kind of architectural,

01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:10.940
from an architectural sensibility
are there to, now, for us,

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:13.280
for the first time for me at least,

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:17.120
that connection's not
inert, passive surface.

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:23.600 position:56%
But, rather, this surface is able to
partake on the music effect, right?

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:30.500
So, there's a direct effect and
a direct, say, direct consequence

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:36.030
on some of the grooves and some of
the variation on these gestures.

01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:39.030
But, what's interesting,
too, is if you were painting,

01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:40.870
you would do gestures
of this size, right?

01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:42.710
So, it's just kind of a scaler.

01:32:42.710 --> 01:32:46.220 position:56%
Very interesting scaler relationship
to me between the valley

01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:50.230
of the scale of the gestures and
the real gestures that take place

01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:53.300
when they move over it, right?

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:56.580
So, that's a detail that further
development of the guitar.

01:32:56.580 --> 01:33:01.220 position:56%
New, versions are, then, constantly
trying to perfect it, smoother body,

01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:03.100
you know, different kind of neck.

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:04.400
This is a [inaudible] guitar.

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.790
Scott could tell you much more
about it, but it's something

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:13.630 position:56%
that he created as an instrument
which has this kind of single string

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:15.710
that is a different version of it.

01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:19.100
It's about basically it's
a travel basic or smaller.

01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:24.790
But, so that's kind of that mural,

01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:29.910
and I think this is probably the
most iconic of the instruments

01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:31.670
that we've done thus far.

01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:34.570
And, probably the reason
that we're here, ultimately.

01:33:34.570 --> 01:33:39.400 position:56%
And this, this is a two string
piezoelectric violin that we created

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:44.690
where this kind of
exaggerated size of it,

01:33:44.690 --> 01:33:46.660
it is renders that we
created at the beginning.

01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:49.590
Ultimately, it is much
smaller, but what we do

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:52.230
when we create these
instruments, I think this is part

01:33:52.230 --> 01:33:53.880
that I'm really getting
excited about.

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.050
The more we do them, the more we
create [inaudible] other types

01:33:57.050 --> 01:34:01.080
of instruments, is that it has a
lot to do, not only with posture

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:07.490
and understanding how musicians
need to play or how to,

01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:11.010
how to best suit your habits,

01:34:11.010 --> 01:34:13.900
different habits of
[inaudible] musician.

01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:19.320
But, also, it does mean, in
working with these instruments,

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.640
what we're doing is we're
creating another body for it.

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.580
So, the guitars literally
have bodies only one

01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.050
of these stringed instruments
have bodies.

01:34:27.050 --> 01:34:31.450
But, what we're doing is
kind of a kind of volume

01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:37.270
which surfaces are there to kind
of interface within the body

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:41.420
of the human and what's necessary
to perform with it, right?

01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:44.940
So, for us, I think that's kind of
the more interesting opportunity

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:48.600
for the architectural exploration,
and as you can see, I mean,

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:52.330
I could tell you that this
is exactly, or not exactly,

01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:55.760
but it has the same amount of
geometric information that was

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:59.460
to produce a very large performing
arts center except it's all

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.870
concentrated on something
that has this dimension.

01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:04.100
Right? So, that's to me
the interesting point,

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:07.060
the interesting opportunity,
having done this 15 years

01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:10.350
of those very large
projects which are way bigger

01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:13.190
than what you can even
look at when you try it.

01:35:13.190 --> 01:35:18.780 position:56%
And then, all of a sudden, it's all
concentrated on one discrete device,

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:20.510
and that's more images
of the violin.

01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:25.480
I'm going to just, I think that's
the right, this is the right image

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:28.310
to tell you where we
work in Florida, right?

01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:34.960
It's kind of, it's very lush
presence of nature around it.

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:38.330
So, I think that the images speak

01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:40.000
for themselves in terms
of the violin.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:46.150
And, that we've done also a
one string piezoelectric cello,

01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:49.110
[inaudible] cello who which is
there along with the violin.

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:54.320
And, I think the other part
that's really interesting is

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.190
that all this instruments for
us have [inaudible] relationship

01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:00.910
with how they need to
interface with the body,

01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:03.810
but about the other
components that are in it

01:36:03.810 --> 01:36:07.000
which always is a process
of feedback with Scott.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.910
We get a lot of back and forth
with him in terms of accommodating

01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:18.220
for what is necessary in finding,
in his case, very creative ways

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:23.200
of alternative solutions to be
able to fit this [inaudible]

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:28.110
to be effective in terms
of the performance needs.

01:36:28.110 --> 01:36:30.310
These are details of the violin.

01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:33.820
We also created by the
time, we created like five

01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:38.010
of these instruments at once last
April for an art show in New York,

01:36:38.010 --> 01:36:42.740
and we also created for them
as another, different version

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.800
of what was then a
three dimensional,

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:48.580
two and a half dimensional mural.

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:52.990
This was a fully three-dimensional
spine slash rack of instruments

01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:59.390 position:56%
where five of these instruments
would be again mapped on latching on

01:36:59.390 --> 01:37:03.320
and in the front, there are
these three stringed instruments,

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:06.230
the violin, the treble
bass guitar, and the cello.

01:37:06.230 --> 01:37:09.160
On the back part, there
were two wind instruments,

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.550
one of which you saw an
image of Andrew's before.

01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:13.660
This was built.

01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:20.080
The pieces, again, is high
density foam structure done

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.090
with a CNC milling machine,
and all the instruments,

01:37:22.090 --> 01:37:25.310
these five instruments, four
of them actually were created.

01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:29.020
The fifth is in production, are
all 3D printed, are all 3D printed

01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:31.460
with common MakerBot, you know,

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:35.350
nothing too sophisticated
in terms of printers.

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:37.310
And they played, and they,

01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:39.250
we've been playing them
not only in Europe.

01:37:39.250 --> 01:37:44.140
Then we, throughout the summer, we
went to Japan, to China, to Russia,

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:48.180
to Prague as well,
and Washington, right?

01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:53.490
So, that's kind of an image
of the mapped-out instrument

01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:58.350
onto the topology of a surface so
that there's no, there's nothing

01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:01.680
to hold it other than
the form itself.

01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:08.090
Sure. And, I just run
through the last images.

01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:11.140
That's more on the guitar.

01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:13.440
So, you get a sense of.

01:38:17.110 --> 01:38:19.570
And, that's the cello.

01:38:19.570 --> 01:38:24.660
I think that there's a lot
of interest in bringing

01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:26.420 position:56%
to these instruments the sensitivity

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:28.810
of those structures
that we found in nature.

01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:32.060
And, in terms of that, I think
this is the most interesting one

01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:33.360
because it's the largest one.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.890
It's the one where the whole
way in which you're going

01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:38.850
to hold this instrument
is not trying to map

01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:44.560 position:56%
out an existing standard instrument,
but it's we call it hornucopian.

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:50.070
But, it's actually a very large
[inaudible] around the body.

01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:51.540
And, you saw it before.

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:52.840
That's Scott playing it.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:55.620
And, I think that what is
interesting about it is really

01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:59.260
in terms of scale, it's mapping
almost one to one the size

01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:04.310
of the roots and the branches of
the trees that originated them

01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:06.560
as triggers, image triggers.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:12.810
I think that, the last thing
I'll show you is a couple

01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:14.110
of other projects.

01:39:14.110 --> 01:39:15.920
This is the fifth that was
not, it's not yet built.

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.220
We're still adjusting it.

01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:19.770
It's getting more and
more interesting.

01:39:19.770 --> 01:39:24.150
That's another one, and
[inaudible] in production.

01:39:24.150 --> 01:39:26.530
And, this is being
printed as we speak

01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:32.850 position:56%
which is a six string electric
guitar, and it's the last instrument

01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:34.550
that is in production right now.

01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:39.510
And, I'm happy now to
let you hear Scott.

&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Thank you so much.

01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:04.650
That was interesting
to see how this evolved

01:45:04.650 --> 01:45:08.960 position:56%
out of architectural buildings,
rhythmicity, and into an instrument,

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:13.110
and it's exciting to see this
kind of a panel of people

01:45:13.110 --> 01:45:14.910
who are doing this every day.

01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:16.590
I really want to thank
you for coming.

thank you to all our panelists,
