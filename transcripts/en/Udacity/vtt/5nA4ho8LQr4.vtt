00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.734
So, in terms of a graphical interpretation, we could just add the two y values

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:11.864
here together to find f plus g of 2. We would just add 8 and 3 to get 11. So,

00:00:11.864 --> 00:00:17.445
what do you think would be f plus g of 0? You can either evaluate these

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:22.281
functions for 0, or you can use the graph. When you think you have the answer,

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:23.310
