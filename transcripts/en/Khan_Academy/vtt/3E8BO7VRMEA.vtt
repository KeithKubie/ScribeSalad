00:00:00.423 --> 00:00:03.565
- [Instructor] Consider
the density curve below

00:00:03.565 --> 00:00:05.283
and so we have a density curve

00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:08.024
that describes the
probability distribution

00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:10.438
for a continuous random variable.

00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:13.747
This random variable can take
on values from one to five

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.385
and has an equal probability

00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:19.142
of taking on any of these
values from one to five.

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:22.684
Find the probability
that x is less than four.

00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:25.351
So x can go from one to four.

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:29.851
There's no probability that
it'll be less than one.

00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.647
So we know the entire area
under the density curve

00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:34.121
is going to be one.

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:36.903
So if we can find the fraction of the area

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.661
that meets our criteria

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:41.237
then we know the answer to the question.

00:00:41.237 --> 00:00:45.404
So what we're gonna look at is
we wanna go from one to four.

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:48.725
The reason why I know we can start at one

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:51.789
is there's no probability,
there's zero chances

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.160
that I'll get a value less than one.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.798
We see that from the density curve

00:00:56.798 --> 00:00:59.882
and so we just need to think
about what is the area here?

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:02.715
What is this area right over here?

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.186
Well, this is just a rectangle
where the height is 0.25

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:11.914
and the width is one, two, three.

00:01:11.914 --> 00:01:15.414
So our area's going to be 0.25 times three

00:01:16.718 --> 00:01:18.635
which is equal to 0.75.

00:01:19.632 --> 00:01:23.799
So the probability that x
is less than four is 0.75

00:01:24.663 --> 00:01:28.142
or you could say it's a 75% probability.

00:01:28.142 --> 00:01:29.285
Let's do another one of these

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:33.675
with a slightly more
involved density curve.

00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:36.130
A set of middle school students' heights

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.713
are normally distributed with
a mean of 150 centimeters

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:43.864
and a standard deviation
of 20 centimeters.

00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:46.077
Let H be the height

00:01:46.077 --> 00:01:49.440
of a randomly selected
student from this set.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.508
Find and interpret the probability that H,

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:55.528
that the height of a randomly
selected student from this set

00:01:55.528 --> 00:01:58.917
is greater than 170 centimeters.

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:02.566
So let's first visualize
the density curve.

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:05.387
It is a normal distribution.

00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:08.208
They tell us that the
mean is 150 centimeters.

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:09.189
So let me draw that.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.189
So the mean, that is 150

00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:15.412
and they also say that we
have a standard deviation

00:02:15.412 --> 00:02:16.801
of 20 centimeters.

00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:19.252
So 20 centimeters above the mean,

00:02:19.252 --> 00:02:22.604
one standard deviation
above the mean is 170.

00:02:22.604 --> 00:02:26.863
One standard deviation
below the mean is 130

00:02:26.863 --> 00:02:29.242
and we want the probability of

00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:33.418
if we randomly select from
these middle school students,

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:37.754
what's the probability that
the height is greater than 170?

00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:40.011
So that's going to be this area

00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:42.698
under this normal distribution curve.

00:02:42.698 --> 00:02:44.375
It's going to be that area.

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.866
So how can we figure that out?

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.711
Well, there's several ways to do it.

00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:51.411
We know that this is the area above,

00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:54.364
one standard deviation above the mean.

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:56.120
You could use a Z-table

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.146
or you could use some
generally useful knowledge

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:02.787
about normal distributions
and that's that the area

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:05.677
between one standard
deviation below the mean

00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:08.787
and one standard deviation above the mean.

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:12.178
This area right over here is roughly 68%.

00:03:12.178 --> 00:03:14.218
It's closer to 68.2%.

00:03:14.218 --> 00:03:16.670
For our purposes, 68 will work fine

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.589
and so if we're looking
at just from the mean

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.555
to one standard deviation above the mean,

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:21.823
it would be half of that.

00:03:21.823 --> 00:03:26.412
So this is going to be approximately 34%.

00:03:26.412 --> 00:03:29.833
Now, we also know that
for a normal distribution,

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:34.459
the area below the mean
is going to be 50%.

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.768
So we know all of that is 50%

00:03:37.768 --> 00:03:41.340
and so the combined area below 170,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.714
below one standard
deviation above the mean

00:03:44.714 --> 00:03:48.797
is going to be 84% or approximately 84%

00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:51.950
and so that helps us figure out

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.366
what is the area above one
standard deviation above the mean

00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:57.371
which will answer our question.

00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:00.177
The entire area under this density curve,

00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:04.274
under any density curve is
going to be equal to one

00:04:04.274 --> 00:04:06.070
and so the entire area is one.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.070
This green area is 84% or 0.84.

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.957
Well, then we just subtract that from one

00:04:11.957 --> 00:04:13.957
to get this blue area.

00:04:13.957 --> 00:04:17.040
So this is going to be one minus 0.84

00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:19.683
or I'll say approximately

00:04:19.683 --> 00:04:24.028
and so that's going to
be approximately 0.16.

00:04:24.028 --> 00:04:26.887
If you want a slightly more precise value,

00:04:26.887 --> 00:04:28.860
you could use a Z-table.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.116
The area below one standard
deviation above the mean

00:04:32.116 --> 00:04:34.608
will be closer to about 84.1%

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:39.435
in which case this would
be about 15.9% or 0.159

00:04:39.435 --> 00:04:41.397
but you can see that we got pretty close

00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:44.919
by knowing the general
rule that it's roughly 68%

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.166
between one standard
deviation below the mean

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.902
and one standard deviation above the mean

00:04:49.902 --> 00:04:52.069
for a normal distribution.
