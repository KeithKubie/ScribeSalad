00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.390
Okay Michael, so
I think we're done with this section.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.230
So it's time for
you to tell me what have we learned?

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.587
&gt;&gt; So, this was the section on
generalizing generalization and scaling.

00:00:12.587 --> 00:00:13.910
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.420
&gt;&gt; So, we connected that idea
with function approximation,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.180
which was the section that I did.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.860
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.430
So, we talked about generalization
beyond function approximation.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.673
&gt;&gt; To function approximation.

00:00:24.673 --> 00:00:25.890
&gt;&gt; And beyond!

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.290
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] To function approximazation.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.474
And beyond!

00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:29.110
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.470
And what kind of
generalizations did we do?

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.765
&gt;&gt; So, we did temporal abstraction.

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:35.610
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.298
&gt;&gt; And in particular, we talked
about temporally extended actions.

00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:42.927
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, or?

00:00:42.927 --> 00:00:44.570
&gt;&gt; SMDPs?

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.060
&gt;&gt; Well, options.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.120
&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.856
&gt;&gt; And SMDPs.

00:00:49.856 --> 00:00:52.294
And, what does SMDP stand for?

00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:53.760
&gt;&gt; Semi markup decision processes.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.635
&gt;&gt; That's right, just like the truck.

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:56.770
&gt;&gt; Right,
a semi markup decision process.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.301
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:57.301 --> 00:00:59.244
&gt;&gt; And so, SMDP with 18 wheels.

00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:00.626
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:03.683
So, we learned about options in temporal
abstraction, which is really cool.

00:01:03.683 --> 00:01:04.453
And what else?

00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:06.384
&gt;&gt; I want to say that led
us to goal abstraction.

00:01:06.384 --> 00:01:08.500
&gt;&gt; It did, as a matter of fact.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.570
And in particular, do you remember?

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.540
&gt;&gt; Mediating between the different
goals, competing goals.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.739
&gt;&gt; We did, and that had a larger name.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:20.050
We talked about modular
reinforcement learning.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.900
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.730
I should remember that because I
was alive when phones were modular.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.360
That was like a big deal.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.591
&gt;&gt; Nobody was alive when
phones were modular, Michael.

00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:28.099
In any case,

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.816
one of the things that we got out-
&gt;&gt; I was alive before phones were

00:01:30.816 --> 00:01:33.709
modular and I was alive when
they switched to being modular.

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.430
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're such a hipster.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.066
Okay, so we talked about modular RL or
MRL as the kids call it, and

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:43.918
the word you were searching for
before, I think, was arbitration.

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:45.784
&gt;&gt; Arbitration!

00:01:45.784 --> 00:01:48.027
It just seems so arbitrary.

00:01:48.027 --> 00:01:49.520
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.574
We talked about one other kind of
abstraction, you might recall.

00:01:52.574 --> 00:01:53.245
&gt;&gt; State abstraction?

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.225
&gt;&gt; Yeah, state abstraction.

00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:56.494
&gt;&gt; We got to state abstraction
from the temporal abstraction.

00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:57.267
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:00.063
But not only do we get some state
abstraction from the temporal

00:02:00.063 --> 00:02:03.235
abstraction, that is, not having
to pay attention to all possible,

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:06.516
all states for all particular options,
it actually turns out that state

00:02:06.516 --> 00:02:09.411
abstraction is sort of what
function approximation is doing.

00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:10.100
&gt;&gt; Hm, okay.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.833
All right, Yeah.

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:12.092
&gt;&gt; All right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:13.557
So, I think that's pretty cool.

00:02:13.557 --> 00:02:14.613
Was anything else that we learned?

00:02:14.613 --> 00:02:16.240
I don't think so.
Well, we had a name for

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.604
at least temporal abstraction,
we should at least mention that,

00:02:19.604 --> 00:02:22.260
nothing else,
that this is a form of hierarchical.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.219
&gt;&gt; And we talked about
quintessential search, but

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.611
I think we actually meant quiescence.

00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:30.292
&gt;&gt; We did, [LAUGH], and
what does quiescence mean?

00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:31.099
&gt;&gt; Quietness.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.958
&gt;&gt; Right, and in particular
it means that you are forced-

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.160
&gt;&gt; In the search it means that there's

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.980
not all this crazy search
backtracking stuff happening anymore.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.400
Things have settled down and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.550
you know exactly what the next
thing is going to be.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.770
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So everything is settled.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.220
&gt;&gt; Right, and once things are settled,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.350
then you might as well not
count it against your search.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.710
It has no more sort of
exponential hit on your search.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.460
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; You're forced.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.340
We can treat it as almost as
if it's a single move, say, or

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.590
a single action because once you do
this the next thing's happening,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.299
the next thing's happening, the next
thing's happening and [INAUDIBLE]
