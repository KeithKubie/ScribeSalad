00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
[SFX: waves]

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.340
I had this hotel room for a week. On
the sixth day I finished it.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.760
On the seventh day I rested; and on the seventh day

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.820
I tried to write a letter to my secretary

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.410
to tell her how I wanted 
this to be typed up

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.410
and I couldn't finish a sentence!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.140
It was gone; the muse was gone.
I would start writing and all of a sudden

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.000
I'd say "Now what was I going to say?"

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.540
It was flowing for six days and then it stopped

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.590
and so I think it's an inspiration that
I can't just turn on and turn off, either

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.350
Well, I understand you've been considering

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.180
all kinds of numbers under the sun

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.460
and probably the greatest kind of numbers,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.820
because it includes everything,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.260
is the surreal numbers.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.920
The name actually came to me in the middle of the night; I have no idea...

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.960
I have a vague recollection that I saw, at one point,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.400
a French paper that talked about
'nombres sur ordinaux'

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.440
I don't pronounce it well, but sort of sur- ordinal numbers

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.650
I've never been able to track down that
paper and I don't know if I heard about it

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.900
before or after I thought of the name
"surreal" but you'll see that it's

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.380
a great name after you understand
 what surreal numbers are.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.200
John Conway invented the concept,
and his first description of it was

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.100
"All numbers great and small"

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.600
Not only big and small, 
but *inside* and everything.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.540
So people know what the real numbers are,
and I call them surreal because

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.460
there are infinitely many surreal numbers 
between any two real numbers.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.160
[off-camera] I thought the numbers between 
all the other numbers already existed, so...?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.600
-Yes, that's what almost everybody 
thought except Conway

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.409
So I learned about it...

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.570
I happened to be visiting Calgary in
Canada at the same day that

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.890
John Conway was up there, and we had lunch together and he had recently discovered

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.400
this concept, which we're going
to describe. During our lunch

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.030
he wrote out on a napkin all the rules of...

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.920
a definition of surreal numbers.
I was enchanted by this idea. Of course I

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.010
had lots of other stuff to do, but I kept
the napkin--I took it home with me.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.450
The basic idea: you have a new way to describe all numbers: you build up all

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.080
numbers starting from nothing, and
actually nothing is kind of the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.730
representation of 0.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.380
But then you can use 0 to describe
another number which turns out to be 1.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.030
And you can use 0 and 1 to make two other numbers, one of which is 2 and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.750
one of which is 1/2. And you can
continue creating more and more numbers.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.290
It's something like the creation of
a universe. Here we're creating a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.120
universe of numbers. But the numbers that you get are always... the denominator is

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.209
always 2 or 4 or 8 or 16 or something...

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.880
You don't get everything... you'll
never get 1/3 throughout the first

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.390
part of this process, but you keep on
creating numbers until you go to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.860
infinity. Then a big bang occurs and all
of a sudden you get all the real numbers.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.780
The next day after that then you create
infinity plus 1 and infinity minus 1

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.680
You also have 1 over infinity which is
a number that's bigger than 0

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.290
but it's less than any positive real
number. That's why I started calling them

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.340
surreal, because there's a number like 
pi plus one over infinity

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.600
This is between pi and 
every real number that's greater than pi

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.540
And also we keep on going and keep on creating, 
so at some point we get

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.780
1/2 of infinity, and we get square root of infinity,
and we get infinity to the infinity.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.800
All these numbers that we get
we can add, subtract, multiply, and divide them

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.480
So it goes way beyond any kind of
numbers that people ever conceived of before

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.960
[off-camera] These sound like tiny slivers that we're dropping into gaps that we didn't even know were there.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.790
-We got the tiny slivers and we also have
 the reciprocal, 1 over a tiny sliver,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.260
which is a gigantic thing, larger than we've ever...

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.040
people ever thought of before. So
that's why Conway called them "All numbers

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.430
great and small"  One night in the
middle of the night I said, "Hey, I bet

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.239
why don't I call them surreal numbers?" But the
the main inspiration that I had was,

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.260
I said "Wait a minute,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.280
this is so cool, I think maybe I ought to 
write a book for high school students

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.400
that would teach them what surreal
numbers are." There was a need for a book

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.780
that shows how mathematical research is
done, and how you take some simple

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.410
laws and create gigantic universes
 out of simple laws.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.570
And the process of discovering is
something that's usually not

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.830
taught in schools.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.419
You just are taught the facts, 
but you don't get to see the thrill of

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.130
developing these facts. I woke my wife up.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.830
We were on sabbatical
year in Norway and I...

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.740
Well maybe I didn't wake her up till the
morning, but anyway I had the idea in

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.430
the middle of night and I couldn't go to
sleep and I said "Wait a minute,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.510
a book like this ought to be written."
I was already years behind on books

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.350
that I'd promise to write, and I'm still
not done writing... that was 50 years ago

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.970
But I told my wife, you know

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.440
Jill, I decided I have to write another
book, but it's only gonna take me a week.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.620
She said, well you know that's actually
kind of a nice idea...

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.760
...time in your life when you can do
this, here we are in sabbatical and so we

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.340
worked it out that a few weeks later 
I would rent a hotel room and

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.180
downtown Oslo and spend a week writing
this book. She would come visit

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.550
me a couple times that week, because we
always wondered what it would be like to

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.750
have an affair in a hotel room! So that
was the plan, and it actually worked out

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.210
so marvelously, it was probably the
greatest week of my life.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.330
I started out every morning having a big
Norwegian breakfast.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.840
My hotel was very near where Ibsen used
to live so I could get some of his

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.610
vibes at breakfast.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.390
There were a group of 50 American
students and I could listen to what they

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.800
were saying, because I had decided to
write this book in dialogue

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.600
between two characters:

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.400
Alice and Bill. Might as well show you the book.
Here's the book and you can see Alice

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.120
and Bill here. 
My wife did the illustrations.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.220
[reading] How two ex-students turned on to pure mathematics

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.730
and found total happiness

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.870
If you look on the web you find out that
that there's a bimodal distribution of

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.919
reader comments:

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.030
there are those who are looking for
beautiful mathematics and those people

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.940
are rating it at five, and then there are
people who are looking for a novel and

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.110
and some cool sex scenes and things like
this, and they're reading in a zero and

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.090
they're saying it's the stupidest thing
I ever did

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.620
and "Why would anybody waste his time?"
So it's a kind of a litmus test

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.580
as to what you like

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.590
Oh by the way, A is Alice and B is
Bill, but there's one line here which

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.060
is said by Conway and I went and
visited John Conway a few months later to

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.470
try to make sure that I could quote him.
So in this particular part, he's...

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.300
Conway says "Rubbish. Wait until 
you get to infinite sets."

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.930
Alice says "What was that? Did you hear something? It sounded like thunder." Bill says "I'm

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.919
afraid we'll be getting into the monsoon season pretty soon." [off-camera] Is that the only line

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.090
from Conway? or is he here multiple times?
- I believe it's the only line that Conway

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.310
has in here. In the book, he's the creator and he's not only J.H. Conway,

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:19.360
but he's J. H. W. H. Conway, which is an
allusion to the tetragrammaton, the

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.060
Hebrew name for God. And the characters
in the book discover two axioms on a

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.650
stone tablet and also some markings on
the stone tablet: a surreal number

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.479
consists of two parts and you indicate it
by brackets and a colon.  You have a bracket

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:38.979
on the left.  To the left of the
colon your put some number

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:39.970
and on the right, er...

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.020
some set of numbers and on the right you
put some set of numbers, and then you

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.550
create more numbers. So you start out
with this number which is 0

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.620
and if you put 0 on the left,

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.030
you get a number which called
1 and if you put 0 on the right you

00:07:55.030 --> 00:08:00.550
get a number which is called minus 1.
And this stone that Alice and Bill find has

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.389
these markings on it, but they have to
decode what it means for

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:09.220
these markings to do. Even though I have 
hardly any plot in this book

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.650
the fact that I do refer to nature
and have a little story going on, meant

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:19.030
that I was watching everything in the
world much more intensely.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.840
Not only was I listening to what these
students said at breakfast but I'm also

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:30.010
seeing the colors..., the leaves
 on the trees... everything outside

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:35.080
There was more, too, because every
morning I was actually trying to create

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.190
the theory myself.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.649
Conway had told me the thing

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:42.569
and I saved the napkin on which he
wrote it down, but I lost it,

00:08:42.569 --> 00:08:49.019
somehow, in the next month, so
I had to try to remember it and

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:52.350
then I had to try to remember how did he
prove all these marvelous things that he

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.369
had told me about during the lunch? And I
purposely didn't plan that in advance,

00:08:56.369 --> 00:09:02.610
but every day I would work on it and
then the mistakes that I would make,

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.959
the characters in my story would make
those mistakes. But then

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:11.100
eventually, you know, I got further
and further and was able to

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.059
develop the theory.

00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:14.359
[off-camera] Had Conway not published it himself and he just...?

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.200
-No, he had the report: "All numbers great and small" was his report.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.009
Then he was writing this book

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:24.569
on numbers and games that came out a few years later.
But at that point it was

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:25.230
brand new

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.340
[off-camera] If you are so much pleasure from this
form of writing, why don't you do it more often?

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.029
-Oh no, it's too scary.

00:09:33.029 --> 00:09:36.389
It's not sustainable! [laughing]

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:42.089
I think you...  These are moments that
come once in a lifetime. But I

00:09:42.089 --> 00:09:47.459
think also there was... it wasn't
just me, there was something... the ideas

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:52.499
were coming to me as if they were being
dictated, by some muse. The last thing

00:09:52.499 --> 00:09:54.120
at night, I'd turn out the light

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.319
the next several sentences would flow
into my head. I couldn't sleep, so I'd turn

00:09:58.319 --> 00:09:58.949
on the light,

00:09:58.949 --> 00:10:02.610
I would write down those sentences,
 but they were coming so fast, I only

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.230
had time to write the first letter of
every word, so I jotted that down,

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.980
turn out the light, go to sleep. The next morning
I can figure out what I was going to say

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.240
and continue. But if I had been doing
that all my life, I think I'd be dead

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.980
long ago!  So the characters discovered
this rock and it's covered with

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.180
Hebrew writing

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.410
that explains two rules, and
everything flows from two rules:

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.880
The first rule is: every number
corresponds to two sets of previously

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.200
created numbers

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.850
and furthermore, there's a left set
and a right set

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.330
Nothing on the left is greater than or
equal to anything on the right

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.899
That's the first rule. This makes a new
number. The second rule

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:46.410
describes what does it mean to be greater
than or equal?

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.770
So this is the number that we call 0,
there's nothing on the left and nothing

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.790
on the right.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:58.589
Here we put 0 on the left and nothing on
the right, and this is a number that we now

00:10:58.589 --> 00:11:05.520
call 1, but on the stone that Alice and Bill discover, 
it was indicated by a

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:13.529
vertical line. And if we put 0 on
the right and nothing on the left

00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:19.470
then we get something that on the stone 
was indicated a by horizontal line. Now this

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:26.640
sort of Day Zero is when we got the
number 0. The next day we got the number

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.640
1, we'll call it Day One.
On Day Two,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:39.329
now we can have a set of numbers, so we
can put 0 and 1 on the left and nothing

00:11:39.329 --> 00:11:46.290
on the right, for example. And this is
actually... turns out to be 2.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.880
Or we could put 0 on the left and 1 on
the right

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.570
this is the number that turns out... 
is going to be 1/2. But now,

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:59.760
there was a classical definition of real
numbers by Dedekind called

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.240
Dedekind cuts: you have a set of
rational numbers on the left and a set

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.459
of rational numbers on the right. That
defines a cut between the two and that

00:12:08.459 --> 00:12:12.180
gives real numbers. 
So Conway's genius was that...

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.380
keep on going and allowing, besides
rational numbers, to allow any set of

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.649
surreal numbers. After i get to a
point where

00:12:19.649 --> 00:12:25.800
0 and 1... (let me put a comma here)
And a 1 and 2, let's call it,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.709
and you get all of these here,

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:34.439
but nothing on the right, this is
infinity. Then we find out what's

00:12:34.439 --> 00:12:39.480
infinity plus 1? And that turns
out... actually got an infinity here, ...

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.910
These rules might have been invented
before Dedekind's rules and that everybody

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:49.559
for 100 years had learned about this in
school, and we'd considered that

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:53.550
this is the way numbers are. Then
physicists would have said that this

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.059
is actually part of the real universe,
that these numbers aren't strange but that

00:12:57.059 --> 00:13:00.629
that these are basic. And people
probably would have discovered the real

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:04.980
numbers as a special subset of
the surreal numbers. There's no reason for

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.660
us to think that the universe obeys the
laws of real numbers.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.980
People used to think that the real
world had Euclidean geometry, but now

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:20.040
people know that space bends.
The patterns that are revealed here are as

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.689
mind-boggling as anything in mathematics
and are far from being explored. Every year

00:13:24.689 --> 00:13:29.069
more and more converts come along
and and we find people winning prizes

00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:32.069
because they've advanced 
the theory of surreal numbers.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.450
...which is a subtle point...

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.540
So, I'd lost a napkin

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:44.840
but it turned out that the rule that
I gave in my first draft during those

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.010
six days was not his rule actually, but
it was subtly different.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.650
Here, for example, is Chinese translation.
[Conway] ...don't like thinking of my impending

00:13:54.650 --> 00:14:02.210
death, [pauses] and you know, 
I haven't got all that many years left...

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.140
I don't quite know how many
