1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,800
[inaudible]

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,350
let's shift, let's talk about the
scary you right. Are you ready?

3
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:13,670
I tried to do this. We did
the happy stuff. Now we're
going to plunge with, look,

4
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:15,590
you know, Dave, when I began
to research this thing,

5
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:19,520
I probably ended up reading about 200
books on this topic when the end and,

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,950
and I'm a happy guy. I like happy things.
I like technology. I'm an optimistic guy,

7
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:29,300
but this really put me in
a dark place. Uh, digging
through this history, uh, from,

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,350
from Hagle essentially up to
Julius Caesar Eveleigh and the,

9
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:37,430
and the post were Nazi movement and
realizing that there was an intellectual

10
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:40,610
stream that stretched
over all of these years.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,400
Let's go back 200 years.
Yeah.

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,330
So let's go back 200 years when you
talk about right wing collectivism.

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,183
Yeah.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,340
Because I think most of my audience now
understands what left wing collectivism

15
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:55,970
is cause that's what we've got right now.
Very in a very strong way.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,300
Talk to me about right wing
collectivism. Okay, Dave,

17
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:04,130
I'm going to tell you a story.
Um, I, I love Ludi muses.

18
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:08,300
I think he was a genius, right? And
I thought I'd read all of his works,

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,630
but in there is a transcript of a lecture
he gave in 1956 at the San Francisco

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,830
Public Library.

21
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,450
And he had about three sentences in
there that just knocked me over and I

22
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:22,790
couldn't believe it.
It cause it explains so much.

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,680
He says something like this and he's
speaking casually, right? He says,

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,590
Hagle ruined German
philosophy for a century. Uh,

25
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,270
his original followers became,
uh,

26
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,250
believed that all of history
would end in the Prussian state,

27
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:44,510
in the Prussian church, having all power
in the individuality, individualism,

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,900
they became the right Hegelians.

29
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,750
Galleons that became the Nazis
is the dissonance of this,

30
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,100
uh, of the writer.
Gillian's became the lefty.

31
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,130
Gillian's they wanted a universal
transformation of humanity and a,

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,610
and a historical drive to, to something
other than the commercial society.

33
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:06,110
They became the Marxists
and, uh, and the communists.

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,290
And he said that that's, it's
left, right yelling aneurysm.

35
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,880
And that explains pretty much
all political history. And
I closed that. I thought,

36
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,080
hmm,

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,700
that explains more than practically
any other book I've ever read.

38
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,700
And so I began to,
began to explore this.

39
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,710
I understood the left to Galleon as I
understood Marxism. I mean, those were,

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,450
those were our professors, right?
Um, and there are annoying.

41
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,560
Um, but what I did not understand what
the writer Gillion of them and what that,

42
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,940
what that tradition looks like.
It's the throne and alter, uh, this,

43
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,970
this historic says to view that the
nation should constitute its own unit of

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,220
profound integrity, uh, that, that
that is more important than the,

45
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:57,200
than the individual. And that commercial
society was too chaotic. That it,

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,670
that that was leading us,
giving us wrong kind of progress.

47
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,030
That it was flattening out the hierarchies
that we need to have an orderly life.

48
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,443
Right?
This is,

49
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,480
this is the writer Gelien
pitch that ultimately by mid
20th century becomes this

50
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:17,050
very dangerous, dangerous
movement in Europe. You know, um,

51
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,000
that became catastrophic.
Uh,

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,830
but it gradually emerged from all
the way from, from Hagle because,

53
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,260
uh,
this is at the end of the endless,

54
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,270
seemingly in those Franco Prussian wars.

55
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:35,290
There's this battle at the battle
of Jenna that, that Germany lost.

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,280
And the explanation for that was
that it was a temporary setback.

57
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:43,720
That history was going to determine
that Germany would rise despite,

58
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,860
despite the choices of individuals.
History has got its wind.

59
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,940
It's like a Meta narrative that, that,
that was going to override everything.

60
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:56,350
Hegel himself was a theologian
by the way. Um, and, and so this,

61
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,240
this view began to kind of spread
throughout German academia. And it was,

62
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,690
it ended up being imported
to the United States through,

63
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,700
through circuitous means, but what,
but one of the great theorists of the,

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,450
of the 1840 [inaudible] who, and 1850s
who brought the suit to the United States,

65
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:14,410
there's physical list,

66
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,990
who was one of the first economist to
repudiate the free trade tradition of, of,

67
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,880
of the Smithian Manchester Rides.
And that was celebrating the nation as a,

68
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:28,020
as a unit, as a productive power, uh, and,

69
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,650
and believed in tariff
walls, uh, which was strange.

70
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,320
And I've read his book, uh, but,

71
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:39,730
and that had a huge influence of American
trade policy is actually the late 19th

72
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:42,610
century. And, um,

73
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,880
and it began to flow out from there.
So Thomas Carlyle and,

74
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,280
and Britain now,
uh,

75
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,420
began to celebrate the
great man theory of history.

76
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,410
And really we're nothing without Napoleon,
without,

77
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:59,670
without gigantic of figures
that we can worship, admire,

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,580
and s and our individuality
should be subsumed within them.

79
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,680
They act for us. They're God,
like, you know, and, and,

80
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,280
and it was Thomas Carlyle who
first coined the phrase, um,

81
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,980
uh,
quite coin,

82
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,580
the phrase to describe economics
as being the dismal science.

83
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,290
And the reason he said that is that
every condoms team new imagined a world

84
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,340
without slavery. And he said,
kind of have a website slavery.

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,200
That's a tread for world without
slaves. You don't have masters, right?

86
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,350
And we need a world with
masters and slaves, so we can,

87
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,710
we can have a vision of hierarchy
and greatness without that,

88
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:39,580
we don't have greatness.

89
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,810
So he began to see this building of
this intellectual apparatus that was not

90
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:44,461
left together.

91
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:47,800
And there wasn't Marxist who was
actually anti Marxist in a strange way,

92
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,750
but as an alternative
form of collectivism, uh,

93
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,760
it began with a kind of historicism
and a celebration on nationalism of the

94
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,850
German state.
It began to grow with this,

95
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:59,210
this alternative theory
of trade that we should,

96
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:02,180
we should build up tariff
walls and Carlisle with his,

97
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,910
with his great man theory of
history and then, and then, uh,

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,130
Rueskin and Britain with his haste
hatred of Commercial Society because they

99
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,200
believed that somehow,
uh,

100
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,850
commerce was ruining quality and culture
and was giving us mass production.

101
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,450
But we all need to be really
doing is, is, is, uh, uh,

102
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,630
living in guilds and, and
making our own stuff, you know,

103
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:26,930
because we're going to destroy English
life and English country life. And so, so,

104
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:30,560
uh, a full scale reactionary trend
on the right began to develop.

105
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,220
And were you always a
racial element to know?

106
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,420
So that's what's interesting.

107
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,380
I'm so glad you asked that because
it comes about first of all, through,

108
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,830
through nationalism now and the,

109
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,460
and the early 1820s and 1830s,
this celebration of nationalism.

110
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,830
Now you have to ask yourself,
what is a nation, Bret,

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,930
what do we mean when we say nation?
And,

112
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,030
and I'm taking this a lot
of this from, um, uh, from,

113
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,020
uh, uh, an essay gave it,

114
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,940
given the 1882 by Erin ran in
a great French historian. Uh,

115
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,600
looking back at the rise
of nationalism said,

116
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:12,740
there's only five ways you can consider
nationalism. Uh, you consider, uh,

117
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,230
the geographic definition.
So we're just live in this space.

118
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,490
There's a dynastic element.

119
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:21,260
We can all trace our lineage back
to the great founders of our nation.

120
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:24,200
There's a language theory of nationals
and we all speak the same language.

121
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,270
There's a religious theory of nationalism.

122
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,320
We all worship God and it precisely the
same way I believe in transubstantiation.

123
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,790
You believe in consubstantiation,

124
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,480
we can't be part of the same nation
and that case, right? And then finally,

125
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,230
and probably most insidiously, there
was the ratio, the ratio of view.

126
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,630
And that came along and
essentially the 1860s and 1870s,

127
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,660
with a misapplication of Darwinian
theory and scientific racism came along.

128
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,050
And that's wept through academia,
particularly in the United States.

129
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,610
Like nothing you've ever seen.

130
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,670
It's absolutely astonishing
how much racism with Orthodoxy
and American academia

131
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,550
in the 1890 [inaudible],

132
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,670
the very first monograph
published by the American economy,

133
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,200
Economic Association by gay men,
I think his name is Andre Hoffman.

134
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,340
It was called race traits
of the American Negro.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,870
And the first chapter dress goes all
in. You know, it's, it's, it's the,

136
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:22,280
the horror of the black people that
don't have the right values. They can't,

137
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,290
can't save money.
They're just terrible.

138
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,850
A shiftless and lazy and
ghastly and uncivilized double.

139
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:32,660
And now chapter two, the Jews, you
know, these people, I don't know what,

140
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:35,390
they've got this crazy out
of control commercial ethic.

141
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,920
They can't stop hoarding money.

142
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,160
They really went for it. Yeah. And then
the third chapter three is the slops and,

143
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:48,020
and so on. And so the American Economic
Association, you know, and then, uh,

144
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,740
and there was essentially, no, what do you
think was happening in the world there?

145
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,750
That it was taking a time,
what was happening? Dave?

146
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,990
Laissez faire had transformed societies
so dramatically that there the

147
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,970
intellectuals felt that
they had lost control.

148
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,250
And that you might think that when the
world becomes massively prosperous and we

149
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:11,790
suddenly have cities rising up and we've
got steel that is transverse in large

150
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:16,530
bodies of water and we're developing the
telephone and indoor electricity and,

151
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,270
and people are living longer lives and,

152
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,200
and so much wealth was being created
that everybody was data per say. Hooray.

153
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,610
We found the answers.

154
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,430
But the gatekeepers who had
controlled everything for so long.

155
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:28,590
So that's so interesting
because of revolt.

156
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,090
This is sort of what it feels
like now to me, the gatekeepers,

157
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,060
we've had so much success.
There's so,

158
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,360
there's so many reasons right now to
understand how great everything is.

159
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,340
That book right there by
Steven Pinker enlightenment is,

160
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,230
is all about how great things are.
And a gratefully we are,

161
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,180
there is less violence now and all sorts
of the revolt you always have to be on

162
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,140
the gatekeepers are having,

163
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,090
are not in the narrative to intellectuals
are what digital closet calls the

164
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:01,050
clerisy. Right? So it's, it's
the high end intellectuals,

165
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:03,720
it's the power elite bureaucrats in the,
in the public,

166
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,650
the permanent peace keepers of
our civic culture. You know, it's,

167
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,740
it's the political class. And, uh,

168
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,670
so this is sort of what for my
audience that maybe not follow this,

169
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:18,240
this is sort of what the New York Times
is sort of, right. But like, yeah,

170
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,450
maybe I shouldn't have said
it so obviously, but like
that's kind of what it is.

171
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,690
Like that class, the ruling
class. Yeah. The ruling class.

172
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,720
And they were in full scale revolted.

173
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,690
They did not like what was happening
to the world and the 18, 80s and 90s,

174
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:33,100
because of the loss of control.
And so the,

175
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:38,101
the scientific racism came along to add
to the celebration of dictatorship and

176
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:39,091
the,
and the,

177
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:44,010
and protectionism and the new nationalism
to add a very insidious element,

178
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,310
which culminated in Eugenics ideology.

179
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,940
And that's when it gets very strange.
And this is where,

180
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,510
this is where the reading
gets very difficult because
now you're reading all the

181
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:59,250
way into, uh, you know, the, the, the
1910s with the works of Oswald Spangler,

182
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:04,170
you know, the right, who galleon German
theorist that enraptured every American,

183
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:07,230
you know, they're all reading his book.
Oh my God. The decline of the West.

184
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,630
We better reconstitute
ourselves as the tribe,

185
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:13,950
or we're going to be eaten alive by
flood out the other foreigners and then,

186
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,630
but there's a strain of that that's
still going on right now. You know,

187
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,790
there's nothing new, you know,
like, um, and you know, this,

188
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,820
this very funny book called the passing
of the great race by Madison Grant,

189
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:27,720
uh,

190
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,340
that was on every coffee table in
the late 19 teens and early 19th,

191
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:36,360
20th, you know, with this forecasting doom
for the white race. You know, and he was,

192
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,830
he was a fascinating figure because, um,
you know, of course I've read his book as,

193
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:45,120
as it everybody did. Everybody the great
Gatsby makes a pass in reference to it.

194
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,850
It was that popular. It was
that popular. And I tell you,

195
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:51,450
there's not a single outright
racist alive today who hasn't,

196
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,820
is not repeating those cliches that
were written by Madison Grant has all

197
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:58,630
pseudoscience is all just nonsense. And
it's just ridiculous. Embarrassing. But,

198
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,600
but it keeps being resurrected.
But here's what's interesting.

199
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,640
He was a thoroughgoing a Darwinian,
because you recall that Darwin,

200
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,030
Darwin had two great books,
origin these pieces.

201
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,470
The other was called the descent of man.

202
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,100
And the descent of man had the very
unfortunate paragraph in there where he

203
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:20,020
regret regrets. Um, the
invention of mass, uh,

204
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,850
disease killing, uh, uh,
uh, cures essentially.

205
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,300
It's like if we keep curing people and
we keep feeding a inferior people and,

206
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:30,400
and curing disease,

207
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:34,540
then then our genetic stock students
kind of go down and down, you know, so,

208
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
so they were all kind of playing
off this little, the passage.

209
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,550
But Madison Grant was,

210
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,290
was not an unusual by American x to
academic standards at all. They, they,

211
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,020
this was orthodox in the 18,
Tencent 1820s.

212
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,330
What made Madison Grant Interesting?

213
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:53,620
You can look up his Wikipedia entry
right now. Uh, if you look it up, it'll,

214
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:57,160
it'll celebrate him as the, as the
father of the National Park Service.

215
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,660
Well,
in the course of my research,

216
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:06,590
I'm wondering to know what
is the connection between
Madison's grants hardcore

217
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,700
eugenics based racism and as
environmentalist them? Hmm.

218
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,010
What is the relationship there? And it's
not just two people usually people have,

219
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,710
have it figured out in their own heads.

220
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,450
I went through and read some of
his works on, on the environment.

221
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,320
It turns out that he had a
master race theory of nature,

222
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,830
and he went to the California redwoods
and he looked at these glorious mighty

223
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:31,040
trees and he was horrified to see
they're being cut down for, for, for,

224
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,820
for making coffee tables and
boats and things like that.

225
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:38,440
And he thought it was dis genic to nature.
So he wanted the master race,

226
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,210
uh, the California redwoods to
be protected. And that's that.

227
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,250
So that's why he started
the national park service.

228
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,780
And now the left Harold's them as,
as, as great as a great visionary,

229
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:52,930
environmentalist.
But actually he was like a tree Nazi.

230
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,110
I don't know how else you want to call.

231
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,460
It's very creepy stuff. We
don't have enough Nazi labels
being thrown around now.

232
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:04,570
We're going to have tree nuts even. Sure.
That already was nuts. Um, but you know,

233
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:07,510
you can just march through the
history and it gets worse and worse.

234
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:11,890
And then to me, Dave, it'll, it all
culminates in the works of Karl Schmidt,

235
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,430
uh, from the, from the late 1930s and his,

236
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,190
and his amazing book called
the concept of the political.

237
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,190
And if you'll give me just one quick
second to explain this, because,

238
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,730
because you as a liberal,
uh,

239
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,000
need to read this book because it's
the most passionate, I would say,

240
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:32,560
and even competent attack on liberalism
Britain in the 20th century. Now,

241
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,170
Carl Schmidt,

242
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,900
that's a jurist of brilliant man and a
philosopher and a hardcore Nazi. Okay.

243
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,760
He wasn't tried at Nuremberg. He escape.
I'm merely an intellectual. Okay, sure.

244
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,830
His book concepts with the political says,
what's wrong with liberalism?

245
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,340
I tell you, it's still nothing
happens, nothing dramatic.

246
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,310
There's nothing requires
no courage whatsoever.

247
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,030
Liberalism is a life in which we all
benefit from each other's presence.

248
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,530
We all just trade with each other.

249
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:04,850
What kind of life is that where we all
just are kind of the same and like each

250
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,180
other and hold backyard barbecues
and go baseball games and,

251
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,980
and just get richer and live longer
lives and send our kid to college.

252
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,670
This is terrible. We need
to live big, dramatic,

253
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,850
mighty, bold, courageous,

254
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,400
transformative lives and live in
times that, that, that, that, that,

255
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,440
that are shocking, that are amazing,
that make our lives worth living,

256
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,320
that requires above all else politics.

257
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,300
Liberalism imagines a world without
politics. That's a terrifying world.

258
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,080
What we need is a world of politics and,

259
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,090
and he continues to lay
it out chapter by chapter.

260
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:43,091
Why we have to destroy the liberalism and
celebrate the concept of the political

261
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and for him that means having friends
and having enemies defeating your enemies

262
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:51,800
and rallying around your friends.

263
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,220
Now who are your friends and who
your enemies and Carl Schmidt says,

264
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,900
at some level,
it doesn't matter.

265
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,890
What matters is that
they exist and the state,

266
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,410
the powerful men will choose them for us.

267
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,540
They will decide who our
friends and our enemies are.

268
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,400
Now let's be clear what we mean by enemy.

269
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,320
I don't don't mean
somebody you don't like.

270
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,740
I mean the willingness to kill there has
to be the presence of real bloodshed in

271
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:22,100
your time. For you to have a
sufficiently prescient sense of enemies,

272
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:27,050
this so that you'll feel the intense
desire to rally around your fence for your

273
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:30,500
friends and experience
that, that, that the,

274
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:34,490
the awesomeness that only comes
with belonging to a group. So,

275
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,140
so he says,
so he,

276
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,270
at the end feeling there is
that you can't achieve what,

277
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:45,340
what the real purpose of a human is that
you can experience whatever the highs

278
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,820
of belongingness essentially,

279
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:54,740
and the life of drama that a big important
life without being part of a kind of

280
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:57,380
a, uh, a group on the move, the
slaughtering and its enemies.

281
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,510
And so we have to have the presence of,
of bloodshed.

282
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,560
So it really is the opposite of live and
let live. It is. It's so through, through,

283
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:06,020
through bloodshed comes life and without,

284
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:08,840
without bloodshed and death
and violence in politics,

285
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,990
then you're just going to live at an
irrelevant life. And we can't have that.

286
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,940
So he was in many ways the philosophical
architect of the Holocaust. Again,

287
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:19,850
not a leftist, not a Marxist,
although he dabbled in it.

288
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:21,830
You find that so from a lot of these,
right?

289
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:25,700
Collectivists the writing galleons that
they dabbled. Guys like Verner some Bart,

290
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:28,100
right? He was once a communist
who later became a Nazi.

291
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,680
Carl Schmitt dabbled in and leftism
and then went full. Right? Um,

292
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,020
and it was in many ways the culmination
of the writing galleon ideology in

293
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,100
crossfit. So it's a book worth
reading and contemplating.

294
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,110
And I would say to anybody who
rejects liberalism, you know,

295
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,320
be honest about where
you're going with this.

296
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,220
This is the opposite of the celebration
of death in the quirks of crush Schmidt,

297
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,620
very powerful thinker,
highly regarded,

298
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,580
even today worth reading
and worth reflecting on what
kind of world do you want

299
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:02,760
to live in to live in peace with others.

300
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,920
Where do you want a slot at your friends,

301
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,750
a slaughter your enemies
and rally with your friends.

302
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,310
So move me from that point
1930s into of course,

303
00:18:12,311 --> 00:18:17,300
obviously into Nazi Germany and, and then
we'll, we'll finish where we, yeah, and,

304
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,150
and you know, my book really does it
1958 not necessarily. It didn't have to,

305
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:24,840
but I started to get really queasy
about what happened after World War II.

306
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,850
A lot of the writing Gelien movement
went underground, you know, um,

307
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,640
and,
and became a kind of a,

308
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,670
a quiet neo Nazi movement that never
really had access to social media that

309
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,920
clearly weren't in
academia, obviously. And,

310
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:45,780
but the ideology never entirely went
away. And, and it was just lying in, wait,

311
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,590
wait,

312
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,580
waiting for the failure of the left and
for the resentment of the population

313
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:54,160
against the left to rise up
and receive would get a fever.

314
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:58,230
It enough pitch that it would, it
would then, ah, come on full force.

315
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:02,640
And that's really what's happening
in Europe. Russia, United States,

316
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,870
it's an alternative form of
collectivism has got a different flavor,

317
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,830
a different orientation,
a different kind of resentments,

318
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,020
but it's still drags in this gigantic
history of writing Ghillean ideology,

319
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,380
the celebration of the Dick, great
man, dictator, the protectionism,

320
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,600
the anti-immigration,
the nativism,

321
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:26,490
the nationalism that could take any one
of five forms, including the racism. Um,

322
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,710
what do you make about how now,

323
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,630
and it's obviously largely
because of the Internet.

324
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,640
It seems to be happening in so many
places at once. We're seeing this unholy.

325
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,450
It's an oddly unholy alliance between
the collectivists left and then that

326
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,010
drives it made.
It's exactly what you're saying.

327
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,980
Then you've got this other thing that's
just waiting there for these guys to go

328
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:46,650
to bananas. I was like, oh,
we got all these answers.

329
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:49,080
Meanwhile you have the
liberals and everyone,

330
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,910
all the decent 80% of us that
are trying to live and let live.

331
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,140
Part of it really comes down to this.
There's a weird sociological,

332
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,860
cultural contradiction at the heart
of social democratic leftist ideology.

333
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,810
On one hand they,

334
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,010
they wanted to build gigantic institutions
that are redistributed worry and

335
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:11,160
we're supposed to treat each other like
a big family and we're supposed to have

336
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:14,880
this homogeneous nation state and the
other hand they're celebrating diversity

337
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:19,560
and encouraging mass immigration and
heterogeneous populations, and guess what?

338
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:23,610
Those don't really work together.
So you build gigantic institute,

339
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:27,540
gigantic states that presume sort
of that we're all one family.

340
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,620
And then you throw in this,
this, this diverse set of people,

341
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:35,250
especially with the refugee crisis in
Europe and immigration in the United

342
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,530
States, and people are looking around
going down these people at my family,

343
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:41,820
I don't even like these. Yeah. And yet I'm
paying for them. That is a prescription.

344
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,760
I mean that, that blows up. I'm,
that's a disaster. It's a powder keg.

345
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,270
And so it was the left and there's
this core contradiction that they have

346
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:51,520
between on a welfare state on one hand,

347
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,180
and there's celebration and Hetero
heterogeneous populations on the other

348
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,780
welfare state and diversity.
They don't, they don't work.

349
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,990
And that basically puts us where
Germany sort of is at right now, right.

350
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,090
Where they said, okay, 3
million people come on in.

351
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,070
Now all these people are
going to have to pay for you.

352
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,300
We're not going to integrate you properly.
I mean, this is not only, you know,

353
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:12,550
you've got that I did to Terrian movements
rising up in Germany and in Hungary

354
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:15,280
and of course in Russia in,
and of course the US, you know,

355
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:19,390
so it all just kind of follows. It's,
it's inevitable. The left created this,

356
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,290
I mean, if, if after World War II
we had just embraced liberalism by,

357
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,840
we should have, like, we should have,
we wouldn't be where we are today,

358
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,020
but we have another chance. And that's
why you're here. And that's why I'm here.

359
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,000
We have another chance now to,

360
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,680
to re-embrace liberal liberal theory
and to, and to reject the left are,

361
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,430
and don't feel yourself just because
of the enemy of your enemy is there.

362
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,780
It doesn't mean it has to be your friend.
I mean,

363
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,350
we really do need to think of
ourselves as kind of a, uh,

364
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,080
dissidence from a political culture that,

365
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:52,110
that rally around freedom and human
rights and universal human rights and,

366
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,930
and the noble meant of humanity, the
champion of the common person, uh,

367
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,550
the rights of everyone to live
freely with each other, to,

368
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:06,400
to gain value from each other. And to
live in peace and stop thinking of our,

369
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:08,830
of our fellow human beings
as possible enemies.

370
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,190
We don't want to get drafted into this,
the political world that call Schmidt.

371
00:22:13,191 --> 00:22:17,080
Imagine for us, as I was
describing crossfit, you,
you see it happening, right?

372
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,060
That Schmitty in view to slice and
dice the population. Who Do you like?

373
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:25,540
Who Do you hate? You know who
is, who are your people? It's,

374
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,260
this is not a good life. Yeah. And we feel
like chopping away at both sides, right?

375
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:31,120
Yeah, we do. We feel it. And so we don't,

376
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,710
I just don't feel like we have to be
part of it. I mean, as best we can, uh,

377
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,340
let's find things we love,
you know, and go places.

378
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:42,460
We love me with people who love
of all different backgrounds,

379
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,940
all different kinds of cultures. Learn
about alternative religions, learn,

380
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,830
learn about new ways to do things,
travel, right? And the age of liberalism,

381
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:54,730
there were no such things as passports,
you know? All right, so let's,

382
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,740
let's spend the last portion here on
just these last five years really here in

383
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:02,950
America, because I remember just even, it
doesn't have to be the last five years,

384
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:05,590
but let's say even three years ago,
just,

385
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:10,030
it's sort of the emergence of Trump as
a candidate when people started saying

386
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:11,670
the phrase, all right. Yeah.

387
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,400
And I did a bunch of videos on
it where I was basically saying,

388
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:19,690
I see two strains to this thing and people
are now using this video against me.

389
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,020
And what I saw was there was the
sort of fun money makers and the,

390
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,510
all of the people who were having fun
online doing often doing awful things and

391
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,150
Nazi imagery just to upset
people in power and whatever.

392
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,370
But sometimes very fun things too.
And funny things.

393
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,460
But I saw it like just the real sort of
shit posters as they're known in the pet

394
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,640
pay people.
The whole idea was we could get,

395
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,910
we can start sending a frog to some like
intellectual and they're gonna think

396
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:48,950
that's a racist thing. And then
they would, they would say,

397
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:50,700
I'm being under attack from racist.

398
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,200
Like they would actually give them
exactly what they want it. So I saw this,

399
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,870
this sort of fun shit
posting whatever part of it.

400
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:59,660
Not to say it didn't have elements
I didn't like, but there were,

401
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,260
I saw that as the bulk of it.
And then alongside of that,

402
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:07,760
was this that you're talking about the
identitarian part, the true racist part,

403
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:11,900
the part that had been sort of underground
for a long time and then because of

404
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:15,580
social media now is finding that it could,
yeah.

405
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,070
Actually you influence people and beat
it up. Okay. And now and you know,

406
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:24,630
and I think the media really fueled both
of those things because basically when

407
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,210
Hillary said that deplorables comment,
she,

408
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:29,820
she just lumped the whole
damn thing together.

409
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,410
And I think if she had not said that,

410
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,590
I think it's very
possible she be president.

411
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,640
Aoun should help the Kashi
almost made though. Right? Exist.

412
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,370
So my question really is, how would
you just define the alt right flat out?

413
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:44,990
If I asked you right now, because I think
the definition has changed and has it,

414
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,470
but if I asked you right now, in, in
the summer of 2018 the definition, you,

415
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,080
the phrase all right, comes
about what, 10 years ago,

416
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:57,400
I think it was coined by Paul God prayed
who himself as a follower of met. Yeah.

417
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,210
Um, I, I would rather
look at this as a, as,

418
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,010
as a writer, Galleon collectivist
movement, you know, and,

419
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:08,280
and general that stretches from the
early 19th century all the way up to the

420
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:12,650
present that's characterized by love
of dictatorship, a love of power,

421
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,810
protectionist trade policy, nativist
immigration policy and [inaudible],

422
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,610
and a resentment against the commercial
life because it's because it's, it's,

423
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,770
it's too heterogeneous into an ennobling
of humanity. I mean that too. To me,

424
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:29,100
the alt right is one species, I
guess you could say. One flavoring,

425
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:30,990
one instanciation yeah.

426
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,140
Of a much larger problem
that stretches way back,

427
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:39,030
which is an illiberal theory of,
of life in liberal theory of, of,

428
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:43,980
um, of, of politics. So that's, I
think the right way to think about it.

429
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,070
My first time I heard Trump
speak was July, 2015 and,

430
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,330
and I don't even think we were using
the term alt right at the time,

431
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,700
but he opened his speech with,
um, the immigrants are a problem.

432
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:57,534
I thought,
hmm.

433
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,720
Then there was protection of their foreign
goods protections when you protection

434
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,860
some. I thought, hmm, that's third
big point was I can fix everything.

435
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,660
This is all sounding strangely
familiar to me. You know, that's,

436
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,520
that's like the three pillars of a writer
Galleon ideology essentially. And, um,

437
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,700
I realized we had a problem
and I understand, I do,

438
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,460
why people had a high regard for him.

439
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,140
He was going to save us from,
from the problems that Obama had created.

440
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:29,610
And God knows those problems. And, and
the left has gotten just bonkers, right?

441
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,550
So we need,
we need protection from that.

442
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,810
But he introduced his own form of problems
and he unleashed it's own form of,

443
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,150
of dangerous and,
and potential,

444
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,360
potentially very despotic
arrangements of power.

445
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,290
And some ways are more insidious
because they appeal to bourgeoisie.

446
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,570
The left is always been a little
bit culturally as strange,

447
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,420
you know, from, from
mainstream of American life.

448
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,630
Whereas Trump connects
very closely with it.

449
00:26:57,631 --> 00:27:01,290
This is why fascist movements have been
oftentimes much more successful than,

450
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,170
than left socialist
once I got to get this,

451
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:06,090
because I would have thought the opposite.
So if you,

452
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,710
if you would have asked
me before you said that,

453
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:11,610
I would say the left is the one that
is understood the culture part of this,

454
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:16,050
at least in the American piece of this.
Certainly academia and culture,

455
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,610
what you could and couldn't joke
about that all agriculture. Yeah,

456
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,690
the left is as high except you know,
I mean,

457
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,670
socialist ideology never came from below.
It was never working man's philosophy.

458
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,150
It was always an mental, I was always the
intellectual. So it was a top down rule.

459
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,600
There's always the ruling class that
hatched associates, socialist ideology.

460
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:36,000
They never would have been.
It's communism, socialism,

461
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:39,960
all these things without the
intellectual class. But fascism,

462
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:43,620
if you'll allow me to use that term, uh,
kind of flips the narrative a little bit.

463
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:47,850
It's more, it's much more of a from
below that you can keep your religion,

464
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,450
you can keep your nationhood, your
identity, your race, your language,

465
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,480
rally around your friends,
your family, you know,

466
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:59,240
all the things that you believe are
true. You and, and, and, and, and,

467
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,800
and within me as a person,
as a leader, I will,

468
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:06,801
I will embody all your values and
collected by us in a way that that means

469
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:12,270
something important, that, that connects
with who you are. So in that sense,

470
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:16,730
it's a very effective, uh,
way of being in liberal.

471
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,980
All right?
So all that said,

472
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,230
what is our way out of this
precarious position? I,

473
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:28,050
I think I get what you're yeah,
I get the theme of what you're doing here.

474
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,700
I have is we have to just keep fighting
for what we [inaudible] be better. Well,

475
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:34,740
so Dave,
I think we need to rethink who we are.

476
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:39,741
I think we need to deepen and enrich
our understanding of who we are and what

477
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,590
we're here to do. And it
goes back centuries. I mean,

478
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,120
it was the liberalism.

479
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:50,121
That dog is out of feudalism that ended
the guilds that brought us free trade,

480
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:54,240
that ended slavery,
that really gave bursts and modern world.

481
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,930
And we need to learn to take credit
for that and make that ethos our ethos.

482
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,710
Go back and read the works of Adam
Smith and the greatest cautious Scottish

483
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:06,120
enlightenment thinkers,
you know,

484
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,660
and and understand our history so
we understand ourselves better.

485
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,600
I think this is important because maybe
it stopped thinking of ourselves even

486
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,820
though we are radicals. I
think you are. I think I am.

487
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,270
I almost believe that we should
stop thinking of ourselves that way.

488
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,350
We should think of ourselves as normal.
If I'm a radical,

489
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:25,530
then the phrase radical, it's definitely
not as cool as it used to. I mean,

490
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:29,310
I think I'm open to these
ideas and I w I guess being,

491
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,490
being open right now and lit,

492
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,120
being really living up to the ideals that
you've set forth here is radical these

493
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,110
days.
It kind of is.

494
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:40,740
And maybe liberalism has always been a
radical creed because it opposes power.

495
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:43,210
It always been opposed to power.
And that's what we have to do now.

496
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:46,600
But we also have to celebrate
regular life. You know, we have to,

497
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:50,950
we have to celebrate the good life and
the beautiful things and the things we

498
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:51,311
love,

499
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,700
the people we love in the choices that
we can make and the technologies we can

500
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:58,240
use. And I, I fall in love with the new
technology. Every single day I came over,

501
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,620
I came over to see you.

502
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:02,800
Or with this new funny pillow
that I bought for $10 on Amazon,

503
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,830
it allows me to sleep, sitting and
stayed up. But I'm been raptured by that.

504
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,910
I think this is the way to happiness
and I think ultimately is the path to

505
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,900
political victory for us to,
to be, to be more hopeful,

506
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,690
to be more cheerful,
to be more,

507
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,750
to celebrate life and celebrate love
and celebrate wealth in a way in which

508
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,520
neither left or the
right or doing right now,

509
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:26,950
it gives us as an opening to be awesome,

510
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,420
to emancipate the world.
We can do this.

511
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,620
I've got nothing better to do
for more on Jeffrey.
