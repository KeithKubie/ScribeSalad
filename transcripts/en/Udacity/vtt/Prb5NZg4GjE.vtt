00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.942
let's analysis for a second why this graph has this particular behavior with the

00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:09.110
ends pointing in the same direction on either side up really, really high. To

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.530
do that I like you to form this x, y table for this function y equals x to the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.836
4, now you notice that the x values over here are ordered in a little bit

00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:19.541
familiar each of these pairs of numbers one is just the negative version of the

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:26.540
previous one I think you'll see why in just a second. I'd actually recommend

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.640
doing most of these calculations by hand so you can see why y is taking on the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.529
value that it is.
