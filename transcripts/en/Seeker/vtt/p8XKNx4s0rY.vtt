00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.430
Oh you've heard of oxytocin?

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.010
Oh you love it because you think it's so lovely?

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.980
Yeah think again.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:13.100
Hello hello Laci Green here for Dnews.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.720
Guys I love me some oxytocin.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.310
We've talked about this neurotransmitter before.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.110
It's that chemical that's released in your
brain when you hug someone, when you're cuddling,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.730
after you orgasm, even after childbirth.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.330
It's a love hormone.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.440
It makes people feel all warm and nice inside
and it's said to promote social bonding between

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.440
people.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.161
So basically it's a hormone that you makes
like people more, I mean what's not to like

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:35.161
there.

00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:39.729
Except that there might be one little thing
that's not to like: the teensie tiny little

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:45.579
thing of oxytocin making you feel fear and
anxiety and burning bad memories into your

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.579
brain.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.049
Dude, that's not cool!

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.799
A new study at Northwestern that came out
this week is revealing the evil side of oxytocin

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.299
which up to this point has been unbeknownst
to us.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.420
Researchers took two sets of mice, one set
without oxytocin receptors and one set with

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.890
lots of extra receptors.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.460
They put the mice into a cage with agressive
mice.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.970
They're trying to stress them out right?

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.970
And then they gave them a break.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.050
When they reintroduce the mice to the aggressive
cage, the mice on oxytocin were totally freaked

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.050
out.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.750
They knew it was coming, they were super stressed,
and they were not having it.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.360
But the mice without the oxytocin were chill,
almost like they had let go and forgot about

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.500
the previous experience.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.380
The scientists think this happened because
there's this little signaling molecule in

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.710
your brain called the Extracellular Signal-Regulated
Kinase or ERK for normal people that can't

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.710
remember long words.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.420
After you have a bad social experience that
signal activates the fear pathways in the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.450
brain and it gets all crazy in there for about
six hours after the experience.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.070
The ERK is an important part of how we regulate
fear in our brains and it appears that oxytocin

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.980
activates it for even longer which ultimately
makes it harder to recover from the negative

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.980
experience you had.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.340
So this is kind of a big deal because scientists
have been looking into using oxytocin to treat

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.320
anxiety disorders.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.700
Like I'm just guessing here, but it's probably
not gonna be very effective to give people

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.190
with really bad anxiety drugs that will make
their brains have really bad anxiety.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.720
It's just a hypothesis I have about this,
because science.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.499
The researchers say that using oxytocin for
anxiety treatment may not be entirely out

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.439
of the question, though, given all its other
good effects that come about when social circumstances

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.439
are different.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.430
You know when you're having sex instead of
being put in a cage with a bunch mean ol'

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.430
mice.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.769
The key here may be that it depends on when
the oxytocin is taken and what the context

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:31.769
is.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.030
Anyhow I'm pretty sad about this finding.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.930
I thought that oxytocin was the one thing
in the world that I could love unconditionally.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.129
Nothing lasts forever guys.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.129
That's what I learned today.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.720
Thanks for joining me peeps and hey, if you
haven't already you should be our friend on

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.720
Twitter @Dnews.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.920
I swear we don't bite.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920
Well I don't bite.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.639
I can't say the same for Trace and Anthony.

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.089
We'll see you next time.
