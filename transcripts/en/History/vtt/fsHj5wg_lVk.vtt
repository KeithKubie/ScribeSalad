NARRATOR: Spring,
when a young man's

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.429
fancy lightly turns to thought.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.431
What's the matter?

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.167
Exam week getting you down?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.169
What you need is to
put down that notebook

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.705
and take in some of
the beauties of nature.

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:40.840
See what I mean?

[music playing]

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.316
But wait a minute,
young lady, how

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:53.286
did you get into this picture?

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.323
You see, we're trying to prove
a point about nature and beauty.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:01.160
And you are not exactly
helping, you know.

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:04.730
Look at your hair.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:08.701
Look at that blouse,
and the way that skirt

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.337
hangs, and those socks.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:16.609
Sorry, there must
have been a mistake.

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.212
You don't seem to be exactly
the type to make this guy

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.746
behave like a human being.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:24.117
[music playing]

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.488
But wait a minute.
Come back.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.791
[music playing]

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:36.596
Let's start all over again.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.632
[music playing]

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:42.201
Oh, brother.

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:45.371
NARRATOR: Oh, brother, is right.

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:50.843
Look at that hair,
that skin, that mouth.

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:54.514
And now look at that blouse.

00:01:54.547 --> 00:02:00.453
And now look at the
skirt and the socks.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:03.656
Thanks a lot for helping
us prove a point.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.493
And you, you too know the
value of a good appearance.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.529
