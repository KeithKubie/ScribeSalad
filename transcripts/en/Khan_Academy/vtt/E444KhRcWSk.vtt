00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:03.313
- Let's now get some practice
with separable differential

00:00:03.313 --> 00:00:06.346
equations, so let's say I have
the differential equation,

00:00:06.643 --> 00:00:10.680
the derivative of Y with
respect to X is equal to

00:00:10.068 --> 00:00:14.692
two Y-squared, and let's say
that the graph of a particular

00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:18.683
solution to this, the graph
of a particular solution,

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:23.435
passes through the point one
comma negative one, so my

00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:28.435
question to you is, what is Y,
what is Y when X is equal to

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:38.132
three for this particular
solution, so the particular

00:00:38.132 --> 00:00:40.164
solution to the differential
equation that passes through

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:44.459
the point one comma negative
one, what is Y when X is

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:47.258
equal to three, and I encourage
you to pause the video,

00:00:47.258 --> 00:00:49.484
and try to work through it on your own.

00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:52.722
So I'm assuming you had a
go at it, and the key with a

00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:55.437
separable differential
equation, and that's a big clue

00:00:55.437 --> 00:00:57.323
that I'm even calling it a
separable differential equation,

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.997
is that you separate the Xs from the Ys.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:03.236
Or all the Xs and the
DXs from the Ys and DYs.

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:04.712
So how do you do that here?

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.490
Well, what I could do,
let me just rewrite it.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.049
So it's gonna be DY DX is
equal to two Y-squared,

00:01:12.068 --> 00:01:16.332
is equal to two Y, equal to two Y-squared.

00:01:16.332 --> 00:01:20.670
So let's see, we can
multiply both sides by DX,

00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:24.825
and let's see, so then we're
gonna have, that cancels with

00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:27.441
that if we treat it as just
a value, or as a variable.

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:32.441
We're gonna have DY is
equal to two Y squared DX.

00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:33.695
Well, we're not quite done yet.

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:36.126
We gotta get this two Y
squared on the left hand side.

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:39.231
So we can divide both
sides by two Y-squared.

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:44.616
So if we divide both sides by
two Y-squared, two Y-squared,

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:50.416
the left hand side, we could
rewrite this as 1/2 Y to the

00:01:50.762 --> 00:01:55.762
negative two power, is going
to be equal to DY, DY is

00:01:59.992 --> 00:02:04.992
equal to DX, and now, we
can integrate both sides.

00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:08.651
So we can integrate both sides.

00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:10.935
Let me give myself a
little bit more space.

00:02:12.043 --> 00:02:17.043
And so, what is, what is this
left hand side going to be?

00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:20.183
Well, we increment the exponent,

00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:23.302
and then divide by that value,
so Y to the negative two,

00:02:23.302 --> 00:02:26.113
if your increment is
Y to the negative one,

00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:28.159
and then divide by negative one,

00:02:28.573 --> 00:02:33.573
so this is going to be -1/2
Y to the negative one power,

00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:37.728
and we could do a plus C like
we did in the previous video,

00:02:38.187 --> 00:02:39.808
but we're gonna have a
plus C on both sides,

00:02:39.808 --> 00:02:41.615
and you could subtract,
or you know, you have

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:43.418
different arbitrary
constants on both sides and

00:02:43.418 --> 00:02:44.784
you could subtract them from each other,

00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:46.805
so I'm just gonna write the
constant only on one side.

00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:52.041
So you have that is equal to,
well if I integrate just DX,

00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:57.100
that's just going to give me
X, that's just gonna give me X.

00:02:57.397 --> 00:03:00.428
So this right over here is X,

00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:04.534
and of course I can have
a plus C over there,

00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:09.811
and If I want I can, I can
solve for Y if I multiply,

00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:13.695
let's see, I can multiply
both sides by negative two,

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:16.240
and then I'm gonna have, the
left hand side you're just

00:03:16.024 --> 00:03:20.226
gonna have Y to the negative
one, or 1/Y is equal to,

00:03:20.442 --> 00:03:23.548
if I multiply the right hand
side times negative two,

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:28.548
I'm gonna have negative
two times X plus, well

00:03:29.488 --> 00:03:31.537
it's some arbitrary constant,
it's still going to,

00:03:31.537 --> 00:03:33.814
it's gonna be negative two
times this arbitrary constant

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:38.272
but I could still just call it
some arbitrary constant, and

00:03:38.272 --> 00:03:41.037
then if we want we can take
the reciprocal of both sides,

00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:46.161
and so we will get Y is equal
to, is equal to 1/-2X+C.

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:55.215
And now we can use, we can use
the information they gave us

00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:58.449
right over here, the fact
that our particular solution

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:00.928
needs to go through this
point to solve for C.

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.359
So, when X is negative one,
so when X is negative one.

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:12.016
Oh sorry, when X is one, when
X is one, Y is negative one,

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.099
so we get negative one
is equal to 1/-2+C, or

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:25.483
we could say C minus two, we
could multiply both sides times

00:04:25.483 --> 00:04:29.516
C minus two, if then we will
get, actually let me just

00:04:29.516 --> 00:04:32.507
scroll down a little bit, so
if you multiply both sides

00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:35.102
times C minus two, negative
one times C minus two is going

00:04:35.102 --> 00:04:40.102
to be negative C plus two or
two minus C is equal to one.

00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:45.476
All I did is I multiplied C
minus two times both sides,

00:04:46.938 --> 00:04:49.717
and then, let's see, I can
subtract two from both sides, so

00:04:49.717 --> 00:04:52.884
negative C is equal to negative
one, and then if I multiply

00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:57.884
both sides by negative one,
we get C is equal to one.

00:04:58.724 --> 00:05:03.724
So our particular solution
is Y is equal to 1/-2X+1.

00:05:09.736 --> 00:05:12.541
And we are almost done,
they didn't just ask for,

00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:14.409
we didn't just ask for
the particular solution,

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.850
we asked, what is Y when
X is equal to three.

00:05:17.022 --> 00:05:20.901
So Y is going to be equal
to one over, three times

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.099
negative two is negative six
plus one, which is equal to

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:31.305
negative, is going to be
equal to 1/-5, or -1/5.

00:05:33.334 --> 00:05:36.686
And we are done.
