00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's look at the relationship between correlation and regression

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
as we make changes to our data.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's consider the following simple data set.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We have x of 1, 2, and 3 and y of 4, 7, and 13.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Consider the regression coefficient for the equation y = bx + a

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and the correlation coefficient.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
