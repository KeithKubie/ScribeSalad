00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
hello I'm Lawrence this is my question

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310
hello I'm Lawrence this is my question
 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.390
hello I'm Lawrence this is my question
to you David gross will will we be able

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400
to you David gross will will we be able
 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.290
to you David gross will will we be able
to live in another galaxy hi Lawrence so

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300
to live in another galaxy hi Lawrence so
 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.330
to live in another galaxy hi Lawrence so
you're asking whether we will be able to

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340
you're asking whether we will be able to
 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.640
you're asking whether we will be able to
live in another galaxy probably as far

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650
live in another galaxy probably as far
 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.609
live in another galaxy probably as far
as we can tell galaxies are more or less

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
as we can tell galaxies are more or less
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.870
as we can tell galaxies are more or less
all the same there's some differences we

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
all the same there's some differences we
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.470
all the same there's some differences we
live in a spiral galaxy but there many

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
live in a spiral galaxy but there many
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.509
live in a spiral galaxy but there many
many such galaxies throughout the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
many such galaxies throughout the
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.999
many such galaxies throughout the
universe there are 10 billion galaxies

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
universe there are 10 billion galaxies
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.220
universe there are 10 billion galaxies
in the visible universe so there are

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
in the visible universe so there are
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.639
in the visible universe so there are
lots of galaxies where we life like us

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
lots of galaxies where we life like us
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.090
lots of galaxies where we life like us
could have evolved we believe if we can

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
could have evolved we believe if we can
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220
could have evolved we believe if we can
live in other places of our galaxy and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
live in other places of our galaxy and
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.590
live in other places of our galaxy and
we believe more and more that they're

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
we believe more and more that they're
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.229
we believe more and more that they're
probably millions of planets like ours

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
probably millions of planets like ours
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.439
probably millions of planets like ours
throughout the galaxy where life could

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
throughout the galaxy where life could
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.569
throughout the galaxy where life could
have evolved life like ours were just as

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
have evolved life like ours were just as
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.080
have evolved life like ours were just as
likely to or life like ours is just as

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
likely to or life like ours is just as
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.789
likely to or life like ours is just as
likely to evolved in other galaxies but

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
likely to evolved in other galaxies but
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.630
likely to evolved in other galaxies but
it's very unlikely that we will ever be

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
it's very unlikely that we will ever be
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.880
it's very unlikely that we will ever be
able to physically go to these other

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
able to physically go to these other
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.660
able to physically go to these other
galaxies we can't travel faster than the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
galaxies we can't travel faster than the
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.440
galaxies we can't travel faster than the
speed of light and it would take us even

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
speed of light and it would take us even
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.780
speed of light and it would take us even
at those speeds millions of years to go

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
at those speeds millions of years to go
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.370
at those speeds millions of years to go
to other galaxies so it's even hard for

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
to other galaxies so it's even hard for
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.289
to other galaxies so it's even hard for
us to imagine communicating with other

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
us to imagine communicating with other
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.530
us to imagine communicating with other
galaxies because again light or radio

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
galaxies because again light or radio
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.480
galaxies because again light or radio
waves that we would use for such

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
waves that we would use for such
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.780
waves that we would use for such
communication can't go faster than the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
communication can't go faster than the
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.719
communication can't go faster than the
speed of light or radio waves and they

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
speed of light or radio waves and they
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.550
speed of light or radio waves and they
would also take millions of years to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
would also take millions of years to
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.649
would also take millions of years to
reach these other galaxies so it'd be

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
reach these other galaxies so it'd be
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.819
reach these other galaxies so it'd be
very hard to have a telephone

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
very hard to have a telephone
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.980
very hard to have a telephone
conversation if you had to wait over a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
conversation if you had to wait over a
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.370
conversation if you had to wait over a
million years to get a reply so we're

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
million years to get a reply so we're
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.069
million years to get a reply so we're
only going to know rather indirectly our

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
only going to know rather indirectly our
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.270
only going to know rather indirectly our
weather life definitively exists on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
weather life definitively exists on
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.479
weather life definitively exists on
other galaxies but it most likely does
