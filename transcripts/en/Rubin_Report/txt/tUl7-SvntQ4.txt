Speaker 1:          00:00:26       All right people, we are live on the youtube. This is an impromptu live stream. This came together yesterday because there are so many forces in the world that are moving so freaking fast right now. And the man sitting across from me has been tracking these things like a, like a what? How are you tracking these things? Like a mathematician, like a mathematician, Eric Weinstein. Everybody knows you already. All right, we got a lot to do here real quick. I'm going to go back to the camera over there for just a second. So I'm going to do about an hour and a half with Eric. We're going to chat about all kinds of stuff and then, no, I'm gonna keep talking to you. Uh, so we're gonna do about an hour and a half together and then we're going to do patrion only Q and a. So only the Reuben select people are going to get in on that patrion.com/uh, Ruben report and a, any people that joined at any level, we'll be able to ask us questions directly.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       No. Uh, no censoring around here. Great. Are you all right with that? Okay, so the reason I wanted to do this, and we've been, we've been trading a lot of calls the last couple of days and the reason I was like, we gotta just do this tomorrow is that I feel like I'm living in kind of two worlds at the moment that I've been on this tour with Peterson for the last, you know, four months or so. We've done about 50 cities. You've appeared at some of the shows who where I've brought you on and you, you play the harmonica and get the crowd going and 3000 people cheering as you're playing the harmonica, which I assume is your, your biggest great, your greatest professional joy so far, but I'm meeting quite literally thousands of people every night in different cities all over this country and soon to be all over the world.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       We're about to do 18 stops in, in Europe that are coming together over ideas that are putting political differences aside, getting rid of the hate, trying to figure out some answers. They dig what, what we're doing, what's going on with the IDW, all of that. Then you go on on Twitter and everywhere else online. And just the hate fest seems to have been ramped up and it's not just Twitter, I always talk about it in a Twitter perspective, but just everything, the articles of hating this one, hating that one, all this stuff with cabin. Ah, everyone, these siloing of opinions has just increased exponentially and it all seems to be getting worse. And that brings me to why you're sitting here, because you came on this show about two years ago for the first time. We had just met a little bit before that and we started talking about fake news just as it was bubbling up. And I think some of your predictions that you laid out or kind of right. And I suspect that maybe you have a couple answers to some of the theories that you, that you dropped back then. How was that for an intro? Well, Einstein is, is, uh, a lot of that matches my own experience. And

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       I do think that these, these parallel worlds, uh, are very confusing. If you've never seen what I've termed the vampire effect. So a vampire is supposed to not reflect in a looking glass when it passes by and in, uh, in essence, the shows that you're doing with Jordan are a vampiric that at some level they don't really exist. He can produce people coming together extraordinary impacts on people's lives. He can talk about his disdain for reactionary movements and it doesn't change the narrative at all. And so at some level, there are two Jordan Peterson's, there are two day Rubens. There may even be too Eric Weinstein's, but I'm a smaller fish in this, in this pond. Um, and one of them is a fictional character that is drawn using details of your actual life. And the other is your actual life. So one's just the media caricature basically.

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       But it's a very interesting caricature. In other words, it's as if somebody has a fixed strings to your hands, into your feet. And so every time you make a motion, your character has to move. Um, so you have to start doing these calculations. If I say something a little bit nuanced, I have to run the risk that it will be taken out of context. And my media character, uh, will end up saying something that I find absolutely abhorrent. And so the goal is to get you to consider the consequences of your actions. If I tell you that every action you could take would be mapped to some consequence that I will, uh, right into a story, then you start thinking, okay, it's not a question of what I want to do. It's a question of what do I want to do given the fact that you're going to caricature me.

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       So do you think that these, even if they're self imposed constraints have now been placed on many people about how they speak and it really had a think and how they act? Um, you think it's significantly worse now than it was even two years ago? Well, because right before the election you had all these people saying, oh, you know, the polls were off because all the Trump people that say they didn't want to say what they really thought. The teams like those screws have been tightened even more. So I'm not, I don't mean it just in its own context and one lens through one Lens. Things have gotten much worse, but I'm actually in a kind of a different mood about all of this, which is, um, I would say that when I first came on, I was quite cautious and I said that this fake news meme, if you will, felt very inauthentic.

Speaker 2:          00:05:39       Trump had just won the election in November of 2016. And my interpretation at the time, uh, which hasn't changed much, was that the people who had lost control of the major narratives, um, realized that they needed to buy time to figure out how they were going to reestablish narrative control. And so what they did was they created a shell, in my opinion, that they were going to have to fill as they had meetings and figured out what they wanted to do. And that Shell was fake news. So basically by pushing the idea of all the Trump voters were paying attention to fake news, that's what caused them to vote for Trump. Right. Well, so you have this problem, which is that, uh, when you have to call 50% of your electorate deplorable, um, because they're voting for someone beyond the Pale. Now keep in mind, uh, I think it's absolutely essential, uh, that we unelect Trump as soon as possible.

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       So, uh, I've called him an existential risk from before the election and I continued to do everything I can do honorably in decently, uh, to figure out how to unelect him. You're a Bernie guy. Well, I was a Bernie guy in the sense that I voted for Bernie, and I definitely saw him as the most survivable survivable of the three major options with Hillary, Bernie and, and, uh, and Donald what I, what I felt then at the time, and I said so, is that we should not have a choice between three boomer, uh, candidates, um, or older candidates. We need fresh, new ideas and none of these people's experience speaks at all to me. So it's not that I was wildly supportive of Bernie and his economic policies, which made very little sense to me. It was that he was struggling to be a decent human being, and he was an absolute maverick like Trump, but he was a maverick who had managed to survive within the system.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       So there was a level of trust that I had with him, even though I thought he was economically confused. What, what I believe now is that we've, we've been shown what got put in to that container called fake news or media manipulation and rather than it being terrifying, um, I, you know, I'm, I'm sort of on the fence about this, but I think I'm going to go in the direction of funny, like this report that just came out from data and society. Yeah. On the alternative influence network. Had you ever heard of these people before this report, by the way? I'd heard of, uh, the woman who founded it, Dana Boyd, and uh, I've actually co-ran sessions with an advisor of theirs named Hillary Mason who, uh, you know, as a top notch, a data scientist. Um, so I didn't have the most negative impression of the roster of people. There's some people who I've used very ideological, uh, over, over there, but I didn't actually know about data and society. It's sort of, um, seemed to be an echo of things that you see in the Tim O'reilly network. Uh, or

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       what is it? The Berkman center at Harvard. So it's connected up through all of the major institutions. If you look at the funders of data and society, it's the Sloan Foundation. Uh, it's The New York Times. It's, I think it's open society. Yeah. So bill and Melinda Gates. So what's going on? Let's pause for a second. People that don't know what this thing is at our, I think most people watching probably do, but basically they issued this report, the alternative influencer network, and it was sort of how the reactionary right is monetizing and extending their influence throughout youtube. And it was heavily based on me as one of the people. I think I was mentioned 77 times in this report. Uh, Joe Rogan of course was included. Jordan Peterson was included. Tim Pool, who I've had on the show, Dennis Prager. Prager was interesting that he was included because they included his name Dennis Prager, even though this was about youtubers, but really they were going after his channel.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       Prager U. I think that's just an interesting distinction that they went after the man, not the channel. Then there was a series of other people on there that I have no idea who they are. There were real white nationalists, I suppose, on there, from what I understand, one, uh, and, but basically they issued this insane, uh, graph linking us all together that looked like a cat, six degrees of Kevin Bacon on steroids. And there were, there were errors. I mean, I know there's areas even related to me. They didn't have me in Rogan connected. I've been on the show three times. I mean, you're going to ruin the whole thing. Okay. Go ahead. Everything that's wrong. Okay. Please. You know, there's this fill out to say that I know well, but the thing is that at first I thought it was like the 80s, and I'd forgotten that we had these channels.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       So, you know, three's company was on there, he couldn't believe it. The, uh, the funny thing is, is that before there was no way to fight these things. Like if you couldn't jack into the network of newspapers and radio stations, there was no way to fight back. So all of these things were terrifying. But I noticed that I wasn't a part of this graph. And at first I had this like sense of relief and then I thought I should just go on Dave Ruben show and become part of the alternative reactionary influence. Now work as a Bernie voter because, oh, this is gay poet, pro choice pot smoking against the death penalty on the air, right winger. Right. You know what I mean? As fellow, by the way, just as a fellow Neo Nazi. Can I ask how you spent Yom Kippor oh, it was lovely. I broke it with bagels. Yeah, exactly. I mean, they've got Ben Shapiro on there saying he's a white nationalist. It's so completely insane. Yeah. And uh, that it, it, it really doesn't require reputation. What it requires is a middle schooler with an Iq of above 80 and a, and an assignment to say what's wrong with the methodology of this report? Because so far as I could tell, there is no methodology. The report, um, it's

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       not just that it's got errors and what's what you explain what in a report like this, what a proper methodology would be. Because from what I could understand in the 61 pages of this thing, they basically just tried to link us together. This person talk to this person, this person once interviewed this person, this person appeared somewhere with this person for getting the errors in those connections. But that to me doesn't strike me as a methodology. It strikes me as just it. Just human connections. People Cross paths with people. It doesn't mean you're promoting them. It doesn't mean you're secretly working with them or that you're in, in a network. I mean, that's what they were really going for here. And I think there's a bigger reason for that that we're going to get to in a little bit. Well, okay, so, um, what, what could they have done?

Speaker 3:          00:12:35       Yeah, if you were, if you were doing it properly, right, and you were trying to show, here's a small group of people that have created this network to extend these horrible ideas or alternative, we do have influence and there is a part of us that is a network. So in fact, that's not really where the problem, right? What you would do normally is you would set out some list of qualities, characteristics that didn't pick names that you selectively, uh, wanted to feature. And you would say, okay, here's what we did. We came up with the following rule. Uh, somebody needs to appear, uh, on at least three shows. We've done this so that it's exhaustive. Uh, and everybody who fits these criteria is listed on this graph and look what emerges. Or they at least hold certain beliefs. Right? Could you do it that way or is that trying to say, you're asking me what, just what I would think would be a proper method.

Speaker 3:          00:13:35       Okay. So you'd stay at something that was fairly neutral, that didn't name anyone, and then it would emerge that the network was the solution to the carefully stated problem. And then you'd say, isn't this interesting that when I looked for at, at those, um, criteria, it picks out Dave Ruben, uh, and Richard Spencer, and it doesn't pick out a Ezra Klein and Sarah John. Unfortunately, uh, you know, Ezra Klein does a podcast with Sam Harris. Sam Harris is named in the appendix, but he's not on the graph, I think. Yeah, the, you know, Noam Chomsky has appeared on Stefan Molyneux. So if you actually put all of the people who would occur as part of a proper methodology, methodological discovery of a network, there would be things that didn't go your way. And then there'd be a section at the end that says, we note that the following anomalies are present people who are clearly opposed to, you know, you might have Linda Sarsour with a node on the network.

Speaker 3:          00:14:41       Right. And you'd say, okay, why is Linda Sarsour to two degrees separated from Richard Spencer? And then you'd have to say like, these are maybe some deficiencies, may, you know, here's some, here's some ideas for further research. But the point is that there was nothing like a methodology. And when you look at the authors ideological commitments, which she's very comfortable sharing, they fly in the face of facts. So there's no, she's not trying to present herself so far as I can tell as a dispassionate researcher, she's trying to present herself as an activist. She has tweets from August since deleted because she uses that tweets scrubber thing or whatever it is. Talking about how d Platt performing people is the answer to these problems that she proposes. We have so, but it's pretty clear what's going on there. Dave, I could understand somebody saying, look, let's talk about what d platforming is and let's talk about it in neutral terms so that it, it's not being used selectively to wipe out reasonable ideas that I disagree with [inaudible] there's no pretense.

Speaker 3:          00:15:50       There's no semblance, and that's why I think this is, I have a different feeling about this than I had expected, which is like, bring this on. Give me more. Because if you show me who is willing to salute this report, you know, is this going to be featured by the Berkman Center at Harvard? I went to Harvard. You couldn't turn something like this in. Yeah, into a statistics department or a math department and be considered a researcher. You'd be considered a lunatic. And so if Harvard then salutes this thing, that's going to tell us about an ideological commitment. Does the New York Times support this? There's certainly funding this, um, and they're funding the center for data and society. So we know that the Guardian liked it. We know that vox liked it. [inaudible] buzzfeed wired. I didn't see buzzfeed actually. Yeah, buzzfeed did. I saw New York, I saw a New York Times reporters tweeting at NBC news reporters tweeting it.

Speaker 3:          00:16:49       And it did it did it, did it occur in the New York Times? Because I'm seeing no, I haven't seen that. I'm seeing that even the publications who probably would like to find that this report is reasonable. No, they gotta be very careful because if you embrace this report, you're telling, it's so bad that you're telling people what your standards are for intellectual discourse. And that's what makes it fascinating. So, um, so you want more of this because you believe this will hasten the destruction of the monster we've been fighting. Basically I want to know how I can help them to produce more reports like this. Um, you have to understand what the purpose of a report like this is. And I think somewhere, this is my fifth appearance on your show. So I'm probably getting close to winning something. Um, doesn't get more [inaudible] some whiskey for the Q and a about that.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       There you go. All right. The, uh, I brought up this gated institutional narrative, and this is where this report is supposed to slot in. In other words, it's not meant for individual consumption. It's meant to be a sizable report. And so it's got like high production graphics and Hey, it's a pdf PDFs or hard to make. Like it's not a word document. We go let you fix a pdf. It's locked in. So the idea is you're supposed to be able to hold a conference, let's say under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences or Brookings or Berkman Center, whatever it is. And you're supposed to say, well, earlier in the year we had this fabulous report, uh, by Rebecca Lewis at the center for data and society and, and, and they're doing some remarkable work about how people are being radicalized. And I think this is very important and pressing. And so you have a big serious conversation in a closed conference and the release proceedings, and then maybe you'll allow the public in for the, for the final day and you say, well, thank you all for joining the conversation.

Speaker 3:          00:18:56       Of course, none of those people in the audience is allowed to join the conversation. And that's what the gated institutional narrative is all about. That if you don't own a seat somewhere on the institutional network, you can't get into that conversation. So you, there's nobody who's going to be in a position to say you realize that report, uh, would not be acceptable at any reasonable middle school, uh, as a, as a data project. So that's what there are some, someone was hoping for this, but I think even for these institutions, they're going to be a little bit wary because it's so nakedly ideological and so piss poor on, on the analytics. Okay. So when I saw this thing come out and I called you and I was pissed and I was like, Oh, here we go again. Just another one of these things. And I was saying, you know, this is just their way of inching us closer to d platforming and may be you think, but you think that's a secondary issue here?

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       Well, what I'm trying to say is, and by the way, thank you for having, uh, my friend, uh, Peter Teal on oh yeah, no problem. That was great. Yeah, we can talk about that too. Um, you know, Peter has this brilliant way of analyzing things is that you have something that a powerful entity could do. Uh, and then he says, but the level of violence needed to accomplish that goal is probably not something that that entity could stomach. Well, I have no doubt that people are fantasizing about doing to all of these people what was done to Alex Jones, right? With Alex Jones, there's so much over the top stuff that a lot of people who breathe a sigh of relief, thank God somebody rid us of that terrible Alex Jones. And I'm not going to get into whether Alex Jones, good or bad. No. But putting, putting lemme lemme can continuously with, they could try to take the alternative influence network that they have identified off the air.

Speaker 3:          00:21:00       Okay. What would that look like? You've got to somehow get rid of Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, Sam Harris, etc. Etc. And we've got new kids coming up all the time who are said to be a major voices. So are you going to get rid of all of these people? Because if you do that, the only way to do that is in such a visible way. The, the way they can do with this now is, is harassment through algorithms where suddenly you don't get the number of views that fit the pattern. You're, you're D monetize, you can't make money. Um, you know that maybe there's a glitch and you're thrown off the platform and then they say, sorry, sorry, sorry. Et Cetera, et cetera. So this is just like, they're harassing us. It's digital harassment. So do you think that we decided w crew, whoever they say is at this point, do you think we kind of dropped the ball on not offering Jones a better defense?

Speaker 3:          00:21:58       Not having anything to do with the content. I don't, I've watched maybe 10 minutes of him ever. So put the content aside, but that there was this digital assassination basically where it's like, all right, well if this guy can't be on Twitter and camping on paypal and Campy, I knew to Megan can eat, can he have a phone? Is He allowed to have a phone? I have running water at his house. I mean, what, what is the publicans be allowed to use streets? That's a good question. That is a good question. Where are we going with it? I don't know. Um, so should we have offered, not because we were defending him or any of his ideas, but should we have offered man these platforms doing this basically in conjunction with each other cause it all happened, you know, within a 24 hour period. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:22:39       I thought about this. I mean I, I tweeted about it and I said something about this is ominous having nothing to do with Jones, that all of these platforms, Ddi platform to him d platform, Tim sudden suddenly. Yeah. Um, but my belief about this is that because the platforms occupy a very strange position, I don't think we have good jurisprudence around these platforms. No, we clearly don't. It bothers me that we don't realize that the shift has been so dramatic. Or these companies, are they utilities, are they natural monopolies because of the Cordy problem of path dependence? Um, I'm not positive that we have the economic theory, the legal jurisprudence to just refer to precedents and say, well, this is a clear violation of the Sherman and Clayton acts or, um, that, you know, this is covered, uh, under New York Times v Sullivan or who knows what. I think we're going to need a lot of new thinking. And so the problem that I'm having is, I don't know exactly where to fight this and fighting it around Alex Jones particularly. But the sandy hook issue

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       strikes me as I want to be maximally effective. So I said I was very clear about taking issue with the sudden d platforming. But you know, to the point where you're saying that businesses should be allowed to do what they want to do. Well is this, is this simply a business? And you know, keep in mind that we have very good information about how our government used to harass people who held dissident political perspectives in the fifties sixties and seventies. But we've got no information about whether or not this is being coordinated through the intelligence communities. We don't know. I've talked to before about Tim and sometimes people call it time for technology, intelligence, media. And if you add education, that is the universities and the research infrastructure, um, that conglomerate that, that Association of major institutions, we don't know what we're up against.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       So how do we start thinking about this issue? I actually think that this issue that you've just laid out here, not just because it affects us in a very obvious way. If I were doing this, I actually believe this is probably a far bigger issue than anything going on with Cavanagh right now. Or certainly the other ridiculous political machinations are half this stuff going on in terms this way that we conduct and transfer information and who in a sense of who you can get it and, and yeah. Well sensemaking comes on the back of our ability to communicate with each other. And I think this is probably the biggest issue out there. And by the way, I'm glad you just called me out on it, but this is where I'm running my classical liberal part that veers into libertarianism is starting where the rubber's meeting the road and I'm going, maybe there isn't, I don't want the government to come in, you know, that's against everything I stand for. It's not against every is everything

Speaker 2:          00:25:26       you stand for. Look at one of my goals is to get you off of the Canon hardcore libertarianism. I think competition is still the answer, but I do think we agreed that where competition works is the answer. But if you are truly free marketeer, you should know about market failure. Yeah. And you should not pretend that markets can solve all problems because you will have a world that is absolutely red of tooth and claw. Well, I think we're sort of heading there with this. I understand that. I can't create a youtube, but I'm trying to say that, you know, all I'm asking is that you reconsider your position because of the complexities about, you know, path dependent monopoly, which we refer to sometimes as Courtney, um, after the typewriter, uh, may have a funny structure and it's not clear that we should break it up or not break it up or regulated or not regulated. These are open questions and I'm absolutely, I agree with you as somebody who's much more in a, in a classic progressive position. Uh, although that has nothing to do with what people, client claim is progressivism now that where the market works, you let the market work. Yeah. Right. But it's not clear that the market is meant to work here because there's too many asymmetries of information. I mean, Google so many of our secrets.

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       Yeah. And so what happens when they've got a problem and they can also read all your email and then you're thinking like, okay, well that's a level of power. That's not like a company. You know, maybe somebody can invent some, some sort of email where the company can't read your email, but then the question is, are they responsible for regulating, right Zach? Well, okay, but that's exactly what the data and society people are supposed to be doing. Or the, uh, the Berkman Center. The problem is, is that we have a situation in which it's as if the grownups, whoever they are held a conference, which we were not invited to and they made a whole bunch of findings, you know, that, that these people are extreme. These people are good if you think about it. And in terms of like the hulk, the hulk, you know, often talks in sentences that don't have one part of speech, you know, so the Harvard good, send it strong.

Speaker 3:          00:27:38       Yeah. Um, well somehow they have an idea that Harvard has our best interests in mind. That, uh, more or less the Democratic Party is that which has to defeat Trump and the progressive agenda. And I put huge scare quotes around progressive here because it's anything but yeah. Um, those forces, the grownups as they see themselves need to take this thing back. And my point to them is, are you aware of who you have in this alternative influence network? Because I think you're sadly mistaken if you don't imagine that the fire power outside of the institutional network, intellectual firepower is as great or greater than the intellectual firepower inside of the institutions, which are constantly requiring people to say absolutely outrageous, ridiculous, false things. And so good people tend to eventually get so fed up that they can't stay inside of the institutions and the magic of this alternative network. Um, and I, and I mean that in the good sense. Yeah. Uh, is that it's based around individuals. The main war is not left versus right at the moment. [inaudible] it's institutions versus things that are much closer to being individuals. So the Ruben report isn't just you, but it's a team that is relatively small, and these relatively small teams don't take on these terrible characteristics of the large institutions. And so the reason that we're able to be so effective, in my opinion, is that all of the institutions are fighting.

Speaker 4:          00:29:27       MMM. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:29:28       certain problems having to do with, we don't have a, a really dependable source of growth. We don't have a great national story. They're all sputtering. They're all struggling. And the individuals are where the vitality and the energy is. So if Jordan Peterson has given us a biblical lecture on this right now, I think he'd be talking about David Verse Goliath. And in this case it might be Dave verse Google, but, but right. I mean, that's the idea that the small operation, the individual, or it can be just a small set of individuals. We have a lot of leverage because we don't have this cumbersome, cumbersome machine around us. And we don't, you know, I have to answer to myself and a couple of other people that I hold in close confidence, but that's it. And that, that's nimble and that's great. Yeah. So that's powerful. That's powerful even though it feels kind of scary. But what are you writing on your right? Great people. I think you're riding on, um, internals pipes stories. Oh, you meant you meant literally, right. We are still using their stuff. We're still using their stuff. And if you take this idea, you see the d platforming movement is quite clever.

Speaker 4:          00:30:37       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:30:39       Because free speech is enshrined in the constitution, so they can't really go around,

Speaker 4:          00:30:45       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:30:47       you know, it's like somebody saying you're entitled to play Your Guitar, Your Electric Guitar, but we have the right to cut off your power while you can barely hear an electric guitar, uh, without an amp. Right. And so the platforming is, they, it's a fail over into the next level of where can we take this fight. And I think it's very important that people read a, I think it's a transcript of a speech by the founder of data and society institute or Center, um, Dana Boyd, where she talks about two important concepts. One of, one of, in a speech, one of which is data voids in a data void is some place where people want to search for something, but there's not a lot of information around.

Speaker 4:          00:31:32       And

Speaker 3:          00:31:33       that's fascinating because that's a lot of how the mainstream institutions control us. So I have a very clean example of this. The idea that you can be a immigration restrictionist and a clear xenophile like everything throughout your life speaks to your interest in foreign cultures, your openness to other people. But you happen to be a restrictions. There is a complete void. If you go search xenophile restrictionist you'll probably find me at the top because what may be a majority position in the United States is acknowledged nowhere. Meaning that you might be into other cultures do, you might even be married to an Indian woman. You might love all sorts of things, speak a kajillion languages. Every time I get in a car with you, you're speaking in another language, you might care about all these other cultures for a million other reasons, but it doesn't mean you want open borders, which is what most people think.

Speaker 3:          00:32:31       I think. Well, it's very confusing. The Di, uh, an analogy would be, um, do you wish to adopt, uh, every person have over for dinner. The idea of being open to dinner guests and expecting that as much as you love them, they will probably leave, if not after dinner that after a few days or a few weeks you kicked me out. But I was drunk. I did, I'd be Runco. Alright. Focus. Sorry. So we have a situation in which these data voids, um, are real and they're created by the unwillingness to report. Now this is what's radicalizing people. So that's what, that was one of the forest types of fake news you originally discussed, right? Avoidance about an important topic is actually a title. Let's see if I can remember the, yeah, let's see if he can do it. All right. So there was algorithmic, there was institutional, I mean, give me an example of each one as your algorithmic fake news has to do with the, there's something important, but you can't find it via via search and it's, it's down ranked.

Speaker 3:          00:33:32       So that a, it's, it's effectively suppressed and something else is accentuated. Um, there was institutional where any institution that wants, um, can, uh, broadcast information and people treat it as if it's news. Um, but individuals can not do this. Then there was narrative fake news where the New York Times is the principle offender here, which they figure out the narrative, the narrative arc ahead of time. And we don't know why they would do that because the, the facts haven't come in, but they have an idea of how the facts should be organized as they come in. And then there's just false news. Yeah. So these, but wasn't one of them. Oh, so the first one is what you're saying [inaudible] is the closest Scott it, but sometimes that occurs just naturally. Like what if nobody thought, why aren't, why don't we have articles on xenophile file? Restrictionist oh, we just forgot. We forgot about what may be a majority position in the United States. Um, but it's like, it's so large that it's pretending that you can't find an aircraft carrier in a, in a, in a community harbor. So that's what makes people crazy. So the, the, the, the big data voids if you will, are people who believe that, um,

Speaker 3:          00:34:48       let's say that a trade is generally good, but that it isn't a rising tide that raises all ships and that you have to do work around it to make sure you don't decimate communities and states, you know, uh, there was very little, um, real work done on what, what the effects of trade would be. Uh, immigration we just mentioned. And then there's the, the, I believe that there is a linkage between terror, uh, and Islam, but I'm, I would think is Llama fillic because I'm fascinated by the culture, religion and uh, find it very easy to, to, you know, socialize in that portion of the world because it's very similar to many of the values that I hold. We just had a great night with your, what best friend from college who happens to be Muslim damn. Well, it's like who even noticed it doesn't, right.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       So the, by creating these voice saying, don't mention the following obvious fact, because if you do, we have an interpretation. If you disagree with us on policy, we can infer that you're a bad person, a moral failing, we'll have to be fixed to your name in perpetuity. That thing is making people absolutely hate these institutions. And my goal and trying to unelect Donald Trump is to say, there is no reason that Donald Trump should be running the table by monopolizing these data voids. Yes, you can believe that there is a link between terror and Islam and not be Islamophobic. Yes, you can believe that we have a problem with the way in which we negotiate trade agreements and you can still want to be open to the world and not protectionists that heart. Yes, you can be uh, uh, a restrictionist and the xenophile simultaneously though the, those are my big three examples of what makes people hate the institutions.

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       And in some sense I've been thinking that Donald Trump is like a company fragging it senior offers, like we don't want to be led by people who tell us that we're deplorable because if you pee on our leg and tell us it's raining, we say, no, you're peeing on my leg. Please stop. Right? And those people who want to say, look, we are the natural guardians of America. We know who needs to be the platform. We know, um, who, who shouldn't have access to paypal. We should be able to write our terms of service in such a way that pure virtue is boosted and not niceness is pushed down. By the way, pure virtue is everybody. I like nobody. [inaudible] right, right, right. Okay. Well, none of us want to be governed by this. Nobody who loves liberty and loves this particular country and loves the enlightenment, wants to be governed by this.

Speaker 3:          00:37:29       And so this is an unwanted institutional class and we're trying to throw them off. What happened was it was so uniform throughout the institutions that they couldn't field candidates that spoke to this fed upness. I mean we were just fed up who are, who are these baby boomers who are entitled to tell us how to think. And I'm saying, this is somebody who comes, you know, from, from the left. It shouldn't be a left, right. Distinction. Yeah. More or less people who have interesting perspectives as individuals are looking at this and say, we know you're trying to get us off the platforms. We know your engineers hate us, or are you reading our dms? Are you going through our emails? What are you doing over there? And that's where this the Alex Jones incident to changes in the terms of service. So now like you can be thrown off of a platform even if you conduct yourself properly on platform because of you're off platform behavior.

Speaker 3:          00:38:30       Yeah. A lot of people probably don't know about that. You are not making that out. But this is, this is what happened when I came on your show and I said, um, I said the fake news story is inauthentic. What I was doing was I was putting a marker and I was saying, watch this space because what they're going to do is they're going to fill it with some kind of machinery. And so there's been a lot of changes. One, they're all of these reporting mechanisms. Uh, you've got loud groups who objects to things that you put them on a, a, a truth in safety council. And then the idea is that all of the squeaky wheels, uh, who are, who are upset with things, if you give them free pizza and you give them a place at the table, uh, they may shut up, but they're also doing this free work with probably often doesn't need to be done.

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       I'm not saying that there isn't abuse on these systems, but you want the abuse to be even handed. If you have a Hashtag, uh, like as your client brought up, uh, kill all men. Why is kill all men? Did you read this article? I'm not, I'm not a huge fan of his, frankly. That's actually in the last couple of days. I find him quite personable. He's been very nice. Uh, I'm putting him on a list. He's had dinner at your house. I've had dinner at your butt, but he's also been set on a, but he's also been savage, so I'm better, I'm trying to understand the perspective. Yeah. So I'm trying to figure out is the Nice intelligent guy, uh, who came over for Shabbat dinner. Uh, the same guy as the guy who's rationalizing kill all men. I didn't actually mind his rationalization of kill Altman. What he said is, is that within a small group of feminists Twitter, which I don't think really exist, people talk like that, but since it's an open platform, it doesn't have any walls around.

Speaker 3:          00:40:14       He said that inside that community, that phrase meant it would be nice if the world were slightly better for women. So take that, take him at his word. You would imagine that that same community, if it was epistemically consistent, would also believe, hey, we can't police microaggressions because we have to figure out whether those things are actually not as toxic as they sound, but that this is what's fascinating is we think that the same community that should object to anything like, you know, referring to mankind as bigotry. Yeah. That community should also be allowed to use the Hashtag kill all men. Now, that doesn't make any sense. I'm very focused on are you granting yourself a privilege that you will grant to no one else, because if you recall, but created the reformation, uh, it was the selling of indulgences. And I believe that what the left thinks it has is an indulgence system that is Sara Jong, when promoted to the editorial board of the New York Times should be granted an indulgence because she's actually a great person and she engaged in some bad twittery and we should be, uh, there should be compassion. There should be forgiveness. There should not be a black mark on the record. So basically she believes in all the right things, according to the New York Times, you can say whatever she about white journal,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       but she believes in prove, you know, she's a progressive and blah, blah, blah. But this other guy who once said something which was ambiguous, should be be platform

Speaker 2:          00:41:43       for life. Yeah. And I don't think without profanity, uh, I don't think I have any way of, of communicating how hateful that is. How dare you. Literally, how dare you suggest that some community is entitled to own both of these things. Ultimate forgiveness for their members and the right to police everyone else. And that's what we have to fight.

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       So what do you make of what I would argue is the lack of clear thinking on behalf of these people. I don't want to make it about as her, it doesn't matter, but like look, a report like this comes out. And if we were to Parse, I honestly, I didn't know at least 10 of the people, I'd never even heard of them. A whole bunch of them I've had muted on Twitter because they don't like me. So it's like the idea that we were all connected is, is just silly. But if they had done a report just on true white nationalists, right. You know, they actually probably could have got some of us on our side, not maybe not to have them d platform because that's not where, where I would want to go with it, but that there's this group of people doing some really bad stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       Here's what it is. But they do a sloppy version out in out racists. There's an oppression they need. They need a certain amount. Look, there is still structural oppression in the world. I don't want to have to argue that I can, I can make a convincing case. So I do believe that there is structural oppression in our society. The problem is disrupted. What do you mean by structural? Cause this will be a big hangup point for a lot of people. Well that you know, you, you don't have anything that is explicitly against one race, but when you have a decision about where road has to be placed in the level of disruption or how

Speaker 2:          00:43:18       schools are paid from property taxes, uh, that are local, um, you have self perpetuating system

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       is where the, the rich become more advantaged in the poor, become more disadvantaged over time. Um, that wasn't necessarily racial though. That was rich versus poor. Well, but the point is that what if that correlates and you know, there might be rich versus poor. There might, it might

Speaker 2:          00:43:39       be male versus female. I don't think it's the case that we've gotten rid of all oppression. And I just think that that would be silly to suggest and it's not, it's important that we not lose sight that because our progressive's at the moment are terrible that we couldn't steal man. That point if that was in our interest in my intention is to do so. That said there isn't enough oppression to explain all of the phenomena that we're seeing. So I go to the very simple example of top hundred chess players. One of them is female. Now that cannot be in my estimation, likely caused by the law. Is oppression encoded into the rules of chess? Is it because you know chess is is sort of cryptically male and that if we, if we did it with Barbie dolls or or, or, or some other body positive female thing, that girls would suddenly become 50 50 I don't know. I think it's unlikely to imagine that. I don't think that it would have to be one versus 99 and maybe it's 20 versus 80 or 40 versus 60 who knows? But it's unlikely that it's 100% structural oppression. Like one of my jokes is and depression and online anonymous chest.

Speaker 1:          00:44:52       Yeah. Cause it's just like it's all day.

Speaker 2:          00:44:55       Well, so you have a situation where my, my team guessed wrong. We thought if we could get rid of red lining, if we could get rid of literacy tests, if we could get rid of all of the things that were holding people back that were just nakedly ridiculous, that we would have this much more even society. And while there's still more work to be done, I would say that preliminary indications are, is that that solves some of the problem. But it didn't solve as much of the problem as we were hoping. So now you have two very difficult choices. Do you decide that really the problem is, is that the oppression is super cryptic and it's much, you know, it's, it's much worse than anyone imagines. But that's why you're policing microaggressions or do you decide, Huh, I wonder if there are other factors. And that's kind of disturbing and I'm scared to even consider that question. And that's, that's the choice that the progressives and the lefties have have faced.

Speaker 1:          00:45:52       Can I take it to a slightly less heady place perhaps, which is, I get you on that, on the intellectual level, but I think there's just a lazy, it's just lazy thinking for young people. It's just lazy to think the system's rigged against you. It's just lazy to think they're coming after you because of your gender or your sexuality or your color or, well, most of the aiming after you because of your age. But it's, but it's empowering. In other words, it's empowering to these people to think the whole systems against me, I'm going to destroy it. So it's like, it just an easy answer as opposed to clean up your room and get your shit together. Yeah. When we had that,

Speaker 2:          00:46:28       by the way, it was tremendous fun having Jordan and Ben, uh, on the show did that. Um, but I pushed back on that, which is no, there really is an issue, particularly intergenerationally a lot of these people, if I take the standard child rearing house where somebody, you know, at age 26 wants to propose to somebody at age 24 and say, Hey, I, you know, I've got enough means to have a house and we can have a few kids and you can take off work for for a few years to, to raise them with kids with the most demanding. That's very hard to do at the moment. The labor market needs to get much tighter. We need to have employers writhing in pain before that becomes possible again, and I support making the labor market tighter in order to redistribute some of the wealth using market mechanisms to people who need

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       to start their lives and to become homeowners and to have a stake in the system. And we made a huge mistake in my opinion, not understanding that when it's so difficult to start a life in your 20s that feels adult, that those people are now pissed as hell. And rightfully so because we're not really hearing them. So I think that the, the one that is most important to me is that we missed the boat on intergenerational oppression. I think that one really feels salient. Now. There are other things having to do with, with race and gender, um, which we have to get to. And I'm not gonna pretend that, I don't think that there are problems in those areas. They're very, very, very clearly are, but there isn't enough problem at the moment. I mean, we have so many opportunities with a world crying out for diversity that, um, you know, we have, we have to be looking how much of this is solvable by going after oppression and how much are we having to invent, invent oppressions in order to avoid looking at more disturbing questions. And I think that what's going on is that the, our betters in the institutional world have already decided that anyone searching for explanations that are not oppression based, uh, and things that can't be cured with diversity is a bad person.

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       And that's what's so disturbing. Let me ask you something just on a kind of personal note that we've talked a little bit about privately that as a guy that came from the institutions that has plenty of friends and colleagues in the institutions, I mean you talk about all this stuff and it in a certain way, there's a level of kind of kissing that goodbye, right? I mean at some level by, by being here and calling these things out constantly. And I liken that to I forward you emails probably every day now from people from a zillion walks of life. I mean, you know, high school teachers to choreographers to lighting people to all scared, scared of the exact same thing that you're describing. They are seeing this photo diversity come down on them and certain people now by their gender, usually male by their skin color, usually white and all of these other things are realizing their careers or coming to an end that they are afraid that their future no longer works, the things that they believed in no longer work. Um, so first I just want to know just you personally like it, that is a real shift for you. It has to be right. I don't even know if you want to do this publicly, but I'm, no, I know. Let me see if I, if I even

Speaker 3:          00:50:11       understand that we are, let's talk about what it is that we learn when we do shows and we meet people afterwards. Here's what we know that nobody else in my opinion knows. We know that people are terrified. Yeah. The people who are coming to these shows are saying, thank you for speaking out. I'm almost ready to say something at work, but I'm fear that I'll lose my job and my livelihood. And I've got two kids at home.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       And by the way, it's often things like, I believe in low taxes. It's not, you know what I mean? With God, it's, it's like it's nothing I believe in free speech. Yeah. I think maybe James Damore was, was railroaded. Oh my God. But he's James Damore. He's that. He's that tech Bro. That's bro on the end of anything. But also the idea that group, the bro report, it's like, okay, now we don't have to take it seriously. But also him as tech bro in praying that he's like this frat boy, like, like cocky as well. This is the most do mujer word. Yeah, this is the most, no, he's like, yeah, I think he's openly on the spectrum, right? He, he's a, he's a total, he's the shyest. I mean really in all the shows I've done, I don't have any, how many hundreds of interviews I've done. He's the only guests that I felt I needed to spend probably a half hour in the green room just chatting with them to get comfortable enough to talk. This was not a bro who wants to get in there and grow it up. But this is the fun part. Yeah. Like I think Bernie Bros were totally, you know, it was basically an invention

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       that institutional voice is dying because it's so funny and I think that this, cause it's so ludicrous at this point. The thing is, you and I happen to have really good information about how many people are scared. And we also know that the reason that they're scared is that a tiny number of people who hold these very extreme positions have found their way into the high leverage seats. If you're sitting on the editorial board of the New York Times, that's a high leverage cedar. If you're a columnist, that's a high leverage seat, or if you're in the admissions office or if you're in human resources or if you are, you know, uh, a judge or a lawmaker. And so people are seeking out these high leverage positions if they hold very radical perspectives, which has to do with alternative logic. I mean, I think, I want to say very clearly that the real reason that I'm so dead set against this is that people can't be trusted with this level of epistemic inconsistency.

Speaker 3:          00:52:48       And I've referred to this as the alternative logic network, and I just want to say one or two things from a mathematician's perspective. You asked me like how I see this from a, from a math, but yeah, give me a little math for God's sake. There's a principle called the principle of explosion and it says roughly that from a contradiction you can deduce anything, smuggle one contradiction through airport security. And on the other side you can come up with anything. Two equals seven, two equals a chicken. Um, you know, the United States doesn't exist. And so this is where scientists get very persnickety about somebody saying, oh, come on, just let us tweak what we say about biology a little bit. It's like, no, there will be no tweaking of logic itself. We are not going to allow you, if we can avoid to smuggle one structural contradiction in because once you get one in, it's all over.

Speaker 3:          00:53:48       This is, this has to do with the unity of nature. I don't want biology to give me many of the results that it gives me. Tough biology is what it is. I don't have the right to say, uh, you know, let's say microcephaly. Small heads, uh, has no effect on intelligence or that people with down syndrome are just as capable as anybody else because it's not true. I want it to be true, but my wanting it to be true doesn't have that effect. And if I start making those adulterations, then the whole thing falls apart. So this is sort of where you and your brother Brett and, and your sister in law, Heather and many other pejorative and a bunch of other people have been saying that that's the fear that if the gender studies stuff and all of this progressive, then you ask Jack gets into science.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       We, we literally blow apart all the progress, all the real progress. We'll never make sense. You can actually make progress on the male female stuff if you're pretending that males and females or both simultaneously totally different and totally the same. Yeah. Right? And you have to pretend both in order to get this new version of progressivism to work. So you're literally smuggling in a contradiction. So if you say, look, we really need a diverse workplace, um, let's say between men and women. And we noticed that in this particular occupation, it's 80, 20, um, and that has to do only with oppression because otherwise it would be 50, 50. Well, what you've just done is you've said, we know that there's no cognitive difference between males and females, um, because we've just assigned all of the difference to oppression, right? Because it would be exactly equal.

Speaker 3:          00:55:27       But if you allow males and females to, to, um, to coexist, you're going to get this huge bonanza because now you're going to have intellectual diversity. Now there, there's actually something very clever and very important to say that has to do with the kind of fishers, uh, notion of equivalence of males and females in terms of fitness strategies. Um, so there is a kind of equivalent, but when you destroy the true biological understanding of the, of why males and females have the same expected return is fitness strategies in favor of this dime store nonsense, you actually destroy the ability to correct for imbalances. And so we're, we're, and Heather and I come down, um, is that we say in your rush to build utopia, you're going to destroy everything that we've done and you can't take the shortcut. That's really what's important. The intellectually these

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       shortcuts will eventually cause the system to collapse. And so it's not that were not sympathetic with the idea that we'd love to see more, more female programmers, but let's figure out, and this is actually what Dimauro was focused on. Like what changes can we make in order to, you know, respect the biology and make this work? And so I, I, I think that that's what's, what's so confusing is that this push to assign so much, um, to what is essentially an intellectual universe of pure contradiction is what's offending many people who consider themselves progressives, which is like w I think absolutely we're in the row, we progressive's are in the right. But you have to do it honestly. You can't just cheat and pretend things that you wished to be true and, and close your eyes and put your fingers in your ears and say, ah, I'm not going to listen to data and analysis.

Speaker 2:          00:57:21       But do you see any people on the left besides you guys trying to fix this thing? Well, this, yes, but, but they're scared. You see, this is what's so terrifying about these current fake progressive's is, is that they're just scary people. They, they, they say, oh, we need more empathy and then what are they interested in? Are they interested in the notion of progress or justice? Well, justice is all about sticking it to somebody. Like you have something that belongs to this other person, but progress is just like, let's make things better. And hopefully, um, you know, where there is injustice, we can, we can identify a bad guy, but where there is no injustice and it's just somebody out of luck. You're just trying to try to raise people up. I want to say one other thing that I realized I forgot to say somewhere else.

Speaker 2:          00:58:11       Yeah. Dana Boyd brought up a very interesting issue which she called strategic silence and the idea which isn't a bad one and initially is that if somebody should not have their voice amplified, let's imagine that you have a manifesto and you decide that you're going to kill 30 people. Um, and in the desire to figure out what the motivation is that you're going to have your manifesto broadcast all over the world. So the UNI bomber didn't kill 30, but he killed a bunch, uh, killed a few people and names and people and his manifesto was read widely. So strategic silence is the idea that reporters should not be played or used and they should be silent about certain things. I think that what she did not realize is that this much strategic silence cannot function in an intelligent, open society. People are simply to mute in the press about all sorts of things that the rest of us have a very legitimate interest in knowing.

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       And if you're going to be strategically silent, you should be sharing the idea that the policy of this paper is that it doesn't look at motive on individual instances unless the constitutes a pattern. But like if you take terrorists killings when somebody reports, you know, 10 people were killed today and the attacker said something religious in a foreign language at the end, you're not helping things. You're creating a belief that there is some kind of conspiracy and we don't know what that's about. Is it an honest desire to protect our vulnerable communities, in which case many of us would be supportive or is it because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, uh, has some relationship with our government that may be strategic that we will want more information about? Is that, is that a special favor to a foreign power? I don't know what that is, but what I do know is that if people are dying and that there's a motive that's linking multiple killings, for example, you can't afford strategic silence and pretend that this thing just doesn't exist.

Speaker 3:          01:00:25       I think that that's partially where this, uh, our overlords in the institutional class are so far off, is that they're not realizing that there's no possible way to get rid of t to get away with this level of strategic silence. And that's what created Donald Trump is that he was willing to break strategic silence everywhere and people were willing to say, look, he may be crazy. He may be immoral, but at least he's not under the thumb of whatever this thing is. Right. But they're crazy. And Mro, he's just showing us his crazy anymore. I think that if I'm allowed to be mean, I think that's the way the average Trump voter felt. They're crazy and a moral, these people, I felt somebody is probably crazy and, but he's doing it. Okay. I just don't like being lied to in, in terms that, uh, a stupid child would never accept because these lies, I need better lies.

Speaker 3:          01:01:19       No, I do. This is what I talk about. Adult level fiction. Are you talking about the lies of the nature of the gate institutions or are you talking about the rise of Trump and of the gated institution there? I understand that you want to not create an incentive structure so that people murder people so that they can get their message out and amplify. That makes good sense to me. And when we get to the point where this thing is big enough, we may have to consider all of the issues that the traditional media had to consider. However, what is absolutely not acceptable, nobody from the State Department has ever contacted any one of us and said, hey, I'm a little bit worried, uh, as to what you guys are doing. Do you understand how this fits in? Can you come in? Uh, you know, we understand that you guys are, are trying to do good, but let, let us tell you what you s objectives are.

Speaker 3:          01:02:04       I've never been a part of any conversation like this, uh, in the last 20 years, right? Voc Salata buzzfeed things were so dangerous and yet nobody's getting radicalized in the name of Vera client's time. Well, but you know, we're also d radical. Most of us are. Most of us are patriotic and I will definitely tailor some of what I say, uh, to national interests if I'm aware of what those national interests are. But if you're not contacting us and then you're smearing us, then that's your only means of control. You're not talking about a free society, you're talking about a Potemkin democracy. And I'm not going to participate in your Potemkin democracy, either have the conversation or be prepared that nobody's going to obey your strategic silence and you can get rid of all of us, but you're not going to get rid of the number of people are going to take our seats and the more force you use to get rid of us, the more you're going to radicalize people in the name of liberty.

Speaker 3:          01:03:01       And I think that, you know, this is very important that this is really a war over sensemaking and we have a right to be, I mean I wanna I want to state this rather emphatically, this idea of d platforming, sensible, rational people who are smarter than the people who are being platform to where more moral, more decent and saying, well you can't come in because you're not part of the narrative agreement. That's how you get something like the French revolution. And so if you want to, if you want to say thank you to things like the Ruben report, we are taking this, the pressure off of this system. You are alive so transparently about so many things that no sane or smart person as an adult can believe. And thank God there's some place where people can come and say, I thought I was losing my mind.

Speaker 3:          01:03:52       And then here you guys are, and it's clear that you're not radical. You're not mean spirited, you're not bad, bad hearted. There's no shortage of PhDs in our system. There's no shortage. You know, Comedians as an alternate intellectual universe, you guys lost the plot in the institutional space. Why don't you come out to the comedy store? Why, why, why, why don't you come out at for dinner, uh, the, you know, the next time we have it, why didn't you call us into Washington and say, look, here's what our strategic objectives. And then we'll say, okay, you can't lie that much to people, but what you can do is you can present the truth in different ways and stop making everyone feel like they're being gaslit. All right, so here's what

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       I do. I think we've done probably about an hour or so right now. Maybe an hour 10. We're going to do about an hour and a half total, just the two of us. Then we want you guys in on this. So patrion.com/ruben report and whatever level you're at, we're going to take your question. So jump in on that. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:04:48       all this being said, do you think, I think

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       perhaps that we're winning and I say winning. I've been floating this idea for a couple months now, and it's partly because of what I'm seeing out there with Jordan and when I've been saying it to the audiences, I always say it with the kind of tongue in cheek, you know, I think maybe we're starting to win guys, and 3000 people cheer at once because they haven't heard that before. They haven't been around a huge group of people where they can go. These people are all sorts of different, I don't know any of these people, but we're kind of in on this together now. Jordan always brings up the point often in his talks that it's not about winning per se, because if this was a marriage, you don't want to beat your wife in an argument because then you're just married to a loser. You want to get to a place where you can both maybe have one in lost.

Speaker 1:          01:05:32       Maybe you won the argument, but there was a lesson learned. That's the type of winning I'm talking about. I suspect that they now think we are such a huge threat for all the reasons that you've just laid out, that they're going after us in crazy ways. That to me shows we're winning. When I saw the veracity of the, of the pieces that came out after this lovely report here, uh, I thought, wow, we're actually bigger than these guys now. I don't have hundreds of millions of dollars behind me like vox does. I've got patrons and super chat money, you know, and it's like we're doing, what you referred to before is this sort of slim thing, which is really cool right now. And there's reasons that it's really strong right now and maybe, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:06:13       we'll all grow ferocity. That do you mean the veracity of the for us? I think I meant the veracity. Okay. That these are not, these are not very truthful reports.

Speaker 1:          01:06:24       Well, I meant the, that they, there were so many of them.

Speaker 3:          01:06:26       Oh, okay. Wait, give me those two definitions there. What do I do? What did I say? It doesn't matter. Um, this is why I shouldn't be interviewing smarter people. No, I don't know. Maybe I'm getting it wrong. Yeah. So the um, but there's, there's a signal being read by these people. Like holy cow, they've got all this money and they've got all this power. Yeah. I've been tricked my rule in general. I need a dictionary when I'm dealing with, with, with, with the, with the intelligence community. So whenever you're talking about something sensitive, you should clump around because they don't like to be surprised is what I'm talking about. Immigration and stuff. I try to make a lot of noise. I tried to make a lot of noise. This, this alternative network. Um, and the good part of it, which is what I'm focused on, I'm not talking about, I don't know, whatever Richard Spencer is saying to baked Alaska cause who, who, who gives a shit.

Speaker 3:          01:07:14       Yeah. Um, the good part of this network has been making a ton of noise. Hey, this is important. People are listening. The events, you know, our large people are fanatical and they're normal people. Um, we are winning at some level, but we are losing, we're not winning quickly enough and clean enough. Well, that's what I always say. What do I say to you every week? We're not moving fast enough. Well, okay, but this thing has its own pace. So somehow when the gated institutional narrative issues or report that tries to take you all out, um, next time guys, first of all, assigned somebody better than Rebecca because she just doesn't have the chops yet. Maybe, maybe in five years if you're going to come for us, come loaded for bear and do it intellectually correct. Um, my concern is, is that the next moves are going to be highly personal. Like how do we take out, you know, you saw this thing with

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       Rogan talking about white farmers in Africa. You know, Rogan says some crazy stuff on his show. I'm not sure whether what he said was crazy or not, cause I haven't looked at this, but I have no doubt that Joe holds some positions that are, that are off. I certainly hold positions that are often, when I find them, I try to correct them, but suddenly the litany of people going after him as if he's a racist because he even talked about this. Well, yes. And you know, Rebecca Lewis is very adamant that we shouldn't have gotten angry at Elan Musk for smoking dope. Uh, on the show. We should have gotten angry that a Elon Musk went on Joe Rogan because he gave a platform to James Moore and Jordan Peterson. Jordan. I mean, doesn't that tell you everything? This kind of bananas a inside of this tiny little bubble stuff, um, they're going to get more sophisticated.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       So just thinking about it as a video game, um, we've been playing with like lots of low level orks on level zero and, okay. So then things got ratcheted up. This isn't terribly serious. It's going to get more serious because as the narrative outcomes to understand just how big these channels are, just how influential they are. Let, let me be open about something. Part of the theory behind defining the Idw, uh, has to do with my understanding of how demography works in presidential elections. So one way of winning an election is that you find a demographic that nobody knew existed and then you speak to them and they're large enough to sway things. So soccer moms remember soccer moms. Okay. Another one of these things was Karl Rove's discovery of the excerpt where you have urban, suburban something and then rural in between suburban and rural, there was this thing that nobody understood called the excerpt.

Speaker 2:          01:10:03       And so by finding that you could find some demographic chunk. So both parties, uh, let me be very clear about this. The IDW nation is quite large. It's people who've had enough of low level lies. They don't mind adult level fictions that are in the best interests of everybody, but they cannot put up with this level of nonsense coming out of our institutions and part of what's going on inside the institutions at the institutions have a fake public facing front and then an internal group. And this is how they handle things. So like, um, I think Danny Roderick talked about, um, public voice and seminar voice that as an economist you can say certain things to your colleagues, but when you're talking to the public, you have to say different things. And unfortunately they don't even really mirror each other too closely. Right? And so it's okay to lie to the public. And so when you've talked to an economist and you say, well, you can't possibly believe what, what, uh, that immigration and trade or pure positives of course not. Well, but you just said that or you allowed your colleague to say you stayed know well, that's what you have to say in front of the public because they can't follow the analytic argument. Well, okay, that's a, that's academic malpractice. You're engaged in academic malpractice when you do that. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:11:19       whatever you say to the public has to be a version of what you're saying in private or you're engaged in some kind of Potemkin statecraft. And if the idea is that we can't have a country, because actually if you, if you took the constitution seriously, it wouldn't work. Then we have to talk about, okay, well what are we going to do that would work that, that would actually be viable. But right now what we have is we have a bunch of, um, not very intelligent adults who are not very honest, who are sitting in the most important chairs telling us that we're all idiots and world deplorable across this political spectrum. And that's not going to work and that we are going to win that battle. So for all the people that at every Q and a that I do anywhere, either with Jordan or at the standup shows that I'm doing are we got, I think basically this question, we, we did a little IDW, is it pretty awesome?

Speaker 1:          01:12:03       Actually, within a day we set up an IDW, there's an IDW group now, which they're springing up all over the place. This one sprung up in New York City. We did a, a room down on Bleecker street, 300 people standing room only. We did it for free. They, you know, whatever we grifters, I know it's such grifters you did it for free. Uh, but, but putting that aside, uh, the question that consistently comes up is, okay, we get all this people go, you know, get, all the ideas were onboard and we like what you're doing. We want to help. We're ready to, you know, show our faces and, and be part of this whole thing. We know there's a technological answer. How is it that you morons haven't come up with it yet? There's some version of that, like aren't you guys the ones supposed to be doing all right? Well you and I have been talking and working on this in various ways.

Speaker 2:          01:12:47       Let's just be honest about this. We haven't known when the right time is because the investment in trying to rebuild the infrastructure and then there's a question about how are you going, you know, if on the other side of this thing, there really is a collaboration between technology, intelligence and media. Uh, it doesn't make sense to build the system only to have it torn down by people with special access, um, in a non competitive non-market kind of a way. But make no mistake, um, this is a viable concept. I think it's going to happen. I think it's important that it happened before 2020. Um, and the key, you know, people should know that there's a lot of billionaire interest in this. There's a lot, and I don't mean one person. I mean several billionaires are sniffing around this. Um, and I think Ben Shapiro just got to this show on Fox.

Speaker 2:          01:13:42       I'll be on this Friday. Okay. So, uh, this is going to heat up. And I think what's really important is to watch what happens to data and society as this particular, um, report, uh, finds its course. Because if what we see is that the institutions agreed to cite this because it's a big serious report in a pdf file. Um, then that's going to tell us a lot about how far the institutions are gone. And I, you and I differ somewhat where I believe I want to rebuild the institutions because I think it's a shame to, we've got some bad hermit crabs and some perfectly good shells. I don't want to crack the shells just to get it. The hermit crabs. I think your feeling is, is that things are so rotten that it might be better starting from scratch.

Speaker 1:          01:14:29       Well, I feel that mostly about the Democrats. I don't feel that about our institutions, so I don't feel that about our academic institutions and things of that nature. I think those things, I agree. I want to keep that Shell. Let's get rid of the bad crabs that are in there. Fine. Um, but the Democrats, I think it's basically through and through at this point, but maybe not. And, and I would be, believe me, if the day comes, and I have to eat crow on that one because they came back to sanity and there's suddenly a new JFK and a Daniel Patrick Moynihan and I will gladly eat crow and mia culpa, the whole Shebang.

Speaker 2:          01:15:02       I think one of the big questions is how do we save the, uh, you know, I think I've, I've asked before, does this come down to the University of Chicago or the, are they the only ones who are holding the line, uh, on the enlightenment standards? But I think one of the things we should be doing in the, in the academic institutions is having debates where two departments are studying the exact same thing like gender and sex, uh, in biology departments and gender, women's studies departments, uh, or for example, the wage gap where you have the economists version of this. And then you have like, let's say the women's studies version of this. Um, we should be holding debates to bring about the unity of knowledge. And so we understand where are we divided if you have two different academic standards, uh, I think people would be shocked if they looked at the article which introduced the concept I think of white privilege and maybe mail, which was like unpacking the knapsack coming out of Wellesley.

Speaker 2:          01:16:06       If they looked at the, that's where a lot of this stuff was born. Right? That very piece, well that some of it was born in that piece. Some of it was born, I think it a woman's name is professor Crenshaw at Ucla. The intersectionality, which originally had a very different flavor than what we call it intersectionality today. Um, it's very important to look at the, at the genesis of these ideas and to look what is their academic pedigree. And you know, they're not all terrible ideas, but a lot of them are just puristics that are fighting things that are much farther down in the stack. And it's not tamale anybody. You'll look if, if, if the wage gap is really 25 cents, I want to know, but I don't trust that the wage gap is 25 cents. If somebody refuses to control for things like, you know, the choice of what field they get, their training or how much kin work they're doing. And you know, as I've said on this program before, if the problem is, is that uh, too much kin work is falling to females and that this is uncompensated, we may have to do something which

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       this real labor that is being done for society in monetary terms, women may need to get paid more, you know, but let's make the arguments honestly, and let's stop lying about everything where if you don't sign up for the idea that there's a 25 cent wage gap, um, which has no known source other than oppression, uh, that you need to be deeply informed and not be able to learn, earn a living because your, your views are beyond the pale. That's, that's, that's moronic. I think that's a break right there. That was pretty sad. You want to do something so you finally focused, you know, I do all the shows with you and I'm like, ah, what is he saying? Really? I want to get back to the tits for and Thall Magic Square and large exceptional lead groups or whatever the chaff. I really only did that just so in the title.

Speaker 1:          01:17:51       We could put tits, Freud and Dorcas tits on youtube plays. We never saw what happened with that experiment. Whether it got a higher view camp. Oh, I should check him out. I have no idea. Well, you never know how youtube is manipulating these things. All right people, here's what we're going to do. We're going to take literally one two minute break. We are going to pour whiskey. You always say that is going to be one or two. Do you have to pee this time? Probably. All right, well then depending on how long Dr Eric Weinstein has to urinate, that will be the length of the break. We're gonna pour some whiskey on the rocks and then we're going to take some questions. So patrion.com/ruben report, we're going to give you guys preferential treatment. Uh, you can jump in on super chat as well. Oh. And by the way, I'm the, on October 5th, I am going to be at wise guys in Utah, a comedy doing about an hour of comedy and there will be a special guest from the intellectual dark web.

Speaker 1:          01:18:38       It's a big one. I don't want to say who you've joined me. Pq, can you, I'm going to ask for a plug for my, a new youtube channel. And you're doing the youtube and I'm on Instagram because I'm getting, I want to diversify so that if I get kicked off of Twitter for something, I'm not completely dependent on that place is sort of depressing. So they did, they put out this alternative influencer network about youtubers. You've put up at least three videos. Yeah. You didn't get on. I'm a major youtube or man Erickson, the a on the youtube. What is it? Just a slash Eric r Weinstein or how do you know what it is? I, I actually will fire. We're going to find it. We're going to comment on the video after the livestream. Ah, give us like two minutes. Whiskey your questions. patrion.com/rubin report. Uh, we'll be right back.

Speaker 5:          01:19:37       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:26:28       All right guys. We are back. We've got whiskey. First off chairs my friend. Cheers. Let's see what happens because of all the guff that, uh, Ilan took when he went on Rogen your shot telling everybody this is not actually whiskey. It's, it's IOWASCA. It's Iowasca that's right on the rocks. You wouldn't smoke weed on camera with you. Pardon me? You wouldn't smoke weed on camera with you? Never. Alright, here we go. So real quick, uh, we're gonna take questions from a patriotic people first. So Reuben, select patrion.com/rubin report. Uh, we've got a whole bunch of questions already. Uh, we'll do some stuff on super chat as well. I will be at wiseguys in Salt Lake City on October 5th, Dave ruben.com/events and the links in the description right down below. All right. What us normies get is that the very personal attacks against famous people are a warning to the normies.

Speaker 3:          01:27:25       Not to step out of line. Do you agree with this? Absolutely. Yeah. That's what I've been pushing for a while. Well, this in terms of this network diagram, um, I just, you know, so this guy, Cody Wilson, who had the three d printable guns defense distributed. So I follow him on Twitter and there was just an ominous tweet, which is like Cody Wilson is followed by the following accounts. Well, I, I'd follow Adolf Hitler if you were on Twitter to know what he's thinking. I mean the fact that you follow somebody, if that's evidence of your moral turpitude and how base and file you are. I mean, for God's sakes, if I was at war, I would tune into my enemies broadcasts. You can't tell anything from that. So this is part of the scare tactics and I think that those of us who are trying to be the advanced guard and have to make fun of this.

Speaker 3:          01:28:15       Yeah. So yes, you're, they are trying to scare you that if you listened to these people, you will be radicalized, you will be unemployable. And, um, let us take the first few steps and make fun of this. And then it would be great if you followed in behind and made fun of us, made fun of not us, but well they can make fun of us. That's fine. But they certainly do. But yeah, that make fun of this mania about saying, well, so and so talked to so and so talked to. So and so. And I just want to say one thing about this I haven't gotten to yet. Yeah. The whole concept of a safe space is not about people being triggered that I think is false. I think what it is is about safety for narratives. And so if you have a nonsensical narrative as you do in cult,

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       that narrative cannot survive direct contact with outsiders. And so if you think about it, it's funny that the institutions are actually a cult like network that aren't confident enough of their opinions. I mean, look, I've never taken any kind of class in my life. Uh, I want to tell people that their calculation, the calculation of CPI, um, on a cost of living a basis with changing preferences is completely wrong. And I know how to do it. And my wife knows how to do it. And so far as I know, nobody else knows how to do it. And if you want to come at me and say, that's nonsense and this is the, the ratings of an amateur, uh, name the time and the place. I'll show up at any ECON department and make that argument that kind of a, a narrative, um, which is that you have to have a secret group of people adjusting the CPI.

Speaker 2:          01:29:53       Um, because so much is indexed to CPI. So billions of dollars change hands when you change the calculation of CPI. Uh, that's a nonsensical statement. And so you need a safe space that says only the experts can understand this. That's the same thing that we're seeing with so many of our positions, which is that people imagine, um, that the safe space is about not wanting to hurt people's feelings. No, no, no. It's about not wanting, uh, these nonsensical narratives to come into contact with intelligent critics. And I think that people have to understand that you're being warned away from PhDs, from, uh, other alternative intellectuals who have a lot to say. Like Noam Chomsky, um, because the narratives are being protected.

Speaker 1:          01:30:39       So a couple of people have asked me questions like this that I've gotten before just now, but I did get it here. So I'm just going to sort of paraphrase it. I think you saw the moment when I had Shapiro on a couple of weeks ago and we got into the gay cake thing again. He said he would not bake me a cake for my anniversary party. He said he may not even come to my anniversary party. And I said, my hope is that if we can remain friends for 50 years, I can move you on this. Now I understand that I cannot be friends with Ben exactly the same way. I can be friends with you because of that particular issue. We can be friends and friendly and, and allies in a lot of ways. But we, there's a separation there for sure. But I do consider him a friend who I have differences with and that's okay. And I want to respect his differences and he's not trying to take away my marriage or jail me or take away my things as people keep telling me he's trying to do. I'm curious what you just thought of that exchange, just as watching somebody talk about morals and sin and how that's related to your ability to be friends with someone. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:31:43       I've got a terrible view on this. That's why I ask. Um, I don't know, I think Ben is actually being very genuine in terms of the analytics of it, but are you don't sense that he's got, I think it's a very formal homophobia as opposed to a visceral homea homophobia. Like, okay, there's some, uh, there's some passage in the, in the Torah that says this is not good. And so it says, thou shall not lie with a man as you would a woman basically. But I don't lie with women that way, so it's all good. You know what I mean? Let's not make a big deal in. Yeah. Um, okay, so focus the, uh, so I think that Ben is actually being reasonable and you know, in the same way that as a, as a guy with a, a fair number of clothes, a gay male friends, I know that there are some parties that you guys feel comfortable inviting me to and other parties that you wouldn't feel comfortable inviting me to.

Speaker 2:          01:32:53       I'm not sure what you mean. Not Go higher than me. I'm not having those parties. You can come to any of my parties. Somebody whose name will not be known, would not be known to your audience. Once said to me, um, if it's boys soup, uh, and there are a lot of twinks running around, you're not going to be the one getting the invitation and I hope you're okay with it. So that would be a kind of discrimination that would be for my benefit. And I think that, you know, this is what happens when Ben brings his own food to the dinner party you're having, he's trying to say, how do I integrate into your life in a way that allows me to keep my modern Orthodox position? And I actually really valued, I is honesty and I, and I, and I just, I want to get something across.

Speaker 2:          01:33:38       And Ben's defense, which is, yeah, it does seem kind of backward. And on the other hand it seemed kind of awesome. Um, which was that he was owning that this was a discomfort. There was no real bar in my opinion, to the depth of your friendship and he's just going to be formal about it. Yeah. By the way, if you hang around with Orthodox Jews, they, there's a lot of this, they're very formal about rules and they're also very adept at getting around them. And so this is exactly what I expect from an Orthodox Jew is that he is open minded in some ways. He's, I think he's very progressive on this front and he's going to be upfront, like formally, I can't do these things. Uh, but it's very similar to when I have Muslim friends in, you know, I have Turkish friends and stumble and you're having an fs beer and um, then you say, hey, you know, isn't it strange that you're a Muslim and you're having this beer?

Speaker 2:          01:34:32       And they said, you know, I really shouldn't. And they put the beer down for the rest of the meal. Or in India you talk about people being confirmed, bachelors that are gay, just give people their formal out. Uh, and that's the way that they're dealing with their form of formal homophobia. I don't think it's very deep. Yeah. And I just thought all these people were like, oh, she Reuben such a sellout. He's letting, he's sitting there with someone, tells him he's a sinner and it's like, well then when they're ready to come to the adult table, we'll welcome them there. We all right. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:35:01       well we answered it. You answered a couple of, there's a lot about just like how can a business be built around this? Um,

Speaker 2:          01:35:08       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:35:08       Eric, I'd love to see you have a discussion with the free market. Economists like Brian Kaplan. Would you be interested in something like that? I've had Brian Kaplan on the show. He's, yeah, he's an endcap guy. I really, I mean, I like those ideas. I just liked the intellectual place that those, I didn't know you'd be happy to do that. Right. I think so. Yeah. Why not,

Speaker 2:          01:35:25       right. Talk to Tyler Cowen a lot in Tyler and I disagree on some stuff, but um, you know, just as people should know, the universe of smart generative people is so small that we don't usually screen each other on ideology. We're just so happy to, to meet somebody who's thinking deeply and his open

Speaker 1:          01:35:44       or just basically will act in good faith. And then it's like, oh, you think differently. Okay. It's all good. I didn't know about this, maybe you did, but how do you feel about the nation of Hungary proposing to ban gender studies as a discipline at their universities? Had you heard about this?

Speaker 2:          01:35:56       No. Um, I mean I think it's very important to, I would not ban gender studies. I think I would do what I just said, which is, uh, make sure that you have a uniform standard of scholarship and not, um, a form of scholarship that is friendly to activism. You have to make sure that activist scholarship, uh, is recognized as something other than pure inquiry. I mean, are you capable of disseminating a, finding that you're very upset to find that that's a prerequisite for having professorial privileges, uh, in terms of tenure and academic freedom? I suspect there's very little of that these days. People that truly go in without any sciences, there's tons of it. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, this is my, my basic take on the universities is the heart and soul of the great research universities. It's hard core disciplines. We've done much more in those disciplines than anybody else.

Speaker 2:          01:36:59       And so who are you and get out of my lab, uh, is an important principle. And as long as we have something that keeps bad scholarship from getting in, from, you know, bringing the principle of explosion, as we talked about before into the sciences, um, we should start exporting a scientific notions of rigor and we should be holding debates between disciplines to make sure that everything is other piece rather than saying, okay, well you have no wage gap and you have a wage gap. We don't even know if it's the same word. Um, so I, I think that it's a bad move. Instead, what we should do is we should make sure that all of these fee, and by the way, if gender studies has figured out some things that the biologists don't know, we have to take our lumps in biology. It's not, it's not a, there's no fix in that game.

Speaker 1:          01:37:46       Do you have any recommendations for having a more s epistemological? The honest, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:37:51       responsible conversation. I think that the anti is much higher than people imagine that one of the w you know, I think about, um, I don't know why I do this, but I think about the old shows love boat and fantasy island versus game of Thrones in the Sopranos. Like the Auntie is a lot higher these days. We are smart and we have long attention span, put down love boat on my show. I have a thing, I carry a torch for Julie. Um, but, uh, the cruise director, um, I, I think that people have to understand that if you want to behave in a more epistemically consistent fashion, uh, you're going to need to budget one or two orders of magnitude more brain space because most of them, the heuristics that have been pushed out or completely unworkable in our modern world. And once you open up that brain space, once you say, okay, I'm going to follow game of Thrones for season after season in episode after episode, you're having a much better time than you ever had, uh, with shows that had to have their entire narrative arcs concluded within 30 minutes. And that sadly they did that on love boat,

Speaker 1:          01:39:07       right? Like it's like you got an hour, it was about we're going to do this and we're going to wrap this thing around in 40 minutes. And there you go. Eric, what do you think about a potential satellite based Internet solution? Because it seems like I SSPs are going to start banding content over landlines. I mean this goes to all the technological things that people are talking about.

Speaker 2:          01:39:24       Well, right, so you, you tell us, uh, how much you want to persecute us and then you'll cause the development of a crypto and smart contracts and satellites and that can be free market guy. I'm like, no, I just want people to be happy. Free market. Okay. Um, is,

Speaker 1:          01:39:44       well, there's again, there's a lot about that. Is there anything to be done with social media and funding platforms and payment processors who are in the sensor sip business? It's sort of the same question. You can give me something on that while I'm looking here.

Speaker 2:          01:39:56       Um, look, there are some very serious problems that the major platforms are facing that we are not facing. And I think it's very important for us to recognize that once you break it, you've bought it. So if we start our own thing, they're going to be all sorts of intellectual half measures that are going to have to happen. Um, so we're in a relatively luxurious position riding on top of somebody else's platform and they're handling the problems. I do think they're going to have to be innovations. As I said earlier, there's something I forgot to say that it's very important that I'm just going to shove in here. There's this talk about whether or not Google is biasing search. Oh, I'm glad you're bringing this. This is super. Let's really do this. Yeah, we should have done this in the first part of my bed.

Speaker 2:          01:40:44       All right. Google is biasing search and the way in which they're able to say, we don't buy a search is how they buy a search, so need to look up m l fairness, machine learning, fairness. Google has released a video and they talk about their need to unbiased search. That's how the bias is coming in. This is the Google is acting, and I think I said this in a tweet as an incompetent ophthalmologist, you have a very mild case, let's say, of a stigmatism or myopia and Google says, oh my God, you're suffering from some terrible, they're sightedness in your eye. Your eyeballs are all misshapen here. We're going to give you the craziest, thickest glasses you can imagine. Now you're blind as a bat when you, when you're putting those on. But from their perspective, they're helping you unbias your bias problem. Uh, can, can you just for people that haven't got this, can you explain why they think and biasing makes sense? Sure.

Speaker 2:          01:41:41       It is definitely true that physics, let's say, used to be a much more European dominated male activity. It just is. It was now it is less so now, but it is still very often dominated by men who are a fair of you. Right? There perspective is, well that's a bias because in the past that's what physicists looked like. So if you do an image search, we should be correcting for that bias. So we're going to show you, uh, Neil degrasse Tyson. Uh, we're going to show you Stefan Alexander or James Gates. And so you know that they're showing you African Americans and then maybe, you know, surely, uh, what's her name? Shirley Jackson, a black female. And so suddenly you're saying, well, wow, this is really crazy. I'm doing the search on physicists and I'm seeing all black faces or something like this. And so what they're doing is that they're claiming to undo latency bias, which is the data hasn't caught up to the world.

Speaker 2:          01:42:46       That will be where things are much more equal. And so we've just fit you with the prescription, but you're looking at this and saying, wow, you're really biasing your data in order to have a social justice agenda. And so whatever's going on with Donald Trump, he's not saying the magic words. The question isn't to Google. Are you biasing your data? The question the Google is, are you an biasing your day? Tell me how your unbiased in your data. And the, the, the phrase that pays is ml fairness. I should also say that anybody who knows engineers within youtube and Google and all of these things knows that some of them are very unhappy. And some of those very unhappy engineers are talking about all of the ways that they're being forced to degrade the product and to privilege certain sources. Like I've seen a list of rankings of various news sources as to how authoritative they should be. And so the no, no surprise, um, very liberal institutional medias and gets very high rankings. And so from their perspective, none of this has

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       nothing to do with politics. It just has to do with biasing authoritative sources. Well that has everything to do with the fact that you think it's authority. Please just open this up so the rest of us can, can toggle these switches because if, if you're going to tell me, I mean I, I know that a lot of things in the New York Times happened to be true, but I also know that it has a very strong ideological bias at the moment that's getting worse. And so I don't feel the same way about privileging the New York Times. I think this is something else that I want to talk about. There are no authoritative sources that we can use as baseline at the moment and it's a little bit like having a dollar denominated fund at a point when the dollar is falling or rising rapidly relative to everything else.

Speaker 3:          01:44:41       If you are referencing yourself, like Wikipedia says, we accept authoritative sources and then there's some activists that gets into one of the sources that they consider authoritative and then Wikipedia says, okay, well we have to print this because it occurred in an authoritative source. That's why the danger of letting the Sarah Johns of the world in, in their activist role, um, is because we now don't know what an authoritative sources. I would say that there are no authoritative sources of an institutional nature at the moment because all of the institutions are scrambling. And quite frankly, this is the one thing that keeps me up at night. And the whole IDW concept was an answer to the question from where will we reboot when this madness is over? Like it's not going to be from, um, departments in universities that have been taken over by activism or news.

Speaker 3:          01:45:35       Oregon's or political parties. It's going to be from individuals. And I think that the thing that is most authoritative right now are the individuals with a lot of surface area who are pretty trustworthy. Do you think there's a cutoff point, uh, for the individuals who the good guys inside? I'm not just talking about the average person right now for the people that are inside that get it, but that are cowards right now and maybe for good reasons that a coward better that are acting cowardly. No, no, no. Or that they don't afraid for a litany of boundaries there. I don't want to say Karen, I'm just going to push, but you know I'm a little more frustrated with these people because they privately come up. But you know what the thing is is that how many nights do I wake up in a cold sweat?

Speaker 3:          01:46:16       Like, oh no, what's going on at, you know, it's a, it's a, so when they come for you, yeah. And there, you know, it's, it's merciless and its life destroying. So I don't think these people are cowards take on the level of risk that you can afford to take on. If you've got two really young kids at home and you're just getting by on a gig economy thing, don't do it. Don't stay at some level. Safe enough that you can meet your obligations. But if you happen to have, as Joe Rogan says, f you money, uh, [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       that's not it. It needs to be more than just the f you money people. No. If you have a little bit of a few money, you don't have to be, you don't have to have eight figures of wealth. If you're in a position where you have very few dependence and you know, you, uh, you do a go pro videos, uh, and with extreme skateboarding on weekends, you're already taking major risks. Get in here, help us out. Don't be a pussy about it. Right? I think there's a cutoff point though for certain people, like once we fix things and if you didn't get onboard, [inaudible] are two more Qurans private truths, public lies. Because the idea is you have some number of people who are willing to go first and then you have some people who are willing to take on slightly less risk, but they're really right in behind you.

Speaker 2:          01:47:33       But the thing is is that we need more people evaluate your risk. If you can afford to join us, join us. That's the point. But look, there are people who, there are people who are being cowardly. They have all the advantages in the world and they won't step up. Those are the ones that I'm frustrated with. Not The average person. Yeah. But I don't want to attack. And eyes are, are people who are saying like, you know, you know, but when I, if I lose my job, how do I provide for my children? We don't understand yet,

Speaker 1:          01:47:59       of course. And I'm not talking about those people. You know, when, when, uh, there was a, there was a dinner we got into where it got pretty heated because there is a certain set of very wealthy Hollywood people that are down with what we're doing and they won't do it publicly. And it's like, and I was the one that was,

Speaker 2:          01:48:14       it's, it's, it's what Morpheus says to neo. He says, I'm not gonna lie to you. Everyone who has ever faced an agent, you know, uh, has met their end. Um, but sooner or later somebody is going to have to and when it's time you'll be able to, okay. Well you have people who are going to try to fight the agents first and the least you can do is don't undermine the people who are taking the risk in order to sell them out to feed them to the crowd. Right. So don't be cipher. Right. Cause you think it gives you a little more time or something. Right. But, but in general, um, if you don't have a lot of obligations and you've got a little bit of change in your pocket and you don't need that much, get in here and help. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:48:54       Uh, David, if you ever had to have tosh 0.0 on the show, seems like a guy who benefits from free speech. I don't think we have tried. I will look into that. Um, oh, I like, I like this one for you because this is a very Jordan Peterson question. Uh, Eric, I have a three month old. How do you raise a responsible, critical thinking son in this polarized postmodern world of bananas?

Speaker 2:          01:49:19       Well, first of all, do something like Peter's give, give me some hand motions. Little of this. No, Jordan, Jordan on me. All right, fine. Um, you know, I kept my son off of social media, just introduced him on my channel. Uh, and Zev is just opened his own his own channel. So check that out. Um, the thing I did was I took my children as seriously as they deserved to be taken as soon as they were ready. And I was astounded really at how quickly a smart child's mind comes online ready to deal with things. And I think I remember when was sandy hook, it's over two years ago now. It's maybe it was, there was, it was a school shooting. And I talked to the children about risk extensively and they weren't that disturbed because they had an intrinsic sense that the odds of anything happening in their school were quite low, but that there is no guarantee. And you know, if I think back on all of the crazy conversations I had with my two children, a daughter and a son, uh, be prepared that it's not just children. Say The darndest thing. Children are ready for much more adult interaction, uh, while still being they're adorable child like cells. And don't be afraid if you find yourself,

Speaker 10:         01:50:43       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:50:45       in a, in a conversation that you can't believe you're having with a three or a four year old. Both of those happened with my children. I remember when I was away, um, I had, I taught myself to play the Vivaldi Largo Movement from a guitar concerto and my daughter said, I miss you Daddy. And she said, listen to this. And she played it on violin. So I knew she wasn't getting it from sheet music. And I just thought like, okay, what you're F you're five [inaudible] six. I don't know. I don't remember what age your children are going to astound you. Take it seriously and don't treat it as if it's adorable. Treat it as if it's serious. Well said.

Speaker 1:          01:51:26       There's a lot of Peterson style questions here. You want to keep going on that whatever you want. All right. Uh, if what Peterson has said is true, that we're living in a 13 year old girls reality and most of the people who want a d platform, the ITW are possibly emotionally stuck. Is attacking their ideas directly effective at all? Or is there any value in starting an emotional discussion that goes on a little bit more from there? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:51:49       well it's, we'll go from that. I think that, um, this is something I said at the end of our performance in New York, uh, on that panel. Um, if you can, if you're in a position to love your opponent out of their cult, do that. You don't have to always return costs and assume, you know, very often you're dealing with frightened and scared people who don't realize that they're much more resilient than they think. They're stronger. The world isn't as hostile. People form completely insane ideas about what they're up against. And you know, I remember, um, my, my, my defacto uncle, uh, Mike Brown, um, who used to invite us onto, onto his, his island up in Washington state, um, I think it was a republican and a positive. He was like the kindest, most generous person. Uh, I could imagine. And people who came to the island who had very strong left of center ideas that had this idea that somehow republicans, we're all selfish.

Speaker 2:          01:52:55       I can't tell you how common that belief and I'd have to point out, you realize that your host is providing everything for you and it's just the kindest best person who give you the shirt off his back. Uh, is voting in a way that you would think of is selfish because he wanted low taxes and he believed that this was the best way to help people out of poverty is to give them self reliance. Try. Yeah. I really believe that in some sense. Um, set an example and try to show people that who they think they're dealing with isn't too, they're dealing with. Um, have you guys discussed the possibility of this movement becoming a third political party? Is that actually even possible? Not only sort of hit on this button needs to be a third political party? I think it should infect both political.

Speaker 2:          01:53:42       I think our system of selective pressures determined by the constitution more or less selects for two parties, whether it's Democrats or Republicans or the weeks come back, doesn't matter. The key thing is that we, we on the left need you on the right to be responsible and you need to know you have a party on the other side. And I think that was the magic where Ben Shapiro after the joint appearance came to me and he said, you know, Eric, the thing that I fight on the left is these claims that the market or society is, is all off. And he says, when you come in with a highly specific complaint about some aspect of the market or, or an impression or something like this, he says, I'm absolutely willing to listen. And I thought, wow. Um, this is how we do it, is that we sh the left takes out, it's garbage on the extreme left.

Speaker 2:          01:54:29       The right takes should take out. It's garbage on the extreme right. And you'll start to see, I think Ben, for example, engages in a certain amount of live baiting that he'd love to stop. And it's really targeted on the extreme. It's not targeted on the center. And I think he would come in. So the center and left and right, it needs to go fight its own wings that are polarizing everything. But the IDW doesn't live in one party and it's not a separate party. What it is is an agreement about what constitutes conversation and what constitutes a legitimate argument. And part of the rap against us is that we're snowflakes and that we don't want to talk to people who think things that are very different from us. In a weird way, I think we don't want to talk to people who have really novel ideas about what constitutes an argument because we have a clear idea of what constitutes and argument and everybody's willing to submit.

Speaker 2:          01:55:26       Okay, you got the better of me. You know, I remember a particular moment where Sam Harris got the better of me and my first podcast with them. Um, the key thing that, that we don't like is when you just make up your own logic, you're not entitled to your own logic and you're probably not entitled to your own facts. And you're not entitled, uh, to just go off on your own. Epistemically inconsistent tangent to get all the goodies. Once you meet some, some of these criteria, I think we'll talk to Moralis. Anybody who's got a decent heart and a desire to figure out what would generally be seen as best for society, but it should be, have a both the left and a right. I'm not interested in it becoming a third party. I like that you call it an agreement. I don't think I've ever heard you say that before.

Speaker 2:          01:56:10       I like that. Um, all right. So we're going to take a couple more on Reuben select. It's patrion.com/ruben report and then we're going to keep drinking whiskey. Uh, Eric, what do you make of the metaphysical implications of the Big Bang? I'm not a lot. Well, give me one more sentence on that. Sure. Uh, when you solve Einstein's equations, there are two essential singularities that you encounter. One is the black hole singularity, um, that you associate with a collapsing star. And the other one is the Big Bang, uh, initial singularity that you associate with the beginning of the universe. And really in some sense what they tell us as mathematicians and now I'm going to take some guff for saying this, but is that Einstein's equations aren't the final aren't the end of the story because they probably wouldn't have these defects if you will. And so there's the big bang that occurs with respect to, you know, the, the, the moment of last scattering or what, however you want to think about what we can observe.

Speaker 2:          01:57:10       Um, and then there's the initial singularity, which has to do with the Einstein equations. And in general, you don't want to make metaphysical inferences around the points of your model, which are least reliable. And so it just for the simple 10 on this one, so if the, so the argument would be that if it was, if these were perfect theories, that the big bang and basically wormholes wouldn't, wouldn't exist. Our molds but, but, but like black holes, courts, chills, singularities yes. That's what the argument is that, that those are the signs that you're not done yet. Got. And so the problem is some people become very attached to the idea that they should be investigating those for metaphysical implications. But likely all your work is going to be wiped out when a better set of equations becomes available if you're trying to make metaphysical meaning out of that.

Speaker 2:          01:58:02       So it's super tempting. And the reason to do it would be that you wanted to push the equations so hard that they broke so you could find the true ones. That doesn't bother me at all, but don't spend too much time thinking about something in a system pushed beyond its domain of reliability. All right, here we go. Two more. Cause we got some stuff to do tonight. Uh, I'm just a regular dude. Other than daily exercise of basic critical thinking. What is the role of regular dudes like me improving the quality of sense making a midst the corrupted institutions you've been discussing the regular guy, not that fuck you money guy. First of all, I don't, I've never met a regular dude. My belief that everybody has something extraordinary in them. So first of all, stop, stop claiming you're just a regular dude unless it's your false modesty. And, um, and then the question is, if you're already here asking these questions and you're a PA, a patron of the Rubin report, uh, think about yourself as already in a tiny minority and take on some goddamn responsibility for where you want to steer this thing and, uh, and ask for help. If you, you know, pick up an order and start rowing man.

Speaker 1:          01:59:11       All right, one more. Um, this is, I'm going to go to super chat. This is Tim pulled. Do you know Tim, by the way? I've never met him, although I think he's reached out to me. Yeah. So Tim is doing great work. He's actually an honest journalists on the graph. He's new, he's on the ground, like in the fricking dead center of the graph. And from what I understand, Tim pools, reactionary journalists, um, idiots. I can hear laughter. Yeah, yeah. Well we know what part we're using as the promo now. Um, Tim Pool, the half Korean white supremacist. It's all so stupid. But, um, Tim and also by the way, I think for the record, if I'm not mistaken, some of the connections that they actually had to Tim don't even exist and a bunch of other stuff. Okay. Uh, Tim said and super chat. They know they're lying about our views. This is the death rattle of an archaic media system. We didn't really talk about their bad intentions enough. I think perhaps because I think you, you always, and I try to, I try not to judge people's intentions. He's going right to their intentions here. They know they're lying. They know what they are,

Speaker 2:          02:00:12       they know they're lying and they think that they're doing it in the service of something beautiful. Yeah. Well then the problem is just the reason I'm left off of this graph with, uh, this white supremacist Korean Tim Pool.

Speaker 1:          02:00:26       And again, I'm super sorry about that. I know that if they would've asked, I wouldn't know. Look, I'm trying to clue for now your brother, everybody. I was, I was too busy trying to organize Nuremberg style rally. Um, the reason that they leave us off

Speaker 2:          02:00:39       is because they can't handle the fact that you have like a Bernie supporter who's never voted Republican in the supposedly reaction. I mean, they're going after Tim pool like children and they're trying to find something that sticks all right? Doesn't seem to work extreme, right? Reactionary this, that, and yet, um, let them empty their revolver because they don't really have many bullets left. Um, yes, they don't, they know that they're lying, but they think they're lying in the service of good. And I might lie in the service of good if the good were extreme enough and the lie, we're small enough so don't get upset with somebody just because they're lying in the service of put. Of course, they know they're lying. And of course, uh, they think they're doing it in the service of good. But the point is, we're going to have to live with each other as a nation and

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       we're going to have to love each other. And there are a lot of people with this mimetic complex in their mind. This is why I went and I talked to Kanye. I thought what Kanye was going to do was d trumpified Manga with people who wanted their towns in Ohio and western Pennsylvania to start working again. People who, uh, you know, we're drinking themselves silly feeling that they were part of the American dream and got sidelined. We are going to have to find common cause and it's just not that hard, you know, it's just not that hard to have a friend who's Hugh is different than yours is not that hard to have a friend. You and I have serious political differences at this point. It just doesn't cause me to want to silence you. And so my claim is, is that even though they're lying and even though they know they're lie, you've got to experiment with love and forgiveness to the best of your ability.

Speaker 3:          02:02:38       And I can't tell you that I never lash out. I think I lashed out a little bit at Rebecca Lewis because she was lying. She said it will never not be funny that the entire intellectual dark web is only located on Youtube. Oh really? So the 12 rules of life isn't a book that exists. And the waking up podcast isn't something that has no video, even if it's exists on youtube. People listened to it off of Youtube is it's not true that we don't have any events. Of course, Rebecca Lewis is like, she knows, she's like Dana and society is lie. These people all know that they're lying, but they think that they're lying for some beautiful reason to keep our country together, to make sure that we're not in the hands of a tyrant, to make sure that every child has a shot at a beautiful tomorrow.

Speaker 3:          02:03:25       And I'm sorry that they're this confused, but have some compassion because they don't have the compassion. When we hear about empathy, okay, the onus is on us. They don't have this great empathy. They like I Aye so care about Trans people that I can't care about white people. Okay, that gives me a headache. You're either empathic and you care about people in general or it's selective empathy and you really have a lot of hate in your soul. So I set it Goddamn example that that's my basic take, which is you've got to love the people who are lying, thinking that they're advancing the world's cause, and you have to love them out of their cult. And if we're not willing to take that on, then I don't know what we're doing. But I can't always make this, this high bar that I'm setting for myself. I will fail. I would lash out at somebody, but have a forgiveness narrative. There is in general, no redemptive redemption narrative on the left. That's why it's not even a religion. People say it's a cult. It's religion without a redemption narrative. There's nothing. If what you're really excited about is sticking it to the man, whoever the man is, you're not fundamentally a good person. You're a person who's working through your own personal. And

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       so my claim is, is that love the people who are aligning against you and figure out what an incredible power, incredibly powerful weapon that is. Because at the end of the day, after you knock them senseless to the pavement, you better offer them a hand up and say, look, it wasn't personal. It's just you were, you were threatening our system and you know, I felt like I couldn't communicate to you while you were still in the cult. That's where I am.

Speaker 1:          02:05:06       I'm joining you on that adventure, my friend the Ohio. There you go. All right guys. That's it. Remember October, fifth wise guys in Salt Lake City. We've got your links. You do have a, uh, a custom name, by the way, for your youtube channel. I'm going to, it's gone. It was here before.

Speaker 2:          02:05:24       It's up. It's up top guy.

Speaker 1:          02:05:26       It's Eric r Weinstein on Instagram. And if you just search Eric Weinstein on Youtube, it's on there. Dave rubin.com/events for a bunch of more standup stuff that I'm doing and we're going to Europe with Peterson and a whole bunch of other stuff. And, uh, patrion.com/ruben report, we're trying to get our Reuben select members to 5,000 people. We've got a great community growing over there. Uh, you want to get dinners on something?

Speaker 2:          02:05:47       Sounds like a plan. All right. That's it. See Ya.
