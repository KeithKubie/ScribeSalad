cognitive science from developmental
 

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.940
cognitive science from developmental
psychology etc and look at where there

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:03.950
psychology etc and look at where there
 

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.130
psychology etc and look at where there
were longitudinal studies what had

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.140
were longitudinal studies what had
 

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.280
were longitudinal studies what had
happened in that child's life to help

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:09.290
happened in that child's life to help
 

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.020
happened in that child's life to help
that child thrive now and in the future

and that's how the seven skills actually

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:13.510
and that's how the seven skills actually
 

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.120
and that's how the seven skills actually
emerged in a sense the seventh skill is

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.130
emerged in a sense the seventh skill is
 

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.260
emerged in a sense the seventh skill is
kind of cumulative which is

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:17.270
kind of cumulative which is
 

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.330
kind of cumulative which is
self-directed engaged learning it kind

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:19.340
self-directed engaged learning it kind
 

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.580
self-directed engaged learning it kind
of pulls them all together and focus the

self-control the first skill is is a
 

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.770
self-control the first skill is is a
baseline in a sense because if you can't

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:26.780
baseline in a sense because if you can't
 

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.720
baseline in a sense because if you can't
pay attention you can't really learn the

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:28.730
pay attention you can't really learn the
 

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.310
pay attention you can't really learn the
other skills if you don't have the

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320
other skills if you don't have the
 

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.230
other skills if you don't have the
self-control to not go on automatic then

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240
self-control to not go on automatic then
 

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.270
self-control to not go on automatic then
you can't really learn to listen to what

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:34.280
you can't really learn to listen to what

they're hidden in plain sight but
 

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.220
they're hidden in plain sight but
they're so simple to do something about

workshop is that the seven essential
life skills basically you know which are

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.070
life skills basically you know which are
 

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.210
life skills basically you know which are
the skills that we need

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220
the skills that we need
 

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.670
the skills that we need
be fully functional successful human

be fully functional successful human
 

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.240
be fully functional successful human
beings basically come down to learning

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:26.250
beings basically come down to learning
 

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.610
beings basically come down to learning
as a life like a lifelong orientation

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620
as a life like a lifelong orientation
 

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.190
as a life like a lifelong orientation
toward learning they enable us to learn

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200
toward learning they enable us to learn
 

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.440
toward learning they enable us to learn
they they you know they make us

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:33.450
they they you know they make us
 

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.720
they they you know they make us
effective learners and and it sort of

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:35.730
effective learners and and it sort of
 

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.330
effective learners and and it sort of
represents human beings as learning

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:38.340
represents human beings as learning
 

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.490
represents human beings as learning

something that I mean on there are you

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100
something that I mean on there are you
 

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.740
something that I mean on there are you
know two things one is we tend to think

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:45.750
know two things one is we tend to think
 

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.780
know two things one is we tend to think
of learning as something that stops when

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:47.790
of learning as something that stops when
 

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.360
of learning as something that stops when
you graduate from graduate school I mean

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:50.370
you graduate from graduate school I mean
 

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.850
you graduate from graduate school I mean
not not you know in some ways no but in

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860
not not you know in some ways no but in
 

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.980
not not you know in some ways no but in
some ways yes like I'm done my learning

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:54.990
some ways yes like I'm done my learning
 

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.010
some ways yes like I'm done my learning
and now I'm doing my life you know and

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:58.020
and now I'm doing my life you know and
 

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.340
and now I'm doing my life you know and
and and and so the idea of that that

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:01.350
and and and so the idea of that that
 

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.540
and and and so the idea of that that
you're learning throughout your life is

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:02.550
you're learning throughout your life is
 

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.650
you're learning throughout your life is
not something that people necessarily

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660
not something that people necessarily
 

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.430
not something that people necessarily
actively engage in you know past school

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440
actively engage in you know past school
 

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.160
actively engage in you know past school
and then you know secondly we always

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:10.170
and then you know secondly we always
 

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.960
and then you know secondly we always
have this back-and-forth where on the

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:11.970
have this back-and-forth where on the
 

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.400
have this back-and-forth where on the
one hand we understand that it's good

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:13.410
one hand we understand that it's good
 

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.990
one hand we understand that it's good
for children to be curious and that we

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000
for children to be curious and that we
 

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.240
for children to be curious and that we
want them to be active learners you know

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.250
want them to be active learners you know
 

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.160
want them to be active learners you know
in education and design and curriculum

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.170
in education and design and curriculum
 

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.250
in education and design and curriculum
and so forth and on the other hand we

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260
and so forth and on the other hand we
 

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.860
and so forth and on the other hand we
have these exigencies of skills and so

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:24.870
have these exigencies of skills and so
 

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.300
have these exigencies of skills and so
forth that we feel we have to teach

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:26.310
forth that we feel we have to teach
 

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.340
forth that we feel we have to teach
children concrete things so that they

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:28.350
children concrete things so that they
 

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.170
children concrete things so that they
can remain competitive and so forth and

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.180
can remain competitive and so forth and
 

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:30.650
can remain competitive and so forth and
so on

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660
so on
 

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.860
so on
that often you know create curriculums

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:33.870
that often you know create curriculums
 

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.540
that often you know create curriculums
and school systems that do the exact

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:35.550
and school systems that do the exact
 

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.490
and school systems that do the exact
opposite that as you say put out the

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500
opposite that as you say put out the
 

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.560
opposite that as you say put out the
fire and yeah so I mean you know I

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:42.570
fire and yeah so I mean you know I
 

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.390
fire and yeah so I mean you know I
wonder kind of what it would take for

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:44.400
wonder kind of what it would take for
 

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.450
wonder kind of what it would take for
the orientation of whole educational

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:47.460
the orientation of whole educational
 

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.270
the orientation of whole educational

systems to shift in in such a way that
 

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.310
systems to shift in in such a way that
we are focusing on these kind of meta

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320
we are focusing on these kind of meta
 

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.860
we are focusing on these kind of meta
skills that make for better learners you

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:54.870
skills that make for better learners you
 

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.840
skills that make for better learners you
know not only in sort of progressive

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:56.850
know not only in sort of progressive
 

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.560
know not only in sort of progressive
schools but also you know everywhere

00:14:59.560 --> 00:14:59.570
schools but also you know everywhere
 

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.260
schools but also you know everywhere
more than we are on concrete right no

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:03.270
more than we are on concrete right no
 

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.210
more than we are on concrete right no
that is such a great question I just

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:05.220
that is such a great question I just
 

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.300
that is such a great question I just
love that so much because and all of

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:08.310
love that so much because and all of
 

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.350
love that so much because and all of
these are great questions

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360
these are great questions
 

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.390
these are great questions
and the reason that I love it so much is

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:11.400
and the reason that I love it so much is
 

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.200
and the reason that I love it so much is
that it's it's like the notion of

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:14.210
that it's it's like the notion of
 

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.580
that it's it's like the notion of
competitiveness me against you always

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:16.590
competitiveness me against you always

I feel that the world is so a washed
with information that is very hard to

with information that is very hard to
 

00:19:29.429 --> 00:19:31.430
with information that is very hard to
know what's what's real I mean you can

know what's what's real I mean you can
 

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.139

watch the same news story on two

watch the same news story on two
 

00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:35.930
watch the same news story on two
different channels and to get to totally

the same event
presumably and you get two totally

we see this experience that where we

we see this experience that where we
don't have direct knowledge of it I mean

00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299
don't have direct knowledge of it I mean
 

00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:12.200
don't have direct knowledge of it I mean
we can't you know maybe in in a very

we can't you know maybe in in a very

pre-industrial agricultural world we

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:14.850
pre-industrial agricultural world we
 

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.879
pre-industrial agricultural world we
could have direct experience with

00:20:16.879 --> 00:20:16.889
could have direct experience with
 

00:20:16.889 --> 00:20:18.529
could have direct experience with
everything that we needed to know about

00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539
everything that we needed to know about
 

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:20.450
everything that we needed to know about
we can't do that anymore we have we have

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460
we can't do that anymore we have we have
 

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.460
we can't do that anymore we have we have
to outsource our knowledge so I think

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:22.470
to outsource our knowledge so I think
 

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.669
to outsource our knowledge so I think
that by and large critical thinking is

00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679
that by and large critical thinking is
 

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:28.039
that by and large critical thinking is
an important skill because it's the

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:28.049
an important skill because it's the
 

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:30.529
an important skill because it's the

ongoing surgeons that word ongoings is
 

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:33.230
ongoing surgeons that word ongoings is
critical here the ongoing search for

critical here the ongoing search for
 

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.499
critical here the ongoing search for
ballot and reliable information so you

00:20:36.499 --> 00:20:36.509
ballot and reliable information so you
 

00:20:36.509 --> 00:20:40.789
ballot and reliable information so you
have to understand when information is

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799
have to understand when information is
 

00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:43.850
have to understand when information is
not accurate when it's what researchers

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:43.860
not accurate when it's what researchers
 

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.070
not accurate when it's what researchers
would call confounded because you can't

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080
would call confounded because you can't
 

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.909
would call confounded because you can't
say that a always leads to B you you

00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919
say that a always leads to B you you
 

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:51.710
say that a always leads to B you you
know it's just it's more complicated

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720
know it's just it's more complicated
 

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.950
know it's just it's more complicated
than that and other things get in there

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960
than that and other things get in there
 

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.029

and so I think teaching children not

and so I think teaching children not
 

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:02.240

just let's say science but how

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:02.250
just let's say science but how
 

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.840
just let's say science but how
scientific thinking takes place has been

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:05.850
scientific thinking takes place has been
 

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.740

found to improve them in all sorts of

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:09.750
found to improve them in all sorts of
 

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.360
found to improve them in all sorts of
other areas I'm thinking of the research

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:11.370
other areas I'm thinking of the research
 

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.269
other areas I'm thinking of the research
that's going on at Carnegie Mellon my

00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:14.279
that's going on at Carnegie Mellon my
 

00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:16.999
that's going on at Carnegie Mellon my
David Clark for example he found that

00:21:16.999 --> 00:21:17.009
David Clark for example he found that
 

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:19.700
David Clark for example he found that
kids in the seventh grade eighth grade

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:19.710
kids in the seventh grade eighth grade
 

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.039
kids in the seventh grade eighth grade
etc were never thought how to conduct a

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:22.049
etc were never thought how to conduct a
 

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:24.049
etc were never thought how to conduct a
good experiment they were always told

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059
good experiment they were always told
 

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:25.669
good experiment they were always told
here's the experiment and here's what it

00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679
here's the experiment and here's what it
 

00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:27.769
here's the experiment and here's what it
learned but not how do you know whether

00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:27.779
learned but not how do you know whether
 

00:21:27.779 --> 00:21:29.330
learned but not how do you know whether
it's a really good experiment and when

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340
it's a really good experiment and when
 

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.149
it's a really good experiment and when
he actually taught kids how what a good

00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159
he actually taught kids how what a good
 

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:33.769
he actually taught kids how what a good
experiment was and how would how would

00:21:33.769 --> 00:21:33.779
experiment was and how would how would
 

00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:36.289
experiment was and how would how would
you know what you've learned from this

00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299
you know what you've learned from this
 

00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:38.740
you know what you've learned from this
experiment it made a big difference in

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:38.750
experiment it made a big difference in
 

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:42.889
experiment it made a big difference in
in the kids lives and performance so I

00:21:42.889 --> 00:21:42.899
in the kids lives and performance so I
 

00:21:42.899 --> 00:21:45.139
in the kids lives and performance so I
think by enlarge it's mostly a positive

00:21:45.139 --> 00:21:45.149
think by enlarge it's mostly a positive
 

00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:48.860
think by enlarge it's mostly a positive
result but of course you know we get

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:48.870
result but of course you know we get
 

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.749
result but of course you know we get
lots of knowledge that it's hard to

00:21:50.749 --> 00:21:50.759
lots of knowledge that it's hard to
 

00:21:50.759 --> 00:21:52.490
lots of knowledge that it's hard to
figure out whether it is reliable and

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500
figure out whether it is reliable and
 

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.619
figure out whether it is reliable and
accurate and I guess that's the bad side

00:21:54.619 --> 00:21:54.629
accurate and I guess that's the bad side
 

00:21:54.629 --> 00:21:56.299
accurate and I guess that's the bad side
of it how do we know with you know the

00:21:56.299 --> 00:21:56.309
of it how do we know with you know the
 

00:21:56.309 --> 00:21:58.430
of it how do we know with you know the
thousands of Twitter fees we get every

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440
thousands of Twitter fees we get every
 

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.029
thousands of Twitter fees we get every
day what's real and what's not real

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039
day what's real and what's not real
 

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:03.110
day what's real and what's not real
definitely and I think that's what kind

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120
definitely and I think that's what kind
 

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.230
definitely and I think that's what kind

use like databases through school and
 

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.259
use like databases through school and
like go after research-based articles

00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:12.269
like go after research-based articles
 

00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:14.360
like go after research-based articles
and there's a bunch information

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:14.370
and there's a bunch information
 

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:15.500
and there's a bunch information
you know bunch of different articles

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:15.510
you know bunch of different articles
 

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.910

once your friend place it in to draw
 

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.010
once your friend place it in to draw
this information from and I'm not saying

this information from and I'm not saying
 

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.460
this information from and I'm not saying
it was a bad way to do it but I like how

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:22.470
it was a bad way to do it but I like how
 

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.170
it was a bad way to do it but I like how
big thing takes it and do a different

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:24.180
big thing takes it and do a different
 

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.910
big thing takes it and do a different
perspective and like kind of breaks it

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:25.920
perspective and like kind of breaks it
 

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.860
perspective and like kind of breaks it
down for you and helps you understand it

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:27.870
down for you and helps you understand it
 

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.540
down for you and helps you understand it
in in terms of your own life and what

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:29.550
in in terms of your own life and what
 

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.910
in in terms of your own life and what
you're doing so thank you for that well

euphoric email us back to him when we
 

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.440
euphoric email us back to him when we
started this conversation I think that

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:45.450
started this conversation I think that
 

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.400
started this conversation I think that
it brings people together in in a way

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:49.410
it brings people together in in a way
 

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.770
it brings people together in in a way
that we can now with technology I mean

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780
that we can now with technology I mean
 

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.010
that we can now with technology I mean
we can have this conversation and you

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020
we can have this conversation and you
 

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.630
we can have this conversation and you
know you can push back at me and I love

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640
know you can push back at me and I love
 

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.669
know you can push back at me and I love
that and I can hopefully push back at

that and I can hopefully push back at

you and I love that too we can have we
 

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.540
you and I love that too we can have we
can do the big thinking that we need to

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:02.550
can do the big thinking that we need to
 

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.470
can do the big thinking that we need to
do to be able to live our lives in the

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480
