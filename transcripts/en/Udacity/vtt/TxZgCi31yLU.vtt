00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.819
The answer's $107.80.

00:00:01.822 --> 00:00:07.350
So if you got it right, well done. Let's see how we got 107.80. I have a

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:13.395
computer monitor, and the original price was $154. And, since the computer

00:00:13.407 --> 00:00:19.630
monitor is on sale, we know that we have to subtract the 30% from 100%, since it

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:27.100
is decreasing the price, since it's on sale. So we have 154 times 100% minus

00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:32.833
30%. Well 100 minus 30 gives us 70%. Once again, whenever we use a percent in a

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:39.806
problem, we have to convert it to a decimal. So, 70 percent is written as .7 as

00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:47.602
a decimal. We need to move the decimal place two places to the left. So, we have

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.169
154 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Times .7.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.003
When you multiply 154 times .7, we get 107.8. Now, this answer doesn't exactly

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:58.780
like what we put in the box, because we're talking in dollars and cents. 107.8

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:03.210
in dollars is one hundred and seven dollars and eighty cents. Once again,

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:07.851
remember to put the dollar sign, because it's a word problem and we need to

00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:09.014
include the units.
