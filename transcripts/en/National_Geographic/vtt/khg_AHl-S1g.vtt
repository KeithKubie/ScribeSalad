00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.800
[music playing]

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.300
Cameras aren't working, and
it's getting super frustrating.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.433
This is what it's like
on "Life Below Zero."

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:10.500
Camera's already down.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.066
Tough conditions all
around to film in.

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.300
CROFTON DIACK: No heat,
no power, no anything.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.033
Argh!

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:19.133
Won't even turn on.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:22.934
CROFTON DIACK: I've
fallen too many times.

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:24.166
We have bad winds.

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:28.000
It's just a typical
day in the arctic.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.367
MAN: Making best
with what we got.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.133
[music playing]

00:00:43.867 --> 00:00:46.467
I built this
time lapse lockbox.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.400
And what we're going
to do with this one

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.633
is try and catch the freeze-up.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.266
Hey, how come I get
the heavy [bleep]??

00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:57.200
SIMEON HOUTMAN: I love
doing stuff like this,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.734
getting out there trying to get
like different shots and shots

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.033
that maybe we haven't seen
before, like a lake freezing

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:03.834
up.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.700
[music playing]

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.500
MAN: Oh boy.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.333
Let's see.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.700
We might be able to pull right--

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.333
SIMEON HOUTMAN: So we want to
get some elevation, and then

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.967
a nice clear, unobscured view.

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:22.367
MAN: I think these kind
of specialty type shots

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:25.100
are some of the most
fun part of this whole

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.867
being involved in this program.

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:29.500
I just really get a kick
out of trying to experiment

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.433
and do new things.

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:33.367
And so this is a
big part of that.

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:35.834
Are you still pretty
good for level?

00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:37.600
SIMEON HOUTMAN: This
is completely enclosed,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.000
and this is waterproof too.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.300
So in theory, it should be good
to go and be able to withstand

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.066
all conditions.

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:50.166
We've got a solar panel hooked
up to a battery that ideally is

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.367
going to keep
charging this camera,

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:57.467
and it can run for
as long as it can.

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:58.266
She's set.

00:01:58.266 --> 00:01:59.500
She's going.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.000
Now we just got to wait and see.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.867
[music playing]

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.133
[helicopter blades whirring]

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.433
Could you drop me off
and I can jump out?

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:40.133
The problem is the ridge
is only like a knife edge.

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:42.000
I don't know how
adventurous you are.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.266
CROFTON DIACK: What
we're trying to do

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:45.500
is set up a really
long time lapse

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.500
so that we have the
Yukon breaking up.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.133
So we're just looking
for that bluff visual

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:53.600
that looks out over the river.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.867
If you take a second look
at it and it doesn't look

00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:56.934
right, then let's not do it.

00:02:56.934 --> 00:02:58.400
Yeah, I don't want
anybody to fall there.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.900
I mean, you could fall off.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.867
Bye, guys.

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:03.567
Be safe on that
little knife ridge.

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:06.433
[music playing]

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.800
The safety guy and the director
of photography just left.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.500
They're up there
right now getting

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.266
dropped off at basically
a knife's edge of a peak.

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:26.166
And I am really excited,
a little bit nervous.

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:28.867
[music playing]

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:44.967
It's going to take a
couple of car batteries

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:47.600
to run the camera out
so that it doesn't quit

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.433
on us because we only have
one opportunity to get

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:51.767
this time lapse.

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:53.834
And we think it's going to
happen in this two-week window

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:59.000
when the ice of the frozen
Yukon river breaks up.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.300
Is my job this cool?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.133
Yeah, it is.
