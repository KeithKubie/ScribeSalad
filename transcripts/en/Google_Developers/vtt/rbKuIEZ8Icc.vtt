NAZMUL IDRIS: Welcome
to this episode of UXD,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.086
where we will talk about Lean
UX, measurement and metrics,

00:00:05.086 --> 00:00:07.654
and why they're useful to
making better products.

00:00:07.654 --> 00:00:09.320
I'm your host, Nazmul
Idris, a developer

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.330
and advocate passionate
about design and mobile.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.820
And Laura is back
on the show today.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.840
Welcome, Laura.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.106
LAURA: Thanks for having me.

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:18.730
NAZMUL IDRIS: Lean
UX is a way to apply

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.772
the methods of learning
as quickly as possible

00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:22.480
and reducing the cycle
time, through what

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.450
is called the build, measure,
and learn loop, to UX design.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.500
Practicing Lean UX
means that you're always

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.750
validating with users, that
you're designing something

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.040
that people will actually use.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.456
It's about designing
products that

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:34.125
are both usable and useful.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.150
Laura wrote a great
book about this

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.020
called "UX for Lean Startups."

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.820
Now measurement is a
big thing in Lean UX.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.790
And last time you
were on the show,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.680
we talked about different
ways of measuring things

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.190
using both qualitative
and quantitative research.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.490
And you explained that
quantitative research

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.220
helps you understand what is
going on with your product.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.370
And qualitative
research helps you

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.070
understand why it's happening.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.820
So I have a question.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.300
What does quantitative
research actually mean?

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.071
And what are the right
ways of conducting it?

00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:05.570
LAURA: So the best
way to learn what

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.450
you need to know about all
this stuff is, actually,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.991
to read a book called
Lean Analytics.

00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:11.480
It's by Ben Yoskovitz
and Alistair Croll.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.606
So they cover all of this
in a lot of great detail.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.230
But I'm going to do
my best to give you

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.980
a quick overview of
the topic, so that we

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.520
can talk about how you can use
analytics to build a better

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.155
product.

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:22.280
NAZMUL IDRIS: That sounds
great, let's start there.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.064
So what are metrics
and analytics exactly?

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:26.480
LAURA: At the very
simplest level,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.390
metrics are the data
about our product--

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.450
how many users we have,
how much money we make,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.616
what our conversion rate is.

00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:33.120
And when we talk
about analytics,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.536
we're talking about the process
of gathering those numbers

00:01:35.536 --> 00:01:37.160
and making some
sense out of them.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.993
NAZMUL IDRIS: I see.

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:40.070
So metrics are the
raw data that you

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.990
collect to measure key things.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.580
And analytics are then used
to extract information or make

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.672
sense of this data.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.380
Sounds like metrics
are really important.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.338
LAURA: Oh, my God, yes.

00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:49.870
So without looking
at key metrics,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.510
we're just flying blind.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.530
Metrics help us make
better product decisions

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.240
and understand whether
the decisions we're making

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.104
are good or bad.

00:01:57.104 --> 00:01:59.270
They help us to make sure
that our brilliant product

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.516
vision isn't merely delusion.

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:01.890
NAZMUL IDRIS: That
never happens.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.263
LAURA: No.

00:02:02.263 --> 00:02:03.054
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:05.260
So now can you illustrate
why metrics and analytics

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.120
are important, with an example?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.389
LAURA: I can.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.760
So let's say you make a fairly
major change to your product,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.090
like you redesign a product
page where you're actually

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.180
selling things.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.770
How do you know if
it was a good idea?

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.170
NAZMUL IDRIS: Well wouldn't
it just look prettier.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.610
And isn't that a better thing?

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.560
A good thing, I mean.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.351
LAURA: It might be.

00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:24.610
But what if it didn't
convert better.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.980
I mean, what if, you
know, like fewer people

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.432
bought the product
after the big redesign.

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:30.640
NAZMUL IDRIS: Ah, that's bad.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.850
LAURA: Yeah, it would be bad.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.276
And it happens.

00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:34.900
It would be even
worse if that happened

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.720
and you didn't know about it.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.240
NAZMUL IDRIS: Oh, OK, I'm sold.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.060
So metrics are important.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.341
Now what makes a good metric.

00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:42.840
LAURA: That's an
excellent question.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.270
And again, it's
one that's answered

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.860
in a lot more depth
in Lean Analytics.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.350
But let me recap here.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.910
A good metric has to be
comparative, actionable,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.685
understandable, and measurable.

00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:53.560
NAZMUL IDRIS: Got it.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.020
So what does that mean exactly?

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.890
LAURA: Sure.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.590
So let's look at what it means
for a metric to be comparative.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.210
OK, I'm going to tell
you that my conversion

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.190
rate for my product is 2%.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.832
How do you feel about that?

00:03:05.832 --> 00:03:07.040
NAZMUL IDRIS: I have no idea.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.905
Is that a good or a bad thing?

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:09.530
LAURA: Exactly.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.200
So that's the
important question.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.450
Now what if I told you that
the conversion rate was

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.030
up 20% from the
same time last year,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.200
or it was 10% higher
than a competitor

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.440
with a similar product?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.981
NAZMUL IDRIS: Ah,
that's a good thing

00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:23.150
since those metrics
actually made sense to me.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.902
LAURA: Right, 2% is
just a number, right?

00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:27.110
Two percent conversion--
might be good, might be bad.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.610
It's impossible to
know in a vacuum.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.360
But if you compare that metric
to the standard converge rate

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.780
on a similar product, or to
a historical conversion rate,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.470
suddenly we can see that this
particular metric is better

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.230
than other similar products,
or this particular metric

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.490
is improving.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.085
Obviously, it also works if
the number is going down.

00:03:44.085 --> 00:03:46.710
NAZMUL IDRIS: Right, so that is
so much better than just saying

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.880
a 2% conversion rate,
which means nothing.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.440
So you mentioned something
about actionable.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.369
What is that?

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.160
LAURA: So metrics do
have to be actionable.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.660
So let's take that same number,
right, a 2% conversion rate,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.920
and let's imagine that it's
gone down in recent weeks.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.954
That's actionable.

00:04:01.954 --> 00:04:03.870
Specifically, the action
that we want to take,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.960
is we want to understand
why it's gone down

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.790
and take some steps,
maybe, to fix it.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.170
So based on the knowledge
that your conversion rate has

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.444
declined, you can take
that action to correct it.

00:04:14.444 --> 00:04:15.860
NAZMUL IDRIS: Got
it, I like that.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.000
So actionable metrics can
affect people's behaviors.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.672
And now what else
makes a good metric?

00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:23.630
LAURA: OK, it's going to
seem a little obvious,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.190
but I like to just state it.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.790
Metrics have to be
understandable and measurable.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.140
So if your team
doesn't get a metric,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.720
if they don't know
what it means,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.510
they can't make
decisions based on it.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.965
And if they can't measure it,
they can't do anything with it.

00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:38.340
For example, I
worked with a team

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.381
that wanted to know what
effect their product had

00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:41.790
on call times for call centers.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.371
The problem was
they weren't allowed

00:04:43.371 --> 00:04:45.620
to measure the amount of
time that the representatives

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.744
actually were on the phone.

00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:48.810
So the metric was
inherently unmeasurable.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.670
I mean, it would have been great
to know whether call times went

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.790
up or down with each new release
of the call center product,

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.570
but the information
just wasn't available.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.280
So they couldn't use it or
make decisions based on it.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.225
NAZMUL IDRIS: Wow,
that really sucks

00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:00.230
that they're weren't
able to measure

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.650
such an important thing.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.790
So we've talked quite a
bit about good metrics.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.879
What would make a bad metric?

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.670
LAURA: I'm going to
give you a little quiz.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.253
Let's say you create a comments
section for your product page,

00:05:11.253 --> 00:05:13.380
and you want to
collect some metrics.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.630
What are you going to collect?

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.550
What kind of metrics
do you think?

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.930
NAZMUL IDRIS: The number
of comments and the number

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.270
of people that left comments.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.610
Those might be good.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.610
LAURA: OK, well they're
certainly understandable

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.330
and, I mean, should
be measurable, right?

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.820
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.819
LAURA: Is it actionable?

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.226
I mean, would you
do if I told you

00:05:28.226 --> 00:05:30.600
that the number of people
leaving comments on the product

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.402
page, on the first
day, was a thousand.

00:05:32.402 --> 00:05:33.610
NAZMUL IDRIS: I have no idea.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.930
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.526
Is that too few or
too many comments?

00:05:36.526 --> 00:05:37.400
LAURA: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.380
So that's the problem with
metrics like that, right?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.730
They're easy to collect, but
in general, they don't really

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.870
help you make any decisions.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.170
I mean, a better metric would be
to track the number of products

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.128
you're selling on the
pages that show comments,

00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:49.110
because you care how
much product you sell.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.270
NAZMUL IDRIS: Right.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.030
LAURA: You don't
necessarily care

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.940
about the number of comments.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.180
NAZMUL IDRIS: True.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.767
LAURA: I mean, if lots of
comments make people buy more,

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:56.100
you might want to make an
effort to drive more comments.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.820
And if comments make
people buy less,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.410
you might want to
get rid of them.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.950
See?

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:00.910
Actionable.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.920
NAZMUL IDRIS: Oh.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.830
LAURA: An even better
number to track

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.246
is the number of
sales of products

00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:07.460
over time on pages
that have comments.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.590
Do they go up or down based
on people leaving comments?

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.529
See comparable metrics help
you make better decisions.

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.320
NAZMUL IDRIS: Now that
makes perfect sense.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.850
So now I've also heard of
the term "vanity metric."

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.440
It seems that the number of
comments is a vanity metric.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.490
Is that correct?

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.590
LAURA: Yeah, it is.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.340
That's a great example
of a vanity metric.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.750
And for those who don't
know, vanity metric

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.430
is a term coined by Eric Ries
to describe the numbers that

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.292
make us feel good, or sometimes
bad, about our product,

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:34.250
without actually helping
us make any decisions.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.990
For example, the
graph of the number

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.970
of registered users
of your product

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.465
always goes up and to the
right-- vanity metric.

00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:44.390
It doesn't help you do anything,
except possibly to raise

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.710
some money from people who
don't understand graphs.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.940
So the percent of active
users, on the other hand,

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.832
that starts to be a
useful metric, right?

00:06:51.832 --> 00:06:53.540
It tells you how many
people are actually

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.490
getting value from your product
and continuing to come back.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.620
The percent of active
users over time

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.870
is even better than that,
because it tells you

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.510
whether your product is
getting better or worse.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.465
And again, that helps
you make good decisions.

00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:07.340
NAZMUL IDRIS: Got it.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.500
So how about the number
of application downloads.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.510
I know that a lot of
people track those,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.320
and they seem to me like
they're a vanity metric.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.200
They're not really
measuring the engagement

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.033
that users have with
the application itself,

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:19.817
is that correct?

00:07:19.817 --> 00:07:21.150
LAURA: Yeah, they generally are.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.820
I mean, unless you're
charging for your app.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.640
What does it tell you
that a lot of people

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.252
are downloading your app?

00:07:26.252 --> 00:07:27.710
You don't know if
they're using it.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.450
You don't know if you're
monetizing them, again,

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.962
unless you're
charging for the app.

00:07:30.962 --> 00:07:32.420
It doesn't really
tell you anything

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.900
at all about the user
experience of your product.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.714
NAZMUL IDRIS:
Exactly, so it seems

00:07:36.714 --> 00:07:38.380
that this is a trap
that a lot of people

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.780
fall into because it's so easy
to track these vanity metrics.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.210
So what metrics should
people actually be tracking?

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.980
LAURA: Another
excellent question.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.175
And unfortunately, the answer,
as usual, is that it depends.

00:07:50.175 --> 00:07:52.050
But one thing is certain,
you should probably

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.150
be tracking fewer
metrics than you think.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.670
NAZMUL IDRIS: Wait, what?

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.169
I thought metrics
were a good thing.

00:07:56.169 --> 00:07:57.270
LAURA: I know, they are.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.940
But only if you're
tracking the right ones.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.315
So for example,
you should always

00:08:00.315 --> 00:08:02.089
be tracking all of your KPIs.

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:03.880
NAZMUL IDRIS: So I've
heard of KPIs before,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.290
but what do they mean exactly?

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.572
LAURA: Yes, so KPIs are
key performance indicators.

00:08:07.572 --> 00:08:09.030
These are the
metrics that actually

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.985
tell you how your
product is doing,

00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:13.815
and again, help you
make better decisions.

00:08:13.815 --> 00:08:15.690
But one of the really
big problems that I see

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.020
is that, instead of
just tracking the KPIs,

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.150
just people track
all the things.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.466
NAZMUL IDRIS: I was
actually just thinking that,

00:08:23.466 --> 00:08:25.590
that if you collect more
metrics rather than fewer,

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.770
that would probably
be a good thing.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.904
So what's wrong with
collecting too many metrics?

00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:30.820
LAURA: So having too
many metrics is almost as

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.080
bad as not having any, right?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.400
It's very easy to
start to drown.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.640
Remember the goal of metrics--
good product decisions.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.450
So when you have
too much data, you

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.270
can end up getting so distracted
that you can't actually

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.440
make any decisions.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.280
It's why Lean Analytics
has a concept called

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.780
"the one metric that matters."

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.110
You'll do much better if you
focus on a single, critical KPI

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.750
that you want to move rather
than trying to track everything

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.527
all the time.

00:08:53.527 --> 00:08:54.360
NAZMUL IDRIS: I see.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.734
So that's actually the case
with so many things in life--

00:08:56.734 --> 00:08:59.720
too much or too little of
anything can usually bad.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.280
And always, less is more.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.780
LAURA: Yeah.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.571
NAZMUL IDRIS: Cool.

00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:04.950
So how do I track
the metrics that

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.620
just matter-- that
really matter, I mean.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.520
LAURA: Yet another
excellent question,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.700
and why don't I answer
it in our next episode.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.020
We can talk all about A/B
testing, cohort analysis,

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.395
and maybe even some funnels.

00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:17.061
NAZMUL IDRIS: Cool,
that sounds awesome.

00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:18.419
I can't wait.

00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:19.960
So that's all the
time we have today.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.835
If you'd like to learn
more about qualitative

00:09:21.835 --> 00:09:23.300
and quantitative
research methods,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.400
check out Laura's book,
"UX for Lean Startups."

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.320
It has a lot of tips
and tactics for doing

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.420
the right kind of research
at the right time.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.907
Laura, thanks again
for joining us.

00:09:30.907 --> 00:09:31.990
LAURA: It was my pleasure.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.865
Thanks for having me.

00:09:32.865 --> 00:09:34.010
Go build something awesome.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:34.820
NAZMUL IDRIS: Cool.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.406
