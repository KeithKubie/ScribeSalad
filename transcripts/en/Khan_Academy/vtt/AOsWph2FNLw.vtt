00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.000
In the last video,
we figured out

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.590
the probability of getting
exactly three heads when

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.319
we have five flips
of a fair coin.

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.360
What I want to do in this
video is think about it

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.131
in a slightly more general way.

00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:14.130
We're still going to
assume we have a fair coin,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.270
although we'll
shortly see we don't

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.780
have to make that assumption.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.320
But what I want to
do is figure out

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.320
the probability
of getting k heads

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.560
in n flips of the fair coin.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:36.530
So the first thing
to think about

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.580
is just how many
possibilities there

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.640
are where there's
going to be n flips.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.330
So literally, the first flip,
second flip, third flip,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.670
all the way to the n-th flip.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.820
And this is a fair coin.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.930
Each of these, there's two
equally likely possibilities.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.430
So the total number
of possibilities

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.900
is going to be 2 times
2 times 2, n times.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.663
So this is going to be equal
to 2 to the n-th possibilities.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.580
Now, let's think about how
many of those equally likely--

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.538
and these are all equally
likely possibilities.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.490
This is a fair coin.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.948
Let's think about
how many of those

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:21.220
equally likely possibilities
involve k heads.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.950
Well, just like we
did for the case

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.490
where we're thinking
about three heads,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.250
we say, well, look,
the first of those k

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.220
heads-- how many different
buckets could it fall into?

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.880
Well, the first of
the k heads could

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.810
fall into n different
buckets, right?

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.490
It could be the first
flip, second flip,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.490
all the way to the n-th flip.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.450
Then the second
of those k heads--

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.880
and we don't know
exactly how many

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.820
k is-- will have n
minus 1 possibilities.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.460
And then the third
of those k heads

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.460
will have n minus
2 possibilities,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.040
since two of the spots
are already taken up.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.290
And we would do this
until we have essentially

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.570
accounted for all
of the k heads.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.940
So this will go down all the
way to-- so the number of things

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.470
we're multiplying is going to be
k, one for each of the k heads.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.540
So this is 1, 2,
3, and then you're

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.620
going to go all the way
to n minus k minus 1.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.020
And you could try this
out in the case of 5.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:36.470
When n was 5 and k was 3, this
resulted in 5 times 4 times--

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.170
and actually, we just
have to go times 3.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.280
And actually, that was
this term, right over here.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.080
So I'm doing a case that
is a little bit longer,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.940
where k is a slightly
larger number.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.680
Because this right
over here is 5 minus 2.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.591
That is this one over here.

00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:53.840
Just so not to confuse you,
let me write it like this.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.260
So you'll have n spots
for that first head, n

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.520
minus 1 spots for
that second head.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.130
And then you keep going.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.970
And you're going to have
a total of these k things

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.070
you're multiplying.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.560
And that last one
is going to have

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.659
n minus k minus 1 possibilities.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.700
And now, hopefully, it'll
map a little bit better

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.370
to the one where we had
five flips and three heads.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.850
Because here, there
was five possibilities

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.160
for the first head,
four possibilities

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.450
for the second head.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.260
And then n is 5.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.570
5 minus 2-- you get
three possibilities

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.320
for the last head.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.700
So this actually works.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.120
This is the number of
spots, or the number of ways

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:46.120
that we can put
three heads into five

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.990
different possible buckets.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.590
Now just like the last video, we
don't want to over-count things

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.370
because we don't
care about the order.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.347
We don't want to differentiate
one ordering of heads.

00:03:58.347 --> 00:04:00.680
And I'm just going to use
these letters to differentiate

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.513
the different heads.

00:04:01.513 --> 00:04:05.660
We don't want to
differentiate this from this,

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.510
heads A, heads B. Or any of
the other orderings of this.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.230
So what we need to do is we
need to divide this number

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.880
so that we don't count all
of those different orderings.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.320
We need to divide this
by the different ways

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.040
that you can order k things.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.780
So if you have k things,
so one thing, two things,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.490
all the way to k things, how
many ways can you order it?

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.680
Well, the first thing can
be in k different positions.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.850
Or maybe I'll do it like this.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.390
Maybe I'll do it Thing 1.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.960
I'll call it T for Thing--
Thing 1, Thing 2, Thing 3,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.712
all the way to Thing k.

00:04:48.712 --> 00:04:50.420
How many different
ways can you order it?

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.780
Well, Thing 1 can be in
k different positions.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.260
Then Thing 2 will be
in k minus 1 positions.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.470
And then all the way
down to the last one

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.330
is only going to
have one position.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.000
So this is going to be k
times k minus 1 times k

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.340
minus 2, all the way down to 1.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.410
And in the example where we
had three heads in five flips,

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.140
this was 3 times 2
all the way down to 1.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.770
3 times 2 times 1.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.510
And so is there a simpler
way that we can write this?

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.760
Well, this expression
right over here,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.470
this is the same
thing as k factorial.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.760
And if you haven't ever
heard of what a factorial is,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.090
it's exactly this thing
right over here. k factorial

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.820
literally means k times k
minus 1 times k minus 2,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.510
all the way down to 1.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.690
So for example, 2 factorial
is equal to 2 times 1.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.470
3 factorial is equal
to 3 times 2 times 1.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.029
4 factorial is equal to 4
times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:58.820
And it's actually a
fun thing to play with.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.480
The factorials get large
very, very, very, very, fast.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.430
So anyway, this
denominator right over here

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.960
can be rewritten as k factorial.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.980
This right over here can be
rewritten as k factorial.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.990
And is there any way to
rewrite this numerator

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.830
in terms of factorials?

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.610
So if we were to write
n factorial-- so let

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.240
me see how we can write this.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.280
If we were to
write n factorial--

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.230
get some real estate over
here-- so n factorial

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.850
would be equal to n times
n minus 1 times n minus 2,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.975
all the way down to 1.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.430
That's kind of what we want.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.520
We just want the
first k terms of it.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.363
So what if we divide this
by n minus k factorial.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.440
So let's think about
what that is going to do.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.190
If we have n minus k factorial,
that is the same thing

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.200
as-- we have to do a little
bit of algebraic manipulation

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:12.600
right over here-- that is the
same thing as n minus k times n

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:27.420
minus k minus 1 times n minus k
minus 2, all the way down to 1.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.209
When you divide these, the
1's going to cancel out.

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:31.750
And what you may or
may not realize--

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.860
and you could work out
the math-- is everything

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.900
is going to cancel out here
until you're just left with,

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:45.410
up here, everything from n times
n minus 1 to n minus k minus 1.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.840
Because this, if
you expand this out,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.910
or if you distribute
this negative number,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.060
this is the same thing
as n minus k plus 1.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.980
So n minus k plus 1
is the integer that's

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.339
one larger than this
right over here.

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:00.880
So if you were to
divide it out, this

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.482
would cancel with
something up here.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.190
This would cancel with
something up here.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.890
This would cancel with
something up here.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.431
And what you're
going to be left with

00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:09.380
is exactly this thing over here.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.550
And if you don't believe me,
we can actually try it out.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:19.850
So let's think about
what 5 factorial over 5

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.560
minus 3 factorial
is going to be.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.600
So this is going to be 5
times 4 times 3 times 2 times

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.350
1-- so all of that stuff up
there, all the way down to 1.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:37.059
Over-- 5 minus 3 is 2--
over 2 factorial, 2 times 1.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:38.030
2 cancels with 2.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:38.739
1 cancels with 1.

00:08:38.739 --> 00:08:40.405
You don't even have
to worry about that.

00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:42.590
And you're just left
with 5 times 4 times 3.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:49.250
Exactly what we had up
here, 5 times 4 times 3.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.810
And so in general, if
you wanted to figure out

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.760
the number of ways to stick
two things in five chairs,

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.880
and you don't care
about differentiating

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.160
between those two
things, you're going

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.770
to have this expression
right over here, which

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.440
is the same thing as
this right over here.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.150
So you're going to
have n factorial

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.964
over n minus k factorial.

00:09:16.964 --> 00:09:18.380
And then you're
going to divide it

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.560
by this expression right
over here, which we already

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.010
said is the same
thing as k factorial.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.510
So you're also going to
divide it by k factorial.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.530
And then you have
a generalized way

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.220
of figuring out
the number of ways

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:39.040
you can stick k things
in n different buckets, k

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.050
heads in n different flips.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.945
And so another way
of writing-- and this

00:09:43.945 --> 00:09:45.480
is actually a
generalized formula

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.830
for binomial coefficients.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.050
So another way to write
this is the number of ways,

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:59.530
given that you have n buckets,
you can put k things in them

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.490
without having to
differentiate it.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.630
Or another way to think about
it is if you have n buckets,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.757
or n flips, and you want to
choose k of them to be heads.

00:10:10.757 --> 00:10:12.590
Or you want to choose
k of them in some way,

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.600
but you don't want
to differentiate.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.850
So all of these are generalized
ways for binomial coefficients.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.460
So going back to the
original problem,

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.790
what is the probability
of getting k heads

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.780
in n flips of the fair coin?

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.520
Well, there's 2 to the n
equally likely possibilities.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.240
So let's write this down.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.710
So the probability-- you have
2 to the n equally likely

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.020
possibilities.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.410
And how many of those
possibilities result

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.980
in exactly k heads?

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.740
Well, we just figured that
out during this video.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.810
That's the number
of possibilities.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:52.300
So n factorial over k factorial
times n minus k factorial.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.440
Now, it probably is a OK
idea to memorize this.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.270
But I'll just tell you frankly,
the only reason why I still

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.395
know how to do this 20
years after first seeing it,

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.728
or whenever I first saw it,
is that I actually just like

00:11:03.728 --> 00:11:05.170
to reason through it every time.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.950
I like to just reason through,
OK, I've got five flips.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.514
Three of them need to be heads.

00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:12.930
The first of those heads can
be in five different buckets,

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.080
and the next in four
different buckets,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.850
the next one in three
different buckets.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.500
And then, of
course, I don't want

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:23.250
to differentiate between
all of the different ways

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.640
that I can rearrange
three different things.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.320
So I have to make sure that
I divide it by 3 factorial,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.490
by 3 times 2 times 1.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.010
I want to make sure
that I divide it

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.650
by all of the
different ways that I

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.840
can arrange three
different things.
