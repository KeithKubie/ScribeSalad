00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.840
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.270
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Bangkok, Thailand

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.660
and tonight I am at
Talad Rot Fai Ratchada,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.120
which is the night market.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.970
It's the train market.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.140
This market is known for it's very unique

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.140
Thai street food, as well as
it's gigantic portions of food.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.170
Tonight we're gonna walk around,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.060
we're gonna eat some street food,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.670
but I'm mainly here to eat
a dish called Laeng Saeb.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.700
And I'm gonna share it all with you

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.528
in this video, right now.

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:26.195
(uptempo music)

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.040
Now, you might remember
in the previous video,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.360
I came to this market and we ate the most

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.160
over-sized, gigantic
bowl of lobster tom yum,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.630
that you've ever seen.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.040
And it was definitely a lot of fun to eat,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.930
but the problem is that we
were so full after eating that,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.460
that really nothing even
looked good after that.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.000
So, I decided to make a part two.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.350
We're back at Talad Rot Fai Ratchada.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.410
This is the train,
night market in Bangkok,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.980
known for it's unique Thai street food.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.723
And I'm here to eat another unique food,

00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:01.960
it's gonna be another giant bowl,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.240
but completely different

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.140
and we're gonna try it at this market

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.100
where it's most famous.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.520
The train-night market is especially known

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.910
for very unique Thai dishes.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.100
You'll find a lot of dishes that

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.790
people kind of experiment with,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.040
people come up with,
things are invented here.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.690
So, apart from like authentic Thai food,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.550
you'll find a lot of unique
creations that you'll

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.090
only find at this market.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.794
Oh, and here we are, this is the spot.

00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:28.877
(music)

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:34.873
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:41.703 --> 00:01:44.030
And the menu is on a giant cardboard.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.020
They have medium, large,
XL, and they have XXL.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.065
We're going straight for the XXL.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:53.565
(swing music)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.300
Oh wow, they just pulled out the plate,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.690
it's not even a bowl it's a plate

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.905
that's like the size of a satellite dish.

00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:07.405
(swing music)

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.300
they're stacking it up,
it looks like a tipi.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.580
In a triangular fashion,
into a cone shape,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.173
that is just getting more and
more ridicules by the second.

00:02:26.173 --> 00:02:28.840
(uptempo music)

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.470
They literally take pots
and there like buckets,

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.080
and they mix up the soup broth
with crushed green chilies

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.600
and just literally anoint
that, just dump it on,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.234
just fully coating it in a
layer of chilies and that soup.

00:03:08.234 --> 00:03:10.901
(uptempo music)

00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:30.557
Are you ready for this?

00:03:30.557 --> 00:03:32.757
- Yes, can eat right now?

00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:35.424
(uptempo music)

00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:44.320
Taste very, very good, but
it's not that it look crazy,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.940
but it taste very very good also.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.810
- [Mark] This is one of the
most ridicules plates of food,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.050
single plates of food I've
ever seen in my entire life.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.020
It's literally a mountain of food.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.830
Can you even see the whole thing?

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.440
Honest, he looked like he was struggling

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.070
when he carried it to the table.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.903
This thing must be heavy,

00:04:02.903 --> 00:04:04.683
I'm just gonna lift it a little bit.

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:08.220
Oh yeah, wow.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.680
That not only weighs a
lot, but it's kind of like

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.120
it works on your motor skills too,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.673
because you have to balance it.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.950
You've got liquid in there,
you've got the bones,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.050
this is a Mount Everest,
of pork bones and chilies.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.850
And the amount of chilies
that they added on here

00:04:26.694 --> 00:04:28.000
I think it would be uncountable.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.710
There's like thousands
of chilies on this plate.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.320
Before I get started
eating, before I taste this,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.310
I just wanna tell
quickly about Laeng Saeb,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.070
which is this dish.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.850
It's actually a very
recent, modern Thai dish,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.590
that's only been around for a
couple of years now, I think.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.430
Or at least that's only been popular.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.130
What it is, is it's the
pork bones, the pork spines.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.320
A lot of the bones that
would just tossed out,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.820
which are then boiled into a soup.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.790
But, it looks like there might be

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.760
quite a bit of meat on these bones.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.910
But then, it's boiled into a soup,

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.890
the soup is known to be very
spicy, full of lime juice.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.690
Okay, it's time to start digging in.

00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:12.002
I just wanna do a glory lap,
revolve around this first,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.280
to see where is a good place to start.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.860
Oh man, this is.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.470
Okay, I think I found the spot.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.060
Right down here where there's
a gigantic pool of chilies.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.780
Seems like they should
be giving you a shovel

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.010
to eat this with rather than a spoon.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.720
Okay, I'm gonna go in
just for the broth first.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.553
And just look at that.

00:05:27.553 --> 00:05:30.110
Yeah, that's just like solid
chilies with a little bit,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.183
a little bit of cilantro in there.

00:05:38.962 --> 00:05:39.795
Mm.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.580
Oh yeah, It not only looks ridicules,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.230
that is really good broth.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.510
The chilies are spicy, but not that spicy.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.870
It might look spicier than it is.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.390
Yeah, okay, I can see how
that might build on you,

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.400
and that might grow into
a flame in your mouth.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.200
Mm, but the broth you
can taste it's saltiness,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.830
you taste that rich boney broth,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.720
and then it's nice and sour as well.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.140
I think I'll go in for
this bone right here,

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.580
where I can just kinda scrap it,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.513
scrap it off the spine there.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.820
Oh, yeah, that's guaranteed
to be just fall apart tender.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.260
Look, just scrap that off the spine,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.850
oh, into the pool below.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.910
And what you can kinda do
is mix it with more chilies.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.529
Oh, look at that, oh, that's a big bite.

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.196
(uptempo music)

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.410
Yeah, that pork is nice and tender.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.770
Surprisingly, it tastes quite lean.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.970
But maybe that's because all
the fat has rendered out,

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.930
has boiled down.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.700
I think the next move to make,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.700
would be to grab that whole bone and just.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.873
Oh, look at that.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.510
Okay, I'm just gonna
dip that into the soup,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.346
rehydrate it a little bit.

00:06:55.346 --> 00:06:58.633
(uptempo music)

00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:02.530
I mean, there's not a tone
of meat on every bone,

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.147
but there are like 55 bones,

00:07:05.147 --> 00:07:07.330
and that adds up to quite
a lot of meat, I think.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.480
It's kinda easier to just take your bone,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.530
and scrap of the meat.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.473
Otherwise, it gets a little messy.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.090
Making sure to scrap out
all those little crevices

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.923
all that meat.

00:07:24.708 --> 00:07:27.722
Oh, that one just slide
right out of my fingers.

00:07:27.722 --> 00:07:30.378
(Mark laughs)

00:07:30.378 --> 00:07:33.880
It's not only really
good and looks ridicules,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.250
it actually is a lot of fun to eat too.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.050
I'll grab some of that meat,
I'll put this onto my rice,

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.520
add some more soup.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.760
When you're scrapping
the meat off that bones,

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.920
it feels like a pork
avalanche, a meat avalanche

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.420
is happening with the
chilies and the meat.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.100
If it were any bigger you
would need to harness up

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.726
and like climb onto this pile of bone.

00:07:58.726 --> 00:08:01.393
(uptempo music)

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.660
The chili heat does start to build on you.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.290
We've been eating for about 15 minutes

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.600
I think we're at least a quarter

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.290
of our way through the bones.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.640
We have at least four
or five bones finished.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.080
But, Ying's sister joined us now,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.990
which we definitely need some
help, some reinforcements.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.910
But this is, I mean, it is a lot of meat,

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.657
but it's kinda like a relaxing dish.

00:08:24.657 --> 00:08:26.380
You just kinda nibble on the bones,

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.620
you kinda eat slowly, take
some bites of those chilies,

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.893
drink some of that soup.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.620
And yes, you continue to eat those chilies

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.920
the heat does build.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.800
It's lovely it's wonderful,
but the chilies are not,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.390
I mean for the amount that you eat,

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.874
the chilies are not that spicy.

00:08:39.874 --> 00:08:42.541
(uptempo music)

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.454
Yeah, at this point I'm
just so far deep in,

00:08:53.454 --> 00:08:55.054
I'm gonna sit down the utilizes,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.570
and just go in gnawing, and
digging out with my fingers.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.073
Juicy bits of, just tenderness.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.220
Ying is just pushing those chilies

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.170
down to my side of the plate.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.798
Oh man, that is a
swimming pool of chilies.

00:09:12.798 --> 00:09:16.133
That's so many chilies, that's insane.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.810
As you keep on eating the top bones

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.780
start to get a little dry, so
you can kinda rehydrate them,

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.163
spoon on some chilies and some soup.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.860
And you reach a certain
point where you just wanna

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.693
pick this up and just gnaw on it.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.290
We've probably been eating for 45 minutes.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.810
We're definitely getting closer.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.459
I'd say we're at the finish point now.

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:45.730
You can almost see the
bottom of the plate.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.410
There's just no way that I'm gonna be able

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.417
to finish all those chilies myself though.

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:52.840
That's an absurd amount of chilies.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.290
- Try to give you something.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.214
- [Mark] You're rehydrating.

00:09:55.214 --> 00:09:56.910
(Ying laughs)

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.140
We have reached the finish line.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.820
This is the final bone.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.520
There's only a pool of soup

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.070
and still a ton of chilies down there.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.400
But, yeah, I think we
climbed Mount Everest.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.420
But, they sort of deceive you at the end.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.590
They put all the bones with
the most meat at the bottom.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.280
Look at how much meat that is.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.870
Oh man, and it's like,
when you're at this stage,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.547
you're just sort of like, oh,

00:10:19.547 --> 00:10:22.034
you're just sort of like, slowly moving.

00:10:22.034 --> 00:10:24.701
(uptempo music)

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.810
Mission accomplished,
I am drenched in sweat.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.900
This place is extremely popular.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.640
I don't think there's any empty tables.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.307
(uptempo music)

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.910
It's so popular, that
now as we're leaving,

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.083
there's a waiting line.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.170
It's a good thing we got here early.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.550
Yeah, I'm definitely very full.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.390
But it's, I mean it looks ginormous

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.950
because there's so many bones.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.150
I mean, if you share that
with a few of people,

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.728
that's just a good solid meal.

00:11:07.728 --> 00:11:11.350
But, yeah, it's just impressive
to look at, so many bones.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.690
But I just wanna tell you
that Laeng Saeb, what a dish.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.770
The combination of those green chilies,

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.867
the lime juice in there

00:11:18.867 --> 00:11:21.890
and then boiled down those pork bones,

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.380
what a flavor combination,
what a flavor profile.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.260
That is way more laeng saeb
than I ever care to eat again

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.040
in one sitting.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.410
But, you should definitely try it.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.450
It's an amazing dish.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.340
And you can order all
sorts of different sizes.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.030
Whatever size you desire for your meal.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.459
We have stopped to eat
some, it's called Monster

00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:45.560
(speaks in foreign language)

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.940
Monster (speaks in foreign language)

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.510
oh, okay, in Thai,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.150
okay, it's the instant ice cream,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.800
but in Thai that actually
means stir fried ice cream.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.193
And that's actually exactly,
precisely, what it is.

00:11:59.497 --> 00:12:01.497
(music)

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.440
What she does is she takes some milk,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.800
she takes some other random ingredients

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.270
and then she kinda plays around with it.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.060
That works it on the cold plate,

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.890
kinda flattens it out so it gets cold

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:29.723
and then scoops it back up.

00:12:29.723 --> 00:12:32.040
And then the final step
is when she spreads it out

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.700
into a thin sheet and then
scraps it up from bottom,

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.260
into swirls.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.940
She does some serious decorating though.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.560
She but on some wafers some like

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.210
candy cane looking wafers.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.050
Another Oreo, a bunch of whipped cream,

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.950
a bunch of chocolate sauce,
a bunch of sprinkles.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:47.783
Did I miss anything.

00:12:47.783 --> 00:12:49.620
I just wanna kinda taste
that ice cream first

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.453
and it is mixed.

00:12:50.453 --> 00:12:51.286
What did we get Ying?

00:12:51.286 --> 00:12:52.721
Almond and Oreo, right?

00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:53.554
- [Ying] Uh-huh.

00:12:53.554 --> 00:12:55.813
- Almond and Oreo in the ice cream.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:06.070
This has been a very popular
trending type of ice cream

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.280
because of the way it's
made, for quite a while now.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.600
But, this is my first time to try it.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.590
I mean, it is ice cream,
but it's a little thinner.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.103
It's not quite as rich.

00:13:14.975 --> 00:13:18.390
(uptempo music)

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.120
I think it's a Wednesday night,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.190
but traditionally this market
was more of a weekend market.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.340
But now I think it's almost
open every night of the week.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.173
I'm not totally sure.

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:28.920
But, it's open through out the week.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.770
But coming here in the
week is really nice.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.060
It's not nearly as busy.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.060
The last time we came here
when we had the tom yum,

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.500
that was a Friday night.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.470
Ah man, about this time,
at seven or eight p.m,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:42.290
it just starts to get
like ridiculously packed.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.640
To the point where you can barely move.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.430
And there is so many people.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.620
But now it's really manageable.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.323
It's nice on the week days.

00:14:01.002 --> 00:14:01.835
This snack is called

00:14:01.835 --> 00:14:03.100
(speaks in foreign language).

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.320
Which, it translates
directly to crispy butter.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.970
And this is a snack that's
very popular at this market.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:09.860
If you walk through you'll find

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.240
a number of stalls selling it.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.500
But I think the best part about
it is watching them make it.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.470
It's pretty impressive.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.100
I think they actually use cement trowels,

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.610
spread it out onto the hot plate.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.670
The let it cook slowly.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.130
Then he puts on a bunch of
butter with a paint brush,

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.710
they add on I think
sweeten condensed milk,

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.120
and then let it sizzle.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.650
It's really like a paper thin sheet,

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.770
and then when it's done they scrap it up

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.433
into little like wafers.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.140
In order to make this snack
you definitely need a lot of

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.910
construction materials,
trowels, paint brushes,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.960
they're using it all.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.280
Here they are the finished products.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.310
These are like little,
little butter wafers.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.010
Wow, yeah they're just paper thin.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.660
They're the type of thing
that just completely collapses

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.690
as you bite down.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:06.618
Mm.

00:15:06.618 --> 00:15:07.451
Mm.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.300
It sort of like, goes down to nothing

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.040
when it touches with your saliva.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.736
They do have a egg yolk taste to them.

00:15:14.736 --> 00:15:17.403
(uptempo music)

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.520
those go down really easily.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.160
And they're the type of thing
that kinda stick to your lips

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.713
if your lips are kinda dry.

00:15:26.713 --> 00:15:29.380
(uptempo music)

00:15:43.429 --> 00:15:46.440
I saw the coconut shakes and
this is just too tempting.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.400
My mouth is still quite salty
from all of that Laeng Saeb.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.340
And yeah, actually I'm pretty full,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.460
so I think we might call it here.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.250
End with a coconut, end on a good note,

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.300
with a coconut shake.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.080
Oh, that's so naturally sweet.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.640
That's just the sweetness
from the coconut water,

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.270
from the coconut meat, with ice in it.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.370
Oh that hits the spot.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.470
So that's gonna do it for this night,

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.420
street food tour of
Talad Rot Fai Ratchada.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.520
The main goal of coming this evening

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.020
was to eat that Laeng Saeb.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.020
And again, that was the most
gigantic, XXL version of it.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.477
But you can order smaller
sizes, more manageable sizes,

00:16:30.477 --> 00:16:32.083
and it's a great dish to eat.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.350
And there's a lot of really
unique, really interesting

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.190
innovative, Thai street
foods to try at this market.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.070
It's really worth checking
out when you're in Bangkok.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.460
So I'm gonna end the video now.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.830
Also, make sure you watch part one.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.830
The absolutely giganormous
bowl of lobster tom yum.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.670
I will link it below, but check that out.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.180
