one of the most interesting things I

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639
one of the most interesting things I

a scientific point of view has to do
with how a very small advantage can can

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209
with how a very small advantage can can
 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.409
with how a very small advantage can can
grow over time when it's shared so if

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:06.419
grow over time when it's shared so if
 

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:08.660
