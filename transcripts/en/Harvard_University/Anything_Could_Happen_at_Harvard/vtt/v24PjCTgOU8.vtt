00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.367
My name is Jordan,
and I’m in the class of 2016.

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:07.533
I’m in Mission Hill After School Program...

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.533
one of the many opportunities at Harvard
to get involved and volunteer.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.033
This program in particular
works with kids in the Boston area.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.167
We tutor them and mentor them
and work with them on their homework.

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:21.167
We have a student driving the van.
We’re all together.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:22.800
And it’s a great community.

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:25.433
[ Jordan ] After a week of studying
and hard work and everything...

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.267
it’s nice to get together with a group of other
students that are interested in volunteering...

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.400
and then to give back to the communities.

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:36.167
One of the things that I love about
being part of a tutoring program...

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:40.500
is that most of the time
my students end up tutoring me.

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.600
[ Girl ]
She’s smart. She helps us.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:46.700
And she’s pretty, funny.

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:50.067
It really helped me transition
from being a varsity athlete...

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:54.700
to being involved in another way I could
give back to the Harvard community.

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:56.700
[ Young Woman ]
It means so much...

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:59.533
and it becomes a huge part of your life
and a huge part of who you are.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.000
I’ve had a very wonderful first year here.
