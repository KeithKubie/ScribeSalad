00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.900
One of my favourite pages from Art Spiegelman’s comix masterpiece Maus

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.400
comes in the very first chapter: here.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.920
The comic, if you don’t know, is about Spiegelman's fathers experience in the Holocaust.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.620
More specifically, it's about Spiegelman’s own efforts to come to grips with that experience while navigating

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.820
a really strange relationship with his dad.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.600
Maus is obsessed with this correspondence between the past and the present and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.880
it's a theme that Speigelman is determent to work out visually in his comic.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.580
How does he do that?

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.880
Well let's take a look at the page that I mentioned earlier panel by panel:

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.240
in the first, Spiegelman’s father, Vladek, takes his grown son Arty back up to his old bedroom

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.640
after dinner so that he could do some exercise.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.400
Already the past is signaled here with the empty bedroom of a child that's moved out.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.300
In the second panel, we get a closer look at that room and what Vladek’s done with it:

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.300
more remnants of the past like the pennant banner from Spiegelman’s college, Harper,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.260
where he studied art and philoshopy.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.160
We get our first glimpse of the exercicle that Vladek uses to workout,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.580
and this is where Art broaches the subject of the book that we’re reading now.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.340
Notice that the bodies of both father and son are leaning at the same angle.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.860
Spiegelman’s asking his dad to open up so he parallels his body language.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.440
He’s also equating this two men visually

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.960
and the book will continue to compare and contrast them until the end.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.740
In the third panel the heads are paralleled this time.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.640
Art’s looking at a picture, but we won’t learn what it is until a few panels down.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.580
In the fourth panel, nothing changes but Art’s head which swivels around to his father

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.440
as he makes his request explicit.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.500
And then we come to the fifth panel, which stretches the entire width of the page and has a lot going on.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.720
Right away you can see three key signifiers of the past:

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.680
the picture, the identification tattoo Vladek received at Auschwitz, and the speech bubble, where Vladek says,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.260
’'It would take many books, my life, and no one wants anyway to hear such stories.’’

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.180
As critic Hillary Chute notes it's ''as if the past articulated, inscribed, and documented

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.560
were flanking both men, closing in on them.’’

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.200
And ofcourse within this, Arty is inclosed by his father.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.840
In the sixth panel we learn that the photograph is of Arty’s mother, Anja,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.960
which helps us understand the panels that came before.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.140
In the seventh panel we see Vladek’s shoe padelling with effort on the bike but going nowhere.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.220
Then in the eighth and final circular panel, we get our first window into the past,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.420
into the story within a story that will consume the book.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.520
The different shape signals a new narrative thread while the image of Vladek

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.000
echoes the photograph thats been a dominant feature of the rest of the page.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.440
‘’In a comic you have various panels, those panels are each units of time.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.440
You see them simultaneously, so you have various moments in time simultaneously made present.’’

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.020
That's Art Speigelman, explaining why it's a bit unfair to do what I just did

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.940
inconsider the value of a panel on its own.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.480
For Spiegelman, the basic unit of comics is the page.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.060
Its basic function that interplay of moments that happens when you take in several panels all at ones.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.100
In a way that unique to comics time is made spatial, spread out across a surface so that

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.840
you can see not only how the past effects the future but vice versa.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.420
What you learn here, that this picture is of Art’s mom, Vladek’s wife who committed suicide,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.180
transforms the meaning of this look here

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.360
and all it takes is a glance, the slides movement in the eyes to access that connection.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.500
You don’t need to rewind or read back or start over again.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.980
On the page, those two moments exist simultaneously.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.000
In this sense, graphic design becomes a vital part of comic making.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.220
As the great cartoonist Seth a.k.a Gregory Gallant ones said,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.540
'’The ‘words and pictures’ that make up the comics language are often described as

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.840
prose and illustration combined. A bad metaphor:

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.680
poetry and graphic design seems more apt.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.040
Poerty for the rhythm and condensing;

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.860
graphic design because cartooning is more about moving shapes around -designing-

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.220
then is is about drawing.’’

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.540
This page of Maus is the perfect illustration of that sentement.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.340
Take a closer look, what do you see in this design?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.580
What about now?

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.880
In Speigelman’s book and life, his father is a towering figure.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.260
His experience surviving the most horrifying event in history becomes

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.200
the central fact in not just his life, but in his sons.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.280
Thats how the trauma of the holocaust invaded the world and how

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.920
the past invades the present. In Maus Vladek literally invades the page and

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.160
pumping away on his exercicle as shoe points out,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.640
Arty’s father is literally unable to move forward.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.300
Which is why it make sense that the past begins in the wheel of that bike.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.000
Art Speigelman set out to create a comic that would be rereadable.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.960
Thats why he spend thirteen years writing, drawing, and designing Maus.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.500
Every page is a new pattern to pick apart, a new configuration of moments, past and present,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.100
words and images, father and son.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.000
This attention to design is why Maus is often regarded as the best graphic novel ever written.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.960
It's not that the subject matter is inherently dramatic and effecting, which it is.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.500
It's that Speigelman wanted to tell a story in a way that was unique to the comix medium.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.120
To extract the truth of the holocaust and of his family that only comix can tell.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.800

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.980
Okay, real quick;

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.300
Here is another page I really love for the way that it plays with how a comics page is normally read.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.880
It's the point in the story when Vladek is first entering Auschwitz.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.620
Now, everyone who reads comics knows that you meant to go left to right, then down, then left to right again.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.520
But here, Speigelman cleverly uses overlapping speech bubbles to pull you down the left side.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.020
''...And at that point you have to read down again, and that becomes a descent into the beast's maw.''

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.060
Horrifying but beautiful. Anyways, see you guys.
