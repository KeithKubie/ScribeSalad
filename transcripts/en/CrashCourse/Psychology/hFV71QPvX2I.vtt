00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.999
Can week-old pizza cause psychedelic hallucinations?

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:03.620
Does coffee make you smarter?

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.540
Or does it just make you do dumb stuff faster?

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.580
Like a bunch of psychology itself, questions
like this can seem pretty intuitive.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.830
I mean, people may not be the easiest organisms
to understand, but you're a person, right?

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.680
So you must be qualified to draw, like, some
conclusions about other people and what makes

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.680
them tick.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.660
But it's important to realize that your intuition
isn't always right.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.180
In fact, sometimes it is exactly wrong, and
we tend to grossly underestimate the dangers

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.210
of false intuition.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.189
If you have an idea about a person and their
behavior that turns out to be right, that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.370
reinforces your trust in your intuition.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.620
Like if one of my buddies, Bob, begins eating
that deep-dish pizza that's been in the fridge

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.420
for the past week but he eats it anyway and
soon starts to wig out, I'll say "Dude, I

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.420
told you so".

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.750
But if I'm wrong and he's totally fine, I
probably won't even think about it ever again.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.320
This is known as 'Hindsight Bias" or the "I-Knew-It-All-Along"
phenomenon.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.460
This doesn't mean the common sense is wrong,
it just means that our intuitive sense more

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.320
easily describes what just happened, than
what will happen in the future.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.370
Another reason you can't blindly trust your
intuition is your natural tendency toward

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.370
overconfidence.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.770
Sometimes, you just really, really feel like
you're right about people when actually you're

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320
really, really wrong.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.320
We've all been there.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.540
We also tend to perceive order in random events,
which can lead to false assumptions.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.140
For example, if you flip a coin five times
you have equal chances of getting all tails

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.220
as you do getting alternating heads and tails.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.030
But we see the series of five tails as something
unusual, as a streak, and thus giving that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.430
result some kind of meaning that it very definitely
does not have.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.740
That is why we have the methods and safe-guards
of psychological research and experimentation,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.850
and the glorious process of scientific inquiry.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.420
They help us to get around these problems
and basically save the study of our minds

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.940
from the stupidity of our minds.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.070
So I hope that it won't be a spoiler if I
tell you now that pizza won't make you trip,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.110
and coffee doesn't make you smart.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.450
Sorry.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.800
[Intro]

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.440
In most ways psychological research is no
different than any other scientific discipline,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.210
like step one is always figuring out how to
ask general questions about your subject and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.200
turn them into measurable, testable propositions.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.960
This is called operationalizing your questions.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.770
So you know how the scientific method works
-- it starts with a question and a theory,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.330
and I don't mean theory in the sense of like,
a hunch that say, a quad-shot of espresso

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.760
makes you think better.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.180
Instead, in science a theory is what explains
and organizes lots of different observations

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.260
and predicts outcomes.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.940
And when you come up with a testable prediction,
that's your hypothesis.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.320
Once your theory and hypothesis are in place,
you need a clear and common language to report

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.990
them with, so for example, defining exactly
what you mean by "thinking better" with your

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.150
espresso hypothesis will allow other researchers
to replicate the experiment.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.470
And replication is key.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.870
You can watch a person exhibit a certain behavior
once, and it won't prove very much, but if

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.210
you keep getting consistent results, even
as you change subjects or situations, you're

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.400
probably on to something.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.810
This is a problem with one popular type of
psychological research: case studies, which

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.520
take an in-depth look at one individual.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.550
Case studies can sometimes be misleading,
because by their nature, they can't be replicated,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.160
so they run the risk of over-generalizing.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.930
Still, they're good at showing us what CAN
happen, and end up framing questions for more

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.180
extensive and generalizable studies.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.340
They're also often memorable and a great story
telling device psychologists use to observe

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.480
and describe behavior.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.560
Like, say the smell of coffee makes Carl suddenly
anxious and irritable -- that obviously doesn't

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.450
mean that it has that same effect on everyone.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.459
In fact, Carl has terrible memories associated
with that smell, and so his case is actually

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.530
quite rare.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.530
Poor Carl.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.100
But you would still have to look at lots of
other cases to determine that conclusively.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.650
Another popular method of psychological research
is naturalistic observation, where researchers

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.490
simply watch behavior in a natural environment,
whether that's chimps poking ant-hills in

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.349
the jungle, kids clowning in a classroom or
drunk dudes yelling at soccer games.

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.660
The idea is to let the subjects just do their
thing without trying to manipulate or control

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.660
the situation.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.010
So yeah, basically just spying on people.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.069
Like case studies, naturalistic observations
are great at describing behavior, but they're

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.130
very limited in explaining it.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.180
Psychologists can also collect behavioral
data using surveys or interviews, asking people

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.720
to report their opinions and behaviors.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.820
Sexuality researcher Alfred Kinsey famously
used this technique when he surveyed thousands

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.040
of men and women on their sexual history and
published his findings in a pair of revolutionary

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.180
texts, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and
Female respectively.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.550
Surveys are a great way to access consciously
held attitudes and beliefs, but how to ask

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.570
the questions can be tricky; subtle word choices
can influence results.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.850
For example more forceful words like "ban"
or "censor" may elicit different reactions

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.180
than "limit" or "not allow".

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.910
Asking "Do you believe in space aliens?" is
a much different question than "Do you think

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.130
that there is intelligent life somewhere else
in the universe?"

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.370
It's the same question, but in the first the
subject might assume you mean aliens visiting

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.710
earth, and making crop circles and abducting
people and poking them.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.480
And if how you phrase surveys is important,
so is who you ask.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.710
I could ask a room full of students at a pacifist
club meeting what they think about arms control,

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.620
but the result wouldn't be a representative
measure of where students stand, because there's

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.630
a pretty clear sampling bias at work here.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.090
To fairly represent a population, I'd need
to get a random sample where all members of

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.560
the target group, in this case students, had
an equal chance of being selected to answer

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.560
the question.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.800
So once you've described behavior with surveys,
case studies, or naturalistic observation,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.590
you can start making sense out of it, and
even predict future behavior.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.050
One way to do that is to look at one trait
or behavior is related to another, or how

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.050
they correlate.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.210
So let's get back to my buddy Bob who seems
to think that his refrigerator is actually

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.850
some kind of time machine that can preserve
food indefinitely.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.621
Let's say that Bob has just tucked into a
lunch of questionable leftovers, pizza that

00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:52.120
may very well have had a little bit of fungus
on it.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.000
But he was hungry, and lazy, and so he doused
it in Sriracha.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.490
Suddenly, he starts seeing things: green armadillos
with laser beam eyes.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.460
From here we could deduce that eating unknown
fungus predicts hallucination, that's a correlation.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.740
But correlation is not causation.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.330
Yes, it makes sense that eating questionable
fungus would cause hallucinations, but it's

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.870
possible that Bob was already on the verge
of a psychotic episode, and those fuzzy leftovers

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.150
were actually benign.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.639
Or there could be an entirely different factor
involved, like maybe he hadn't slept in 72

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.260
hours, or had an intense migraine coming on,
and one of those factors caused his hallucinations.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.229
It's tempting to draw conclusions from correlations,
but it's super-important to remember that

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.910
correlations predict the possibility of cause-and-effect
relationships; they cannot prove them.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.400
So we've talked about how to describe behavior
without manipulating it and how to make connections

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.220
and predictions from those findings.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.540
But that can only take you so far; to really
get to the bottom of cause-and-effect behaviors,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.940
you're gonna have to start experimenting.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.889
Experiments allow investigators to isolate
different effects by manipulating an independent

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.610
variable, and keeping all other variables
constant, or as constant as you can.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.440
This means that they need at least two groups:
the experimental group, which is gonna get

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.110
messed with, and the control group, which
is not gonna get messed with.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.350
Just as surveys use random samples, experimental
researchers need to randomly assign participants

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.110
to each group to minimize potential confounding
variables, or outside factors that may skew

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.110
the results.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.260
You don't want all grumpy teenagers in one
group and all wealthy Japanese surfers in

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.380
the other; they gotta mingle.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.350
Now sometimes one or both groups are not informed
about what's actually being tested.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.639
For example, researchers can test how substances
effect people by comparing their effects to

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.600
placebos, or inert substances.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.639
And often, the researchers themselves don't
know which group is experimental and which

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.360
is control, so they don't unintentionally
influence the results through their own behavior,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.540
in which case it's called, you guessed it,
a double blind procedure.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.520
So let's put these ideas into practice in
our own little experiment.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.820
Like all good work, it starts with a question.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.700
So the other day my friend Bernice and I were
debating.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.300
We were debating caffeine's effect on the
brain.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.509
Personally, she convinced that coffee helps
her focus and think better, but I get all

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:00.360
jittery like a caged meerkat and can't focus
on anything.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.770
And because we know that overconfidence can
lead you to believe things that are not true,

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.700
we decided to use some critical thinking.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.290
So let's figure out our question: "Do humans
solve problems faster when given caffeine?"

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.960
Now we gotta boil that down into a testable
prediction.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.350
Remember: keep it clear, simple, and eloquent
so that it can be replicated.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.130
"Caffeine makes me smarter" is not a great
hypothesis.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:25.380
A better one would be, say, "Adult humans
given caffeine will navigate a maze faster

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.060
than humans not given caffeine."

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.580
The caffeine dosage is your independent variable,
the thing that you can change.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.379
So, you'll need some coffee.

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:36.559
Your result or dependent variable, the thing
that depends on the thing that you can change

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:40.079
is going to be the speed at which the subject
navigates through this giant corn maze.

00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:43.899
Go out on the street, wrangle up a bunch of
different kinds of people and randomly assign

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:45.670
them into three different groups.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.220
Also at this point, the American Psychological
Association suggests that you acquire everyone's

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.370
informed consent to participate.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.189
You don't want to force anyone to be in your
experiment, no matter how cool you think it

00:08:55.189 --> 00:08:56.189
is.

00:08:56.189 --> 00:08:58.300
So the control group gets a placebo, in this
case decaf.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.569
Experimental group one gets a low dose of
caffeine, which we'll define at a 100 milligrams;

00:09:02.569 --> 00:09:05.209
just an eye opener, like, a cup of coffee's
worth.

00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:09.790
Experimental group two gets 500 milligrams,
more than a quad shot of espresso dunked in

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.790
a Red Bull.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.990
Once you dose everyone, turn them lose in
the maze and wait at the other end with a

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.990
stopwatch.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.860
All that's left is to measure your results
from the three different groups and compare

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.139
them to see if there were any conclusive results.

00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:24.230
If the highly dosed folks got through it twice
as fast as the low dose and the placebo groups,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.120
then Bernice's hypothesis was correct, and
she can rub my face in it saying she was right

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.300
all along, but really that would just be the
warm flush of hindsight bias telling her something

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.569
she didn't really know until we tested it.

00:09:35.569 --> 00:09:39.519
Then, because we've used clear language and
defined our parameters, other curious minds

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:43.629
can easily replicate this experiment, and
we can eventually pool all the data together

00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:48.250
and have something solid to say about what
that macchiato was doing to your cognition–

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.160
or at least the speed at which you can run
through a maze.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.129
Science: probably the best tool that you have
for understanding other people.

00:09:54.129 --> 00:09:57.850
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Psychology; if you paid attention you

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.839
learned how to apply the scientific method
to psychological research through case studies,

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:05.709
naturalistic observation, surveys, and interviews
and experimentation.

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:10.649
You also learned about different kinds of
bias in experimentation and how research practices

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:11.649
help us avoid them.

00:10:11.649 --> 00:10:15.980
Thanks especially to our Subbable subscribers,
who make this and all of Crash Course possible.
