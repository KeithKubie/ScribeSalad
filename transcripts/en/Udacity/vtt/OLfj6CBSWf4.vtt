00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's do match first.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Match interfaces with the matchset, finds the set of remainders.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If there is a set of remainders, then it finds the shortest one.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The shortest remainder should be the longest text, and then we want to return that.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We want to return the text, and it's a match not a search,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so the match has to be at the beginning of the text, and it would go up to match.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So we match from the beginning of the text. How far do we want to go?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, everything except the remainder. How much is that?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Well, we can just subtract from the length of the text the length of the shortest,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and that gives us the initial piece of the longest possible match.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Here search calls into match.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What we do is we start iterating. We start at position number zero.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If there is a match there for the text starting at position zero, then we want to return it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If not, we increment i to 1, and we say does the text from position 1 on--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is there a match there and so on. We just keep on going through until we find one.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Here what we want to say is "if the match is not None, then return m."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Notice that it would be a bad idea to say "if m return m."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Normally it's idiomatic in Python to say that if we're looking for a true value.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But the problem here is that the empty string we want to count as a true value.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
A pattern might match the empty string. That counts as a match, not as a failure.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We can't just say "if m" because the empty string counts as false.

00:01:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We have to say "if m is not None."
