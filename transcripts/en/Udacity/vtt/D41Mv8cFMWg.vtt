00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.560
Now that we have a single log equal to a constant, we can finally find j over

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.520
c. This will tell us how many times greater the intensity of the earthquake in

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.260
Japan was, than the one in California. So please solve for j over c. Round to

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.555
one decimal place.
