00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.190
Okay. So now we turn to a big topic

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.380
when you use Datastore, queries. And we will start

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.570
by giving you an overview of the types of

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.150
queries that we will run. Let's do that by looking

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.600
at Conference Central, where we will build out the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.570
show conferences function. In the first tab here, we

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.580
can see all the conferences. This query is called

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.020
query by kind, because we will search for all entities

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.580
that are of the conference kind. In the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.930
second tab, we can see all the conferences

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.560
created by the user. This query is called

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.160
query by kind, filter by ancestor, because we will

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.100
search for all conferences that have the user

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.620
as their ancestor. Remember, this is the ancestor

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.560
relationship we established between the conference, and the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.190
profile that created the conference. And finally, in the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.610
third tab we will see all conferences the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.930
user has registered to attend. This query is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.520
called query by kind filter by property, because

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.000
we will display all conferences that are in the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.590
attended conference property of the profile entity. Remember,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.140
this is to has a relationship we created

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.810
between a profile and the conferences they registered

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.170
to attend. And one more thing. In this part,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.150
you can further restrict the search result by

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.260
applying filters. And as you can see from the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.600
drop down menu, these are properties in the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.950
conference kind. So therefore, these will also be a

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.780
query by kind, filtered by property. Okay. So

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.490
these are the query types we will look at

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.840
now. Query by kind, query by kind filtered by

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.360
ancestor, query by kind filtered by property. The query

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.510
by kind filtered by property, is a little bit advanced stuff. The other ones

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.230
are pretty straight forward though, so you'll

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.410
start off by adding them to Conference Central.
