with data so one of the one of the
 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.720
with data so one of the one of the
things I'm really struck by when I give

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730
things I'm really struck by when I give
 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.999
things I'm really struck by when I give
lectures in Silicon Valley for example

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009
lectures in Silicon Valley for example
 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.759
lectures in Silicon Valley for example
or when I talk to people who are doing

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769
or when I talk to people who are doing
 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.679
or when I talk to people who are doing
things I'm very impressed by and I'm not

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.759
things I'm very impressed by and I'm not
going to say that you know I completely

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769
going to say that you know I completely

understand them right

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789
understand them right
 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.029
understand them right
but one of the things I'm struck by is a

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039
but one of the things I'm struck by is a
 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.999
but one of the things I'm struck by is a
certain kind of naivete that data

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009
certain kind of naivete that data
 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.569
certain kind of naivete that data
automatically produces knowledge which

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579
automatically produces knowledge which
 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.080

that I actually need to be a good

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280
that I actually need to be a good
 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.890
that I actually need to be a good
citizen that's it you know for me like

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900
citizen that's it you know for me like

that's an interesting balance between

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459
that's an interesting balance between
 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.610
that's an interesting balance between
humanities and technology and what I've

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620
humanities and technology and what I've
 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.830
humanities and technology and what I've
noticed is that since we don't think

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840
noticed is that since we don't think
 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.629
noticed is that since we don't think
about it this way we basically punted on

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639
about it this way we basically punted on
 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.309
about it this way we basically punted on
the whole question by accepting this

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319
the whole question by accepting this
 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.259
the whole question by accepting this

Internet's going to mean enlightenment

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470
Internet's going to mean enlightenment
 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.830
Internet's going to mean enlightenment
more data means better understanding and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840
more data means better understanding and
 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.020
more data means better understanding and
so on because we put on that question we

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030
so on because we put on that question we
 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.979
so on because we put on that question we
find ourself I think in a very

precarious position where the humans are
 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.839
precarious position where the humans are
actually just kind of holding on by

you know data is basically being used

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720
you know data is basically being used
 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.920
you know data is basically being used
against them all the time so trying to

against them all the time so trying to
 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.420

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989
this I think it can be solved but I
 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.689
this I think it can be solved but I
think thinking about it that way like as

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699
think thinking about it that way like as
 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.029
think thinking about it that way like as
a balance where the data that comes out

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039
a balance where the data that comes out

you know has to has to be governed by

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500
you know has to has to be governed by
 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.350
you know has to has to be governed by
some notion of Rights and I would also

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360
some notion of Rights and I would also
 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.910
some notion of Rights and I would also
say the data that comes back at me

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920
say the data that comes back at me
 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.530
say the data that comes back at me
has to be governed by some notion of

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540
has to be governed by some notion of
 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.840
has to be governed by some notion of
rights I mean I think people do you have

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850
rights I mean I think people do you have
 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.560
rights I mean I think people do you have
a basic right of access to factuality or

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570
a basic right of access to factuality or
 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.880
a basic right of access to factuality or
maybe we should be thinking about a

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890
maybe we should be thinking about a
 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.440
maybe we should be thinking about a
basic right of access to factuality

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450
basic right of access to factuality
 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.980
basic right of access to factuality
because without that without like access

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990
because without that without like access
 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.080
because without that without like access
to data that makes sense to an average

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090
to data that makes sense to an average

citizen at the right time it's very hard
to have any of the other rights or the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500
to have any of the other rights or the
 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.660
to have any of the other rights or the
other rights I think are very hard to

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670
other rights I think are very hard to
 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.510
