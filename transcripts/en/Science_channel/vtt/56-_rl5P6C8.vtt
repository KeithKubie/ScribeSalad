Narrator:
FRIEND OF THE SHOW MARK ROBER

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:10.501
IS BACK WITH A HOT NEW TAKE
ON THE HOT TUB.

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:14.033
I'M SITTING IN A HOT TUB FILLED
TO THE BRIM WITH SOLID SAND.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.868
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:20.367
WHAT?!

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:22.834
Narrator: MARK IS TURNING
SOLID SAND INTO A LIQUID,

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:28.667
AND IT'S MAKING A SPLASH ONLINE
WITH OVER 24 MILLION VIEWS.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:30.501
THIS IS JUST INCREDIBLE.

00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:31.901
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:35.234
I REALLY WANT ONE OF THESE
IN MY HOUSE.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:39.167
NO, SERIOUSLY, I DO WANT ONE OF
THESE [Laughing] IN MY HOUSE.

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:40.834
Narrator: WE'RE HOT-FOOTING IT
OVER TO CALIFORNIA

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:44.701
TO TAKE A DIP
INTO OUR FIRST QUANTUM LEAP.

00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.567
I WANTED TO CAPTURE THE TRUE,
LIKE, FIRST REACTION

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.300
OF WHAT IT FELT LIKE
WHEN WE TURNED IT ON,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.234
AND SO WHEN I'M SITTING THERE
AT THE BEGINNING,

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:53.801
THAT'S LEGITIMATELY THE FIRST
TIME THAT WE TURNED IT ON.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:55.834
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:57.868
AND THE SENSATION OF JUST
SITTING ON SOMETHING

00:00:57.868 --> 00:00:59.267
THAT'S COMPLETELY SOLID

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:02.067
AND THEN, SUDDENLY,
IT JUST LIQUIFIES.

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:04.801
IT'S A CRAZY, WEIRD,
WEIRD FEELING.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.868
THE WHOLE BUILD TOOK US
ABOUT 2 MONTHS.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:11.234
I'D SAY HALF OF THAT WAS JUST
DOING THE PROTOTYPES

00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:13.067
AND GETTING ALL OF THAT,
LIKE, FIGURED OUT,

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:14.667
THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES,

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:17.367
AND THEN THE OTHER HALF WAS
ACTUALLY BUILDING THE HOT TUB.

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:20.200
Narrator:
NO, IT SURE WASN'T QUICKSAND,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.033
SO HOW DID MARK UPGRADE
THIS HOT SAND PIT?

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:28.434
MARK HAS MADE WHAT IS KNOWN
AS A FLUIDIZED BED.

00:01:28.434 --> 00:01:30.968
Parker: THIS IS WHERE AIR IS
PUMPED THROUGH THE SAND,

00:01:30.968 --> 00:01:33.901
WHICH MAKES IT BEHAVE
LIKE A LIQUID.

00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:37.167
WHEN THE AIR IS SWITCHED OFF...
[ LAUGHS ]

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:39.133
...IT RETURNS TO BEHAVING
MORE LIKE A SOLID.

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:43.000
IT JUST STOPS, AND YOU'RE,
LIKE, LOCKED IN PLACE.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.667
MARK HAS 18 COPPER PIPES

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.701
THAT RUN SIDE BY SIDE
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOT TUB.

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:51.634
INTO THESE, HE'S DRILLED
OVER 2,500 HOLES

00:01:51.634 --> 00:01:54.501
WHICH ARE REGULARLY SPACED
AND ALL POINTING DOWN

00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:56.634
SO THE SAND DOESN'T
GET STUCK IN THEM.

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:58.968
THOSE PIPES ARE WELDED
TO ONE BIG PIPE

00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:02.801
THAT'S CONNECTED TO THREE
CYLINDERS OF NITROGEN GAS.

00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:06.968
THEN MARK FILLS THE HOT TUB
WITH OVER ONE TON OF DRY SAND.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.334
Narrator: BUT HOW DOES HE MAKE
THE SAND ACT LIKE A LIQUID?

00:02:13.334 --> 00:02:15.334
WHEN MARK OPENS
A NITROGEN CYLINDER,

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:17.701
THE GAS GOES BETWEEN
THE SAND GRAINS,

00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:20.434
REDUCING THE FRICTION
IN BETWEEN THEM.

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:23.868
THE GAS PROVIDES AN UPWARD FORCE
ON EACH GRAIN OF SAND

00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:26.267
WHICH COUNTERACTS
THE FORCE OF GRAVITY.

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:28.534
Elliott: SO IF THOSE TWO FORCES
ARE IN EQUILIBRIUM,

00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:29.968
THE SAND JUST HOVERS.

00:02:29.968 --> 00:02:32.000
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.901
THE GAS FLOW HAS TO BE JUST
RIGHT TO ALLOW THE SAND GRAINS

00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:36.567
TO MOVE FREELY OVER EACH OTHER.

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:39.033
IF THE GAS IS COMING OUT
TOO QUICKLY,

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:41.501
IT WILL GIVE TOO MUCH FORCE
TO THE GRAINS OF SAND,

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:44.234
AND THEY WILL FLY OUT
OF THE HOT TUB.

00:02:44.234 --> 00:02:47.133
TOO LITTLE GAS, AND THE SAND
WON'T REALLY MOVE AT ALL.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.167
I CAN'T GET IT OUT.

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:51.901
WHAT'S SO WEIRD IS THAT
WHEN YOU PULL YOUR HAND UP,

00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:54.467
OR YOU GET OUT, LIKE,
IT'S COMPLETELY DRY.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.400
LIKE, THAT'S THE PART
THAT'S LIKE,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.267
"WHAT IS HAPPENING?
LIKE, THIS ISN'T QUITE RIGHT."

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:01.200
CUT IT.

AH!

00:03:03.234 --> 00:03:05.000

OUT OF PLACES.
