00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.806
- AND WE'RE COMING TO THE END
OF THE FIRST QUARTER

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.808
WITH THE RHINOS IN THE RED ZONE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:11.110
- GOTTA SAY, BILL, I LIKE
WATCHING THESE RHINOS.

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:14.080
- RANSOM TAKES THE SNAP,
DROPS BACK WITH GOOD PROTECTION,

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:16.449
AND THAT'S A COMPLETED PASS
TO A VERY WIDE-OPEN

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:19.318
HINGLE MCCRINGLEBERRY,
THE ROOKIE OUT OF PENN STATE.

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.754
- NICE GRAB BY MCCRINGLEBERRY.
YOU THINK HE'S HAPPY?

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:22.888
- OH, BOY, HE IS LOVING IT
DOWN THERE.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:27.160
- OH, WE GOT SOMETHING
OF A SHOOTING GALLERY GOING ON.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.495
- YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.
BOY, THAT IS SOMETHING, AND--

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:31.464
OH, WAIT, WE'VE GOT
A FLAG THERE.

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:33.399
IS THAT
FOR EXCESSIVE CELEBRATION?

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:34.801
OH, SEE, I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT THAT CALL.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.769
- I DON'T KNOW, BILL.
THAT WAS THREE PUMPS,

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:38.771
AND THE RULEBOOK SAYS
YOU CANNOT HAVE MORE THAN TWO.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.139
- OH, MY GOSH,
BUT LOOK AT THE KID.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:41.307
HE'S PLEADING HIS CASE
WITH THE REF.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.475
PLEADING HIS CASE.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:43.776
- YEAH, CLEARLY THREE PUMPS.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.111
- COACH JOHNSON
DEFINITELY NOT HAPPY

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:46.312
ABOUT THIS CALL.
- TWO PUMPS!

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.281
- FIVE MINUTES
INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER,

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.683
THIRD AND TEN, THE RHINOS AGAIN
THREATENING TO SCORE.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.285
CAN THE COUGARS HOLD THEM?

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:53.820
- BIG PLAY COMING HERE, BILL.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.721
- RANSOM TAKES THE SNAP,
DROPS BACK,

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.824
HE FLOATS ONE
INTO THE END ZONE,

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.792
AND MCCRINGLEBERRY
PULLS IT DOWN.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.394
- HE'S GOT IT.
- OH, MY GOSH.

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:03.763
FOR HIS SECOND TOUCHDOWN
OF THE DAY FOR THIS ROOKIE,

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.598
HE HAS GOTTA BE FEELING GREAT
ABOUT HIMSELF.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.101
- NICELY DONE.
I'LL TELL YOU, MAN, HE'S--

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:10.203
- OH, OH, SEE,
NOW THERE'S TWO PUMPS.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.604
- YEAH, HE'S REALLY TESTING
THE BOUNDARIES,

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:14.373
AND HE'S CLEARLY
GOTTEN THE REF'S ATTENTION HERE.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.409
- A THIRD PUMP WILL DRAW A FLAG
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.444
- [blows whistle]
- SEE--OH, HE JUST DID IT AGAIN.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:20.279
NOW WHAT IS THAT,
THE SECOND TIME?

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:21.514
NOW YOU HAVE
TO FLAG HIM ON THIS.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:23.282
- YEAH, HE HAD TO.
YOU KNOW, BILL,

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:24.584
IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING
SEEING YOUNG PLAYERS

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:25.885
WITHOUT THE ABILITY
TO RESTRAIN THEMSELVES.

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.720
- NO, IT REALLY IS.
IT'S HARD.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.622
- I MEAN, THE REF'S
GONNA GET YOU EVERY TIME.

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:30.857
- YEAH.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.725
SEE, NOW THE REF AGREES
THAT'S THREE PUMPS

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:34.794
RIGHT THERE.

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:37.396
AND THE QUARTERBACK RANSOM
UNDER CENTER.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.298
LAST FIVE MINUTES OF THE GAME.

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:40.833
THE RHINOS
ARE MARCHING HERE AGAIN.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.635
- HARD TO STOP THIS TEAM
FROM SCORING, BILL.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.637
THEY HAVE SO MANY WEAPONS.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.339
- RANSOM TAKES THE SNAP.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.442
AND IT'S A SHOVEL PASS
TO MCCRINGLEBERRY, WHO--

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.910
HE'S AT THE 10.
HE'S AT THE 5.

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:53.479
AND TOUCHDOWN, RHINOS.
- OH, MY.

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.915
GREAT BLOCK BY HARDUNKICHUD,
AND THAT'S GONNA BE

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:58.451
TOUGH FOR THE COUGARS
TO COME BACK FROM.

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:00.653
- BOY, WHAT A CAREER DAY
FROM HINGLE MCCRINGLEBERRY,

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.388
THE ROOKIE OUT OF PENN STATE.

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:04.557
OH, HE WAS JUST AMAZINGLY
FIRED UP HERE TODAY, JIM.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.159
- YOU GOTTA LOVE
THE WAY THIS GUY PLAYS,

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.827
AND HE--
both: OHH.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.296
- SEE, NOW THERE'S ONE PUMP.
- UH-OH.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.231
- I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS KID.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:14.534
- YOU GOT TO PUT YOUR TEAM FIRST
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS,

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:16.369
AND MCKRINGLEBERRY'S
JUST NOT DOING THAT.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.171
- NOW THERE'S TWO.
JEFF, NOW IF HE PUMPS

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.339
A THIRD TIME,
HE WILL DRAW HIS THIRD PENALTY

00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:23.242
FOR TODAY.

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:26.546
EVERYBODY HERE WAITING
WITH BATED BREATH.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.747
- HE DID IT.
- OH, DID HE?

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.348
- YES, HE DID IT.
- OH. THAT'S JUST--

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:31.217
- COULDN'T HELP HIMSELF.
- THAT'S JUST AMAZING.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.252
I MEAN, COME ON,
IN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL--

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:34.554
- IT'S A SHAME.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.855
- YES, YES, IT IS.
- YOU CAN ARGUE ALL YOU WANT,

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:37.323
BUT THE FLAG, WELL,
IT'S BEEN THROWN.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:38.691
- THAT'S RIGHT.
IF IT'S THREE PUMPS,

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:40.226
THE REF'S
NOT GONNA TAKE IT AWAY NOW.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.395
- NO, HE'S NOT.
DURATION AND INTENSITY

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:43.863
DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
- WELL, JEFF, LET'S HAVE A LOOK

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:46.232
AT THE REPLAY HERE
TO SEE IF INDEED HE DID DO

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.434
THE THREE PUMPS.
- ALL RIGHT. NO QUESTION.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.469
THERE IS THE FIRST ONE, RIGHT?
- YEAH. AGREED.

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:52.705
- AND THEN COMING UP

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:53.973
IS THE SECOND ONE.
- OKAY.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:55.341
- YES, VERY CLEAR.

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:56.876
IT'S THE THIRD--
- WE'LL SEE IT.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:57.777
IT'S COMING UP RIGHT HERE.
- I'M JUST NOT SURE.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.911
OH, YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:01.280
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
THREE PUMPS THERE.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.216
- OH.
- UH, APOLOGIES TO ALL

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.483
THOSE WATCHING
WITH YOUNG CHILDREN.

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:05.251
CLEARLY UNINTENTIONAL.
