00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.850
Vince Cable: Well, thanks for asking me to
this amazing place you've got.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.459
I'm afraid I feel a bit like an extraterrestrial,
who sort of wandered in from the world of

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:19.990
ties and suits, where people still write in
pen and ink, and things of that kind.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.000
But, actually, maybe that's a good place to
start, because I think one of the problems

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.210
with this crisis is that we all thought we'd
got to the end of history somehow.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.840
And nobody remembered what had happened before
with our economy.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.500
We'd got into some brave new world where there
are no more booms and busts.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.940
And one of the themes of that book which I've
written -- and I've seen a few people with

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.800
them on their laps, which is a good sign -- is
that you can learn an awful lot from what's

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.289
happened historically.
If you go back to the 18th century, Britain

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:03.449
has had regular booms and busts in the housing
market, approximately every 18 years.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.930
It's almost like a metronome.
And people always forget, and they always

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.490
assume that prices will just go up forever.
But they don't.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.150
They boom, they bust, they boom, they bust.
And yet, we had a government, a banking industry,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.720
central bankers, regulators, who just assumed
history away.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.610
And if you look at the way banks perform -- I
mean, what's this extraordinary paroxysm that

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.330
we've been through -- we've been through it
before, over and over and over again.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:44.660
The best description that I've encountered
of this present credit crunch is found in

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.770
the pages of John Stuart Mill, who described
banking collapses in the earlier part of the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.940
19th century -- how they're caused, how they
peak, and what happens afterwards, i.e. the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.159
credit crunch.
Beautifully described, almost to the detail

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.020
of what's happened now.
So, you know, there are lessons from the past.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:15.370
We're not in a fundamentally different era.
But, if I can change my metaphors a bit, try

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.879
to capture what I think has happened and where
we are, the image I use -- and some of you

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.769
may have heard me use this before, but I think
it's a reasonably good one -- that the British

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.430
economy in the last two years has had a massive
heart attack, in effect.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.840
I mean, clearly, in post-war era, we've had
periods of booms and busts, we've had flu,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.269
we've had excitements of various kind.
But what's happened this time is a really

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.849
big attack.
But -- and this is the positive side of it,

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.499
you know -- the patient has survived.
The patient is in Intensive Care Unit, still

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:02.540
breathing, showing signs of life, thinking
about what happens when they go home from

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.090
hospital.
But, it is in the hospital, it's had a very

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.180
bad heart attack, and it's survived because
of extraordinary modern economic medicine.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.150
I said, well, there are historical precedents.
But what's been applied this time -- mainly

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.329
due to the insights of a handful of people
led by the Governor of the Federal Reserve

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:32.779
in the United States, Ben Bernanke -- is a
cocktail of extremely powerful economic drugs

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:37.599
that have kept the patient going.
And it's a combination of drastic cuts in

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.689
interest rates, the use of what's called 'monetary
easing' -- quantitative easing -- the deliberate

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:52.989
creation of credit, vast, vast budget deficits,
the nationalization or semi-nationalization

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:00.840
of banks, and -- in the case of the U.K -- a
very hefty devaluation, 25, 30 percent, depending

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.290
whether you're talking about the Euro or the
dollar.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.829
Now, all those thing together have had an
impact -- of course they have -- and the patient

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.239
is now showing signs of life.
But there is a big question about, What happens

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.269
after a heart attack? And I'll come back to
that in a moment.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.440
But, before going on to what happens next,
let me just try and break down the attack

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.610
into its component parts, because it's quite
a complicated economic phenomenon that we've

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.600
been living through.
Different things have been happening and interacting.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.341
The first thing which happened was that there
was a massive asset bubble in our economy

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:44.870
 -- also in the United States, in Spain, Ireland
 -- but very much in the U.K.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.630
An extraordinary bubble in asset prices, particularly
property prices.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.230
And, as I say, there are historical trends,
which you could have seen this coming.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:02.820
But it happened, it reached its peak, roughly
two years ago -- 18 months ago -- and has

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.310
since burst.
And I was talking this morning to the commercial

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.090
property industry.
There, industry's asset values have gone down

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.390
by 35, 40 percent.
Domestic property prices haven't yet in the

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.570
U.K.
gone down anything like the extent to which

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.160
they should have done.
Now, there is a big question about whether

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.410
that's an interrupt in process or whether
something very funny is happening in the property

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.550
market.
But we've had a big asset bubble, it's burst,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.730
it's burst spectacularly in commercial property.
It's also burst spectacularly in the States.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.510
Residential property prices have gone down
30, 40 percent averaging over the States.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.690
Of course, it varies.
And that has fed back into the banking system.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.840
And one of the reasons the banks got into
trouble was because they overinvested in risky

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.070
property transactions.
H Boss went down because of commercial property.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.890
Bradford &amp; Bingley because of "Buy-to-let."
All banks because of mortgage lending.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.700
So that's the first element -- the asset bubble
that burst.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.210
The second element was the collapse of the
banks.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.830
And it's a remarkable phenomenon.
I try to describe it in the book.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.740
But I don't think any of us have quite got
our heads around the fact that this extraordinarily

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.910
sophisticated banking system, full of very,
very clever people -- and extremely clever

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.950
people, the brightest people of their generation
 -- could have produced an industry that just

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.440
collapsed like a pack of cards.
And there is an important question as to why

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.010
this happened.
Why was it allowed to happen? What were the

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:49.120
dynamics of it?
I'm simplifying a very complicated story.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.050
And I think the two key elements in the failure
of the banking system: One was excessive complexity

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:03.610
 -- complexity which outstripped the capacity
of the managers, the bankers themselves, to

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.830
understand the products they were dealing
with -- combined with extraordinary leverage.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.400
You know, the big investment banks with a
gearing ratio of 50, you know?

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.280
Loan to equity. Unbelievable.
And this was regarded as a viable business

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.600
model until it collapsed.
But what essentially was going on was that,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:33.080
within the banking industry, the industry
was lending subprime borrowers in the United

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.640
States -- low-income families.
And they thought they were doing good -- but

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.520
that's a sort of micro-story, the mortgage
lending to those -- subprime lending.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.390
What was important about it wasn't that it
did that lending -- and that happens -- was

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:54.400
that the loans were sold.
You got the phenomenon that was called 'securitization'.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.000
Loans were marketed.
The link between the lenders and their clients

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.640
was broken because of this new kind of monetization
of credit products.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.220
And they were sold.
And they were sold again and sold again and

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:17.400
spliced and diced in very, very complex combinations.
And very, very clever people were hired in

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.510
order to create these products.
I don't need to go into the technicalities

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:29.480
of it, but just as a little anecdote that
illustrates it: My youngest son was a mathematician

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.770
at Cambridge -- four or five years ago, five
or six years ago -- and all the people at

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:40.250
the top of the faculty were approached by
bankers and said, "Look, you want to come

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.420
work for us?
50K to start, 100K at the end of the year.”

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:50.080
You know, my son -- like most of his contemporaries
 -- knew absolutely nothing about money.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.560
I mean, a lovely guy, but managing a bank
account was way beyond -- you know, being

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.430
invited to join the banking industry and produce
rocket-science products.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:05.430
And, of course, the industry lost track of
the underlying assets which they had on their

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.770
books.
And there's a very powerful image, which is

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.210
used in a book by somebody called Jillian
Tett -- I don't know whether you've seen her

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:19.990
stuff -- writes for the Financial Times beautifully,
and produced, I think, probably the best book

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.460
on the crisis.
And she says, "The way to think about this

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:29.340
is, It's a bit like a sausage factory.
What the big banks were doing -- or at least

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.120
certainly through their investment banking
operations -- they were operating like a sausage

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.670
factory, which bought in meat from abattoirs
all over the place, who in turn brought in

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:46.440
meat from hundreds or thousands of farmers.
And they chewed this stuff up and padded out

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:53.290
the sausage, put skins around it, made money
as manufacturers, sold it into a willing consumer

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.450
market -- everybody likes sausages.
And it was a great industry, and a lot of

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.310
people made money out of it.
Until, suddenly, somebody uttered the dreaded

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.660
words "BSC".
And you know, What happens when somebody says

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.660
"BSC" you know?
Where's the cow?

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.000
Where are the bad cows?
How are we going to get the stuff off the

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.510
shelves?
Nobody knew where it was -- all mixed up.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:20.370
And you know, when the panic started to spread,
the banks no longer trusted each other, because

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:26.480
they didn't know where the bad debts were.
You got a complete collapse of trust in the

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.140
system.
And markets can't function without trust.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:34.751
And they eventually dried up and you got to
the point, which the Governor of the Bank

00:10:34.751 --> 00:10:40.360
of England described last week -- I think
it was last week -- as, "24 hours from the

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.990
complete collapse of the whole banking system,"
because banks no longer trusted each other

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.480
to lend overnight.
It had got to that stage.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.450
And that was the point at which governments
had to intervene and prevent complete and

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:59.270
total meltdown.
So in a very, very abbreviated way, that was

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.880
what happened in the banking system.
Of course, there are many ramifications of

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.310
it.
So those are two elements: The asset bubble

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:10.260
and the banking collapse.
And the third element -- which to some extent

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:16.100
was a consequence of those two things -- was
a classic recession.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:22.100
Consumers stopped spending last October, November.
They turned on the ten o'clock news -- Robert

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:28.240
Peston -- everybody getting into a blind panic.
People in this country started worrying about

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:35.060
their consumer debts, big mortgages.
And it's worth remembering that the U.K. household

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:41.570
debts in relation to people's incomes is the
highest in the developed world, and probably

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:46.240
higher than at any stage in our history.
And people started looking at their domestic

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.540
balance sheets and panicking and stopped spending.
And then, that triggered a recession, fed

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.140
through into the retail sector.
Retail ____ have probably contracted by 20

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.190
percent.
You know, Woolworth's, or the more visible

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:03.180
bits of it.
That fed through into the supply chains -- manufacturing,

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.930
services, your advertisers, the lot.
Spread overseas into the exporting countries

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.830
 -- China initially.
Japan and Germany were all hit very badly,

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.680
because the big consuming markets -- the United
States particularly, in some sense ourselves

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.910
 -- started contracting.
And so, it became global.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:27.990
So you had all these three things feeding
into each other -- asset market failure, banking

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:34.750
collapse, recession -- reinforcing each other.
And it was a massive attack.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.810
Massive attack.
We hadn't seen anything on the scale since

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:46.950
'29, the Great Crash, the Interwar period.
But, unlike the crash of the Interwar period,

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:53.730
this has not -- at least, so far, and I think
probably hasn't -- proved fatal.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.830
Two big reasons for that.
First of all, governments and central banks

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.860
got it right broadly.
The intervention that our government -- I'm

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.610
not making a party point here, because that's
not in my interest to do it -- but the government

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:11.440
broadly got it right.
The emergency intervention last October was

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.930
correct -- what had to happen.
And of course, the central banks were the

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.830
driving force behind it, unlike in the 30's
when governments sat back and watched the

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.480
crisis develop until it was too late.
And the other thing which happened this time

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.152
 -- and something you'll intuitively understand,
because you're part of the global industry

00:13:30.152 --> 00:13:36.029
 -- is that, although there were a lot of
nationalistic instincts around the place,

00:13:36.029 --> 00:13:41.680
broadly speaking, governments realized that
they had to hang together rather than hang

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.779
separately.
You got a cooperative response.

00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:48.920
Everybody played ball with some grumbling.
The Germans didn't want to be dragged into

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.830
big, fiscal deficits.
Chinese and Americans blaming each other to

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.470
some extent.
But at the end of the day, they got down to

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.680
it and worked together.
And that's been the remarkable outcome of

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.230
this crisis.
That you actually had governments -- many

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:08.970
of which hate each other -- actually cooperating
and dealing with it in a collaborative way.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:14.210
And those two things have -- I think to a
large extent -- saved the day.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:19.779
But the question is, you know, Where do we
go from here?

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:22.400
I'm trying to describe how we got here and
what's happening.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.279
But, Where do we go from here?
Particularly in -- I'll start with the U.K.

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:31.580
There's been a big switch in mood in the last
few months.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:37.690
Instead of kind of 'manic depression', we've
now got into the kind of 'hyperphase'.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.940
You know, recovery, green shoots, all that
stuff.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:46.339
And it is justified to have some degree of
return of confidence.

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:49.310
But I would caution against getting carried
away.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:54.800
There are all kind of factors that are dragging
the U.K. economy back.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.770
Consumers, heavily indebted, are going to
spend many years de-leveraging, getting their

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.130
domestic balance sheets back into some sort
of order.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:11.040
So, you're not going to get big spending splurges.
The monetary steroids -- that have been keeping

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.130
the patient alive -- are going to be withdrawn
in the next year or so.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:21.820
They can't just keep pumping in artificially
 -- injections -- into the monetary system,

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.320
because otherwise, you then pile up trouble
further down the line.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.850
So there's got to be an exit strategy from
that, and we don't know how the patient will

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.240
respond.
The British economic recovery depends very

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:41.589
heavily on exports and import -- competing
industries, because they've had a big boost

00:15:41.589 --> 00:15:47.850
from the devaluation, which is why the tourist
industry, for example, is doing well.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:52.940
Some manufacturers are doing very well.
But a lot of the export boost -- if that's

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:58.160
what it is -- depends on the rest of the world.
And it is certainly true that, in many parts

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.810
of the world, this whole thing is bottoming
out.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:08.810
Maybe in France, Germany, we're not absolutely
sure, but they seem to be getting on the level.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.830
The United States, probably some sort of recovery
next year.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:20.209
And India and China are just roaring away.
So all those things together suggest that

00:16:20.209 --> 00:16:24.170
you are getting external recovery as well
as internal recovery.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:30.720
That may help the exports to grow.
So that's the one thing that we can seize

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.310
upon.
The other big downer, unfortunately, is the

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.040
government.
The government has -- to a very substantial

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.610
extent -- been keeping the British economy
going through public spending and public capital

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.839
investment.
That is not going to continue. Not going to

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:54.490
continue.
The big debate in U.K. politics, which I'm

00:16:54.490 --> 00:17:01.339
part of, is how we deal with the fact that
we've now got horrendous government borrowing.

00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:05.329
I don't want to be moralistic about it.
I think the government had to borrow heavily

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:12.740
in a recession -- and I have a separate argument
with the Tories about this -- but they had

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.309
to do it.
But we now have an enormous borrowing requirement.

00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:22.430
Let's just reflect just to why that's happened
and how it's happened.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:28.890
British tax revenue has collapsed.
The share of the British economy in the form

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:35.870
of taxation is now about 35 percent.
That's lower than at any time since I was

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:41.510
a child -- Harold MacMillan's day.
And basically, you may not feel like it, but

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:47.179
you live in a low-tax economy -- not achieved
by design, but simply because a key element

00:17:47.179 --> 00:17:51.850
of the tax base has disappeared, which is
the financial sector and, to some extent,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.960
the housing market.
So you've had a collapse of tax revenue -- not

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.100
just because of the recession, but because
structurally, some of the key elements of

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.500
tax revenue have gone.
So you've got a collapse of tax revenue and

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.929
you've got government spending continuing
to rise.

00:18:08.929 --> 00:18:13.929
You know, recession -- more people unemployed,
government charging in -- trying to prop up

00:18:13.929 --> 00:18:17.500
the housing market, trying to prop up the
car industry, all those things.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:23.840
So government spending continuing to rise
to what -- 48, 49, 50 percent of GDP.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.730
So the difference between what it's spending
and what it's getting in tax is about 13,

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.799
14 percent of GDP.
It is an astronomic figure by most standards.

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:36.710
And that's now having to be borrowed in money
markets.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:41.980
At the moment, it isn't a problem.
The markets are perfectly happy to lend to

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.390
the British government and the Americans,
who've got similar deficits, less structural,

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:51.000
but the Americans have got a similar scale,
because absolute terms it's much bigger, because

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.820
America is a bigger economy.
Both the two, big, Anglo-Saxon countries borrowing

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:01.559
massively from financial markets.
They're happy to do it at the moment, borrowing

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:06.940
very cheaply, two percent rio, you know, it's
not a big deal.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:16.070
But the worry is that sometime, down the track,
markets will look at the U.K. and say, "Well,

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.210
is this a viable model?”
You know, you can't just keep borrowing like

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.750
this.
Debt piles up. Debt service grows.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.200
There is then an adjustment. Their interest
rates go up.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.450
That, in turn, pushes up your debt servicing.
It then becomes very, very serious.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:37.600
And that's why the political debate has now
switched on to this whole issue of cuts, or

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.550
taxes -- do it two ways.
But the significance of it -- from what I'm

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:48.210
saying -- is that nobody believes now that
the government can continue to drive the economy

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.750
through spending and investment. It can't.
It's going to have a negative effect.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.340
So the question then is, Where is this growth
going to come from?

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.000
And I've been down the list.
And apart from exports, it's difficult to

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.650
see.
So, the outcome of that analysis would be,

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.669
"Yeah, you know, recovery?
Sure.”

00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:14.410
Plenty of signs of returning confidence, but
fairly anemic.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.380
I don't want to get into the forecasting arguments
about whether it's 'double-dip recessions'

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:23.679
or 'flattening out' and so on.
But, I mean, you get the trend of my argument.

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:27.010
So that's all I really want to say about where
we are and where we're going from here.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:34.470
I just want to finish up with flagging up
some of the big, difficult, long-term issues

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.150
that we've got to try and face coming out
of this crisis.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:44.160
The first one, I've sort of half touched on
already, which is what kind of economic structure

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:49.049
this country's going to have five, ten years,
20 years down the track.

00:20:49.049 --> 00:20:52.260
I mean, How is the British economy going to
change?

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.750
It's very clear that we became over-dependent
on financial services -- not that all financial

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.000
services are a bad thing. Clearly, they're
not.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.400
And many of the things that are happening
in the City are very useful.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:09.850
But we became over-dependent on a source of
revenue growth -- employment tax revenue -- that

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:14.720
was just too unstable.
And then, we were almost in the position of

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.500
Iceland -- not quite as extreme, but over-dependent
on the banking sector.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.201
So, relatively speaking, that's going to have
to contract.

00:21:24.201 --> 00:21:30.160
So what's going to grow in its place?
Well, new forms of trade-able activities and

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:36.130
manufacturing -- not necessarily metal-bashing,
but industry in the widest sense, including

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.500
creative industries.
That's the space that's going to have to be

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.870
occupied.
That raises questions about whether, as a

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:48.510
country, we've got the skills, the education,
to make it happen.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:53.770
That's where we have to start looking.
Second big question is, What do you do about

00:21:53.770 --> 00:22:01.390
this very big, financial sector that's fouled
up seriously -- caused a lot of damage?

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:06.530
And here, I think -- although the government
was broadly right last October -- they have

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:12.040
completely taken their eyes off the ball.
Haven't focused, for example, on how you make

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.240
sure that the banks that have been rescued
 -- make sure that capital gets out to solvent

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.460
companies.
A lot of companies are still going by the

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:24.710
ball, because the banks have stopped lending.
They've lurched from, you know, ludicrously

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.540
excessive lending to ultra-conservative lending.
The government, in my view, should have stepped

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.610
in and smoothed it out.
But they have a complicated problem because

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.870
of the role of regulation.
But it's not worked.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:42.630
But looking beyond that, How do we make sure
that the big banks are structured in such

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.740
a way that they don't destabilize the British
economy anymore?

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:51.990
And let's not forget, Britain is the center
for the world's big banks.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:57.419
Three out of the five biggest banks of the
world, in balance sheet terms, were British

00:22:57.419 --> 00:23:02.291
in the run-up to this crisis.
RBS -- which is the biggest bank in the world

00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:06.080
 -- went down.
Barclay's just survived.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:13.160
HSBC floated away reasonably comfortably,
having been very well-managed.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.820
Lloyds, another very big bank, has gone down
 -- dragged down by H Boss.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.950
So we've had a very, very big banking sector
 -- exceptionally large banking sector -- and

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:27.309
the question is how you restructure.
Lots of technical arguments here.

00:23:27.309 --> 00:23:33.540
But my very simple view is that we can not
continue to have the situation where you have

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:40.330
very, very large banks, which take big risks
in their international activity, which then,

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.809
when they overreach themselves, have to be
underwritten by the British taxpayer.

00:23:43.809 --> 00:23:49.860
We can't allow this situation to happen again.
And that means, probably, we're going to have

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:55.600
to have a dual system where you have, on the
one hand, competitive banks -- that don't

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.530
depend on taxpayer support -- go out and do
their own thing, hedge funds or whatever -- take

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:06.460
risks -- commercial, business-minded, purely
private sector.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.260
They can stand or fail by their own competitive
performance.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:16.690
And then, on the other hand, you have utilities,
which are run and regulated like water companies,

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:21.789
which don't take risks, -- except on a kind
of microlevel with small business -- are run

00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:29.490
very safely, provide credit to normal business
customers, take your deposits, and operate

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:34.950
in a very traditional, conservative way.
I think that has to be the clear separation

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:41.280
at some point in the next few years.
So that's the second question.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.070
How do you sort out the financial sector?
I don't think the government's even begun,

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.950
really, to get to grips with that.
And the third and the final point I want to

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.960
make and I'll finish on this now.
I think the one major thing that's affected

00:24:53.960 --> 00:25:00.679
the world in all this is that, it's changed
the center of gravity of the world economy

00:25:00.679 --> 00:25:05.820
in a quite radical way.
Until this crisis, it became part of the conventional

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:10.910
wisdom that China and India were becoming
major powers.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:18.110
Their GNP, measured in purchasing power terms,
put them right up at the top.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:21.780
China -- before the crisis -- was the second
biggest economy in the world.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.140
India probably the fourth, if you measure
it properly.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:30.640
You know, we all taught about this.
But I don't think -- until this crisis happened

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:36.330
 -- we've quite realized how important these
countries are economically.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:41.740
I remember, only a few years ago, the Governor
of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, coming back and

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.179
saying on television, "Don't get so excited
about China.

00:25:45.179 --> 00:25:51.270
It's only got an economy the size of Belgium.”
You begin to realize it's taken an awful long

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.390
time to call on board what's happening in
the real world.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:59.770
You know, these are very big countries with
very big economies that make a big difference.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:06.440
And when they move, they move big, and they
suck in vast amounts of oil and commodities.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.620
China was pumping out vast quantities of cheap
manufacturers.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.559
That was what was giving us the illusion of
low inflation.

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:17.500
It wasn't really low inflation, because the
inflation was in the property market.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.770
So these countries have been making waves
for a very long time -- or at least certainly

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:25.840
for the last two decades.
And what's happened now is that, whereas the

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.750
Western economies have stalled and stalled
very badly -- and will probably lag behind

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:35.500
now for several years till we get out of this
mess -- the Chinese and Indian economies are

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.410
storming ahead.
What's happened in China is extraordinarily.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:44.539
They've applied classic Keynesian methods.
They were worried about a recession.

00:26:44.539 --> 00:26:49.120
They have pumped vast amounts of money into
infrastructure, trying to get their consumers

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.830
spending.
You know, things could go wrong there.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.990
They could have problems -- political problems.
But, as it looks at present, they're going

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:03.160
to grow very rapidly.
And the gap between China and the States is

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:08.090
going to close much more quickly than we have
thought possible -- and between India, and

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.971
the other developed countries, is going to
close.

00:27:09.971 --> 00:27:14.900
So the whole center of gravity is changing.
Therefore, the decision-making about the world

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.210
economy is changing.
And these guys, quite rightly, insisting that

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:23.070
they want to be at the top table deciding
the way the world is run.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.039
And the significance of the meeting last week
is, de facto, they're there.

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:33.570
And they're now calling the shots.
And that's the big strategic change that's

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.790
happened and which this crisis has really,
really reinforced.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:44.890
So thank you. Any questions? That's all I
want to say.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.810
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:27:46.810 --> 00:28:02.240
Q Hi. I just wanted to know what you thought
the role of the FSA was?

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.590
Vince Cable: The role of the FSA?

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:08.240
Q Whether it was to blame at all?

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.230
Vince Cable: Yeah. Well, they made a terrible
mess of supervising the banks, you know.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:18.240
And they have more or less put their hands
up and acknowledged that.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.390
I think there is sort of a bit of a myth that
there wasn't any regulation of the banks.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.610
There was. There was some quite extensive
regulation.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:31.059
There were regulators crawling over the banks,
but they didn't supervise them.

00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:34.539
Slightly different -- regulation, supervision
 -- not quite the same.

00:28:34.539 --> 00:28:41.190
The supervision of the banks was negligent.
And we had the problem with Northern Rock

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.260
 -- which they didn't see coming, although
there were plenty of warnings about it.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.789
There were plenty of warnings about H Boss,
and they disregarded it.

00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:55.570
So they made a complete hash of that.
But I think it's fair to say that the FSA,

00:28:55.570 --> 00:29:00.480
under Lord Turner, has acknowledged their
weaknesses, is now recruiting better staff,

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.910
reorienting them, learning from the past.
One of my main quarrels with Mr. Rosenbaum's

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:11.080
approach to this is, I think that now that
they've learned their lessons, the worst possible

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.450
thing to do is to embark on a big, bureaucratic
restructuring.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:20.250
You don't need to put the FSA in with the
Bank of England.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:25.490
The Governor of the Bank of England needs
to have overall oversight of everything to

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:33.540
do with risk in the system -- systemic risk.
But the bread-and-butter operations of regulating

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:39.210
building societies and insurance companies
is an FSA matter and should be left alone.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:46.200
And if what happens is what Mr. Osborne is
saying, as I understand it, the teams of people

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.950
 -- who are now working on, for example, regulating
the insurance industry -- will be split in

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:54.470
two.
And there will be one lot that will go off

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:58.370
and look at systemic risk.
And another lot will go off and look at consumer

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.350
protection.
And there will be a lot of uncertainty and

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:06.750
a lot of people watching their backs.
And precisely, at this time, when we've really

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:11.580
got to get on top of the financial system
and start looking at it properly, we're going

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:16.840
to have a hiatus of a year, 18 months, whatever
 -- everybody decides who is doing what job.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840
It's not helpful.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:34.500
Q You talk about sort of splitting financial
industry into two -- into sort of a utility

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.500
part and a part that's able to do -- takes
bigger risks, has hedge funds, and so on.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.500
Isn't there a risk that all the customers
are going to go to the hedge fund half of

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.020
the industry, and then, when it collapses
next time, it needs to be bailed out, because

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:45.140
everyone's borrowed money from it, and so
on?

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:51.559
Vince Cable: There is a risk, and what I'm
suggesting is not the perfect answer.

00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:57.940
The point will be made against what I said
that some of the problems in the banking system

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:03.250
were not caused by the high-rollers in the
so-called 'casinos', but they were caused

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:11.059
by ordinary mortgage lending in Northern Rock
that was completely berserk, by fairly mundane

00:31:11.059 --> 00:31:15.820
commercial property lending by H Boss in Scotland.
That's what really derailed H Boss.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:20.730
So some people would argue -- and I don't
think this is your point -- that you can't

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:25.429
just artificially separate banking into the
high-risk bit and the low-risk bit.

00:31:25.429 --> 00:31:30.030
It's not quite as simple as that.
And there is certainly a danger -- of the

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:37.710
point that you make -- that all these regulated,
but free enterprise, hedge funds could also

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.540
go belly up, and somebody might need to do
something about it.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.750
I don't think there's a perfect answer to
that.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:50.840
But the issue was raised ten years ago by
a man called Cruickshank, who produced a very

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:57.400
perceptive report about British banking.
And he said, "Look, the problem here."

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.220
And he warned -- I mean, it was the first
real warning that was given that, "There's

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.250
a real problem here.
The British banks are making returns on capital

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:10.740
that are far in excess of what you'd expect
in a low-risk industry.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:16.600
Something odd about this.
And it's odd, because these are companies

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.909
that are all underwritten by the taxpayer.
So something has to happen.

00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:27.230
Either they're set free of the taxpayer and
forced to compete -- go down.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:34.350
Or we just accept that the banking industry
is an, essentially, state industry.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:40.000
And it's got to be run by -- and for -- the
taxpayer, one or two levels removed.”

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.679
And he posed that problem.
The government clearly found that too difficult

00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:46.030
to handle.
They didn't want a confrontation with the

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.029
bankers.
They let it go.

00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:54.929
It may be that you're right and that my approach
of just splitting the thing down the middle

00:32:54.929 --> 00:32:59.110
doesn't work.
But if it doesn't work, then actually, what

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:05.700
we would have to argue for is much, much tighter
regulation of the whole lot.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.850
But I'm trying to get a middle way.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:19.460
Q I really got two questions.
For this two-system approach to work, wouldn't

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:25.571
we need global agreement for it to happen?
And I guess, to use your analogy of the patient,

00:33:25.571 --> 00:33:31.419
Isn't it inevitable -- as we develop better,
more sophisticated drugs -- the patient is

00:33:31.419 --> 00:33:36.090
going to push themselves harder, so eventually,
to the point of breaking?

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:40.240
Isn't that just human nature?
Especially, brute human nature?

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:46.659
Vince Cable: Well, yes. I mean, that's a rather
fatalistic conclusion.

00:33:46.659 --> 00:33:49.770
And, you know, and there are people who are
arguing that.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:54.490
They say, "Well, what's the point of bringing
in more regulation, because the guys will

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:59.140
find a way around it?
They're clever and driven by greed, or whatever.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.400
And you can't stop it. That's the way people
are.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.990
So what's the point, you know? Let it all
happen again.”

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:09.520
You know? And I just think that's the counsel
of despair, actually.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:14.740
We do have to try to make the system better,
while understanding there will be people out

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:19.669
there who are constantly trying to find a
way of breaking through -- breaking the rules.

00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:22.169
I mean, you have this in your own industry,
right?

00:34:22.169 --> 00:34:25.899
You're an innovative industry, moving very
fast.

00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:28.940
You've got regulators who are trying to catch
up with you.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.070
And it's very much the same in banking.
The problem is, I don't think you can destroy

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:37.220
the world economy -- maybe you can -- but
in the way that the bankers have been able

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.859
to, or almost.
So we have to try -- though you're absolutely

00:34:40.859 --> 00:34:47.220
right that, particularly in a free enterprise
system, there are limits to what regulation

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.639
can do to restrain seriously damaging behavior.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:35:00.670
Q So you said we were 24 hours away from the
banking system going into complete global

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:01.670
meltdown.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:04.060
Vince Cable: That's how it looked in the U.K.
yeah.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:09.380
Q So, I just wondered, What could have actually
happened and how bad things could have actually

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.320
gone? What 'meltdown' actually means?

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.359
Vince Cable: Well, I don't want to be too
flesh-creeping.

00:35:14.359 --> 00:35:21.250
I mean, I think the way the government or
the bank described it, you know, that kind

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:24.290
of the ATM system would probably just have
stopped working for awhile.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:29.961
You know, banks would have just ceased to
function for awhile.

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:37.400
But, in that kind of environment, governments
just step in and do it.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:43.890
The idea that we would have returned to some
kind of Stone Age -- it would never have happened.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:48.270
But if it would have been allowed to continue,
it would have been really horrific.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.560
And of course, other banks would have collapsed
 -- not just IBS.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.619
You know.
Some of the others that were near the edge

00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:53.619
would have gone over too.

00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:54.619
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:58.460
Q Where there's very low interest rates and
the government's pumped a lot of money into

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:13.530
the system, what's your view on the risk that
this will create another bout of serious inflation

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:16.090
and a second very-serious debt?

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.720
Vince Cable: The question -- I don't know
whether it was heard at the back -- was about

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:25.640
whether there is a danger of return to inflation.
I think the professional assessment at the

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.490
moment is that the risks of that happening
are very low.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:35.690
That there is a greater risk, at the moment,
of lurching back into deflation; in other

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:41.880
words, falling prices.
The one scenario that has horrified the central

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:47.390
bankers and governments too is that we do
get into a world of falling prices, falling

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:51.680
output, falling wages.
You know, we've seen that in past episodes

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.750
in history.
We have been on the edge of that.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.640
I think it's actually true at the moment that
prices are falling.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:02.099
I haven't seen the latest indicators.
It depends which measure you use.

00:37:02.099 --> 00:37:10.190
And that is a very dangerous world, because
if prices start to fall seriously and systemically,

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:16.160
then the real value of people's debt and company's
debt, of course, grows.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:23.530
And that increases the extent to which you
are trapped in a 'debt deflation', as it's

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:27.140
called.
And governments and central banks have been

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:33.020
desperate to make sure that doesn't happen.
There is a risk of overreacting.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.530
There is a risk of that happening.
There's very little sign of it happening.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:43.640
And I think, the central banks -- including
our own Bank of England -- are acutely conscious

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:49.240
that, you know, this is a latent problem.
And, if it started to become apparent, they

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:56.300
would react quickly with interest rate increases.
So I think the sequence of events has been

00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:00.640
properly thought through.
There is a bigger danger in the longer run

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:06.710
than the one you described.
It isn't that there's an accidental spillover

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:12.380
into inflation, but that governments take
the view that they've got such problems managing

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:18.490
public debt that it would be easier to let
inflation rip to wipe it out.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:23.869
This is what's happened in the past.
The British government debt after the Second

00:38:23.869 --> 00:38:30.490
World War in relation to our economy was far,
far bigger than it is today. Far bigger.

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:34.890
It was after the First World War.
It was in much of the 19th century.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:40.810
And these things were dealt with through inflation.
Governments let inflation wipe out past debt.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:47.000
And I think some people worry that this is
a big temptation in future.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
The one restraint on that temptation is that
the Bank of England is now independent.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.800
It has an inflation target.
And I can't see any government publicly saying

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.990
to the Bank of England, "We want you guys
to run higher inflation.”

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:09.910
Don't see it. Politically, it couldn't happen,
I don't think.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:20.041
Q With Mr. Osborne's star waning and broad,
cross-party support and respect for your insight,

00:39:20.041 --> 00:39:25.910
do you think there's a good chance that you
accept the offer to be the inevitable, next,

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.410
Conservative Parliament's chancellor?

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:28.610
Vince Cable: No. No.

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:29.610
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:34.500
Vince Cable: The system doesn't work like
that.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:40.630
It's not like football, you know, where you
have an agent and you go off from Man U to

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:44.390
Man City. It's not like that.
I mean, we have parties.

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:49.280
We work as parties. We are loyal to our teams,
actually.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.480
I mean, there is real loyalty and commitment.
And we're elected as Lib Dems or Conservatives.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.750
And we stick with our people -- unless you
have a civil war as happened in the later

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:02.480
party in the early 80's.
But, you know, we stick with our people.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.910
So it's not a question of my going off and
doing something.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:11.130
It's a question about what the combination
of parties is after the next election and

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:15.640
what comes out of that.
But that's not for us to decide. The public

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.720
decides that.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.760
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:30.440
Q Can you guys hear? Okay.
So I have a few friends who are working for

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:35.230
the brokerage places.
And whenever I chat with them, they're, "Yeah.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:38.510
It's pretty much back to business as usual.”
They're doing the expensive lunches and having

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:42.440
a lot of fun.
Is it possible that the country tries to ignore

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:49.710
this and kind of reset to the way it was?
Like, could that even happen?

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:50.870
Or, has so much damage been done that it's
actually impossible?

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.020
Vince Cable: I didn't quite hear all of it.
But were you just saying there's a potential

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.400
danger of return to the same behavior that
caused the problem?

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.099
Was that the question? Yeah.
I think there is, you know.

00:41:01.099 --> 00:41:05.450
And I meet an awful lot of people in the financial
community.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:09.320
And it's a year ago, but you know, a year
ago is a century ago.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.329
But life's getting back to normal, and Why
shouldn't they get back to normal?

00:41:13.329 --> 00:41:20.310
And, you know, there were people who warned
 -- philosophically and practically -- about

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:26.790
the dangers of a bank rescue.
That it's a so-called problem of "moral hazard.”

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:34.079
There was a 19th century philosopher called
Herbert Spencer who was a follower of Darwin.

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:38.830
And he produced, what I thought, was the most
pungent definition of 'moral hazard'.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:47.020
He said, "If fools are allowed to profit from
their folly, we populate the world with fools."

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:52.730
And that, in a way, could happen in the financial
system.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:56.240
People who've been rescued say, "Okay, fine.
That's good.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.599
If we get into trouble again, we'll go rescue
it again.

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:03.350
Let's push things to the edge.”
And there is a real, real danger of that happening.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:08.860
That's why the government has to be much more
aggressive, I think, on the bonus culture

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:13.849
and so on, than it has been.
Because it's so very easy to slide back into

00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:17.070
bad habits, knowing that someone else is eventually
going to pick up the pieces for you.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.940
Q What is going on in the U.K. domestic property?

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.329
Vince Cable: Sorry?

00:42:24.329 --> 00:42:32.020
Q Sorry. What is going on at the moment in
the U.K. domestic property market?

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.140
Vince Cable: You're talking about commercial
or residential?

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.140
Q Residential.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:38.230
Vince Cable: I don't know. It's a strange
phenomenon what's happening in residential

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:43.089
property.
There was a lot of analysis done before the

00:42:43.089 --> 00:42:50.809
crash -- the I.M.F. and others -- who suggested
that, on any reasonable assessment of fundamentals

00:42:50.809 --> 00:42:57.730
 -- fundamentals being supply and demand and
the relationship of price to people's incomes,

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:02.200
because that's what determines what you can
borrow.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:08.260
The British domestic property market was probably
30 percent overvalued. Probably.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:13.090
And we know from previous episodes in history
that, when you get a market correction, it

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:21.490
goes more than that before it stabilizes.
So there is a question, "Why hasn't that happened?”

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:27.070
It has happened in a few parts of the country.
You've had a really big crash in some of the

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:32.089
East Midlands cities.
In the middle of Manchester -- middle of Leeds

00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:37.270
 -- where you've got these big blocks of flats
which, you know, the developers can't sell,

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:41.940
and that's driven down the price.
But it hasn't happened in London, except in

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.810
little pockets.
Now, there are two theories about it.

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:50.980
One is that it's just a matter of time that
this correction will happen.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:58.390
That, at the moment, the market is being artificially
sustained by the fact that, you know, property

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:05.530
is being withheld, and there isn't the supply
and this is artificially creating stable prices

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:11.411
in the short run. That's one view.
The other view is that, you know, something

00:44:11.411 --> 00:44:16.320
fundamental has changed.
You know, make up of families, migration,

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.730
have created supply and demand at a different
level.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:26.230
And I'm not a forecaster, let alone a forecaster
in property markets.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:31.050
My hunch is that it's the former rather than
the latter, but I'm certainly not in the business

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.850
of giving you financial advice as to when
to buy and sell houses.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:41.250
Q To your point earlier about your Herbert
Spencer quote and also your first conclusion

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:48.670
about the new industries that are going to
have to take the place of the financial service

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:50.950
industry.
Do you think there is anything the government

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:55.670
can do to incentivize the new 'brightest and
best' from the next generation to not go into

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:58.700
financial services?
Because you can see already that they're still

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:02.530
being incentivized by the bonus culture, and
the top tier are being taken into those banks

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.200
still.
Is there anything the government can do to

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.540
drive them into the new industries that we
need?

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:11.010
Vince Cable: Well, I'm not sure the government
can directly do very much.

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:15.619
I mean, we don't have labor conscription,
and I wouldn't advocate it.

00:45:15.619 --> 00:45:19.060
I think, to some extent, there is an element
of fashion.

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:25.130
You know, there was a whole generation who
felt that the really smart thing to do -- if

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:30.720
you got a good first, you know -- is to go
to work for Goldman Sachs or Lehman's.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.320
It was the intellectual cream, and you can
make pots of money.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.810
So, you know, but I think that wave has probably
gone.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.990
I suspect those people probably now want to
come and work for you.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:49.050
I don't know, but I suspect they might.
Probably what needs to happen -- I'm not sure

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:55.770
how you make this happen.
You can't force labor markets -- is that,

00:45:55.770 --> 00:46:00.990
One of our big problems is that lots of kids,
you know, who've got real mathematical ability,

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:08.290
for example, would do physics, engineering.
You know, what's the incentive for them to

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:13.820
do it?
They're going into fairly low-paid jobs, relative

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:17.010
little upside.
And somehow or other, we need to change the

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:22.260
psychology so that that becomes a really attractive
thing for people to do.

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:28.980
I mean, as it happens, my youngest son -- who
I mentioned -- didn't succumb to the temptation

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.160
to go into the banks.
He realized his dad's own pea salary could

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:37.330
probably keep him going for a few years.
So did his Ph.D. in physics research and is

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:41.260
now doing theoretical physics.
But it's not very well-rewarded, and it's

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.990
a very insecure world, because universities
are being cut.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:52.430
So somehow or other, we've got to try and
create an environment where the really trendy

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:58.040
thing to do is not to work for an investment
bank, but to become a physicist or an engineer

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:04.140
or a chemist, or the kind of things you do.
But, you're in a position to give incentives.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.900
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:15.790
Q What would you say to the argument that,
"A lot of the problems we're experiencing

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:20.800
now stem from a decision that the U.S. government
made all those years ago to, basically, de-link

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.040
its currency from the gold standard.”
And would you say a reversal of this decision

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:30.020
is perhaps a panacea for the problems that
we're experiencing now?

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:34.369
Vince Cable: No. I don't think so.
I mean, that's a bygone world.

00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:41.079
You know, we've lifted exchange controls;
capital can move around.

00:47:41.079 --> 00:47:46.460
It isn't easy to sustain currency pegs any
longer.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:58.740
You know, the traumas in 1992, Black Monday.
Once a country tries to hold an exchange rate

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:03.510
against speculative trends, it's bound to
lose, but it's a one-way bet.

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:10.160
So I think we have to accept that the major
currency areas, which will be the U.S. dollar

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.000
area, the Chinese area -- whatever we now
call that -- the Euro area.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.650
You know, these are going to float against
each other.

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:27.740
And it's not possible to fix them, in practice.
I think what your question does touch on is

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:35.270
that, one of the underlying sources of instability
is the big imbalances between what happened

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:40.161
in the United States and China -- the very
odd situation really -- where you had essentially

00:48:40.161 --> 00:48:50.650
a poor country saving more than it could invest
at home, exporting it, exporting their savings

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:53.720
to a rich country that was living beyond its
means.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:58.140
And I'm not trying to make moral judgments.
It's just a fact of life.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:04.329
And vast quantities of Chinese savings flowed
into the United States and helped to finance

00:49:04.329 --> 00:49:11.310
its government and private deficits.
And that worked great for awhile; you know,

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:14.530
it kept the world economy growing over the
last decade or so.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:19.661
But it was doomed to come to an end, and it
is in the process of coming to an end because

00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:26.599
of the crisis that's being caused by the flood
of Chinese liquidity into western economies.

00:49:26.599 --> 00:49:33.869
And if you read behind what's being said at
the G-20 meeting, a lot of the debate is about

00:49:33.869 --> 00:49:39.000
how you achieve that rebalancing in an orderly
way.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.130
How do you make sure that Chinese savings
goes into Chinese development?

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:45.530
And that's linked to the issue of their exchange
rate.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:49.750
How does the United States adjust to be a
better-balanced economy?

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:57.950
But I think simply going back, we can't really
talk about going back to the pre-1971 world.

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:03.519
That doesn't exist anymore.

00:50:03.519 --> 00:50:04.920
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:18.550
Q You mentioned previously that you essentially
agreed with the rescue package that the government

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:24.280
put forward to get us out of this crisis.
And I saw yesterday that Alistair Darling

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:30.800
is now talking about bringing in a law or
regulation to limit the amount of debt in

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.890
one year the government can go up to.
Is that not, in some way, tying the hands

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:36.510
of the government in the future?

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:41.150
Vince Cable: No, I don't think that's sensible.
Let me clear what I said.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:47.130
I think -- in the emergency last autumn -- I
think the government did the right thing,

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:52.190
in terms of recapitalizing banks, providing
the guarantees, being willing to step in,

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:55.740
semi-nationalize, the drastic cuts in interest
rates by the Bank of England.

00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:01.220
I mean, all those -- that package was the
right thing to do in an emergency.

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.640
And it prevented a very bad situation getting
even worse.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:09.130
I think, since then, they've let a lot of
things drift.

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:12.970
And one of the things that's been allowed
to drift is the lack of attention to the flow

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:16.930
of credit into the business sector -- keeping
business going.

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:18.970
I think they've not paid enough attention
to that.

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:27.599
And, arguably, not addressing sufficiently
up front the looming issue of the public sector

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:32.190
deficit.
So I'm not criticizing the fact that we have

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:36.720
a large deficit, because conditions have arisen
that made it inevitable.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.170
But there has to be a very clear plan to get
rid of it.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:47.280
Now, the particular proposal that came up
yesterday, "Let's have a legal target.”

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.390
Well, what does that mean, you know?
If Alistair Darling misses it, does he go

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:56.220
to prison?
You know, it's a political process.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:59.670
It's not a legal problem.
It's not a legal problem.

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:02.650
And you know, he wants to go down the legal
route.

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:05.980
George Osborne wants to set up a quango to
deal with this.

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:09.260
You can't deal with this in that way.
It's got to be dealt with up front.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.280
We've got a big deficit.
The politicians have got to spell out very

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.640
clearly what this means in terms of public
spending choices and taxation.

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:22.420
It is a purely political matter and we've
got to level with you about what the options

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:27.890
are, and then, you're going to vote on it.
But hiding behind new laws and quangos does

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:28.970
not deal with the problem.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:30.930
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:37.790
Q I actually did a physics degree at university.
And two years ago, I made the choice between

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:44.040
doing a Ph.D. or coming here.
And I sold out to come here -- well, a company

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:53.940
that was bought by here.
And I wondered what you think we can actually

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.550
do to stop people like me taking these jobs,
and actually.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:59.380
Vince Cable: Well, I don't want to make you
feel guilty.

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.380
I don't know what you do.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.680
Q I definitely remembered saying, "I'm selling
out.”

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:09.950
And I did sell out.
And so, I guess my point is, I know there's

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:12.400
been efforts made in the past.
I know there's less and less people doing

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.400
physics and maths.
There's departments closing around the country.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.920
What can we really do to stop this?

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:25.320
Vince Cable: I think that -- as far as the
deterioration in British science and mathematics

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:31.080
is concerned -- I think the penny has dropped.
I had a debate in parliament four years ago

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:37.119
that I picked up -- I was personally interested
in it, because my constituency houses the

00:53:37.119 --> 00:53:39.920
National Physical Laboratory and the Laboratory
of the Government Chemists.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:46.200
You know, I have lots of physicists and chemists
who are living in my area.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:50.880
And I think the government realized four years
ago -- three, four years ago -- there's a

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.310
really big, emerging crisis.
Because very large numbers of kids are coming

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:58.740
through the system without basic mathematical
literacy.

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:02.369
Not enough further maths.
Most of the further maths and physics is taught

00:54:02.369 --> 00:54:07.220
in private schools.
You know, the state system is just not delivering.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:13.230
And I think they have now focused on that,
in terms of helping recruit more properly-qualified

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:18.030
teachers who can do specialism, not generalities.
And it's beginning to make a difference.

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:21.020
But it's a slow -- it's like turning around
an oil tanker.

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:27.310
You know, it doesn't happen overnight.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:30.319
Q [inaudible]

00:54:30.319 --> 00:54:40.530
Vince Cable: Well, it is hard, you know. Making
brains work is hard.

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:44.250
&gt;&gt; Okay. I think we'll have to leave it there.
Thank you very much, Dr. Vince Cable.

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:45.250
Vince Cable: Thank you.

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:45.251
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
