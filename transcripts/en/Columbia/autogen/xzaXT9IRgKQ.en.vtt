We are at the Harlem Buyer Fair which is
a an industry event that we produce

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.000
under the Harlem Local Vendor Program, a
partnership actually between Harlem

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.640
Park-to-Park, Columbia University, Hot
Bread Kitchen, and Harlem Community

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.880
Development Corporation and West Harlem
Development Corp as our funders and the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.769
program is really designed to help local
entrepreneurs, product entrepreneurs,

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.660
scale their businesses so that they can
pursue supplier partnerships with local

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.050
stores, corporate stores, and corporations
for distribution. So today's event is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.770
actually the culmination of 11 month
program that these vendors have been

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.579
participating in and they have been
learning how to develop their business

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.149
working on their packaging their product
their pricing learning operations

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.350
manufacturing to get to the point where
today they actually get to pitch their

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.789
products to buyers we have buyers here
from Whole Foods Market, Fairway, Fresh

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.520
Direct, corporations like TD Bank that
are all looking to bring in products

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.720
into their companies for distribution
and so it's very exciting because we

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.810
already have some success stories here
today of vendors whose products are

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.940
being picked up for distribution
