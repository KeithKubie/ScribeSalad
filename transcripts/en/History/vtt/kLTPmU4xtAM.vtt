00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.000
Bladesmiths, this
is the strength test--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.540
the hoof chop.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.670
I'm going to be chopping
into these hooves 10 times.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.710
And, remember, this isn't about
what happens to the hooves.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.960
This is what the hooves
do to your blades.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.710
Brad, you're up first.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.620
Are you ready?

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.500
I am ready.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.290
I'm just not breathing.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm trying to figure out
how to keep it together.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.580
And I want Ben to swing as
hard as he can to make up

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.330
for the lightness of my blade.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.920
Oh, my gosh.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.500
Well, Brad, I really like the
construction of your handle.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.710
It was comfortable in my
hand when I was swinging it.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.580
The blade is still
straight, but there

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.920
is a little fold right there.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.710
But the rest of it help up well.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.830
Nice job.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.420
Brendan, are you ready?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.670
Sure.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.580
You sound very
sure of yourself.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.750
BRENDAN: I don't think I've ever
been more anxious for somebody

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.040
to chop a hoof in half.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:19.620
I really hope that
forge weld holds

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.710
Well, Brendan, I like the
forward heaviness of this

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.080
for a chopping
blade, but this thing

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.750
is all about what the
hooves do to your knife,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.420
and they kicked it in
the knife, right here.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.120
There's some pretty
significant chipping.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.790
The other issue I
have is the handle

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.040
is really small and kind
of hard to hold onto.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.210
Jeff, are you ready?

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.290
I've been waiting
four seasons.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.620
I'm ready.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.620
You've been waiting
at the Four Seasons?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.210
That's nice.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.580
Jeff: I'm extremely
nervous at this point.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.330
I can see the chips
in Ben's blade.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.000
Mine could easily
do the same thing.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.670
Well, Jeff, this is
a heck of a chopper.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.420
It's like your knife
didn't even see the hooves.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.170
The one criticism I
have about this blade

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.670
is that the handle is
about an inch too long.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.120
It doesn't have a
real comfortable place

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.580
to sit and be held.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.500
But very well done.
Nice blade.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.750
Thank you.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.750
All right, gentlemen.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.170
This is the sharpness test.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.880
And what I want to
see in this test

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.540
is a nice, clean cut without
any snags or tears in the bag.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.880
Brad, you're up first.
Are you ready?

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.380
I'm ready.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.040
You can see the
cuts are pretty clean.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.540
I mean, there's that
nick there, but I don't

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.040
think it grabbed anything.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.540
It's a cutter.
It's sharp.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.000
Good job.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.620
All right, Brendan, you're up.
Are you ready?

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.710
I'm ready to go.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.170
If it doesn't go
right, that's it.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.790
I'm going home.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.170
Those chips and dings
in your blade, you can see

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.420
there's a lot of material
just hung up on them.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.920
I mean the edge is sharp
on either side of that,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.170
but with those missing
places in there,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.420
kind of caught and
pulled through.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.880
It will cut, but it also tears.
All right, Jeff.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.250
Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.290
So, Jeff, you've got a really,
really stout edge on there.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.620
But there wasn't any resistance
when I made those cuts.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.290
It truly just passed
right through.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.460
The bag speaks for itself.
It's a cutter.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.250
Nicely done.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.750
Thank you.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.750
Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed the deliberation

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.460
and they've made
a final decision.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.790
It's time for one of
you to leave forge.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.540
Brendan, your blade
did not make the cut.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.790
Doug Marcaida will explain.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.120
Brendan, I commend you
for staying in the game.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.880
But as you can see, your
blade took the most damage

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.250
during the strength test.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.710
The process that
you did to harden

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.670
and to sharpen your blade
made your edge brittle.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.080
And for that reason,
we have to let you go.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.670
Brendan, please
surrender your weapon.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.830
I'm bummed out
that I don't get

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.000
to make the historical weapon.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.830
But this was a
fantastic opportunity.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.080
I'm out of the
way, Brad and Jeff.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.500
May the best man
win, and good luck.
