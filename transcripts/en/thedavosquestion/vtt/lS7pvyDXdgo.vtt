Hi World Economic Forum at Davos! My name is Augusto Molinero 
and I am giving one idea that I think can drive inclusive growth.

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:13.149
How can everyone benefit from the global economy?

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:17.690
We need to produce much more wealth with drastically fewer resources.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.659
How could we expect prosperity to spread 
when economies from the less developed world

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:28.439
don't have access to basic best business practices
which have shaped the modern world for the past century?

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:40.840
My idea for getting 3 billion people out of poverty is entrepreneurship 
and entrepreneurship can be taught to these people by using videos.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:49.340
Making sure that that video is used for a purpose, 
first of all to influence policy makers.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.070
Put a TV in every house of the developing world.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:02.090
If the developed world will provide them with the tools, they will 
be able to create the opportunity for themselves and for others.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.240
The opportunity for inclusive growth in the 21st century 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.840
will come from investing in and empowering 
what I call the feminine leadership style.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.330
In our opinion the most inclusive way to close the gap 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.920
is to share knowledge and experience.
Two heads are better than one!

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.330
And this is how we can bridge the poverty gap: 
there is a three-step simple programme.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.860
That’s why my goal is to create a Farmville for charity.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.150
We can absolutely close the gap between the rich and the poor.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.650
I am here on Wall street, asking folks how can Wall 
Street help close the gap between the rich and the poor.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.050
Sir, how can Wall Street help close the gap between the rich and the poor?

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.530
Actually your question is somewhat absurd on one side.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.510
The gap between the poor and the rich can never actually really be closed.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.540
Inclusive growth means expanding our conversations.
It means not just listening

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.069
but collaborating. Discussions about international issues.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.430
Imagine a world where no one is left behind. Where

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.829
everyone has a voice and every voice is heard.

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.180
Inclusive dialogue for inclusive growth. Let’s turn 
these 7 voices into 7 billion. Our generation is ready!
