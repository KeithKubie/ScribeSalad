00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:04.228
- And yet in that volatile tinder box

00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:05.678
of a time,

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:08.756
President Kennedy led with a steady hand.

00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:10.899
Diffusing the most perilous moment

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:14.998
of the Cold War without
firing a single shot.

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:16.577
Enforcing the rights of young black

00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:18.121
men and women to study at the university

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.120
of their choice.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.348
Unleashing a core of young volunteers

00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:24.460
as ambassadors for peace

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.127
in distant corners of the globe.

00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:29.838
Setting America's sights on the moon

00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:32.809
precisely because it was hard.

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.696
And willing to consider
the possibility that

00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:37.152
we might not win the space race

00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:40.019
because he had an unwavering faith

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.523
in the character of
the people that he led.

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:46.356
Resilient, optimistic, innovative,

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:50.702
and courageous.

00:00:53.177 --> 00:00:56.127
It's worth remembering this.

00:00:56.127 --> 00:00:59.794
The times in which
President Kennedy led us.

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:03.423
Because for many
Americans I know that this

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:05.340
feels like an uncertain

00:01:06.308 --> 00:01:08.225
and even perilous time.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.020
The forces of globalization

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.865
and technology have upended many

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:17.633
of our established
assumptions about the economy.

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.027
They've provided great opportunity

00:01:19.027 --> 00:01:20.527
but also great inequality

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:23.277
and uncertainty for far too many.

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:26.632
Our politics remains filled

00:01:26.632 --> 00:01:28.799
with division and discord.

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:31.746
And everywhere we see the risk of falling

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:34.496
into the refuge of tribe and clan

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.312
and anger at those who don't look like us

00:01:41.312 --> 00:01:43.395
or have the same surnames

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.199
or pray the way we do.

00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:51.728
And at such moments courage is necessary.

00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:54.954
In such moments we need courage

00:01:54.954 --> 00:01:56.621
to stand up to hate.

00:01:57.643 --> 00:01:59.255
Not just in others

00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:00.672
but in ourselves.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.867
At such moments we need the courage

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.459
to stand up to dogma

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:11.050
not just in others

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.467
but in ourselves.

00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:16.033
At such moments we need courage

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:17.485
to believe that together

00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:19.267
we can tackle big challenges

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:22.184
like inequality and climate change.

00:02:23.802 --> 00:02:26.043
At such moments it's necessary

00:02:26.043 --> 00:02:27.989
for us to show courage in challenging

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.030
the status quo

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.457
and in fighting the good fight.

00:02:31.457 --> 00:02:34.184
But also show the courage

00:02:34.184 --> 00:02:36.460
to listen to one another

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.828
and seek common ground

00:02:38.828 --> 00:02:41.661
and embrace principled compromise.

00:02:44.274 --> 00:02:45.107
Courage,

00:02:45.107 --> 00:02:46.023
President Kennedy knew,

00:02:46.023 --> 00:02:47.595
requires something more than just

00:02:47.595 --> 00:02:49.262
the absence of fear.

00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:54.526
Any fool can be fearless.

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:58.541
Courage, true courage,

00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:00.458
derives from that sense

00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:04.617
of who we are,

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.938
what are our best selves,

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:10.698
what are our most important commitments?

00:03:10.698 --> 00:03:13.615
And to believe that we can dig deep

00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:19.228
and do hard things

00:03:19.228 --> 00:03:21.267
for the enduring benefit of others.
