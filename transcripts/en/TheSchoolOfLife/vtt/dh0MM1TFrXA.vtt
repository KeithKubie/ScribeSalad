00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:07.350
The Incumbent Problem refers to the vast,
but often overlooked and unfair advantage

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:15.670
that all new people, cities and jobs have
over existing – or, as we put it, incumbent

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.210
– ones. The beautiful person glimpsed briefly
in the street as we step off the bus, the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.710
city visited for a few days of holiday, the
job we read about in a few tantalising paragraphs

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.960
of a magazine; these have unwise tendencies
to seem immediately and definitively superior

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.059
to our current partner, our long-established
home and our committed workplace and can inspire

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.190
us to sudden and (in retrospect sometimes)
regrettable divorces, relocations and resignations.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.399
5641625328_f50d7fbc77_bWhen we spot apparent
perfection, we tend to blame our spectacular

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.210
bad luck for the mediocrity of our lives,
without realising that we are mistaking an

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.770
asymmetry of knowledge for an asymmetry of
quality; we are failing to see not that our

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:15.380
partner, home and job are especially awful,
but that we know them especially well. Incumbents

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.860
are the victims of disproportionate knowledge.
They are generally no worse than anyone or

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.500
anything else, but as they are familiar, their
every failing has had a chance to be minutely

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.280
charted. The corrective to disproportionate
knowledge is experience. We need to mine the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.730
secret reality of other people and places
and so learn that, beneath their charms, they

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:52.060
will almost invariably be essentially ‘normal’
in nature: that is, no worse yet no better

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.130
than the incumbents we already understand.
The solution to the incumbent problem is to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.340
extrapolate from what we already know and
apply it to what we don’t yet. The most

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.909
plausible generalisation we can make about
unknown things is that they are likely to

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:16.829
be closer to what we’ve already experienced
than they are to being completely – and

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:23.239
bountifully – different. We should beware
of the injustices we unthinkingly visit upon

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.480
all the incumbent features and relationships
of our lives.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:44.800
Our Wisdom Display cards explores what it really means to be wise and how we can strive to be more wise in our everyday lives.
