00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.600
When we look up we see moons, planets, asteroids,
pulsars, star clusters, nebulae, stars as

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.410
big as whole solar systems, and millions of
galaxies -- you know what we don’t see?

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.040
Black holes.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.110
Because no one has ever seen a black hole.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.820
Black holes are deep, dark, swirling sinkholes
of collapsed matter.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.859
That gravitational whirlwind that consumes
everything and crushes it.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.470
That place where not even light can escape...

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.330
Except...THIS isn’t a black hole.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.040
This is an artist’s idea of what a black
hole might look like, or more precisely, the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.180
light around it - called the Event Horizon.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.010
Think about t.v. shows and movies like stargate
SG-1, Lost In Space, Star Trek..The Black

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.480
Hole, and most famously Interstellar.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.620
They all have images of black holes, but no
one has ever actually photographed one.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:05.239
So, how close are we to taking a picture of
a black hole?

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.400
Taking a picture of a black hole is expensive,
difficult, and takes a lot of smart people’s

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
time.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.810
You’ve probably never even thought about
what a black hole looks like, because you

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.460
thought “this is what a black hole looks
like!”

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.460
But it’s not.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.829
So, why are scientists so desperate to see
one?

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.229
Why does it matter?

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.229
First.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.229
Science.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.229
Second.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.090
Black holes are incredible, and right now,
artists and filmmakers build conceptions based

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.340
on what scientists tell them is important,
but we don’t know if these are right...

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.399
these pictures are based on math...not in
reality.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:47.549
We’ve known about Black holes since the
early days of Einstein’s theories, but until

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.640
we actually see one, there’s a part of us
that doesn’t want to believe that they’re

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640
real.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.030
This actually all started with that famous
equation: E = mc2.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.420
But math can only get us so far...I mean,
we knew Pluto was out there since the early

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.799
1900’s, and our best guesses told us it
was a boring icy ball.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.069
Until we flew by it in 2016, and actually
saw it.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:19.230
Imagine how we’ll feel when we see a black
hole with our jelly-filled light buckets.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.480
And this is what scientists are going to use
to snap a photo of a black hole.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.069
The event horizon telescope.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.459
It’s not just one telescope, it’s a network
of many all over the planet.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.409
This effectively creates a single telescope
as big as the Earth.

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.400
The bigger the telescope, the more detail
they can see, and the further away.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.900
Which we definitely need to take the image
of a something like this black hole...Meet

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.590
Sagittarius-A Star.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.030
Sag A-Star is at the center of our galaxy.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.769
It's thousands of light-years away.

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.670
There's a second object that we're also very
interested in and that is the black hole in

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.140
the center of the galaxy, M87, also known
as Virgo A...

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.159
M87 is an elliptical galaxy that's located
about 17 megaparsecs away, so about 15 million

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.239
light-years away.

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.060
That’d be like trying to photograph an orange
on the surface of the moon from the earth

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.650
or trying to pick out individual molecules
in a piece of paper in front of you.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.909
And they do this with a whole array of radio
telescopes spread around the world... not

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.640
the kind you look through.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.829
They use radio wavelengths instead of visible
wavelengths...

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.400
It’s a process called interferometry.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.890
Interferometry is a general technique to take
the signals from two separate receiving systems,

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.780
in this case telescopes and interfering the
signals with each other.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.909
The word interferometry is the combination
of interfere -- and meter or to measure.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:59.140
They’re measuring a pattern of interference
of the radio waves entering the telescope.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.140
By analyzing the interference pattern, the
data from the telescopes can be merged together,

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.719
and images can be filtered from all the noise.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:14.349
These astronomers are using Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VBLI), meaning the radio telescopes

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:21.769
are far apart but are working together, .Which
brings us to April of 2017, when these astronomers

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.610
pointed their telescopic array at the black
holes in Sagittarius-A Star and in M8716 for

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.010
5 nights.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.150
So, doesn’t that mean we took the picture?

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.150
no.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.150
We didn’t.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.210
We took the data.We’re now starting to process
the data into a picture.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.240
Part of the difficulty of reconstructing an
image is that we don’t have all the data

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.240
that we need.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.250
The cosmic signals that we are interested
are very weak.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.400
most of what we are recording is from the
receiver and is noise the data that we interested

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.720
in is roughly 1 millionth of all that data.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.590
It is definitely a lot of astronomy and it
is a lot of computer science as well... so

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.550
We’re talking about hundred of terabytes
of data per station.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.970
add it all together and it’s Petabytes.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.550
A petabyte of data is 1,000 Terabytes.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.750
That’s a lot.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.259
That’s 3,900 of the largest iphones.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.670
It’s so much that they can’t even upload
it.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.699
It’s physical.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:27.979
On hard drives.

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.980
All that data has to be shipped to processing
centers from telescopes around the world --including

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.130
at the South Pole, which has extreme weather...
so, the scientists have to wait months to

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.940
even receive that data.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.870
There are two sites working on the data.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.610
The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy
in Bonn, Germany and here at the MIT’s Haystack

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.699
Observatory outside Boston.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.380
Once the data is all in one place, the scientists
have to correlate it.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.190
It’s like watching a 3D movie but where
each eye is seeing something different.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.289
The scientists need to match them up with
timing that’s more precise than atomic clocks

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.910
on the GPS satellites.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:13.040
One of the possibilities is that this year's
data won't be sufficient to provide a good

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.220
image, but with the addition of next year,
we will.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.620
Again, again we won't know until we actually
are at that point in the analysis.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.720
With any luck, we’ll see the first image
of a black hole in 2018.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.550
If we can gather enough data, correlate it,
and analyze it to find the image of something

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.220
thousands or millions of light years away.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.220
If.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.620
Then what will we see?

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.530
The accretion flow will probably look more
or less like a crescent.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.530
That's because we're not viewing the accretion
flow face-on.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.260
We're not quite viewing it edge-on but closer
to edge-on.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:55.180
So, We really don’t know what we will see,
was einstein correct? we won’t know until

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.629
we see the image.

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:02.020
If we produce a really nice picture, people
will say, "Wow, so that's what a black hole

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.159
looks like.

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:04.729
That's cool."

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:08.840
So we are pretty close to seeing our first
photographs of a black hole.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.159
If not in 2018, then maybe 2019.

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:13.810
What do you think Astronomers will learn?

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.810
What Will it look like?

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.790
Do you think it’s gonna be different than
what we thought?

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:38.090
Let us know 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.099
and thanks for watching Seeker.
