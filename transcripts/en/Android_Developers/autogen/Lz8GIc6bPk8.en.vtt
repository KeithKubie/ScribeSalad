normal integer would work fine you're

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900
normal integer would work fine you're
 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.420

going to be creating objects on the fly

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430
going to be creating objects on the fly
 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.160
going to be creating objects on the fly
in a loop and it's going to be pretty

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170
in a loop and it's going to be pretty
 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.840
in a loop and it's going to be pretty
wasteful like slow things down a little

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850
wasteful like slow things down a little
 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.720

bit and use it way more memory sorry so

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730
bit and use it way more memory sorry so

and they're probably fine right but you

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170
and they're probably fine right but you
 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.240
and they're probably fine right but you
probably don't want to do it inside of a

capture a trace that then you can open
 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.890
capture a trace that then you can open
in traceview so if you just type in the

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900
in traceview so if you just type in the
 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.439
in traceview so if you just type in the
from the shell traceview and then the

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449
from the shell traceview and then the
 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.379
from the shell traceview and then the
path to the trace file you can open it

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389
path to the trace file you can open it
 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.510

on that Alex I think we can move on to

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030
on that Alex I think we can move on to
 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.230
on that Alex I think we can move on to
the next question then so this question

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240
the next question then so this question
 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.350
the next question then so this question
is from VT and it I believe this was

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360
is from VT and it I believe this was
 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.320

possible to disable this encryption for
an application so I don't think we

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.010
an application so I don't think we
 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.770
an application so I don't think we
actually have any experts on the

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780
actually have any experts on the
 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.330
actually have any experts on the

such a such a bitmap like this is not a
 

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.150
such a such a bitmap like this is not a
big bitmap and actually the size of the

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160
big bitmap and actually the size of the
 

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.740
big bitmap and actually the size of the

you're not scaling down to a very tiny
 

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.490
you're not scaling down to a very tiny

for Armand yes so thats actually do

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:24.100

where you should probably do it it's

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:27.190
where you should probably do it it's
 

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.970
where you should probably do it it's
actually the way the UI itself works we

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:29.980
actually the way the UI itself works we
 

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.710
actually the way the UI itself works we
so we synchronize the drawing on their

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720
so we synchronize the drawing on their
 

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.540
so we synchronize the drawing on their
own vsync and at the beginning of the

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:33.550
own vsync and at the beginning of the
 

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.790
own vsync and at the beginning of the
frame we consume we process all the

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800
frame we consume we process all the
 

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.860
frame we consume we process all the
events that we've accumulated since the

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:37.870
events that we've accumulated since the
 

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.210
events that we've accumulated since the
last time we drew so this is very

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:39.220
last time we drew so this is very
 

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.490
last time we drew so this is very
similar with what we do in the UI what

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:41.500
similar with what we do in the UI what
 

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.810
similar with what we do in the UI what
might happen though in your particular

might happen though in your particular
 

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.430
might happen though in your particular
case is you might get one frame one

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440
case is you might get one frame one
 

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.579

this thing you have to postpone it to

00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:58.780
this thing you have to postpone it to
 

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.050
this thing you have to postpone it to
the next frame and this is one of the

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:01.060
the next frame and this is one of the
 

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.210
the next frame and this is one of the
reason why for instance we we haven't

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:03.220
reason why for instance we we haven't
 

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.100

UI toolkit is because we can add an
 

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.439
UI toolkit is because we can add an
extra frame of latency so you can give

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:13.449
extra frame of latency so you can give
 

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.720
extra frame of latency so you can give
it a try see if it helps and if it's

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:15.730
it a try see if it helps and if it's
 

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.050
it a try see if it helps and if it's
noticeable then let us know

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:18.060
noticeable then let us know
 

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.300

go ahead a question is I've seen some

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:42.510
go ahead a question is I've seen some
 

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:48.320
go ahead a question is I've seen some
apps use a sideways action bar is this

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:48.330
apps use a sideways action bar is this
 

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.060
apps use a sideways action bar is this
recommended it feels like it might offer

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:50.070
recommended it feels like it might offer
 

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.000
recommended it feels like it might offer
some extra or better functionality ok so

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.010
some extra or better functionality ok so
 

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.920
some extra or better functionality ok so
a sideways action by imagine is

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:54.930
a sideways action by imagine is
 

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.620
a sideways action by imagine is
literally in action bar this oriented

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:57.630
literally in action bar this oriented
 

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.000
literally in action bar this oriented
vertically along the sides of the screen

I think it's worth we see never moved

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:00.690
I think it's worth we see never moved
 

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.090
I think it's worth we see never moved
right that's that's what I was thinking

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.100
right that's that's what I was thinking
 

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.730
right that's that's what I was thinking
as well too so I think the answer there

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740
as well too so I think the answer there
 

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.800
as well too so I think the answer there
is it's not a recommended pattern at

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:06.810
is it's not a recommended pattern at
 

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.930
is it's not a recommended pattern at
this time we do go in periodically

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940
this time we do go in periodically
 

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.420
this time we do go in periodically
revise our UI guidelines so at some

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:11.430
revise our UI guidelines so at some
 

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.830
revise our UI guidelines so at some
point in the future we may or may not

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840
point in the future we may or may not
 

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.620
point in the future we may or may not
decide that that's a good idea but right

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:15.630
decide that that's a good idea but right
 

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.710
decide that that's a good idea but right
now the official recommendation for

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720
now the official recommendation for
 

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.750
now the official recommendation for
action bars is either one action but the

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760
action bars is either one action but the
 

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.540
action bars is either one action but the
top or the split action bar we have an

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:23.550
top or the split action bar we have an
 

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.670
top or the split action bar we have an
action bar on the top and the bottom so

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:25.680
action bar on the top and the bottom so
 

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.530
action bar on the top and the bottom so
and then of course you can do things

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:27.540
and then of course you can do things
 

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.880
and then of course you can do things
like throw tabs and everything else in

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:28.890
like throw tabs and everything else in
 

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.980
like throw tabs and everything else in

it's always something you can consider
 

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.730
it's always something you can consider
placing into your app but right now it's

you're actually going to have to add
 

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.500
you're actually going to have to add
quite a bit of code to make that work

quite a bit of code to make that work
 

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.360
quite a bit of code to make that work
too because there's no libraries that go

you have to look at the big picture
 

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.060
you have to look at the big picture
right does it blend in with the system

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:29.070
right does it blend in with the system

look nice you know all of these things

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.090
look nice you know all of these things
 

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.230
look nice you know all of these things
are things that you need to consider as

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240
are things that you need to consider as

here akio do you wanna um you know kind

00:19:53.639 --> 00:19:53.649
here akio do you wanna um you know kind
 

00:19:53.649 --> 00:19:56.580
here akio do you wanna um you know kind
of elaborate on your question line um

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:56.590
of elaborate on your question line um
 

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.580
of elaborate on your question line um
yeah I just think that I've used the

00:19:59.580 --> 00:19:59.590
yeah I just think that I've used the
 

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:03.299
yeah I just think that I've used the
contextual action bar on top and bottom

00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:03.309
contextual action bar on top and bottom
 

00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:05.159
contextual action bar on top and bottom
click on the bottom but it seems like

00:20:05.159 --> 00:20:05.169
click on the bottom but it seems like
 

00:20:05.169 --> 00:20:06.539
click on the bottom but it seems like
that it would get in the way i'm writing

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:06.549
that it would get in the way i'm writing
 

00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:09.090
that it would get in the way i'm writing
a notes app so it seems like that would

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:09.100
a notes app so it seems like that would
 

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.850
a notes app so it seems like that would
get in the way of the like the actual

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:11.860
get in the way of the like the actual
 

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.289
get in the way of the like the actual
writing with the palm rest and stuff

00:20:13.289 --> 00:20:13.299
writing with the palm rest and stuff
 

00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:15.149
writing with the palm rest and stuff
it's gotten the way when I've used it um

00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159
it's gotten the way when I've used it um
 

00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:18.029
it's gotten the way when I've used it um
so I just figured if I put like a

00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039
so I just figured if I put like a
 

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:19.499
so I just figured if I put like a
sideways action bar you might actually

00:20:19.499 --> 00:20:19.509
sideways action bar you might actually
 

00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:24.299
sideways action bar you might actually
help but yeah so I think in some apps

00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:24.309
help but yeah so I think in some apps
 

00:20:24.309 --> 00:20:26.100
help but yeah so I think in some apps
especially in apps that they require

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.110
especially in apps that they require
 

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.409
especially in apps that they require
interesting interactions that aren't

00:20:28.409 --> 00:20:28.419
interesting interactions that aren't
 

00:20:28.419 --> 00:20:30.899
interesting interactions that aren't
just you know single touches or you know

00:20:30.899 --> 00:20:30.909
just you know single touches or you know
 

00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:32.940
just you know single touches or you know
basic gestures things that are you know

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:32.950
basic gestures things that are you know
 

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.649
basic gestures things that are you know
sometimes require the full screen like

00:20:34.649 --> 00:20:34.659
sometimes require the full screen like
 

00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:36.899
sometimes require the full screen like
drawing it fix something complex like

00:20:36.899 --> 00:20:36.909
drawing it fix something complex like
 

00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:38.610
drawing it fix something complex like
that then you shouldn't feel limited by

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:38.620
that then you shouldn't feel limited by
 

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.369
that then you shouldn't feel limited by
our patterns you know if you want to

00:20:41.369 --> 00:20:41.379
our patterns you know if you want to
 

00:20:41.379 --> 00:20:43.259
our patterns you know if you want to
have actions along the side you know it

00:20:43.259 --> 00:20:43.269
have actions along the side you know it
 

00:20:43.269 --> 00:20:45.419
have actions along the side you know it
may make sense one of the things to

00:20:45.419 --> 00:20:45.429
may make sense one of the things to
 

00:20:45.429 --> 00:20:48.240
may make sense one of the things to
watch out for though is to is to get a

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:48.250
watch out for though is to is to get a
 

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.700
watch out for though is to is to get a
kind of establish a balance between what

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:50.710
kind of establish a balance between what
 

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.549
kind of establish a balance between what
looks like a system stuff and what looks

00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559
looks like a system stuff and what looks
 

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:56.039
looks like a system stuff and what looks
like custom app stuff if you make and

00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:56.049
like custom app stuff if you make and
 

00:20:56.049 --> 00:20:59.070
like custom app stuff if you make and
this is potentially kind of unintuitive

00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080
this is potentially kind of unintuitive
 

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.600
this is potentially kind of unintuitive
but if you make something that tries to

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:00.610
but if you make something that tries to
 

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.409
but if you make something that tries to
resemble the system graphics too much it

00:21:04.409 --> 00:21:04.419
resemble the system graphics too much it
 

00:21:04.419 --> 00:21:05.999
resemble the system graphics too much it
maybe it makes you a little out of place

00:21:05.999 --> 00:21:06.009
maybe it makes you a little out of place
 

00:21:06.009 --> 00:21:08.369
maybe it makes you a little out of place
where as you know if you have something

00:21:08.369 --> 00:21:08.379
where as you know if you have something
 

00:21:08.379 --> 00:21:10.320
where as you know if you have something
that's kind of essentially styled in

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:10.330
that's kind of essentially styled in
 

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:11.879
that's kind of essentially styled in
your own way and it's a sideways action

00:21:11.879 --> 00:21:11.889
your own way and it's a sideways action
 

00:21:11.889 --> 00:21:14.759
your own way and it's a sideways action
bar it may make more sense so I think

00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:14.769
bar it may make more sense so I think
 

00:21:14.769 --> 00:21:16.860
bar it may make more sense so I think
that it can work and in a lot of cases

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:16.870
that it can work and in a lot of cases
 

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.419
that it can work and in a lot of cases
the interaction is correct there it's

00:21:18.419 --> 00:21:18.429
the interaction is correct there it's
 

00:21:18.429 --> 00:21:20.039
the interaction is correct there it's
it's probably better than having things

00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:20.049
it's probably better than having things
 

00:21:20.049 --> 00:21:21.659
it's probably better than having things
along the top and bottom but it's

00:21:21.659 --> 00:21:21.669
along the top and bottom but it's
 

00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:22.889
along the top and bottom but it's
definitely something that requires some

00:21:22.889 --> 00:21:22.899
definitely something that requires some
 

00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:24.899
definitely something that requires some
some special thought just to figure out

00:21:24.899 --> 00:21:24.909
some special thought just to figure out
 

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:26.639
some special thought just to figure out
you know what what's the right balance

00:21:26.639 --> 00:21:26.649
you know what what's the right balance
 

00:21:26.649 --> 00:21:28.860
you know what what's the right balance
between you know establishing pattern or

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:28.870
between you know establishing pattern or
 

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.169
between you know establishing pattern or
established patterns and what's really

00:21:31.169 --> 00:21:31.179
established patterns and what's really
 

00:21:31.179 --> 00:21:34.169
established patterns and what's really
intuitive and useful for the user yeah

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:34.179
intuitive and useful for the user yeah
 

00:21:34.179 --> 00:21:36.119
intuitive and useful for the user yeah
I'll probably keep it down with

00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:36.129
I'll probably keep it down with
 

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:39.330
I'll probably keep it down with
assistant normal system UI if I end up

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:39.340
assistant normal system UI if I end up
 

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.669
assistant normal system UI if I end up
doing it just to avoid like confusion

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679
doing it just to avoid like confusion
 

00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:43.500
doing it just to avoid like confusion
for the user

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:43.510
for the user
 

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.020
for the user
sure another thing to think about is you

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:46.030
sure another thing to think about is you
 

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.910
sure another thing to think about is you
know you can always show and hide things

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:47.920
know you can always show and hide things
 

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.370
know you can always show and hide things
so one of the things that happens in

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:50.380
so one of the things that happens in
 

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.060
so one of the things that happens in
video playback for example is that all

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.070
video playback for example is that all
 

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.180
video playback for example is that all
the controls the the system bar the

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:57.190
the controls the the system bar the
 

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.760
the controls the the system bar the
action bar the status bar all that stuff

00:21:59.760 --> 00:21:59.770
action bar the status bar all that stuff
 

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.040
action bar the status bar all that stuff
can go away with a single tap and

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:02.050
can go away with a single tap and
 

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.420
can go away with a single tap and
actually there was some new API is in

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:03.430
actually there was some new API is in
 

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.280
actually there was some new API is in
jelly bean which made this very easy and

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:05.290
jelly bean which made this very easy and
 

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.980
jelly bean which made this very easy and
made it made the way out very consistent

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:07.990
made it made the way out very consistent
 

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.240
made it made the way out very consistent
and stable actually I think it's the

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:09.250
and stable actually I think it's the
 

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.630
and stable actually I think it's the
name of the API staple across changes to

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640
name of the API staple across changes to
 

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.670
name of the API staple across changes to
visibility of things like that so you

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:14.680
visibility of things like that so you
 

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.110
visibility of things like that so you
may want to consider doing that as well

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120
may want to consider doing that as well
 

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.010
may want to consider doing that as well
so lights-out mode like I think that's

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:20.020
so lights-out mode like I think that's
 

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.090
so lights-out mode like I think that's
what it's called like that's only

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:21.100
what it's called like that's only
 

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.220
what it's called like that's only
available in jelly bean or no so

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:23.230
available in jelly bean or no so
 

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.240
available in jelly bean or no so
lights-out mode is actually available

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:24.250
lights-out mode is actually available
 

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.060
lights-out mode is actually available
with honeycomb and later or later but

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.070
with honeycomb and later or later but
 

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.620
with honeycomb and later or later but
jelly bean introduced some new things

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:28.630
jelly bean introduced some new things
 

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.560
jelly bean introduced some new things
for devices like the Galaxy Nexus and

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:31.570
for devices like the Galaxy Nexus and
 

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.740
for devices like the Galaxy Nexus and
the next seven that have navigation bar

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:34.750
the next seven that have navigation bar
 

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.480
the next seven that have navigation bar
a navigation about the bottom and top

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:36.490
a navigation about the bottom and top
 

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.670
a navigation about the bottom and top
they introduced some new API is to make

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:38.680
they introduced some new API is to make
 

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.440
they introduced some new API is to make
your way out work even better with that

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.450
your way out work even better with that
 

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.450
your way out work even better with that
so it's also the set system you lied

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:42.460
so it's also the set system you lied
 

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.100
so it's also the set system you lied
visibility if you I but there's some new

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.110
visibility if you I but there's some new
 

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.380
visibility if you I but there's some new
flags in there that make it even better

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:46.390
flags in there that make it even better
 

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:50.130
flags in there that make it even better
so I look into that ok thanks ah one

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:50.140
so I look into that ok thanks ah one
 

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.660
so I look into that ok thanks ah one
thing I would also note is like as a

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:51.670
thing I would also note is like as a
 

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.300
thing I would also note is like as a
firm on mentioned if you have a vertical

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:54.310
firm on mentioned if you have a vertical
 

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.030
firm on mentioned if you have a vertical
action bar it's going to be in it

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:57.040
action bar it's going to be in it
 

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.700
action bar it's going to be in it
handedness might become an issue because

00:22:59.700 --> 00:22:59.710
handedness might become an issue because
 

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.470
handedness might become an issue because
if you're left-handed and it's along the

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480
if you're left-handed and it's along the
 

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.510
if you're left-handed and it's along the
left-hand side of the screen like you're

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520
left-hand side of the screen like you're
 

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.860

Paul wasn't actually going to fall on it

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:04.870
Paul wasn't actually going to fall on it
 

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.380
Paul wasn't actually going to fall on it
a lot so I would say like if it's going

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:07.390
a lot so I would say like if it's going
 

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.240
a lot so I would say like if it's going
to actually handedness in general

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.250
to actually handedness in general
 

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.590
to actually handedness in general
becomes an issue with vertical action

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600
becomes an issue with vertical action
 

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.920
becomes an issue with vertical action
bars in touch screen interfaces so i

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:13.930
bars in touch screen interfaces so i
 

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.240
bars in touch screen interfaces so i
would say at least have the option of

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:15.250
would say at least have the option of
 

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.500
would say at least have the option of
moving it to the other side of the

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:16.510
moving it to the other side of the
 

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.380
moving it to the other side of the

your hand there nordea or stick with the

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000
your hand there nordea or stick with the
 

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.940
your hand there nordea or stick with the
top because your hand won't like you

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:23.950
top because your hand won't like you
 

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.140
top because your hand won't like you
don't rest your hand on the top of the

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:25.150
don't rest your hand on the top of the
 

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.750
don't rest your hand on the top of the
screen and you also have to keep in mind

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760
screen and you also have to keep in mind
 

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.420
screen and you also have to keep in mind
to you do have the the system bar at the

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:30.430
to you do have the the system bar at the
 

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.000
to you do have the the system bar at the
bottom which has the home button and so

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.010
bottom which has the home button and so
 

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.000

if your UI is likely to touch an action

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.010
if your UI is likely to touch an action
 

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.380
if your UI is likely to touch an action
bach the bottom of the screen it's just

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.390
bach the bottom of the screen it's just
 

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.820
bach the bottom of the screen it's just
as likely to touch that system bar as

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:38.830
as likely to touch that system bar as
 

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.070
as likely to touch that system bar as
well too so and unfortunately you don't

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080
well too so and unfortunately you don't
 

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.690
well too so and unfortunately you don't
really have the option of moving that so

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:42.700
really have the option of moving that so
 

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.070
really have the option of moving that so
that's something you have to be aware of

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080
that's something you have to be aware of
 

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.810
that's something you have to be aware of
as well all right so do you have any

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:48.820
as well all right so do you have any
 

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.920
as well all right so do you have any
other live questions or should we go

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:49.930
other live questions or should we go
 

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.160
other live questions or should we go
back to the moderator alright so back to

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.170
back to the moderator alright so back to
 

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.890
back to the moderator alright so back to
the moderator this so the next question

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:55.900
the moderator this so the next question
 

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.230
the moderator this so the next question
comes from

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240
comes from
 

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.660
comes from
so actually the next question is I

00:23:59.660 --> 00:23:59.670
so actually the next question is I
 

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.650
so actually the next question is I
battery's dead so yeah so I mean I I

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:03.660
battery's dead so yeah so I mean I I
 

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.210
battery's dead so yeah so I mean I I
have the next question so the question

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220
have the next question so the question
 

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.750
have the next question so the question
is they were the person was looking at

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760
is they were the person was looking at
 

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.080
is they were the person was looking at
intent service and noticed that the

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.090
intent service and noticed that the
 

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.730
intent service and noticed that the
intense service code was creating a

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740
intense service code was creating a
 

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.030
intense service code was creating a
handler and setting the priority for the

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.040
handler and setting the priority for the
 

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.010
handler and setting the priority for the
thread to normal instead of background

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020
thread to normal instead of background
 

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.680
thread to normal instead of background
priority and so the question was what's

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:21.690
priority and so the question was what's
 

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.000
priority and so the question was what's
the recommended approach for background

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:23.010
the recommended approach for background
 

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.460
the recommended approach for background
services and I think as a side question

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:25.470
services and I think as a side question
 

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.700
services and I think as a side question
is that a bug so at least on my end I

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:28.710
is that a bug so at least on my end I
 

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.630

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.030
was taking a look through the source
code earlier and I didn't actually

code earlier and I didn't actually
notice any calls to go into the priority

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580
notice any calls to go into the priority
 

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.910
notice any calls to go into the priority

that behavior but as far as what the

jank is happening but I guess is that it
 

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.890
jank is happening but I guess is that it
is something like if your do we have

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.010
york and the question is what's the
 

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.070
york and the question is what's the
benefits of using an intentservice over

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080
benefits of using an intentservice over
 

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.659
benefits of using an intentservice over
a thread pool executor for neck river

00:27:50.659 --> 00:27:50.669
a thread pool executor for neck river
 

00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:52.880

after Network requests are there any

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:52.890
after Network requests are there any
 

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.620

downsides using the thread pool executor

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:54.630
downsides using the thread pool executor
 

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.510
downsides using the thread pool executor
we found that the intent service was

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520
we found that the intent service was
 

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.280
we found that the intent service was
taking about 10 milliseconds to start

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:58.290
taking about 10 milliseconds to start
 

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:03.049
taking about 10 milliseconds to start

River isn't in service running into a

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:09.030
River isn't in service running into a
 

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.230
River isn't in service running into a
separate process yes I said yeah so

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240
separate process yes I said yeah so
 

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.940

intent service actually does create a

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:13.950
intent service actually does create a
 

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:18.350
intent service actually does create a
service which may or may not create a

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360
service which may or may not create a
 

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.030
service which may or may not create a
separate process but it does create a

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:20.040
separate process but it does create a
 

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.060

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:25.510
I me because if there is actually a 10
 

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.600

millisecond delay it may just be like

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:27.610
millisecond delay it may just be like
 

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.630

the inter process communication but I

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640
the inter process communication but I
 

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.980
the inter process communication but I
believe that the whole point of an

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:31.990
believe that the whole point of an
 

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.230
believe that the whole point of an
internal service is to get instead the

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240
internal service is to get instead the
 

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.820
internal service is to get instead the
life cycle is managed by the system so

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:35.830
life cycle is managed by the system so
 

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.640
life cycle is managed by the system so
you it's all right i mean even within

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:38.650
you it's all right i mean even within
 

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.490
you it's all right i mean even within
the same process activities and services

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:41.500
the same process activities and services
 

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.800
the same process activities and services
normally should use inter-process

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:43.810
normally should use inter-process
 

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:45.270
normally should use inter-process
communication to communicate anyway

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:45.280
communication to communicate anyway
 

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.340
communication to communicate anyway
because there's no guarantee that that

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:47.350
because there's no guarantee that that
 

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.890
because there's no guarantee that that
service it hasn't been to be configured

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:49.900
service it hasn't been to be configured
 

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.940
service it hasn't been to be configured
to go and start in a different process

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:50.950
to go and start in a different process
 

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:52.500
to go and start in a different process
so it's still probably going through

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:52.510
so it's still probably going through
 

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.330
so it's still probably going through
through binder and all of that fun stuff

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:54.340
through binder and all of that fun stuff
 

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.610
through binder and all of that fun stuff
I mean the difference here between using

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:56.620
I mean the difference here between using
 

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.350
I mean the difference here between using
a thread pool and engine service is

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360
a thread pool and engine service is
 

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.940
a thread pool and engine service is
whether or not you want this request to

00:28:59.940 --> 00:28:59.950
whether or not you want this request to
 

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.610
whether or not you want this request to
happen when the app is in the background

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620
happen when the app is in the background
 

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.840
happen when the app is in the background
because with the service your app might

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:03.850
because with the service your app might
 

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.430
because with the service your app might
live longer in the background that get

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440
live longer in the background that get
 

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.710
live longer in the background that get
killed so you can still execute things

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:07.720
killed so you can still execute things
 

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.990
killed so you can still execute things
on your internet service whereas if you

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000
on your internet service whereas if you
 

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.430
on your internet service whereas if you
are using a thread pool executor and

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440
are using a thread pool executor and
 

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.780
are using a thread pool executor and
you're not moving that into your own

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:12.790
you're not moving that into your own
 

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.180
you're not moving that into your own
service then it's more likely to be

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:15.190
service then it's more likely to be
 

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.460
service then it's more likely to be
killed so if you want to wake up your

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:17.470
killed so if you want to wake up your
 

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.530
killed so if you want to wake up your
app you know every few minutes or every

half an hour to to make a network
 

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.690
half an hour to to make a network
request you'd be better off using the

request you'd be better off using the
 

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.280

internet service or your own servants
 

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:27.870

nothing wrong with it as long as you

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:39.610
nothing wrong with it as long as you

already implemented that's awesome so

00:30:44.169 --> 00:30:44.179
already implemented that's awesome so

move on to the next question here this
 

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:49.539
move on to the next question here this
is turn it I've actually got a question

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:49.549
is turn it I've actually got a question
 

00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:51.669
is turn it I've actually got a question
from the Hangout ox14 hangout questions

00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679
from the Hangout ox14 hangout questions
 

00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:53.770
from the Hangout ox14 hangout questions
the question is actually regarding

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:53.780
the question is actually regarding
 

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.330
the question is actually regarding
Hebrew it's supposed to have been fixed

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:55.340
Hebrew it's supposed to have been fixed
 

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.310
Hebrew it's supposed to have been fixed
as of the current version of Android but

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320
as of the current version of Android but
 

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.400
as of the current version of Android but
it's going to be a while before OEMs

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:00.410
it's going to be a while before OEMs
 

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.430
it's going to be a while before OEMs
actually start introducing this latest

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440
actually start introducing this latest
 

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.560
actually start introducing this latest
version so it could take up to quote

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:05.570
version so it could take up to quote
 

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.150
