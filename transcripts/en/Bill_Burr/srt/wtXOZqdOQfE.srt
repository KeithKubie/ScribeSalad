1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,060
Okay.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,110
Yeah. Hey, what's going on? It's a
bit, Whoa, that's really loud. Oh yeah,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,910
that's really fucking loud.
Damn. What's going on?

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,690
It's bill Burke and it's time for the
Monday morning podcast for them. One day,

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,060
one day. One day. Um,

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,950
August 21st, 2005. Jesus, I
got a cough drop in my mouth.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,680
I got a halls, mental lip. This,

8
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:23,020
you're not going to want to listen
to this are you? You know what?

9
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:24,580
I don't have time to start it over again.

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,870
I just don't, you know

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,100
where does things ever is when you have
to go on a microphone and you got a

12
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:32,810
fucking hauls and you God damn mouth.

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,240
And what w like how do
you make it go by faster?

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,860
My supposed to just spit it out. Is
that what you want from me? All right,

15
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:41,570
I will. I don't know where to go here.

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,310
You're just going to have to hang on a
second. Just hang on. Hang on. Hang off.

17
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:51,810
Fuck on. Spit this fucking
thing out. [inaudible]

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,500
why does that make noise?
It's still a podcast.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,930
It's still a podcast as long as I
make noise. All right. I'm back.

20
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,460
I'm back and I got the energy. All right.

21
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:08,461
This is the Monday morning podcast
for it's for fucking August 21st,

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,380
2017. You know, they ain't got no
August over there in the Middle East.

23
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:19,270
You know why they don't
believe in Christ. Do you know,

24
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:22,230
believe in crash? God's like,
well, email worked and guess what?

25
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:26,090
You ain't got no more August. Right?
I just want to so mad all the time.

26
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,840
Summers goes by some fucking phased.
That's true, man. You can look it up.

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,770
Go look it up on the
pooter over there. Shit.

28
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,130
Um, I'm on a great fucking mood.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,060
I've got a bunch of shit to
do. As always, as always.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,900
I'm recording this quarter
at five California time,

31
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,720
um, on Sunday. You know, and I put all
this money down on the red sox. Right?

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,490
You know, I've been betting
the red sox gambling. Okay.

33
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,750
I'm betting on the Red Sox, two
of my friends at Yankee fence,

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,973
right?

35
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,310
It's on the Ed yet. Yeah. P D gap
yet yet. Yeah. All this fucking shit.

36
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,440
All rise. Court's in session. Can
we hear from the bailiff weekend?

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,640
His last name is judge
Jesus fucking Christ.

38
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,690
How do,

39
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,500
how do people in sports get away with
the fucking punch or just basically the

40
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:22,240
newspaper industry in general?

41
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,250
My God.

42
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,710
Have you reached a verdict?
Yes, we have. Your honor.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,370
That was a home run. You get it.

44
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,380
There's so bad.

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,220
Okay.

46
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,440
There's so far I wish.

47
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,590
I just wish sweet Caroline was is funny
bad is all those Aaron judge punts.

48
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,900
If they could just make it that far
as opposed to just watching a bunch of

49
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:55,211
people who you know on fucking
black Friday have their
face pressed up against a

50
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:59,410
Walmart window going. Yeah. Right.

51
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,750
How that song became
part of the tradition.

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,860
When the fuck did that
happen? When did it happen?

53
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,220
When will it go away? You know,

54
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,460
it's bad enough. They sing. Take me out
to the game. It never used to do that.

55
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:17,061
In the seventh thing,

56
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:20,600
he just stood up and stretched and then
so then Harry Carey did it and it was

57
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,740
great. You know why?

58
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,730
Because he believed it and he was shit
faced and he was hanging out the fucking

59
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:29,330
window and you like, is that
Guy gonna fall? You know,

60
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:31,550
you know those guys who
to booze their whole life,

61
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,180
they get this big round belly. Then they
got those little pretzel Rod Sticks.

62
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:38,570
So when he started getting a lot
of that fucking keg out the window,

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,290
you know, that's why they have that net
above home plate. You know what I mean?

64
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,640
Over the fans. It's, you know,

65
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:49,580
that goes back to it has
nothing to do with foul balls.

66
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:53,900
It has to go to back in the day there
was so many fat alcoholic sticking their

67
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:54,734
head out, you know,

68
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,660
doing God knows what back then.
You know. I imagine initially

69
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,690
they were just amazed that they weren't
on the second floor of a structure

70
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,920
sticking their head out. Like, you know,
gee willikers how the hell do steaks?

71
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,590
It was probably people underneath
me, but I can't say right.

72
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,790
Then that gradually morphed
into, Holy Shit, look how far,

73
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,400
you know La writer drama I babe rose hair,
right far right fucking power. Right.

74
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,360
That morphed into that. And then
somewhere in there it was like,

75
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,700
oh my God, is that a black guy on
the field? You know, they weren't.

76
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,880
They've always been hanging out the
window for years and years and years,

77
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,560
and that's why that net
was there. Everybody thinks
it's to protect the fence.

78
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:40,410
It's not to protect the fence. Back
in the day, everybody wore a hat.

79
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,390
They will fine. Okay. The
ball wasn't juiced up.

80
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:48,450
It was the dead ball era. It'd
go up in the year or you know,

81
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,770
those people were tough back then.

82
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:53,250
They built railroads with
their fucking hands, you know,

83
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,500
and that's just the Chinese. Okay,

84
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:58,890
forget about the people
that fucking built the A,

85
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:03,720
I dunno what the cotton gin. All
right, I'm off the fucking rails here.

86
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,880
I don't know what I'm talking about.
All I know is that I'm like, all right,

87
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,250
I got to get back into baseball. You
know what I mean? I'm an old man.

88
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,580
It's a slow game and then all of a
sudden it gets exciting and then it slows

89
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,770
down again. Right. Just like
that thing. As you get older,

90
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:18,600
every once in a while your heart
does something and you're like,

91
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:22,800
am I gonna fucking die here? Okay, no,
I'm good. Right? That's what baseball is.

92
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,470
The rest of the time it's just
fucking sitting there, you know,

93
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,760
like waiting for a cough drop to dissolve
so you can start your fucking podcast.

94
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,200
That's type of shit. So anyways, um,

95
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,770
I decided out of the fucking boom to um,

96
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,650
to bet with two of my friends, both
Yankee fence, right? Once again,

97
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:47,490
key and giant fan. The other a Yankee
and a Patriot fan figured that one up.

98
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,500
It's one of those Connecticut stories,
right? You heard of a Bronx tale.

99
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:56,130
This is the sequel called Connecticut
Story and this guy's a Yankee and a

100
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:59,060
patriots fan. The, the most bizarre,

101
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,380
one of the more bizarre combinations
of fans I've have, I've ever seen.

102
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,850
Um, so I bet at both, you
know, 50 bucks each a game.

103
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,430
So they stand to lose 50 again 50.

104
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,190
I'm dropping a c note of picking
it up on the last two series.

105
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,300
We've won two out of three on both
of them. So I'll freckles here.

106
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,750
It's up a hundred bucks, right?
Is that right? Let's see.

107
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,890
I was down a hundred then I was,

108
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:25,790
even then I was up a hundred then it
was up 200 then I was up a hundred.

109
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,960
Now I'm up 200 bucks.

110
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,050
Do want a boots, right? I loved it.

111
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:35,200
I almost meant an extra 50 cause the
guy's got don't up Tonya right now to

112
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:36,670
fucking Aaron judge.

113
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,510
You know everybody's gonna rise and
coach going to be in session and they're

114
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,390
going to reach a verdict and then
he's going to hit it again and again.

115
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,730
He's going to hit a home run.

116
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,671
And I was like,

117
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:52,671
you fucking cock soccer that guys like
all for 50 with guys on base against the

118
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,950
red sox the last couple of
weekends. Of course the guys do.

119
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,640
It's God Damn Paul Bunyan going
up there swinging the bat.

120
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,230
And then I thought about it, I was like,
all right, fuck it. I'll bet ya. Um,

121
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,090
but I was voice texting and I said,
I'll bet you 50 bucks. He doesn't,

122
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,380
but it wrote, I bet you've
fixed 50 bucks. He does it.

123
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,860
And then I didn't hear back from
him and I was like, all right,

124
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:19,860
you got until you know midnight
tonight to get your bed in her,

125
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,770
the offers off the table.
And he said he fell asleep,

126
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:26,040
but he was probably sitting going like,
oh dude. I said he was going to do it.

127
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,800
Why would you? I said
he'd do it for 20 bucks.

128
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,720
And then you said you also think
he's going to do it for 50.

129
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,240
I think I weirded him out.
He hasn't called me all day.

130
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:39,660
So that might be the end of
that friendship. It's funny
how that happens, right?

131
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,760
15 year friendship can end on a voice
text that somebody doesn't understand.

132
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,520
Um, so anyways,

133
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,910
so red sox took the fucking series
and you know why they took the series?

134
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,930
Because we spent 200 million fucking
dollars in God damn it. You know,

135
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
we better beat the fucking Yankees
if we could spend that kind of money.

136
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,150
I didn't want to yet. I didn't
want the Yankee spent this year.

137
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,190
I just know they have most
of their own draft picks.

138
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,670
So it really doesn't
matter. Right. Or does it?

139
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,560
I have no idea.

140
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,150
Did you guys see in Spain they set up 800
checkpoints to catch that fucking cunt

141
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,983
.

142
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,343
Um,

143
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,040
did they catch the guy? I Dunno.

144
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,430
Okay.

145
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,730
Desperate to ease public
fears and neutralize a
terrorist cell responsible for

146
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:25,150
the deadliest attack in Spain or
they going neutralize the, uh,

147
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,200
the terrorist cell. It was actually gonna
I guess going to be way more deadly,

148
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,380
but the fucking dopes accidentally blew
themselves up trying to make a bomb.

149
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:36,250
That's the greatest thing that can happen.

150
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,610
That's my favorite terrorist story
when they were building it and then it

151
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:42,820
fucking blows up. It's such
a fucked up world, man.

152
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,840
Okay.

153
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,600
It's just people on both sides that
are just out of their fucking minds.

154
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,430
I don't get it. I just don't get it.

155
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,500
Why can't you just fucking
be like me and you know,

156
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:56,070
battle booze and watch sports and get
excited. Things that don't matter.

157
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,210
Why do you have to have a fucking cause
and get all into some invisible fucking

158
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:04,290
guy that you never fucking met and then
everybody around you have to die if they

159
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:08,500
don't think the way you
think. Okay. What is it?

160
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,020
There's a tipping point in religion
and it's a combination of like

161
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,670
you believe too much and
you got too much fucking,

162
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:24,480
I don't know what you know,
I used to a bit about that.

163
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,170
Do you have like too much power and
get too much into fucking religion?

164
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:31,370
Like it always goes bad. You started
pressing other fucking people. You know,

165
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,220
like when my people really get into Jesus
white people, it gets fucking scary.

166
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,853
You know,

167
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,750
black people get really into Jesus and
that's a fucking great service killer

168
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,750
band. That's it.

169
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,290
They're confined white people.
It's an open fucking field.

170
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,690
Whatever the fuck they think. They
just, they just, they run with it.

171
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,320
No checks and balances.
That's the problem. Okay,

172
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,020
so I don't know what
goes on with these fires.

173
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,110
I didn't know what the
fuck I'm talking about,

174
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:03,050
but I don't know what goes on with
these people or the fuck you convince

175
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:06,830
somebody that they less fucking move on
the planet is you're going to walk into

176
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,520
to a group of people sitting
there watching a show or
eating a fucking slice of

177
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:14,930
pizza and you're going to kill all of
them. And a then God's going to be like,

178
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:18,770
Hey, nice going, woo. Hey Buddy,

179
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,810
I want to talk to you. You know,

180
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:24,170
I would have done that but I could dig
to thank God you thought to do that.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I Dunno. So anyways,
so good luck to Spain.

182
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,540
I hope you eradicate those cops right
out of your fucking beautiful country.

183
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,070
Um, anyways, I know. Why
do I talk world politics?

184
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,390
Why know why? Cause it makes you
guys feel smarter, right? Hey bill,

185
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:47,080
maybe next time you bring up spaying,
maybe you could fuck ag. Go Fuck Yourself.

186
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,880
I'll do what I want. Oh, by the
way, I got some a, I got some,

187
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,110
I got to give away this week for the
first thousand people all ran away to

188
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:59,440
second before you take
out you fucking first,

189
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,130
the first thousand people that text a
particular phrase to a particular number,

190
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,270
we'll win some all things,
comedy merchandise. So
they're basically stickers.

191
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,570
All right. Texted, is that what it is
yet? And I'm just letting you know that,

192
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,420
that this is so they can build,

193
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,550
build up their email fucking database and
let you guys know what's going on with

194
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:25,260
this site. Okay. So it's
fucking transparent.

195
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:27,810
What we're trying to do here
for the price of a sticker.

196
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,690
That's what we're trying to do. You know,

197
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:34,580
we're trying to get more social media
and all that type of shit because, um,

198
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,790
we've got big shit coming up on all
things. Comedy relaunched the website.

199
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,530
Um,

200
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,530
next month for Chrysler has a cooking
show on there called something's burning a

201
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,070
, I'm going to be doing those road rage
fucking videos where you got the fucking

202
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,950
camera on me and all of that shit. And
then the person that did whatever they,

203
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,750
uh, Philippe spires is going to be
doing a, a home improvement show.

204
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,100
Basically your favorite comics doing the
shit that they like to do. Being funny.

205
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,240
Um, we got our first stand up
special release with Paul Versey.

206
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,080
We got a bunch of stuff going
on and uh, talks of yes,

207
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,350
all kinds of other things, sports shows
and all this type of stuff. So, uh,

208
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:17,470
we're trying to gotta let you guys know
what's going on. So here's what you do.

209
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,870
If you want a sticker, if you don't
want to do it, don't fucking do it.

210
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,200
But if you want to do it, all you
need to do is text all capitals.

211
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,480
No Space Bill Burns, B I l.

212
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:30,481
L B U R R two four four two two two.

213
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,750
Reggie Jackson, Doug
Flutie, Derek fucking job.

214
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:39,220
Fuck that. Jerry Remy, the
rem dog. It was his day today.

215
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,210
I would've said Derek Cheetah, uh, 44,

216
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:46,990
22 to two fours, three twos.

217
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,410
You got it for a sticker and
then we'll be bugging you.

218
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:53,290
Let you know what's going on with all
these great shows. We have coming up,

219
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,400
you know, we got Bobby Lee, we got al
Madrigal, we got all these fucking people.

220
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,380
All right, we have Ari shifts here. Um,

221
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,400
all right. So anyways, and I
gotta be honest with you, uh,

222
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,750
after these last six
games, red sox, Yankees,

223
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,050
and having money on the game,
I got to be honest with you,

224
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,910
after all these years saying, Pete
rose shouldn't be in the hall of fame,

225
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,810
the man was right betting on
baseball. It makes it better.

226
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,680
It does makes it fuck. It
makes you care. You know,

227
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,650
you think October, baseball is exciting.

228
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:33,280
Puts your paycheck on a fucking
game in August. All right?

229
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,870
You don't need Joe Buck and all those
extra fucking microphones to make that

230
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:38,704
exciting

231
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,390
do to my gay Camaro with tee tops.
Am I going to be homeless? You know,

232
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,680
that's the type, but that's,

233
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,810
that's the type of stakes that you want
to raise a, I'm calling it right now.

234
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,150
Patriots, giants, the
rubber game this year.

235
00:13:57,151 --> 00:14:02,020
Super Bowl patriots.
Finally fucking win, right?

236
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,420
No helmet. Catch no fucking owl Brady
to Welker fucking two foot pass.

237
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,080
It goes in complete Nova. Sanjay
Samuel dropping the fucking ball,

238
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,410
none of that shit. We're finally
going to beat those constant,

239
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,030
you know why Tom Kaufland? No, Tom
Coffins going to be the difference.

240
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,560
I love what the giants giant's doing.
I think. I think they're going to,

241
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,890
you know, and they got fucking Eli.

242
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,330
He's got ice fucking water
in his face. All right.

243
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,250
Their team is looking good.
All right. And I'm telling you,

244
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,980
that team's looking good cause I've
paid attention for about eight minutes

245
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:38,670
during this preseason and uh, I've,

246
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,560
I've just been hearing a lot of
chatter about weapons being added in,

247
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,350
in field goal kickers and all of this
type of shit. And people questioning Ely,

248
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,470
right? He's, he sits there and he's
dockers in his fucking, uh, you know,

249
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:51,640
I dunno what he's, you know, oh,

250
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,650
he always looks like he just did the
right thing the way he dresses. Right.

251
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,910
The loafers, the fucking
pants, the sweater, you know,

252
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,900
just like he dresses the way I should
be dressing in my age and he's like

253
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:08,950
fucking 12 years younger than me and
the man gets the fucking job done.

254
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,460
The later the season is and forget about
in January the man, his light's out.

255
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,700
Okay. Telling you,

256
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,170
telling you it's going to be a
rematch and we're going to win and I,

257
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,270
that's the fucking team I want to play.

258
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,480
That is the fucking team I want to
play cause we got nothing to lose.

259
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,620
They got everything to lose.

260
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:30,350
Cause if they're two one oh they can talk
shit for the rest of the fucking time.

261
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,160
I want another shot. Right.

262
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,260
The fuck two one oh three
and oh I don't give a fuck.

263
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,360
That doesn't make any difference.
But if we get that last one,

264
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,450
the guy then move and then we can give
them shit. I, you know what the fuck.

265
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:47,100
You know it's not they I dropped the
fucking ball and it was a screenplay,

266
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,930
you know, whatever. Whatever we
got you then it's 10 it's over.

267
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,040
Then when we got that thing we can say
back. That's what I'm saying. You know,

268
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,130
cause I've ran to a couple of giants
fair. They're like oh direct. No,

269
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,920
you don't fucking want, why don't we
want it that just logos at this point.

270
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,430
Eli's probably the only guy left
from that 2017 and I bet at least,

271
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,270
I don't know, three quarters of the
both teams are gone since the last one.

272
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,660
That's why I never get
into those types of stats.

273
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,060
Go and let these guys will store ugly
if not the little good, little bigger.

274
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,250
It's like it's all different.

275
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,510
It's all different people wearing
the same clothes with better drugs,

276
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,100
better drugs, better drugs
in their system. Okay.

277
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,840
Just like the drugs that was sent to
a particular quarterback's wife. Okay.

278
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,440
Cause she hurt her arm taking
cookies out of the oven. Okay.

279
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:38,110
It was a complete non-story. However,

280
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,040
had that guy taking a queef
worth of air out of a ball,

281
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,330
all of his rings would've been
questioned. That's how it works. Okay.

282
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:51,230
We're taking callers. Um,
you know what I did today,

283
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,270
you know, he was funny. I did so much,
so many fucking positive things today.

284
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,930
So many. This, this
podcast is not one of them,

285
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:02,710
but I did so many fucking
positive things today. You know?

286
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,770
And then my wife, my wife,

287
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,400
she still had the nerve to be moody.

288
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,680
And I don't know about you guys, but,
oh, what the fuck goes on. Thank you.

289
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,130
I don't know about you. I
don't want to put up with that.

290
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,750
I don't put up with the moodiness.
Okay. Come on. What do I gotta do here?

291
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,840
What happened? Fucking
thing just died on me here.

292
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,250
There we go. Um, I don't put up with
that Moody Shit. If I did something,

293
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,670
you got me. I'm sorry. All
right. I said, I'm sorry. No,

294
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,410
that Moody Shit. If I do
fucking nine things right,

295
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:41,170
and then the 10 things wrong and then
you're going to get home booty with me,

296
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,010
I swear to God, I swear to God, I just,

297
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,280
that's it. You know, and I do, I, I
go, hey, hey, grumpy. What's going on?

298
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,540
And if she doesn't fucking snap out of
it, then then, then I just shut down,

299
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,070
you know? And then you don't, you
know, I'm fucking German. Irish,

300
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,930
you want to play the silence game? I
could do this all fucking do this forever.

301
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,400
All right. You think there's a
lot of silence and master of none.

302
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,190
Let me tell you something right
now. I can do fucking silence.

303
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,720
I don't know why I'm making this motion
with my hand. I grew up with that shit.

304
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,180
Rage. Silence. You know, days going by.

305
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,880
Hey you dumb consol. Gonna Stare at
the sun tomorrow. Do yourself a favor.

306
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,740
Just wait for the pictures.
You know what I mean?

307
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,460
Looking at a fucking lunar
eclipse or solar eclipse.

308
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:33,120
Whatever the fuck's going on
here. It's a lunar eclipse, right?

309
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,100
Is it the lunar eclipse?

310
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,990
There's the one I learned that when the
earth is between the sun and the moon,

311
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:42,610
the moon turns red

312
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,980
cause it deflects the
fucking light or something.

313
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,850
The only reason why I know this is cause
this shit's happening on Monday and one

314
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:52,650
of the writers in the
writers room knew this shit.

315
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,130
And then there's the other one with
a moon passes in front of the sun.

316
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:59,970
Oh my God. Is Avid nap in
for 37 38 fucking years.

317
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,763
Um,

318
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,210
did you see that little,
not a meme? Was it a Jif,

319
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:11,270
that thing going around
about that newscaster that
actually we'll use to like he

320
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,110
used to watch him when I was a kid
and he said a that little that,

321
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,510
that a club said I was a
little [inaudible] and there's
not going to be another

322
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:22,600
one in 38 years and
let's hope that when it,

323
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,010
it fucking happens on a world
that knows nothing but peace,

324
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,190
you know? And everybody's like, Whoa,

325
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,403
okay,

326
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,770
wow. He said that and then wow.
It's just like, what are you,

327
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,870
we've never been at peace ever, ever.

328
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,300
Never will be. They'll never be world
peace. They'll never be world with the,

329
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,260
the level of, of violence that would
have to occur for there to be peace.

330
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,110
You'd have to be the last person on
earth because if there's another person,

331
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,310
if there was just two people,

332
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:59,540
at some point the other person is going
to annoy you and then there goes to

333
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,720
peace.

334
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,553
Right.

335
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,620
That's what happened with Adam and eve.

336
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,550
I hate to tell you what all you people
out there that believe we came from

337
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:11,870
fucking the ocean. I
actually believe in, in,

338
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:15,300
in creationism, whatever
the fuck they call it.

339
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,243
All right.

340
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,790
There was two white people that
started all of this in somehow we had,

341
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,090
yeah,

342
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,600
all the other races out of them.

343
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,483
Um,

344
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,130
he's two white people,
right? Adam and eve,

345
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,370
and they got annoyed with each
other. So she goes for a walk, right.

346
00:20:36,371 --> 00:20:39,550
The snake gets in a rare,
next thing, you know. Right.

347
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,653
Hm.

348
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,590
She goes over and she bites an apple,
which for whatever reason is, is healthy.

349
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:48,550
It's a good thing. It's got fiber in it.

350
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,393
You know?

351
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,800
I don't understand why the man,

352
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:56,770
the visible guy was upset by
that because you know what?

353
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:58,870
It was an apple with
the sugar in it. Like,

354
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:03,220
because there was no weed or coke
or meth or anything like that.

355
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:08,020
Like apples where I guess the
heroin back then. And he said,

356
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,270
let me tell you two little
shits something. All right,

357
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,890
you want to live in this fucking
garden of Eden here? Well though,

358
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,690
yeah. Stay away from
the fucking apple tree.

359
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,203
That's it.

360
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,190
She went down and she'd
probably be like, Hey, you know,

361
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:27,250
I'm going to go down and eat one of
those fucking apples and fucking,

362
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:29,050
what's his face, whatever.
Was it a brother?

363
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,110
I don't know what went and the none
of that fucking is anybody religious

364
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,200
listening to this shit. How to
fuck the two white people. Okay,

365
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,210
fuck and create all different
races of people. Forget about that.

366
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,310
How have you just have to f two fucking
people and then they bang and then what?

367
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,250
How do you keep it going?
Their kids have to fuck.

368
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,320
Exactly. You had nothing. Didn't yet.

369
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,190
Their kids have to fuck.

370
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,740
And then their kids kids. Fuck.

371
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,750
Is that how we went from Adam
and Eve to fucking cavemen?

372
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,440
Neander talls and those other fucking
people with those slopey foreheads,

373
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,080
you know? And that that
fucking Frankenstein brow,
which I kind of have is that,

374
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
is that what happened?

375
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Because Adam and eve banged and then their
kids had to fair to sit down and say,

376
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:30,890
children,

377
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,020
you have to fuck one another in
order to keep this thing going.

378
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,050
All right.

379
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,840
None of it makes sense.

380
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,560
None of those stories fucking make sense
anymore than the fat guy in the red

381
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:50,020
fucking suit going down a God
damn Chimi okay. First of all,

382
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,790
if it was fucking true,

383
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,680
all these new homes without
fireplaces would not have a Christmas.

384
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,580
What a parents who live in
houses without fireplaces, say,

385
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:01,840
okay.

386
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,920
You know, up on the housetop
reindeer paws out jumps,

387
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:08,410
good old Santa Claus looking for chimney,

388
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:13,390
but there isn't one gets back and say
you have no fun. Go Fuck Yourself. Right?

389
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,130
No, guide him toys. Go Fuck
Yourself. Go to child world.

390
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,510
All right, now he, that's,
that's part of his contract.

391
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:25,960
You leave cookies and there's a fucking
chimney or that's it. It's over.

392
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,343
Okay.

393
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,470
That and evidently he has no interest
in anybody who's not Christian.

394
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,240
He makes toys for everybody
unless they're not Christian.

395
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,710
You know what it is? It's everyone.

396
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,450
We were tribes and we had these tribes
and we just came up with these fucking

397
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:50,901
stories.

398
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:54,440
And as it expanded and everybody started
fucking interact and all the holes in

399
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:58,670
our shit, you know, once she got
that global view, that all fucked up.

400
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,010
All of a sudden the world
wasn't flat, you know,

401
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:05,070
depending on what basketball play you'd
talk to, it was round. He followups.

402
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,240
I needed to found out that it was fucking
round. These people aren't Indians,

403
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,370
they're not from the fuck. And then I'm
from India, they're from American Mac.

404
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,160
Right? The greatest fuck. Oh by
the way, I forgot to say, you know,

405
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:17,840
if you go to tech, I just fucked up.

406
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:21,290
If you go to texts that they were not
sending a sticker oversee. By the way,

407
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,660
this is just for Americans
only by Americans.

408
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:28,910
I mean United States of
America, maybe Canada,

409
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:31,070
I didn't know he can't do it
cause it's a fucking sticker.

410
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:34,910
And then they got to fill out forms.
I should have said that earlier.

411
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,300
You know, I should have done a lot of
things in life, but I gotta tell you what,

412
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:39,560
not telling you guys that, you know,

413
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:44,561
if you text that fucking number and it's
in international and the stickers.com

414
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:49,640
and that's probably one of my biggest
regrets other than the fact the last time

415
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:52,910
I didn't watch an eclipse, you know,

416
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,820
there was a guy wishing for world
peace the next time it came around.

417
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,610
And now here we are 38 fucking
years later, 38 years later.

418
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,990
Are we any closer?

419
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,183
Yeah.

420
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:08,860
You know,

421
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,640
I'm sure somebody said that in the 1940s
after fucking Hitler and Stalin and all

422
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:17,560
that shit a, you know, there was a,
uh, last night there was a typhoon,

423
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,860
I hope the next time
there's a typhoon, it's, uh,

424
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,690
killing innocent people in a peaceful
world. It's never going to happen.

425
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,520
Well, Jesus,

426
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,520
build that with that fucking ad to the
children have to fuck when we return.

427
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,590
Part two of the Adam and Eve story,
the story no one wanted to show you.

428
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,520
Um, all right. So anyways, I've been, uh,

429
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,900
only fucking minutes into this pilot's
Shit podcast that I do in my 25,

430
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,940
26 minutes,

431
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:52,930
people 26 minutes as some of the most
ignorant shit you're ever going to listen

432
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:57,820
to yet you continue to listen,
you continue to listen.

433
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,390
Um, all right. You know what I did to I,

434
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:04,660
so I did all this productive
shit today and yes, my wife,

435
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,310
she started pulling the
grumpy thing, right?

436
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,100
Like I was going to wake up
this morning, bad, do what?

437
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,280
They'll do it and I was going
to go play drums. All right.

438
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:14,590
Which I'm still gonna do, but
I'm gonna do it tonight. Okay.

439
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:17,380
But I could tell she was
tired or whatever. Okay.

440
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:20,890
So the advantage macro half that you lady,

441
00:26:20,891 --> 00:26:25,090
hey ya lay has, is when the kids crying,

442
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,460
they always have the option of the boob.

443
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,590
Bam instant shut it, right.
Puts the kid to sleep.

444
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,570
They feel comfort and
all that type of stuff.

445
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,900
The only way that a man can compete in
that arena is you have to either put the

446
00:26:40,811 --> 00:26:44,340
kid in the car and drive
around block a few times.

447
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,900
Or what I think is better,

448
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:48,540
you just put the kid in the stroller
and you just walk around the block.

449
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,500
Now you're burning some of your
dad bod calories. You know,

450
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:54,960
your kid gets to look around
and see a bunch of stuff.

451
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,930
Fucking acid trip birds flying
around, jets, cars, trees, right.

452
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:05,800
Everything's amazing to them. And
then eventually they fall asleep. Um,

453
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,760
so anyways, I could tell my wife, my
wife was really sleepy, so I said,

454
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:13,720
all right, you know, she goes,

455
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,420
it'd be really nice if you
can just take it for a walk.

456
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,020
Cause she was up and my wife wasn't
and I was just like, all right,

457
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:22,110
I was going to work out. I'll go play
drums. You know what? Fuck it, I'll do it.

458
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,180
So I did, went on a nice long walk, did
the whole thing. We had a great time.

459
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,220
She finally fell asleep
after like 20 minutes.

460
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,670
She finally falls asleep and then I
walked around like extra, you know,

461
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,630
take an extra long, you
know, walk home and you know,

462
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,460
walking further past the house, coming
back up, come back up. You know,

463
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,420
my wife's still downstairs. I can tell
she's still sleeping. We hung out.

464
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:52,920
We had breakfast together,
right? I watched a little, the,

465
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,650
the Jerry Remy, you know, Jerry
Remy Day at Fenway Park, um,

466
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,420
just did all of that. And then she
didn't come upstairs till like fucking,

467
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,220
I dunno, 1130, 11 o'clock or something,

468
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,660
something like that. Then she goes,
all right, let's go out today. We said,

469
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,600
we are gonna go out and I'm God,
let's go out. Let's go out. So

470
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,500
she gets the kid ready and
everything, but the fucking shoes,

471
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:21,840
I tried to put the shoes on, I
just can't do it. I can't do it.

472
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:25,650
She tries to kick them off. I start
laughing and I can't get him on.

473
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,540
And I finally got one of them on.

474
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,360
I realized they had it on the
wrong foot and I was like,

475
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:33,660
fucking and undo the buckle. And
then I finally got it on right.

476
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,110
And she just kicked it off. And I
just laughed. I said, I can't do it.

477
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,400
I can't do it. And they left. She's like,
really? And I said, yeah. I go, look,

478
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:43,890
there's some things you're better at
than I am. You're just better at this,

479
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:46,410
right. So I leave. She goes,
where are you going? I said,

480
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:48,750
I'm gonna go watch the red sox. She
goes, well come down here and watch it.

481
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,591
So I said, okay.

482
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:54,591
So then I went upstairs and she told me
how her tire pressure was down and uh,

483
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,560
I was trying to remember how to do that
cause I knew I had the tire pressure

484
00:28:58,561 --> 00:28:59,460
fucking thing. You know,

485
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,970
you stick the thing on there so you don't
overinflate you don't under inflate.

486
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,930
I'm looking up that we got a little
water bubbler. We're all out of water.

487
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:08,790
It's a good opportunity to
clean the fucking thing.

488
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:12,810
I'm looking at Shit like that
when I'm up there. So, uh,

489
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:18,410
I didn't go back downstairs and she came
upstairs fucking pissed at me cause she

490
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:22,950
spent like whatever the next 15 minutes
trying to get ready with my daughter

491
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,900
downstairs for change to stand. There
must have been a pain in the ass,

492
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:28,500
but I was up there
fucking, you know. Yeah.

493
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,270
See she gets in a mood now.
She's in a mood, not yelling,

494
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,590
you know, not flipping out just in a mood.

495
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,250
You know, they know when
they get in the fucking mood,

496
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,300
I get this look on their face,

497
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:46,390
they stop looking at you and they make
sure that they keep walking into the room

498
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:48,220
that you're in. You know what?

499
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:51,220
You talk to them and they barely say
anything back. So you, you know what?

500
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:55,210
So you know what? Come on guys,
let's, let's learn something here.

501
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,900
So you are aware that
she's in a watt [inaudible]

502
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,963
hmm.

503
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,720
Oh Jesus. Somebody is
in a mood. I'm sorry.

504
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,920
Did I do 99 out of a hundred
things? Jesus fucking Christ.

505
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,903
Okay,

506
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,750
so she's in a fucking mood.
Then I gotta go out. You know,

507
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:20,560
cause I got my fucked up driveway.
I got to get my car out of the way.

508
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,420
Bring her fucking car out. Cause you
got to get the fucking air on the tires.

509
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:28,330
Oh and I'm out though all you think I'm
muddle. I put on a clinic of Muttering,

510
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,350
Huh? Fuck. [inaudible] gonna kill up
to Goddamn fucking, he'll come down,

511
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,570
make a pack of fucking [inaudible]
and clean out the water bubble.

512
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,190
And I got to come home, right Henry Hill.

513
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,610
Um,

514
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,200
so that's it. And I'm like, all right,

515
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:49,640
I will match your mood with an
even dumber moot. So that's it.

516
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,250
So then she starts to sense,
then I'm going to fucking mood.

517
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,300
Now we'll share mood.
Put me in a fucking mood.

518
00:30:54,301 --> 00:30:57,750
Now she's sensing that I'm in this
fucking mood. So now all of a sudden,

519
00:30:57,751 --> 00:31:01,080
what does she do? She starts
flipping it around, being nice,

520
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,470
right? Then I'm just giving
a fucking quick answers.

521
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:10,930
Like Jerry Lewis rest his
soul passed away today.

522
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,640
Dick Gregory few days ago, and
now Jerry Lewis, Jerry Lewis,

523
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:19,240
arguably one of the funniest
human beings that ever lived,

524
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,031
ever lived.

525
00:31:21,031 --> 00:31:25,890
He actually spoke at my college
graduation and he was phenomenal.

526
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,720
He did the parent student
breakfast. And when he did that,

527
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:35,190
he was crazy. Jerry. And then
when he spoke in my college,

528
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,910
he was, uh, coming down the aisle. He was
still crazy. You know, when they bring

529
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,000
[inaudible] [inaudible] know fucking
the fucking with the Dean and all those

530
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,020
people come down with there who we have
a special colored Tassel, you know,

531
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,840
we're higher than you. You know,
they come down in their robes.

532
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,980
Well he was coming down and he put his
hands on the shoulder of the person in

533
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:56,480
front of him.

534
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,280
He hit one of those dumb hats on too
when he put his hands and when he walked

535
00:31:59,281 --> 00:32:03,840
down, we just going whoa down
and everyone was dying laughing.

536
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,310
But when he went to give the speech,
he was telethon. Jerry, it was great.

537
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:09,930
You got to see the full gamut of the guy.

538
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,013
Um,

539
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,650
absolutely love that guy. That guy
made me laugh like nobody's business.

540
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:18,900
So very sad day in a Dick Gregory.

541
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,110
I learned about him obviously being a
comedian long time ago. Read that book.

542
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,690
Callison my soul. Um,

543
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,590
all those stories about him being one
of the first black guys to ever worked

544
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:30,900
like white rooms. You know,

545
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,640
the playboy mansion in Chicago playing
that because what's his face there?

546
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:37,680
Hugh Hefner was cool enough
to let him play there.

547
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:42,590
So rest and peace to both
of them. Um, so anyways,

548
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:46,220
so now this all pales in comparison
to those two comedy giants. All right,

549
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:50,160
so I match my wife's mood
with my mood. All right,

550
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,850
so now she's not done. Okay,

551
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,480
now she's trying to be nice to
get me out of my fucking mood,

552
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,420
cause then she realizes this
is all silent. By the way,

553
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,620
this is all body language, all Kurt
little answers, one of these things.

554
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:08,150
Now she realizes that, oh, I took my
mood too far. I overly made my point,

555
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,320
which justified him now being
in his fucking mood, right?

556
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,340
So then at some point she
finally just goes, Hey, I,

557
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:19,400
I you just gonna like she goes,

558
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:21,470
are you going to be in a bad mood
for the rest of the day? I'm like,

559
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm not in a bad mood. I'm in a
great mood. We have an awesome house.

560
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,910
I tell jokes for a living, we're going
to go get, we're going to go out today.

561
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,720
I'm in a good mood. I have the
day off. I am in a good mood.

562
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,680
You on the other hand, I don't know.
She goes, I'm over it. I'm over it.

563
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:39,450
And I go, fine. Somebody
is just going to like,

564
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,450
you know, like that talked
to me. I said, look,

565
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:46,020
we're going out shopping for kid's
shoes the second I see kids shoes,

566
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:48,570
it just puts me in a good mood.
[inaudible] they fucking adorable.

567
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,360
Those little Jordans,
the little shell toes.

568
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:55,170
It's a kids clothes are the
cutest fucking things ever.

569
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,760
They're not even for
kids. They're for adults.

570
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,750
See some little sport call you
like, no. Yeah, you can't help it.

571
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,241
So I told her, I said,

572
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:08,570
just let me get to the fucking kids
sneakers and then that'll put me in a a

573
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:11,580
better fucking mood. Um,

574
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,840
do you know what I saw
today? It's some fucking, um,

575
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,200
okay.

576
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,890
Over on Labrea they got
this, they got this store.

577
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,760
It's just all these crazy signs
and all of this basically junk,

578
00:34:26,861 --> 00:34:30,860
just shit from businesses
that shut down or remodel.

579
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:35,230
And this guy just has all these
fucking sad, sad did and went then.

580
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,640
So I'm walking up and they
actually had the old school,

581
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,880
the little McDonald's arch with the Arrow
that said drive through open 24 hours.

582
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:52,330
That's what put me in a good mood.
All that. All the childhood memories.

583
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:55,690
We were a McDonald's family. We
were not a burger king family.

584
00:34:55,691 --> 00:35:00,220
That was a big thing back then.
You know, nobody talked politics.

585
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,920
She didn't talk fucking religion. Okay.

586
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:07,690
You talked about sports and what do you
like better? Coca Pepsi, coke or Pepsi.

587
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:12,670
McDonald's at Burger King. Those were
the big fucking debates back then.

588
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,320
And um,

589
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,080
okay,

590
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,120
I was out. We will have a
McDonald's fucking family.

591
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:21,570
We used to go to this McDonald's, I
don't even know where the fuck it was.

592
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,880
I was like in PBT or north Redding way
back in the early seventies it was off.

593
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,750
It was near these railroad tracks.

594
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,210
And I remember there was these fucking
seagulls and pigeons and shit and you'd

595
00:35:36,211 --> 00:35:38,820
be eating outside then
throwing them French fries

596
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,770
and then you got to see a train
go by and it was the cool,

597
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,720
this is like pride pad's pre
Fuckin, you know, Internet.

598
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:53,070
There was nothing to do. Cartoons,
we are, our UHF antenna was busted.

599
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:56,610
I could only watch cartoons on Saturday.
So this was a big fucking deal.

600
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,810
I'd always get a cheeseburger,
small fry and a chocolate shake.

601
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:04,020
That's what the fuck I had, you know,

602
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,100
for a long fucking time past when
it wasn't filling me up. You know?

603
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:09,480
But you were afraid of
your dad. It's like,

604
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,280
I'm not gonna ask for a quarter
pounder with cheese. I don't know.

605
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,080
I don't know what this is going
to do to the whole dynamic. Every,

606
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:16,450
everybody's in a good mood. I'm not,

607
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,410
I'm not going to try to
fucking go up a size here.

608
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,020
That's how Americans got fed. Once Dad
became dad's, became their kids friends,

609
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,050
they weren't afraid to, to
fucking supersize their meals.

610
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,590
The last four years of
ordering a cheeseburger,

611
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:33,630
small fry and chocolate
freak chick, I was still,

612
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:35,070
I was fucking starving at the end of it.

613
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,380
I bawled and my younger
brother's cheeseburger like,

614
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,090
you're going to fucking finish that
high. You little fucking gummy bear.

615
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,860
You know your fucking
teeth. I'll eat it. Um,

616
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,870
so anyways, I saw that thing today
and I was just like, I would fuck it.

617
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:54,420
I don't, I'm not in the
junk. I'm not in this stuff,

618
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,830
but there's something about that thing.

619
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,040
I just think it's fucking cool to
get it fixed up as the f the a,

620
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:03,270
the fucking base was all bent in shit,

621
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,010
but to fix that fucking thing
up, I was like, I just don't,

622
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:11,130
I won't say I'll stick that at the end
of my driveway. Yeah. That thing lit up.

623
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:14,860
Okay.

624
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:19,450
Well my wife's like, uh, you know, say
no neighbors would hate us. It's like,

625
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:22,450
I know the anus, I would never stick
it out there if I had like, you know,

626
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,690
buying some giant fucking house. Right.
You know, and there was some sort of,

627
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,130
I don't know what, you know,
those fucking houses, those,

628
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:36,370
those Republicans have them, you know,

629
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,130
I'm not saying there's not rich liberals,

630
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:43,780
but the Republicans live in those states
where you can fucking have a house and

631
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:47,740
then another house on your property.
You know, you have an old barn,

632
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,270
you know, you just let your wife, your
wife gets the fucking house. They,

633
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,320
I'm telling you, this is my
fucking dream, my dream. Right.

634
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,120
Um, you know, but I mean,
I would love to live.

635
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,590
I can't live out their interracial couple.

636
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:05,860
I can't go out there and to
fucking Nazi land, you know,

637
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,020
all these fucking people marching around.

638
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,693
Okay.

639
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,913
Uh, but anyways,

640
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,910
I would love to have a fucking old house
in one of those states that still has

641
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:20,010
clean air, if that even exists.

642
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:25,020
And he just got a giant
fucking what used to be a barn.

643
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,370
And on the bottom you'd
have your daily driver,

644
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:33,810
your classic car, and like a
fucking sick motorcycle. All right.

645
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,990
And then up top I'd have it fucking close.
They'd be at, I always told you this,

646
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,330
be a drum room fucking place to workout.

647
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,100
And the rest of it is just a
fucking cigar bar, you know,

648
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,290
and did some stupid fucking reason.

649
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,110
I would five find a place for that
McDonald's drive through side,

650
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,203
you know?

651
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:57,340
But the more my wife hated it, the more
it would drive me into the barn. Um,

652
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,210
anyways, let's read some advertising
here for this week, shall we?

653
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,340
Okay.

654
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,370
I always it at Burger King. Try to act
like our burgers are flame broiled. Yeah.

655
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:10,570
And then frozen and driven in a fucking
truck across the country. You know,

656
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,430
you still, we showed it in a commercial,

657
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,170
like to sit in there with some
fucking open grill back there,

658
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,180
cooking these fucking things
in. I cook at these things.

659
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,160
A logo was hey. Oh my God man. Boop, boop.

660

[inaudible] [inaudible] Burger King
or Mickey Days Dodo too. To me.

661
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,910

662
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:38,630
but comma fat fuck and your
stomach saying it over tidy.

663
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:41,090
Fucking whities wages not.

664
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,800
Wouldn't it be nice if they were cradle
in a nice piece of fucking velvet?

665
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,720
I'm beyond. Is everybody

666
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,340
okay?

667
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,650
Do you want to look good in your
underwear and be comfortable?

668
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,653
Well, doe, yeah,

669
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,240
but that right balance is hard to find.

670
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,970

They just deliver them right to

your head gets to feel
what? Your nuts feel, right?

naturally thought fabric that is
evidently three times softer than cotton.

684
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,220

fighting words right there.

743
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,970
How's ZipRecruiter is
different with ZipRecruiter?

744
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,080

747
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,420
anyone else. That's why ZipRecruiter
is different. Unlike other job sites,

748
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,170
Sip Ben doesn't depend on candidates
finding you. It finds them. In fact,

all of these fucking places?

I almost read that.

761
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:39,480
Okay.

762
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,820
How has ZipRecruiter been
advertising with me this long?

763
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:45,780
And they don't really have stupid ims.
You fucking, you never saw anchorman.

764
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,810
God Damn it. Who put that question mark
there? That's me. I will. If it's there,

773
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,260
They got to go better than that.

774

like the horse legs down the
street, stamps.com never closes.

775
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:38,870
Okay,

776
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,050
well wait a minute. That would mean
the other hurts her. She closes.

777
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,320
I don't like that. Prude down
the street. I fucked it up, man.

She's right down the street.
She's easy. She's reliable.

782
00:46:59,271 --> 00:47:03,800
Always wants to fucking, God knows
she's flexible. Um, call to action.

783
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,770
All right. I use stamps.com because why?

784
00:47:06,771 --> 00:47:10,160

786

00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:50,020
um, I really fucking
enjoy that and I actually,

796
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,620
I think I like it better than Formula
One because there's all kinds of passing.

797
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,200
There's no passing in Formula
One, it seems after, you know,

798
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:03,740
as far as the first guy, that's my
big complaint. And they're like, God,

799
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,090
there's all this amazing racing and in
position four and five and six, well,

800
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,020
fucking show that. Um,

801
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,990
anyways, let me, let me just plow ahead
here. Uh, me undies every, no, no,

802
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:18,580
I already did that.
Let me, let me ask. No,

803
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,130
I'll read the questions for this week.
This is what we're supposed to be doing.

804
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:25,840
All right. Okay. Boyfriends, Facebook,
all this is never good. Alright.

805
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,510
Hi Bill. Straight to the
point, me and my boyfriend,

806
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:32,920
we've been together for two years
now and we're happy. Smiley face.

807
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:37,120
The thing that concerns me is that a
few times on his Facebook messenger,

808
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:42,121
I saw that he is writing on a weekly
basis with an ex college colleague of his,

809
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,060
a beautiful young lady.

810
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,080
The thing is that they were
close at work back then,

811
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:53,740
but he quit three months ago and
I just don't believe in Male,

812
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:58,180
female friendships. I'm talking from
experience also when we were one.

813
00:48:58,181 --> 00:49:00,550
Basically if I, you know, if
we're having a conversation,

814
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,130
if we're talking eventually we're
gonna fuck is what you're saying.

815
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,720
Also when we're watching
some videos and stuff on his,

816
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,550
on his phone in the search field,
I saw a list of a few girls names.

817
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,080
Other than that,

818
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,130
he has been great to me and hasn't
shown any signs of a man who are yet,

819
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,520
am I too suspicious or do
I have the right to worry?

820
00:49:21,521 --> 00:49:25,840
Thanks and go fuck yourself. I
don't fuck. That's not enough.

821
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,570
That's not enough
information. Um, I wouldn't,

822
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:33,460
you know this ex colleague,
that's a beautiful lady.

823
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,600
Yeah, that's weird. That's you're
right. That's fucking weird.

824
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,060
Um, I dunno about the fucking phone
shit. That's a, I have no idea.

825
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,360
I have no idea what that's about.
But that, that thing there, yeah,

826
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:49,450
that's definitely a red
flag. You know what I mean?

827
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,780
Like we'll put yourself in his
position if you will fucking, you know,

828
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:57,781
close with some guy and you left the job
three months ago and you still chat on

829
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,790
Facebook and you know,

830
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,880
here's the thing about women that
they can sit there and be like, oh,

831
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:06,460
I thought we were just friends. They
seem to be able to get away with that.

832
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,580
But I would always say to the woman
I was with, I was like, listen,

833
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:13,870
can I tell you something? That
guy wants to fuck you. Okay.

834
00:50:13,871 --> 00:50:18,140
I don't care how much you have in common
and how you both like fucking Rosé and

835
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:22,030
whatever the fuck it is. And he
really listens to you when you talk.

836
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:26,950
He wants to fuck you. Um,
yeah. So I don't know.

837
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:30,200
You do there because you went on
his Facebook and you're snooping.

838
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:34,340
So that's one of the thing, you know, if
you're going to pull that ah ha moment,

839
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:38,540
you better be right. Cause if you're
not, then they get to play the, you know,

840
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:44,300
how dare you snoop, you know,
how dare you fucking snoop on me.

841
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:48,200
It's just like, I mean,
don't women have the out?

842
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,350
Why you snooping on me?
Because you have a dick sir.

843
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,393
Okay.

844
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,350
That's why I trust you. I don't trust
you dick. Alright. Missed opportunities.

845
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:02,720
I I, I would bring it up.
I Dunno if you bring it up.

846
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:03,830
I don't have enough information.

847
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:07,130
That was a really quick and to the
point which I, I really appreciate,

848
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:12,200
but I'm watching some videos
and stuff in the search field.

849
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:16,430
I saw a list of a few girls names. That's
not good either. I don't fucking know,

850
00:51:16,431 --> 00:51:18,650
but I don't know who the girls
are, but that are right there that,

851
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:23,600
that fucking ex colleague
think. I Dunno. I Dunno.

852
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,770
Um, that seems like a blow job in the
future to me. That's what I would,

853
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:30,440
if I was standing in front of a
green screen, a little meteorologist,

854
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,780
there'd be a fucking, you know,

855
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,800
Dick floating towards a woman with
their mouth open down south. Alright.

856
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:41,000
Missed opportunity. Hey Billy Buckaroo
I'm going back to school soon.

857
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,200
Within the next week.

858
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:47,201
Actually I got an offer a couple of
days ago to register for a class a this

859
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:50,980
upcoming semester that is
essentially a paid internship. It,

860
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,200
it entailed working with a
company called Sun Corporation.

861
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:58,280
Why is my stomach growling?
Because I'm on a diet, um,

862
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,980
called Sun Corp on a software project. Uh,

863
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:08,420
if you complete the internship, you
get paid a couple of hundred dollars,

864
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,470
like two or 300 and of course something
worth putting on your resume for job

865
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:16,070
hunting. But the thing
is that I turned it down.

866
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,000
I didn't think it would mean that much
to take it as I don't really need the

867
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:22,790
money and software engineering
majors are for the most part,

868
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:25,430
guaranteed a job after graduation. Plus,

869
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:28,190
I only have one semester left and it's
looking like it's going to be pretty

870
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:31,820
tough and it's locally. It's going
to be pretty tough anyway. All right,

871
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:35,360
so you gotta concentrate in schools.
What's the problem? He says, however,

872
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:38,720
I cannot help feel a bit pissed
off at myself for saying no.

873
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:42,380
It's one of those things that has
virtually no negatives to it. I get to,

874
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:46,140
I get work experience and money.
What more could I need anyway?

875
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,700
I can't help but see this as a wasted
opportunity. My question to you is,

876
00:52:49,701 --> 00:52:52,460
have you ever been offered an opportunity
in your community career that you've

877
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:56,480
pissed out, pussied out on and
then heavily regretted later?

878
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:59,860
And could you offer me advice on this?
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. All right.

879
00:52:59,861 --> 00:53:03,500
First of all, dude, it's a fucking
internship. It's your last semester.

880
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,180
It's going to be tough. You know,

881
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,430
you want to fucking go out
and party a little bit.

882
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,240
It's not the worst thing. It's not the
end of the fucking world. And absolutely.

883
00:53:13,241 --> 00:53:16,630
I had, um, oh my God.

884
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,380
Even all kinds of times I pussied
out early in my career. I was afraid.

885
00:53:20,381 --> 00:53:22,840
I was afraid to go on stage.
I was afraid of bombing.

886
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,830
I was afraid of the
whole fucking, so yeah,

887
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:29,340
there was a whole bunch
of times that I did. Um,

888
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,700
so what I would do, I started
to doing moments like that.

889
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,560
My fucking stomach will start,
hey, I gotta eat dinner. Yeah,

890
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:40,410
I was good today for lunch.

891
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:45,360
I had lentil soup and a fucking salad and,

892
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,870
uh, you know, I've just been trying, I've
been trying, I'm laying off the booze.

893
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:51,030
I don't eat fucking sweets, you know,

894
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,240
the writer's room we have fuckin Fridays
and where we just order whatever we

895
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:58,650
want and, uh, fucking they got
barbecue and I just, you know,

896
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:03,210
that's like at my age, that's, that's
like nap food. It's a like drinking,

897
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:07,740
like fucking Nyquil ACEM Shit.
So I can't do that. Um, anyways.

898
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:11,220
Uh, let's see. How would,
how would I answer? Sorry,

899
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:14,430
just click that fucking elbow. Hit the
button there. How would I answer this?

900
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:18,780
I would basically say when I did, was I,

901
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:20,330
okay.

902
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:24,200
I always remember what it felt
like when I pussied out that night.

903
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,530
When I put my head down on the pillow,
my big Charlie Brown fucking head,

904
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:32,180
I put it down on the pillow and I just
would always remember like that awful

905
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:35,400
feeling of of Pussy and
out, you know? And then I,

906
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:39,380
so then the next time that moment
happened, I'd be like, all right, tonight,

907
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:42,530
whether I kill, whether I
bomb with I just to, okay,

908
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,210
I'm going to feel way better

909
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,250
then if I didn't even try. So, but I,

910
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:53,030
I think you'd be in too hard on
your cell phone. This one. I mean,

911
00:54:53,031 --> 00:54:57,530
you didn't pussy up, you just said no.
You seem like you weighed your options.

912
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,410
If you are too afraid to do it, then
I would say that you pussy that.

913
00:55:00,411 --> 00:55:02,810
But I don't think you did. But, um,

914
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:07,310
I don't know if your reasons for
doing it were different. You know,

915
00:55:07,311 --> 00:55:09,770
if there was some sort
of fear involved, uh,

916
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,180
you gotta figure out why you did it and
then you got to forgive yourself for

917
00:55:14,181 --> 00:55:18,470
doing it because it's part of like, you
know, you got to fail to succeed. Right?

918
00:55:18,471 --> 00:55:22,100
You remember that Michael
Jordan commercial, you know,
missed all those shots.

919
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,110
[inaudible] missed all those shots.

920
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,030
They failed over and over and
over and over and over again.

921
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:31,050
That is why I succeed. There you go. Same
fucking thing. Same fucking thing. Um,

922
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:35,720
all right. Nose job. Uh, dear Billy.

923
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:38,990
Mozzarella legs. Um, wow.

924
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,840
Hello? Yeah.

925
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,920
My daughter yelling at me in there.

926
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,143
Yeah,

927
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:51,980
she does this hilarious thing when you're
on the phone, you have it on speaker.

928
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,640
She sees you talking into it
and she just starts going, wow,

929
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,960
what do you yell at about, I can't
find a single pass. You know?

930
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:03,080
I was telling them that
story of how, you know,

931
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,350
I did all that stuff for you this
morning. Then you got into a mood.

932
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,200
So then I matched your
mood with that, my mood,

933
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,180
and then we had that little
game that you play with.

934
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:15,080
Then you try to be nice to get me out
of my mood. You know that little thing.

935
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,990
No, I don't know what
you're talking about, Nia.

936
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:23,090
I don't know what you're talking about.
Nia. What do you want me to say? No,

937
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,063
I'm saying,

938
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:30,470
well I don't know what he's talking
about either. Nia, what, what,

939
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:35,560
what that funny game or you know
you're going to mood and then then,

940
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,520
and then it puts me in a
mood. Then he'd go, okay,

941
00:56:37,521 --> 00:56:39,170
maybe I've took my mood too far.

942
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,140
So now I'll be the one to turn
it around and then you know me,

943
00:56:42,141 --> 00:56:46,790
you always gotta fucking pull me out of
the anger mud, right? Fine. Yeah, sure.

944
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,450
Oh yeah. Can you tell
guys you hear in a voice?

945
00:56:50,451 --> 00:56:55,160
I won't look how beautiful you
are. Find that pacifier. Hey Buddy.

946
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:58,820
How you like to compute or anything
with the screen on it? You like,

947
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:02,600
what are you yelling for? It's
cause you got to have my DNA.

948
00:57:02,601 --> 00:57:07,010
Is that what the problem is? You realize
as you grow up every time you screw up,

949
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,390
I'm going to get blamed for that cause
I'm the screw up in this relationship.

950
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,660
That's right. Talk to the people.

951
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,670
Tell the people what you're feeling,
Huh? Huh? What do you got there?

952
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,860
What are your feelings about, uh,
global warming? What should we do?

953
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,153
Yes.

954
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:29,723
Nothing.

955
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,910
The baby senator was surprisingly quiet
on some of the biggest issues out there.

956
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,320
Hey, how are you liking a
you love and the Avocados,

957
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,350
aren't you the mushed up
Avocados? You liking them? Yeah,

958
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:46,870
she's shy. She, she have Mike
Fright. She doesn't know what it is.

959
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,420
It's probably she didn't grab
it. All right, here we go. Hey,

960
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:53,200
somebody's gonna ask you a question about
a nose job. Some reason my fuck, oops,

961
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:57,730
sorry. Too many Chris here. My
stomach is growling. I'm hungry too.

962
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,530
Yeah. Alright. Nose job.
Dear Billy. Mozzarella lakes.

963
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,160
Wait like the white, like the Mozzarella.

964
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:11,890
I'm a 43 year old married
father of two. Yeah,

965
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:16,120
he liked that up. Very happy with
my life but could use some advice.

966
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:21,120
You see I have a Schnoz. Oh my God. Do
this. And your nose is still bugging you.

967
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,680
43 you married a woman, loves
you. You got a couple of kids.

968
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,810
A real honker a really big nose a
day. I got a big nose over here.

969
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:34,030
Now you want to talk? Huh? I've been
able to get by with the successful life,

970
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:38,020
career and marriage. Um,

971
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,500
but in the back of my mind and okay,

972
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,010
the back of my mind and
whenever I look in the mirror,

973
00:58:45,011 --> 00:58:46,570
I just can't get over my nose.

974
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:52,180
I kind of look like all
the old joke, Groucho Marx,

975
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:58,090
all those old joke, Groucho Marx
with the glasses without glasses. Um,

976
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:02,600
now my question is why are you yelling? I,

977
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:03,161
I you,

978
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:06,180
I gave you the floor and you didn't want
to talk and now you're yelling there.

979
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,780
Acuity. What are you doing? Huh? Well,

980
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:15,490
you say are wrinkles. My Little Sharpei.

981
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:21,860
Um, all right, where am
I now? My question is

982
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,570
being that I've come this
far in life and at my age,

983
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:30,470
do you think it's super vain or
silly to get surgery done? Money.

984
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,170
Money. Your wife is not an issue.

985
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:36,470
I just think it's silly of
me to really want to do this,

986
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:40,520
but it's really affecting me where I
don't want to look at myself in the mirror

987
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:44,300
when I shave or put on context.

988
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:48,970
Thankfully vice and go yank
gage, let's go. Yeah. New,

989
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:56,810
the greatest promo ever. Wheel of
fortune if you can ever find it. Um,

990
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,990
when they went to New York, I
guess went in New York. Huh?

991
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:07,030
That was it. Two second clip.
Um, here's a thing too. I,

992
01:00:07,031 --> 01:00:10,850
I actually don't get surgery. Yeah,
you've got to learn to love yourself.

993
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:14,780
But here's the thing, when
you got a frigging giant nose,

994
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:18,980
it's really defines your face. Like
people, that's what you look like.

995
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:21,410
And then when you shaved
that thing down, you not,

996
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,500
you're not going to look like yourself
anymore. And people are going to be like,

997
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:27,870
you know, I bet. I bet you're

998
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,890
what's wrong with you?
I bet if I talk quieter,

999
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:37,780
I bet that the only person that really
has issue with you knows as you,

1000
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:43,220
you know, your wife loves you, your
kids love you. You got friends,

1001
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:48,950
you find, um, I wouldn't
do it. I wouldn't do okay.

1002
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,790
You think, you think that I
haven't looked into, you know,

1003
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:56,510
whatever Michael Jackson had bleached
out of him to put a little bit of that in

1004
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:58,850
me so I can walk where shorts,

1005
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:06,380
can I have some of that
leftover pigment? Um, look, the,

1006
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:08,180
you always going to have something
by yourself that you don't like.

1007
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,010
I am a firm believer in just
keeping yourself in shape,

1008
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:18,620
yelling over a baby and,
and basically, uh, you know,

1009
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,810
aging naturally you look
way better. All right.

1010
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,210
Whoever makes us knows what
they're doing. Um, however,

1011
01:01:26,211 --> 01:01:29,290
if you're going to go that road
road, I don't know. I don't know.

1012
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:33,760
You better make sure you find somebody
good cause you could end up like that at

1013
01:01:33,761 --> 01:01:35,350
a, that chick from dirty dancing.

1014
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:38,990
I thought it was gorgeous and I
loved her nose. Yeah. I love to know.

1015
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:43,580
She looks beautiful. Yeah. She dyno. I
know she looks at, she looks so cute.

1016
01:01:43,581 --> 01:01:47,480
She got the lead in the movie
with that nose. Barbara Streisand.

1017
01:01:47,481 --> 01:01:51,860
Who else has a very strong
knows Sarah Jessica Parker.

1018
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:54,380
Well what are, who are the
guys that have like strong knew

1019
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,310
Joe Pardoning Joe by Joe Clark.
Nick. Yeah. That was that lady,

1020
01:01:58,311 --> 01:02:01,520
that lady when she made fun of his nose
and he said you need to lose about 40

1021
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:05,990
pounds before you talk to me.
Bitch. One of the great lines ever,

1022
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:09,020
and that her husband turned
around and when she complained,

1023
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:13,980
looked at Joe to one look at Joe and
then started yelling at me. I was like,

1024
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:18,710
you fucking, oh, sorry. Um, I'm not
gonna lie. That's what I would've done.

1025
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:19,860
I would picked the smaller guy.

1026
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:24,600
Wow. What are you saying? What are you
sure you say, pay attention to me, man.

1027
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,140
It's odd to you. Oh, you can talk
to me anytime you want. All right.

1028
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,790
As girlfriend's dad for hand in
marriage and he denied. Oh No,

1029
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:37,710
whoa, whoa. Okay. We've got to read this
one. Whoa. Maybe that'd be quiet. Okay.

1030
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:42,750
This one's is riveting. You gotta
listen to this one, Kiddo. All right.

1031
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:47,310
Hi Sir. Hi Sir. William Berth. Hey Lauren.

1032
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,640
You know what's so funny is the amount
of people they're going to say mean

1033
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:55,100
stuff. I get it. She's
cute, but I swear to God,

1034
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:59,260
if you bring your kid on
that bucket. Um, all right.

1035
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,950
Long Time Fan. Uh, thank
you for all the laugh.

1036
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:04,970
She got me through some hard times
and I am thankful to that. All right,

1037
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,350
that's all. Thank you very much. Anyways,

1038
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,440
I've been dating my current girlfriend
for five years. Come this November.

1039
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,100
I'm 25 and she is 24 I've
been thinking about proposing,

1040
01:03:13,101 --> 01:03:17,900
so I decided to do an old tradition by
asking your father's hand in marriage.

1041
01:03:17,901 --> 01:03:21,770
Now that's f that's a classy
move. The Dad's like that stuff.

1042
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:27,220
I also asked her mother to be sure to
be there as she is very close to both of

1043
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:28,371
them.

1044
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:31,670
I took them out to dinner and I told them
how much I loved her and how much she

1045
01:03:31,671 --> 01:03:33,590
means to me, et Cetera, et cetera.

1046
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:40,230
Once I was done giving my speech, they
just stared at me like I had three heads.

1047
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:45,000
They didn't give me their blessing to
marry their baby and went on saying that

1048
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:48,840
they don't think that I
get along with all that.

1049
01:03:48,841 --> 01:03:51,150
They don't think that I get
along with their siblings well,

1050
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:55,230
and it seemed awkward when
we, the family are together.

1051
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:56,940
Oh my God.

1052
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,550
They said that they felt like I would
try to move their daughter away from her

1053
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:07,551
family because of my job and
she belongs with her family.

1054
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,791
Oh No.

1055
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:13,791
Should I keep dating hoping that something
changes or that the relationship with

1056
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:18,390
their parents can't be repaired or
should I just give up on this five year

1057
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:22,830
relationship? Any help would be greatly
appreciated. Thanks. I call that sucks.

1058
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:27,810
Yes. And I can tell you this
right now, marrying into that.

1059
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,340
I know that f a nightmare. That's
going to be a nightmare. Yeah.

1060
01:04:32,341 --> 01:04:36,660
You better love this girl. Cause I'll
tell you buddy. Yeah. Yeah. That uh,

1061
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:39,600
that sounds like those
parents are going to screw up.

1062
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:44,190
Did they live on a compound that sounds
like the Rayburns in bloodline or

1063
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:47,370
something you're trying to marry into one
of those families? Yeah, I would walk.

1064
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:51,660
He's got to talk to his girlfriend
about it and be like, listen,

1065
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:53,370
I wanted this to be a surprise.

1066
01:04:53,371 --> 01:04:58,350
But I went out and I asked your parents
about getting married because I wanted

1067
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:02,370
to do it the right way and this is what
they told me and see what she says.

1068
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:06,060
Like, and I think you just
kind of go from there.

1069
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,940
But what are they free masons
or something, you know,

1070
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,620
you marry into the family too.

1071
01:05:10,621 --> 01:05:13,380
So if you don't get along with them on
that level and they're already looking at

1072
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:17,410
you [inaudible] it sounds like some
blue blood. Yeah. I don't know.

1073
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:20,020
You know the hedges never
need clipping her away.

1074
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:24,130
She the youngest is she like what
I, I'm just, I'm curious as to,

1075
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,200
did you not see this coming whatsoever?

1076
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,350
Cause I would find that a
little hard to believe. Um,

1077
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,380
but maybe he hadn't spent much time with
the, well, if he didn't see it coming,

1078
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:35,320
that would mean that he's a dope and
maybe that's why they don't want him to

1079
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:36,154
marry the kid.

1080
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,710
Sky's got no anticipation
skills. He doesn't see what's,

1081
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,180
what's the hand in front of his face.

1082
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,480
Obviously you know that you don't
get along with the siblings.

1083
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:49,210
I feel like that probably
wasn't a surprise to you.

1084
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,540
It sounds like nobody in the
family likes you, but that woman,

1085
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,160
so she's going to have
to then make a decision,

1086
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:58,570
you or them,

1087
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:02,380
which is very romantic for somebody in
their twenties but eventually as you

1088
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:07,240
start having kids and stuff, Christmases
and all that or a gun. Oh Dude, I,

1089
01:06:07,241 --> 01:06:08,650
I swear, I don't know
how much you love her,

1090
01:06:08,651 --> 01:06:13,240
but this would be a great thing to
walk away from if you could do it.

1091
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:18,280
That's five years. That's a long, you
know, now he's 25 it's a five year,

1092
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,130
25 it's c shouldn't the first three
years he shouldn't have been in a

1093
01:06:21,131 --> 01:06:23,190
relationship. You gotta be a
free agent in college. Huh?

1094
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,020
You gotta you gotta get the
lay of the land out there.

1095
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,820
I mean no pun intended over there. Yeah.

1096
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,830
Maybe they think you're
just too young or, well, no,

1097
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:33,250
they said why they don't approve.
So I think you, if you're really,

1098
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,660
you gotta talk to your girl about
it. They don't like Ah, yeah,

1099
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:42,910
you gotta talk to your girl and see what
she says. Do a favor. Just dump her.

1100
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,870
So then she doesn't know why and then
she won't blame her family's it because

1101
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:50,440
you're not going to marry into that. I
would leave. I would leave right now.

1102
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,510
Okay. We're moving onto the next
question. I would leave. No, you went in.

1103
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:56,110
He's got a Tazza about it. Oh
my twenties. I wouldn't have,

1104
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,400
cause I would have been smart enough.

1105
01:06:57,401 --> 01:07:00,610
But in my forties if your family
was just like, yeah, you know,

1106
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:03,340
we just don't like it though. And
I would just be like, all right,

1107
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:07,270
well yeah and I agree with that,
but he has to talk to her about it.

1108
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:10,960
You gotta tell her what happened.

1109
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,890
Can you get the little crazy
person here crawling all over me?

1110
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:20,050
Where'd your she just dropped it.
She just dropped it. It's right.

1111
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:24,700
It's right here. She's going for the
computer. Oh, there. There you go, buddy.

1112
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,480
Here you go. Okay, come here. All
right, let's look at the last one.

1113
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,940
Girlfriend's sociopathic
mother. And yet can you give me,

1114
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:34,863
can you give a woman,

1115
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,390
because women never writing into this
podcast cause I'm such an asshole.

1116
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:41,410
Can you give some quick advice
here? This woman went on Facebook.

1117
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:44,020
She's been with this guy for two
years. She says they're happy.

1118
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:47,980
He does everything right, everything's
fine. But she checked his Facebook. Why?

1119
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:52,120
Because you guys are happy
and everything is going okay.

1120
01:07:52,121 --> 01:07:56,680
Why did you check to see how
much my check was for today? Huh?

1121
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:58,180
Oh my God,

1122
01:07:58,181 --> 01:08:01,900
I can't believe you're just putting me
out on front street like that because you

1123
01:08:01,901 --> 01:08:06,700
guys snoop, it's what you do. Um,

1124
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:11,500
anyways, I was just curious. See,

1125
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:16,460
now you're going to have everybody with
the gold digging. W h. O. R. E comments.

1126
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:20,060
That's not why you did it was
because we did a job together.

1127
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:24,800
And you wanted to see what I made versus,
yeah. Job baggies for the family job.

1128
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:26,450
Becky's for the family. Yeah.

1129
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:28,910
And you wanted to see how much
I made versus what you made.

1130
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:32,930
Obviously I know you're gonna
make way more than I make. Okay.

1131
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,490
I was just happened to be there.
I mean they did request me,

1132
01:08:37,491 --> 01:08:42,250
but that's a whole other story. Anyway,
boyfriend's Facebook straight to the

1133
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,330
wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's
go back to the check there.

1134
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:47,780
Why I want to either is I like watching
new twists in the awkwardness that I

1135
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:50,060
live in day to day. So anyway,

1136
01:08:50,061 --> 01:08:53,870
she goes to check the Facebook
messenger and she said,

1137
01:08:53,871 --> 01:08:58,010
I saw that he is writing on a weekly
basis with an ex colleague of his,

1138
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:02,510
a beautiful young lady. Uh, the thing is
that they were close at work back then,

1139
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:06,470
but he quit three months
ago. Okay. Keep going.

1140
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:07,783
That's it.

1141
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:12,290
I just don't believe in Male, female
friendships. I'm talking from experience

1142
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,730
bap, bap, bap, bap band. What'd
he say? What'd he say? Uh,

1143
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,330
and what's the question?
What are you doing? Go back.

1144
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:24,870
We're watching some videos and stuff
on his phone and the search few.

1145
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,150
I saw list of a few girls names.
Other than that, he's great to me.

1146
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:35,090
Uh, yeah. Listen, this is why you
don't go snooping in social media or,

1147
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,430
and phone. Because if you find
something you could, the thing is,

1148
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,150
if you are looking in that direction,
you're looking for something.

1149
01:09:41,151 --> 01:09:42,230
So any little thing,

1150
01:09:42,231 --> 01:09:44,810
no matter how innocent is going to
get you all fucked up in the head.

1151
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,800
So if you're going to go looking for
stuff, you're going to go find stuff.

1152
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:54,310
So either drop it or confess that you've
been a little snoopy snoop and you're

1153
01:09:54,681 --> 01:09:56,450
paranoid and you're insecure.

1154
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:00,770
But I think you should just zip it
and move on and not look at his,

1155
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,480
his social media or his phone anymore.

1156
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:07,290
Wow. I said she should actually
ask them about that. That guy.

1157
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:12,020
Sure. The lady, I will listen to the
lady here. Well, I said it either one.

1158
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,000
You gotta like fess up
and be like, listen,

1159
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:19,001
I've been feeling kind of insecure lately
and I went on your Facebook and I saw

1160
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:21,200
that you messenger
somebody in, first of all,

1161
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:24,620
I apologize for invading your privacy
because I wouldn't appreciate it if you

1162
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:29,090
did that to me. But second of all, since
I've done it both, who is this bitch?

1163
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:35,460
Alright, girlfriends
sociopathic, we mugged shit.

1164
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,880
But you know you're wrong for
looking at his Facebook and you know,

1165
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:40,040
you're looking at wrong for
looking at his phone. You're wrong.

1166
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:40,874
You're wrong for that.

1167
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:46,180
So just know that girlfriend's
sociopathic mother.

1168
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:50,570
Hey Billy boule. I can't see that
in front of about that word. I know,

1169
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:52,540
but still, uh,

1170
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:56,650
not sure if this is the right
place for m m questions,

1171
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:01,840
but I'm in dire need of
redheaded. See Note, wisdom. Uh,

1172
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:06,190
so I've been dating this lady for about
a year now and her mother is a next

1173
01:11:06,191 --> 01:11:09,910
level piece of crap. Uh,
there are countless examples.

1174
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:14,220
Her site psychopaths the of psychopath up.

1175
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,170
There are countless examples.

1176
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,400
Her psychopaths that they always leave
out words I already read bad enough,

1177
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:25,300
but to trim the fat on the
story story. I'll uh, do,

1178
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,390
I'll cite a couple of scenarios.

1179
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:32,580
She has repeatedly asked me whether I use
protection whilst banging her daughter

1180
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:34,200
and when I've responded yes,

1181
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:38,310
she goes on to say she has no
evidence that I do use protection.

1182
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,830
What would there be evidence?
Yeah, where would they be evidence?

1183
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:46,040
No effing clue. Unless
you're banging her house.

1184
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:49,250
Did she checking the wastepaper basket.
Don't want her daughter to get pregnant.

1185
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:54,110
I am 21 years old and she is called my
mother on multiple occasions to ask to

1186
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:57,200
meet up with her and my girlfriend
dad to talk about my girlfriend and I.

1187
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:00,680
My mother's obviously
declined the invitation as
she's continued to pursue yet

1188
01:12:00,681 --> 01:12:04,460
she's continued to continue
to persist. Other than that,

1189
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:08,990
she is the helicopter parent
of the century and calls
my girlfriend at least 15

1190
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,540
times a day to tell her
how to live her life.

1191
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,700
I hate this woman with a burning passion,

1192
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:16,190
but I don't know what to do
about it with my girlfriend.

1193
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:18,680
My girlfriend is tried to set
boundaries with the mother,

1194
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:21,770
but it has had no luck or
just don't answer the phone.

1195
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:25,610
I think about the future and I
never want to see this woman again,

1196
01:12:25,611 --> 01:12:27,440
let alone have her be in the law,

1197
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:32,430
be an in law or the grandparent to my
children. I'd love to hear what thanks.

1198
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,940
Thanks. And go after yourself. Yeah.

1199
01:12:34,941 --> 01:12:38,000
I mean this scene where this
guy is thinking at 21 that
other guy should've been

1200
01:12:38,001 --> 01:12:40,460
thinking at 25 like you're
gonna marry into that.

1201
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:44,030
So I mean you're young enough
where you know, I'm sure, Huh?

1202
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,570
Your girlfriend's only a
few years out of the house,

1203
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:49,200
but she needs just don't
answer the phone. Yeah,

1204
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:53,220
she just doesn't and she's worried her
daughter's too young and is gonna like

1205
01:12:53,221 --> 01:12:57,060
leave her forever and all that stuff.
She's like attached. She's not,

1206
01:12:57,061 --> 01:12:59,430
I don't think she's associate
man. Who knows who's kid who,

1207
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:02,280
neither one of us know this woman.
Neither one of us know this woman.

1208
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:04,110
We don't have enough
information, but we're going out.

1209
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:06,000
We have to go off of
what people write to us.

1210
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:08,760
That's the only way that we can
do, we have to let go all in.

1211
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:10,860
It's like when you watch a TV
show, you're just got to watch it.

1212
01:13:10,861 --> 01:13:11,740
You can't be like, well,

1213
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:14,770
that would never happen in Babba
that you just got to like, yeah,

1214
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,080
this isn't Dr Phila.

1215
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,490
I'm not pretending to like solve
somebody's problems within 22 minute.

1216
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:25,491
Yo need to stop punching her in
the face and stop doing math.

1217
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:30,230
Okay. When we return. Yeah.

1218
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:32,870
You gotta talk to your girl, your
obviously your girlfriend knows, but yeah.

1219
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:37,550
You just gotta ignore the mother. Yeah.

1220
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,420
Just ignore. But yeah, I know a
piece of truth. She's divorced.

1221
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:44,750
She's calling like 15 times a day and
she's asking about this sex life and she's

1222
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:49,640
calling their parents. That's weird.
That's really, that's crossing the line.

1223
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:54,440
Shoving off the Buffalo. Yeah.
You gotta respect your kids, uh,

1224
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,630
boundaries, like their own personal space.

1225
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:59,750
You can't be calling somebody's
boyfriend asking them if they're using

1226
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:03,110
protection. Ask your daughter if
she's on the pill and if she's not,

1227
01:14:03,111 --> 01:14:07,250
get her some otherwise, what are you
calling me for lady? Yeah. That's weird.

1228
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:16,330
Ah, Jesus gets you pause out
of my pants. A lady. Exactly.

1229
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:20,470
Alright, that is the podcast for
this week. Congratulations to me.

1230
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:24,310
But when it all this money
on the red sock socks,

1231
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:27,400
making baseball exciting by gambling,

1232
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:33,010
there's your lesson. You are so
adorable and all you do is smile.

1233
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:39,160
A happy baby. Be In a good
mood all day. Look at you.

1234
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:40,360
She's getting mobile.

1235
01:14:40,361 --> 01:14:44,170
Everybody in anything's that she
sees she wants to get her hands on.

1236
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:46,910
Then she gets her hands on and then she
wants to go to something else and I'm

1237
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:47,890
going to tell you something right now.

1238
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,480
Nobody can flip over faster
than this one. By the way.

1239
01:14:52,481 --> 01:14:56,020
Shout out to Rick Flair.
I'm hope he's doing better.

1240
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,330
I heard that he's a recovering and I'm uh,

1241
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,130
looking forward to seeing them doing
the flare chop, the flare Strut,

1242
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:07,450
the flair flop, all of
it. Absolute legend. Um,

1243
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,650
we already lost one of the funniest
guys of all time. And Jerry Lewis.

1244
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,080
Yup. Dick Gregory.

1245
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:18,700
Do you realize how many stories went
with those two guys just today and forget

1246
01:15:18,701 --> 01:15:19,690
about Don Rickles.

1247
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:24,870
That just closes a
porthole to like Sinatra,

1248
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,930
the whole rat pack, Red Fox,

1249
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:31,930
Richard Pryor, all of that.
That porthole just closed.

1250
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:35,560
So I hope somebody made a documentary.
All right. That's the podcast.

1251
01:15:35,561 --> 01:15:39,160
Everybody or I did. I type on my
dad's saved today on the couch.

1252
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,090
She was a fiery, the face plant
right off. And I just like,

1253
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:46,690
like lightning quick near lightning
quick like a freckled pasty Cobra.

1254
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,640
I was able to grab her. All right. That's
it. She started, she's going for the,

1255
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,440
uh, the mix of here. All
right, you guys, I will,

1256
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:57,520
I'll check in on you in Thursday. Set
a nice cause the kids here. All right.

1257
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,560
Let's see. All right.
