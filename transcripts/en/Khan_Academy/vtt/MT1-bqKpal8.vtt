00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.623
- [Instructor] We're going
to do in this video is review

00:00:02.623 --> 00:00:05.339
the notion of composite functions

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.940
and then build some skills recognizing

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.838
how functions can actually be composed.

00:00:10.838 --> 00:00:13.604
If you've never heard of
the term composite functions

00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:15.575
or if the first few minutes of this video

00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:16.866
look unfamiliar to you,

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.197
I encourage you to
watch the algebra videos

00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:21.620
on composite functions on Khan Academy.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.096
The goal of this one is
to really be a little

00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:26.551
bit of a practice before
we get into some skills

00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:28.047
that are necessary in calculus,

00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:30.087
and particularly the chain rule.

00:00:30.087 --> 00:00:34.100
So let's just review what
a composite function is.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.183
So let's say that I have,

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:40.050
let's say that I have f of x,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.050
f of x being equal to one plus x.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.510
And let's say that we have g of x

00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:52.206
is equal to, let's say g of x is

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:54.373
equal to cosine of g of x.

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.223
So what would f of g of x be,

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:00.208
f of g of x?

00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:03.951
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.549
and try to work it out on your own.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.768
Well one way to think about it is

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:11.799
the input into f of x is no longer x,

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.385
it is g of x.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:15.406
So everywhere where we see an x

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:16.817
in the definition of f of x,

00:01:16.817 --> 00:01:18.290
we would replace with the g of x.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.500
So this is gonna be equal to,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.417
this is gonna be equal to one plus.

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:26.197
Instead of the input being x,

00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:28.061
the input is g of x, so the output

00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:29.644
is one plus g of x.

00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:34.726
And g of x, of course, is cosine of x.

00:01:34.726 --> 00:01:36.096
So instead of writing g of x there,

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.263
I could write cosine of x.

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:43.887
And one way to visualize this is,

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:47.032
I'm putting my x into g of x first,

00:01:47.032 --> 00:01:50.142
so x goes into the function g,

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:51.975
and it outputs g of x.

00:01:52.953 --> 00:01:54.935
And then we're gonna
take that output, g of x,

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:57.168
and then input it into f of x,

00:01:57.168 --> 00:01:59.822
or input it into the
function f, I should say.

00:01:59.822 --> 00:02:01.754
We input into the function f,

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:05.152
and then that is going to output f of

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:08.989
whatever the input was,
and the input is g of x,

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:09.822
g of x.

00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:12.827
So now with that review out of the way,

00:02:12.827 --> 00:02:14.887
let's see if we can go
the other way around.

00:02:14.887 --> 00:02:16.706
Let's see if we can look at some type

00:02:16.706 --> 00:02:18.012
of a function definition and say,

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:21.317
hey, can we express that as a composition

00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:23.170
of other functions.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.310
So let's start with, let's say

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.977
that I have a g of x

00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:32.024
is equal to cosine of

00:02:33.964 --> 00:02:35.797
sine of x plus one.

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.866
And I also wanna state,

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:42.193
there's oftentimes more than one way

00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:45.011
to compose, or to construct a function

00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:46.423
based on the composition of other ones.

00:02:46.423 --> 00:02:48.892
But with that said,
pause this video and say,

00:02:48.892 --> 00:02:50.444
hey, can I express g of x

00:02:50.444 --> 00:02:52.523
as a composition of two other functions,

00:02:52.523 --> 00:02:54.940
let's say an f and an h of x?

00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:58.436
So there's a couple of ways
that you could think about it.

00:02:58.436 --> 00:03:00.290
You could say, alright, well let's see,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.750
I have this sine of x right over here.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.658
So what if I called that an f of x?

00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:08.572
So let's say I called that,

00:03:08.572 --> 00:03:10.369
well actually let me
use a different variable

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:11.499
so we don't get confused here.

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.306
Let me call this u of x,

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:16.002
the sine of x right over there.

00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:19.498
So this would be cosine
of u of x plus one.

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:21.209
And so if we then divided,

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.442
if we then defined
another function as v of x

00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:29.275
being equal to cosine
of whatever its input is

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:33.375
plus one, well then this
looks like the composition

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:35.088
of v and u of x.

00:03:35.088 --> 00:03:39.000
Instead of v of x, if we did v of u of x,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.543
then this would be cosine
of u of x plus one,

00:03:42.543 --> 00:03:43.948
let me write that down.

00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:46.198
So if we wrote v of u of x,

00:03:48.733 --> 00:03:52.209
which is sine of x, if we did v of u of x,

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.918
that is going to be equal to

00:03:54.918 --> 00:03:58.430
cosine of, instead of an x plus one,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.782
it's going to be a u of x plus one.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.588
And u of x, let me write this here,

00:04:02.588 --> 00:04:05.255
u of x is equal to sine of x.

00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:08.050
That's how we set this up.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.011
So we can either write
cosine of u of x plus one,

00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:13.928
or cosine of sine of x plus one,

00:04:15.178 --> 00:04:17.320
which was exactly what we had before.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.576
And so this function, g of x,

00:04:19.576 --> 00:04:22.435
is we say u of x is equal to sine of x,

00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:24.778
if we say u of x is equal to sine of x,

00:04:24.778 --> 00:04:29.366
and v of x is equal to
cosine of x plus one,

00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:32.721
then we could write g
of x as the composition

00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:35.334
of these two functions.

00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:38.947
Now you could even make it a
composition of three functions.

00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:42.154
We could keep u of x to
be equal to sine of x.

00:04:42.154 --> 00:04:45.154
We could define, let's say, a w of x

00:04:46.822 --> 00:04:49.239
to be equal to x plus one.

00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:52.037
And so then, let's think about it.

00:04:52.037 --> 00:04:52.870
W of x,

00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:57.232
w of u of x, I should say,

00:04:57.232 --> 00:04:59.815
w of u, I'll do the same color,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.420
w of u of x is going to be equal to.

00:05:07.444 --> 00:05:10.153
Now my input is no longer x, it's u of x,

00:05:10.153 --> 00:05:12.990
so it's going to be a u of x plus one,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.731
or just sine of x plus one.

00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:18.902
So that's sine of x plus one.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.350
And then if we define a third function,

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.670
let's say, let's see, I'll call it,

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.421
let's call it h; we're
running out of variables,

00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:28.876
although there are a lot of letters left.

00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:31.089
So if I say h of x is
just equal to the cosine

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:34.354
of whatever I input, so it's
equal to the cosine of x,

00:05:34.354 --> 00:05:37.300
well then h of w of u of x

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.760
is gonna be g of x.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.891
Let me write that down.

00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:41.308
H of w of u of x,

00:05:47.335 --> 00:05:50.002
u of x, is going to be equal to,

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.887
remember, h of x takes the cosine

00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:55.372
of whatever its input is,

00:05:55.372 --> 00:05:57.341
so it's gonna take the cosine.

00:05:57.341 --> 00:06:00.401
Now its input is w of u of x.

00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:02.751
We already figured out w of u of x

00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:04.589
is going to be this business.

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:08.089
So it's going to be sine of x plus one,

00:06:10.993 --> 00:06:12.873
where the u of x is sine of x,

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.949
but then we input that into w,

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:16.986
so we got sine of x plus one,

00:06:16.986 --> 00:06:19.822
and then we inputed that into h

00:06:19.822 --> 00:06:21.584
to get cosine of that,

00:06:21.584 --> 00:06:23.132
which is our original expression,

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:25.215
which is equal to g of x.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.444
So the whole point here is to appreciate

00:06:30.444 --> 00:06:33.259
how to recognize
compositions of functions.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.685
Now I wanna stress, it's not always

00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:37.688
going to be a composition of a function.

00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:41.131
For example, if I have some function,

00:06:41.131 --> 00:06:42.797
let me just clear this out,

00:06:42.797 --> 00:06:45.629
if I had some function f of x

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:49.212
is equal to cosine of x times sine of x,

00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:53.989
it would be hard to express this as

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:56.269
a composition of functions,

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:59.274
but I can represent it as
the product of functions.

00:06:59.274 --> 00:07:01.879
For example, I could say cosine of x,

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:04.461
I could say u of x is
equal to cosine of x.

00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:07.870
And I could say v of x,
it's a different color,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.370
I could say v of x

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:12.657
is equal to sine of x.

00:07:12.657 --> 00:07:15.026
And so here, f of x
wouldn't be the composition

00:07:15.026 --> 00:07:17.563
of u and v, it would be the product.

00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:19.896
F of x is equal to u of x

00:07:22.013 --> 00:07:23.096
times v of x.

00:07:24.956 --> 00:07:26.696
If we were take the composition,

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.196
if we were to say u of v of x,

00:07:30.553 --> 00:07:32.129
pause the video, think about what that is,

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:33.945
and that's a little bit of review.

00:07:33.945 --> 00:07:37.195
Well this is going to be, I take u of x

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.058
takes the cosine of whatever is input,

00:07:41.058 --> 00:07:45.331
and now the input is v of
x, which would be sine of x;

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.164
sine of x.

00:07:47.284 --> 00:07:49.097
And then if you did v of u of x,

00:07:49.097 --> 00:07:50.206
well that'd be the other way around.

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:52.308
It would be sine of cosine of x.

00:07:52.308 --> 00:07:54.159
But anyway, this is once again, just to

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.801
help us recognize, hey, do I have,

00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:58.095
when I look at an expression
or a function definition,

00:07:58.095 --> 00:08:00.156
am I looking at products of functions,

00:08:00.156 --> 00:08:02.441
am I looking at compositions of functions?

00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:04.701
Sometimes you're looking
at products of compositions

00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:06.103
or quotients of compositions,

00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:08.021
all sorts of different combinations of how

00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:11.864
you can put functions together
to create new functions.
