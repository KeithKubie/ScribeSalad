&gt;&gt; MIKE: Hi. My name is Mike. I’m an engineer
on Android. I worked on the Application framework

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.570
and several of the applications. My favorite
feature of Android is how you can customize

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.419
a home screen, which I’m going to show you
now. Here’s how I’ve set up my home screen.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.349
In the middle, I have the applications that
I use everyday. And over here, I have my wife’s

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.430
phone number, linked to the New York Times.
And then over on this screen, I have a couple

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.450
of pictures that were selected by my kids
and my Games folder.
