00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.720
Why should computers learn to see?

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.260
Because old friends can now connect
in real-time.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.900
Because no one should have to go hungry.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.900
Because we believe in second chances.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.060
From agriculture to cancer detection,
computer vision is not only teaching

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.179
computers what to see but how
to respond to our visual world.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.630
At Udacity, we've built the computer vision
Nanodegree program for students to

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.360
learn about image processing techniques

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.260
and methods for object recognition
and tracking

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.820
So that you can make a deep
impact in any field.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.380
So why should we teach computers to see?

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.580
Cause the possibilities of what we can build together are limitless.
