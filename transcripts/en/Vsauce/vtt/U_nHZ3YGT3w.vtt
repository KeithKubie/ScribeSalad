Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And are you still
doing things in the real world? C'mon, I mean,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:14.900
why flip a coin when you could justflipacoin.com?
Every time you refresh the page, it flips

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.280
again. Of course, there are plenty of other
things you can Do Online Now, Guys.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:27.510
For instance, have you ever wondered "Am I
Awesome?" Well, ask the Internet.
Go to amiawesome.com -

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.270
it never lies. Earn your awesomeness like
Monstewn by playing The Wiki Game against

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.000
opponents from all over the world. Here I
am clicking links to race from the U.S. Constitution

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.210
to South India. I had a rough patch there
in the middle, but I got by in a squeaker.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.290
The constellations in the sky have looked
the way they do since the ancient people gave

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.500
them names, but they are still fleeting because
our Earth moves, and the solar system moves,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.500
and the galaxy is moving all through space,
they won't always look the same. This website

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.870
shows you what will happen to them in the
future. For instance, 70,000 years from today,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.830
standing on Earth, the Big Dipper will look like this.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.140
If Cosmonauts explore the cosmos, and you
explore the Internet, that makes your an Internaught

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:31.040
and Internaughts love confrontation, specifically,
thedisagreeinginternet.com. Begin from here

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.780
and the internet will constantly
be shaking its head at you.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.520
In Pyro, you aim flaming balls to start fires
and burn things. But to test your wits, try

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.760
The Impossible Quiz. Multiple choice questions
that make you think "can a match box?" "No,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.490
but a tin can."

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.060
The Amaster15 pointed me towards this incredible
depository of giant images. Like, really,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.300
really giant.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.500
Following the rules is safe and easy, for
instance, "deliver." Ok, done. But, when a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.460
level says "disobey,"don't do what is says.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.640
AuzzieZiggy recommends Motherload where you
play as a machine that can burrow but also

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.060
jump pretty well. Make money collecting rock
to upgrade and don't forget to refuel.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.540
Stealing the Diamond lets you make choices
and see how they pan out. Be careful and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.880
creative.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.360
For a string of bizarre clips, thebest404pageever.com
always offers a pleasant surprise.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:49.540
But take a break and relax with 2playstationnetwork
and play in the sand, because thisissand.com.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.879
And oh, look, Amy Poehler has a channel on
YouTube with lots of different kinds of stuff,

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.059
including her answering your questions while
she lies on a bed or sits in a shower. It's

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.480
for Smart Girls, but yes,
there is a weekly Boy Minute.

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:12.169
TheChelengo asks you to test out passwords
at howsecureismypassword.net. The site estimates

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.650
and displays how quickly a PC could guess
your password. Does that make you nervous?

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.110
Well, Hissandpixels is here to calm you down
with thenicestplaceontheinter.net. It's nothing

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.810
but a never-ending parade of fullscreen videos
of people hugging you.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.840
Writer's block? Well be like techonyoursix
and generate yourself some plots. This site

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.220
randomly creates scenarios to get you thinking.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.560
RangerForceful recommends Last Square Standing,
which is super simple but gets tough quick.

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.929
Avoid touching anything for as long as you can.

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:55.340
Pointer Pointer watches your pointer and then
pulls a photo from its giant reservoir in

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.960
which someone points to where your pointer is.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:07.000
Finally, SirFatSug asked hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.520
Phew, ok, it looks like we're good for now,
but let's periodically check on this to make

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.680
sure the world is still together and if it
is, or even if it isn't...

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.909
As always,

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:19.189
thanks for watching.
