00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.060
We're always hearing that being selfish is one of the worst character traits that anyone could possess.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.600
It's smacks of greed, entitlement, and cruelty.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.800
And yet, some of the reason we fail to have the lives we should, and thereby end up mean, bitter, and irritable,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.580
is because we're suffering from an opposite problem: an excessive selflessness--

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.900
an exaggerated modesty, an over-hasty deference to the wishes of everyone but ourselves.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.640
Our problem is that we're not selfish enough.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.940
We collectively get muddled because we fail to distinguish between good and bad versions

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.180
of selfishness.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.740
The good, desirable kind of selfishness involves having the courage and self-awareness to give priority

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.420
to ourselves at particular points, the confidence to be forthright about our needs--

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.360
not in order to harm or reject other people, but in order to serve them in a deeper, more sustained

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.200
and committed way over the long term.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.120
Bad selfishness, on the other hand, operates with no greater end in view, and no higher motive in mind.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.840
We're not declining to help so as to marshal our resources, to offer others a greater gift down the line,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.800
we just can't be bothered.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.960
Unfortunately, afflicted by confusion about this distinction, we frequently fail to be brave enough

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.300
about stating our needs as clearly as we should,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.400
with disastrous results precisely for those we're meant to serve.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.220
For example, in order to be a good parent, we may need to have an hour to ourselves every day.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.660
We may need to take a long time in a hot shower to mull over events.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.360
We may need to do something that seems a bit indulgent, like a life drawing or clarinet lesson.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.580
But because we may sense how contrary to expectations these desires can seem,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.340
we might opt to stay quiet about our requirements and just get on with the job.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.220
And so, we grow increasingly ragged, angry, and bitter with those who rely on us.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.700
A lack of selfishness can turn us-- slowly-- into highly disagreeable, as well as ineffective, people.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.680
Good selfishness grows out of an unembarrassed understanding of what we need in order to maximize

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.760
our utility for others.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.980
As good selfish people, we accept what we require to develop our abilities, get our minds into the right frame,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.120
summon our most useful powers, and organize our thoughts and feelings so that they can, eventually,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.560
be helpful to the world.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.080
We recognize that we will, at select moments, have to back out of doing things

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.440
that people would very much like us to do.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.040
But we have no compunction about politely explaining that we just can't be there for them...

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:56.100
unlike the selfless, who will dutifully smile and help out and then one day explode in vindictive, exhausted rage.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.960
We know, as kind egoists, that we may be confused with the mean-spirited, but our innate conviction

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.320
of our sincerity lends us the calm to pursuit our aims politely in our own way.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.840
So as not to be accused of the wrong sort of selfishness, the trick is to become a better ambassador

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.260
of your intentions.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.700
We have to persuasively and kindly convey to those around us that we're not lazy or callous

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.980
(and indeed we're not),

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.600
but we have to show them that we will simply better serve their needs

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.460
by not doing the expected things for a while.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.260
Sweet people run the strange but highly important risk of becoming an nuisance to other people

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.480
by what sounds like, but really isn't, a good idea:
always putting others first.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.860
As good, selfish people know, sometimes, putting oneself first may actually be the best way

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.700
to serve others properly in the long run.
