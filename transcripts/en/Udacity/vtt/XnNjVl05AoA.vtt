00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.709
Here's a different system of equations. The coefficients to the x are different,

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:09.285
and the coefficients for y are different. Hm, so what could we do? Well, we can

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:13.908
actually use the properties of equality to change one of these equations or both

00:00:13.908 --> 00:00:18.385
of them. Here's what I mean. I can think about changing the second equation by

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:23.232
multiplying it by a positive 2. When I do that I distribute this 2 to each of

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:28.234
the terms, 2 times 3x is 6x, 2 times negative 4y is negative 8y and 2 times 10

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:33.245
is 20. Make sure that you distribute this number to each term. So I know this

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:38.500
green equation is the same as this equation, it's been multiplied by 2. So I've

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.700
rewritten my system of equation here, and notice the y variables have the same

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.080
coefficient and opposite signs. This is great. Now using our elimination method,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.819
I want you to solve this system. You can put your answer here.
