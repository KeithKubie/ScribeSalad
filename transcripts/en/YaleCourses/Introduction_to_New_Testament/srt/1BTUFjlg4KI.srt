1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,080
Okay. We're going to talk about
several different things today,

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:08,010
several different texts. Um, because we're
coming up to the end of the semester,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,700
I often talk about a muffin concluding
with two different lectures that talk

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:19,590
about the rise of institutionalism and
institutionalization of the church,

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,990
but I've decided this year
to combine them into one.

6
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:26,850
So that's why you're reading lists you're
reading for today had some canonical

7
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:31,400
material, the letters of Ignatius.
You're also asked to read the dedicated,

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,000
uh, another non canonical early Christian
writing because I want it to pull

9
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,400
different themes together.
So next time,

10
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:42,720
the last class of the period of
the course, the last lecture,

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,130
I want to then address the kinds of big
questions you might've been having all

12
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:47,760
semester long,

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,760
which is something like how
did this little bitty group
of people following this

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,950
unknown Jew in Syria or Palestine in
the first century become this huge world

15
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:03,750
religion? And what's
the continuity, if any?

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,530
Because I've been stressing all in the
whole semester the differences between

17
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:11,070
contemporary notions about Christianity,
what Christianity is,

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,310
what is Orthodox Christianity
for people in our day and age,

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,470
what people assume
Christianity's all about.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,460
I've been talking about how that's
very different from the canonical

21
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:22,170
Christianity that we see
in the New Testament,

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,560
and it's even more different from some
of the non-canonical Christianity that

23
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,630
we've seen in things like
the acts of Paul and Thecla.

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,700
So next time I will talk about the bigger
issue of the growth of Christianity

25
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:37,140
from this fledgling little movement and
a few house churches scattered around in

26
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:38,850
Greek cities and the
eastern Mediterranean.

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,480
I'll also talk next time a little about
what is postmodern interpretation of

28
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,104
scripture.

29
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,950
I did talk a bit about the theological
interpretation of scripture and how

30
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:53,280
that's different from the historical
critical interpretation of scripture that

31
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,480
you're learning in this semester.

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,950
If you really want to get into theological
interpretation of scripture, uh,

33
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,240
in an academic environment,

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,660
you need to do that through something
like the divinity school or in a seminary,

35
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:06,750
because that's of course where they're
supposed to be teaching people how to

36
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,750
interpret.
This text for contemporary Christians,

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,570
but that's not what we're going
to talk about in this course.

38
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,370
Most of the time I have hinted at that,

39
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,960
but there's also a way of approaching
scripture that might be considered not the

40
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:19,800
canonical,

41
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,830
traditional way of theological
interpretation and also
not the modernist way of

42
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:27,120
history of modern historical criticism.

43
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,310
And that's what we might call postmodern
approaches to the text and even to the

44
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:33,600
text as scripture itself.

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,250
So next time I'll address some of those
bigger issues about the new testament

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,890
that I've kind of put on
side for the whole semester.

47
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,210
But today that we're taking a first step
toward that because I'm going to look

48
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:47,100
at some canonical
material in this lecture,

49
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,560
but I'm also going to look at the
letters of Ignatius and the DDA,

50
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,570
k to show you how the church started
becoming institutionalized in ways that

51
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:59,750
look more familiar to us after
the period of the new, uh,

52
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,603
composition.

53
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,270
How do you create and maintain
unity and a social movement?

54
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,140
That's what early Christian
leaders had to face pretty quickly.

55
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,600
We've already seen that in Paul's letters,
right?

56
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,380
First Corinthian shows a church
that is at odds with itself.

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,820
People disagreeing about what the basic
nature of the Gospel is. And Paul writes,

58
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:23,410
First Corinthians,
in order,

59
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,280
the whole theme of First Corinthians
is you are the United body of Christ.

60
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,780
Now start acting like it.

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,680
And so Paul's trying to get a fractured
church to see itself as a United.

62
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,220
There are different ways you can see
this being done. In early Christianity,

63
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:40,540
Paul of course, didn't have
church structures to appeal to.

64
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:44,740
Paul couldn't say something like, uh, if
you have a question, go to your bishop.

65
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,410
He also couldn't say, look
at the New Testament. I mean,

66
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,960
he was riding it at the time. There
wasn't anything like that to look at.

67
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,350
So Paul exercise his own
charismatic authority.

68
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:56,970
By that we mean that in a sort of a
barrier in sociological sense of an

69
00:03:56,971 --> 00:04:00,970
authority that doesn't derive from an a
foreman office from any kind of official

70
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,650
official office that Paul
had. But it derives from
simply his force of character.

71
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,940
So when someone,
uh,

72
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,160
has a leadership position that
derives more from their personality,

73
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,810
their force of character, their ideas,
than it does from an official office,

74
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,330
then that's charismatic authority rather,
uh,

75
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,970
as opposed to an official kind
of institutional authority.

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,730
That's what Paul had to do with it.
That's what all the earliest, uh,

77
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,800
leaders of these little house
churches had to deal with.

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,720
They had to push their own
ideas of what the church meant,

79
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,130
of what the body of Christ meant,

80
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,250
of what was proper ethics of what
proper interpretation of scripture.

81
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,100
And they had to do it on the strength of
their own character and their force of

82
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:39,934
personality.

83
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,860
So that was one way that people tried
to create unity in this early fledgling

84
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:47,830
movement. Gradually, of course,
you have other ways of developing.

85
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,700
Another way of developing a unity that
we see around us the whole time is

86
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:55,510
hierarchical leadership.
So you have a officer's,

87
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:58,090
you have people who are either
elected or appointed as officers,

88
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,330
and they controlled unity and enforcing
unity from the top down. We also have a,

89
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,740
and you can see this, therefore,
in modern Christianity,

90
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,760
modern religious movements,
the Roman Catholic Church, uh,

91
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,380
has bishops and cardinals and the pope
and everybody who knows anything about

92
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:19,381
Roman Catholicism knows that what
the Pope and the cardinals say goes,

93
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,450
or it's supposed to write you.
Uh,

94
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,100
American Roman Catholics and a lot of
northern western European Catholics

95
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,340
sometimes don't go along with
the Vatican on many things.

96
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,470
But the structure of the Roman Catholic
church is intended to help maintain

97
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:39,400
unity by the means of official
hierarchical leadership structure.

98
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,150
Uh, you also have different
Protestant ways to do this,

99
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:47,530
which are constitutional kinds of
systems. So when, say, the Presbyterians,

100
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,040
uh, have debates about
whether to ordain homosexuals,

101
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,760
whether to allow gay marriages,
uh, the ordination of women,

102
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,370
which was the debate that really rocked
the Presbyterian church in many of the

103
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:02,630
churches back in the 1970s, most
of them got over that by now. Now,

104
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:06,110
the thing that's rocking in his sexuality,
but when they had disagreements,

105
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,070
they go to the general convention,
which occurs every year.

106
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,480
And you have people elected out of
different local churches and parishes and

107
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,280
presbyteries,
they called them the Presbyterian church.

108
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,570
And those people who are
themselves basically elected
from their local churches

109
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:24,440
and their local presbyteries are
representatives to the general convention.

110
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,880
It looks very much like American politics.
It's not much of an accident.

111
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,950
The American constitution to some
extent is based on what was a more

112
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,030
Presbyterian,

113
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,530
Protestant kind of church polity of having
different houses have representatives

114
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:43,340
in this sort of thing. So American
denominations, Protestant dominations,

115
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,570
which were growing up at the same time
as different Protestant movements were

116
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:52,100
growing up and at the same time as
American constitutionalism was growing up,

117
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,810
all influenced each other.

118
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,070
So that's another way to maintain unity
that Protestant churches tend to use.

119
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,910
And then you have other churches in
America that are very free churches.

120
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,750
I grew up in a denomination that didn't
even call itself denomination because it

121
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:10,040
considered itself simply the church called
the Church of Christ and the Churches

122
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,630
of Christ don't have any national office.

123
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,540
There's no place you can go
anywhere in the world. Uh,

124
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,720
like the rer for most other denominations
that have a national office with

125
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:21,950
officers and set rules and decide on
him books and decide on Sunday school

126
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:24,800
materials, there's nothing like
that anywhere in the world.

127
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,690
These churches are all completely
autonomous and a individual to themselves.

128
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,450
They appoint their own officers.

129
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,810
They decide what is doctrine
and what's not doctrine.

130
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,760
They hire and fire their own ministers.

131
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:41,180
Not even the ministers of these
churches are the highest authorities.

132
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:42,860
They basically preach and teach,

133
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,900
but they're not the ones who
actually run the churches.

134
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,430
So each individual church,

135
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,590
there are lots of churches
like that in the United States.

136
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:52,070
There's a lot of baptist churches that
not even part of the Southern Baptist

137
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,220
Convention.

138
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,880
There are lots of free churches and
someone would even have free as part of

139
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:59,150
their name. Of course, in America,
this is not at all unusual.

140
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,440
Anybody can rent out a storefront and
start their own church and many people

141
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,600
have done so. So these kinds of
churches, it's remarkable that, uh,

142
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,660
that the denomination I grew up in,

143
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,400
although there's no Meta congregational
organization that runs this,

144
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,080
it's amazing how, uh, much, uh,
like they are. When I was a kid,

145
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,950
I would, we'd travel to
Alabama are to, you know,

146
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,230
Maryland or to Saint Louis,

147
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:28,200
Missouri and you would go to a church of
Christ as long as it said sign and was

148
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:30,920
one of the same kinds of things
and the services would be the same.

149
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,860
They use the thing, the same
songs. They had the same doctrine.

150
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,020
It's almost like somebody
wrote it all out and said,

151
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:37,400
this is what you'll do on Sunday morning.

152
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,190
The amazing thing was nobody
had written it all out.

153
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,320
It was just done by the sheer nature of
these churches of being very close knit

154
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,010
and,

155
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,010
and sort of ruling each
other by threatening to
disfellowship you if you didn't

156
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,980
do like everybody else did. So there's
a great amount of cohesiveness. In fact,

157
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,630
I remember being astounded when I was
20 years old and I was in a rock band at

158
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:03,810
my college and we did a two month
tour for the u s so you know,

159
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:08,370
playing with milk on military bases
all over in Japan, Taiwan, Okinawa,

160
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,100
Hawaii, the South Pacific,
different places in the Philippines.

161
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,390
And we would actually,

162
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:15,000
because the college I went to
was a church of Christ college,

163
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,410
we would often visit a church of Christ
in Tokyo or wherever we was in Asia.

164
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,200
And it was amazing. You'd go in and
although everything was in Japanese,

165
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,440
it was exactly like it was back in Texas
and there was no organization forcing

166
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:30,780
this. It was just the
cohesiveness of the [inaudible],

167
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,770
this socialization of these
different groups. So what we,

168
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,930
what we're seeing going to see today is
the move in early Christianity, the very,

169
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,970
very beginnings of the move from
this freewheeling, charismatic,

170
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:48,810
structureless kind of organization
structure and authority,

171
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,530
a practice that we see in Paul's letters
and other documents we've looked at so

172
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:55,800
far, and we're going to see a move
towards more institutionalization.

173
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,290
It's not going to be the,
the Catholic Church yet.

174
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,860
It's not going to be what becomes
a Christianity in the fourth scent,

175
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,340
fourth and fifth centuries when it
does become much more highly organized.

176
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,050
But we're going to start seeing that move.

177
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,680
We see the move a little bit
already in the letter of Jude.

178
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,350
So open your bibles and
look with me at Jude,

179
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,800
the letter of Jude.

180
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,670
It's Jude claims to be
the brother of James.

181
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,720
And scholars think most of the time what
he's trying to do is claim that he's

182
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:27,720
the brother of James who was the
head of the Jerusalem church.

183
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:31,410
That is James the brother of
Jesus. So Jube by that, uh, uh,

184
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,550
figuring would also make himself,
uh, the brother of Jesus.

185
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,680
Now this is sort of mark six,

186
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,820
three or Matthew 1355
links these guys together.

187
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,490
What most scholars think
is that this is synonymous.

188
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:48,750
You won't be surprised now to know that
we don't think the brother of Jesus

189
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:52,140
actually, or the brother of James
Actually wrote this, a text,

190
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:58,020
what we know of a Judas who would
have been. Uh, and of course, as I've,

191
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,330
uh,
I think I've explained already,

192
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,710
Jude is simply the Anglo
cessation of the Greek name Judas,

193
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,860
which is simply a Greek version
of the Hebrew named Judah.

194
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,990
So they all refer
basically to the same name.

195
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,070
So Jude Are Judas or Judah.
Uh,

196
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,520
was if he was a brother of Jesus
as the Gospel seem to imply,

197
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,500
then he was an illiterate fishermen.
And we don't think that, uh,

198
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,840
someone with his background with his
lack of education would have been able to

199
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,680
write this letter. So that's the
reason we basically assign it to the,

200
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,060
to pseudonymity
he's dealing with some divisions.

201
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:35,220
I'm not gonna go through the letter very
much cause I want to move ahead to some

202
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:39,720
of these other documents. But there's,
there are signs like I talked about with,

203
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,250
uh, first and second Peter last time
that this is a post epistolic letter.

204
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,440
One of those is verse three,
Beloved,

205
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:51,960
while eagerly preparing to write to
you about the salvation we share,

206
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,520
I find it necessary to
write and to appeal to you,

207
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:59,500
to contend for the faith that was once
for all entrusted to the saints. So this,

208
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,550
the faith is this thing that was
delivered to the saints at one time. Uh,

209
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,240
he also talks in verse 17
about the Apostles for,

210
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,190
but you beloved must remember
the predictions of the
apostles of our Lord Jesus

211
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,170
for they said to you in the last time,

212
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:16,930
there will be scoffers indulging
their own ungodly lusts.

213
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,540
So he sees himself
living in the last times,

214
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,440
but he didn't see the apostles living in
the last time. Right. Even though, uh,

215
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,110
Peter and James and John saw
themselves as living in the last time,

216
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,380
he's living far enough after them so
that you can put them in a prior time.

217
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,970
I sort of at the systolic stage of the
church and now he's writing in the last

218
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:39,610
time.
So this is a post epistolic letter,

219
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,350
but it's also pre canonical. As I said
last time, talking about second Peter,

220
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:46,180
remember I talked about how second Peter,

221
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:50,290
the letter of second Peter uses this
letter of Jude as a model for his own

222
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,900
letter and he quotes stuff out
and take stuff out of it. But,

223
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,560
and one of the things those second Peter
did was he took out the stuff that he

224
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:59,690
found in Jude that was not canonical,
that he didn't figure,

225
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,720
believe there was part of the Real Bible.
But Jude has it in there in verse nine.

226
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,120
But when the Archangel Michael contended
with the devil and disputed about the

227
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:14,050
body of Moses, and he goes
on and says, what happened?
Well, what does this happen?

228
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,140
Is this in your Bible? Nope,
it's not in your Bible.

229
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,340
Michael never disputed about what to do
with the body of Moses after Moses died,

230
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,750
according to our Bible.
But it is in a Jewish document.

231
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:27,460
We call the assumption of Moses.

232
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,650
So he's citing a Jewish document
that's not in the Bible that we use.

233
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:36,340
And it may be that that's why the
second Peter took that reference out.

234
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:40,330
He didn't want the assumption of Moses
being cited in this text. And he also,

235
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:44,380
as I said last time,
he cites the some Enoch material.

236
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,470
Uh,
in verses 14 and 15,

237
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,560
it was also about these that Enoch
in the seventh generation from Adam

238
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:52,150
prophesied saying,
see,

239
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:55,690
the Lord is coming with 10 thousands
of his holy ones where we have now

240
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,000
literature under the name of Enoch,

241
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,080
which was written probably in
over a period of a few centuries.

242
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:05,200
It was an accumulation of
several different documents,

243
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,360
but started being written in the third
century BCE and then was added onto in

244
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:11,830
the centuries after that.
So the,

245
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:15,100
he cites materials from the
assumption of Moses and Enoch,

246
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,730
which demonstrates that he's still
living in a time when what's considered

247
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:22,840
scripture by these early followers
of Jesus is still in a state of flux.

248
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,600
So he's not riding at
a time where the Canon,

249
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:30,130
even the Jewish candidate Hebrew
Bible cannon, uh, has been set yet.

250
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,460
He's also writing at a
time when some of them,

251
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,110
the eucharistic practices may
also be not like they were later.

252
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,010
Look in verse 12,
these are blemishes on your love feast.

253
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,360
You're a got bays

254
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,220
whilst they feast with you or the fear
of feeding themselves and it goes on and

255
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,910
condense the people. These, uh,

256
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,690
got bays probably refer to
the taking of the communion,

257
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,980
the Lord's supper.

258
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,150
But in the context of a bigger meal as
we've seen was the case also in CR and

259
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,950
Corinth.
In First Corinthians 11,

260
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:04,040
Paul talks about them coming
together and having the meal.

261
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,220
And as part of that meal, they would
have the wine and the bread of the law,

262
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,460
the Lord's supper.
So there he,

263
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:15,461
repro Jude represents an in between
time in early Christianity that's post

264
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:19,700
epistolic. So it's not in the
epistolic period as Paul's letters are,

265
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,720
Paul's authentic letters,

266
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:26,050
but it's also not quite
to the from ecclesiastical
institutions that now for the

267
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:32,150
rest of today and next time I'll
talk about, uh, become formed the,

268
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:36,290
you don't have here at this point yet.
Bishops set creeds,

269
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,320
set liturgies and set scripture.

270
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,820
All of those things will later be used
to settle disputes. What did I say?

271
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,760
Bishops,
creeds,

272
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,670
liturgy and scripture.

273
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,780
Those are four things that come to
the used as you might call them,

274
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,210
technologies of unity,

275
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,110
technologies of control in bringing
unity out of this wild diversity of early

276
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:06,920
Christianity that we've been making a
theme of this course all along the way.

277
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,420
And then the next thing we want to talk
about is the letters of Ignatius because

278
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:16,421
he then represents another stage in this
process and especially the use of the

279
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,480
office of the bishop itself.
First,

280
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,160
did you notice how much Ignatius makes
himself out to be this great martyr?

281
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,260
He is.

282
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,260
He's a part of his authority derived
simply because he's been arrested and uh,

283
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:37,770
and he's being taken from Antioch where
he was Bishop to Rome to stand trial and

284
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,510
then to be killed along the way.

285
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,350
He writes these letters when he's going
through Asia minor to different cities

286
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:49,070
in Asia minor sorta like the, uh,
author of revelation had done.

287
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,890
But notice what he does with,

288
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,230
he plays on the idea that he's
going to die and he makes it,

289
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,500
he makes so much out of it.
Then it becomes pretty much gross.

290
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,450
Look for example at the
letter to the Romans,

291
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,190
if you can find it in your packet.

292
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,030
See, I need to have a Bible
Song for Ignatius is letters,

293
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,800
so we'll know where to find
them toward the last one.

294
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,070
Pardon? Yeah, the letter to
the Romans from Ignatius. Okay,

295
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:29,480
so look at chapter four
for my part.

296
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,440
I am writing to all the churches and
assuring them that I am truly in earnest

297
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:38,000
about dying for God. If only you
yourselves put no obstacles in my way.

298
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,510
So he's telling the Romans when I'm
getting trout and put before the beast,

299
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,380
don't you try to intervene and save
me? Don't try to save me. He's saying,

300
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,280
I must implore you to do
me no such untimely. Pray.

301
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:53,120
Leave me to be a meal
for the beasts for it.

302
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,700
As they who can provide my way to God.
I am his wheat ground.

303
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,540
Find by the lions' teeth to be
made purest bread for Christ,

304
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,930
better still in psych, the creatures
to become a simple performance.

305
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,330
He wants the lions bodies to be his tomb.

306
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,250
Let them not leave the smallest scrap of
my flesh so that I need not be a burden

307
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:15,000
to anyone after I fall asleep. No, just
up here in the dark. Don't worry about me.

308
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,760
When there is no trace of my body left
for the world to see, then I shushed,

309
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,670
truly be Jesus Christ's
disciples, so intercede with
him. That is with God for me,

310
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,570
that by their instrumentality,
that is the instruments of the lions.

311
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,150
I may be made a sacrifice to God.
However,

312
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:34,080
I am not issuing orders to you as
though I were a Peter or a Paul.

313
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,560
A little bit of modesty here.
They were apostles.

314
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,310
I'm just a condemned criminal.
They were free men.

315
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,410
I am still a slave though.

316
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:47,340
If I suffered Jesus Christ will give me
liberty and in him I shall rise again as

317
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:48,840
a free man for the present.

318
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,160
These chains are schooling me to
have done with earthly desires.

319
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,470
Look at the next chapter,
chapter five about halfway down it's on.

320
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,490
I don't have page numbers here,
but how I look forward,

321
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,570
this becomes almost more
bid people, modern people,
reading nations, his letters,

322
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,500
and he looks like he's Morbid
in his craving for martyrdom.

323
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,470
That's how odd it looks to us.
Modern people,

324
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,450
how I look forward to the real lions
that have been got ready for me.

325
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,060
All I pray is that I
might find them swift.

326
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,500
I'm going to make overtures to them so
that unlike some other wretches whom they

327
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,240
have been to spiritless to touch,

328
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,660
they may divide me with all speed and
if they are still reluctant artist just

329
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:34,710
show you is forced to them.
He's going to pull the lions' teeth right?

330
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:38,700
Tortoise chest. You must forgive me,
but I do know what is best for myself.

331
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,730
This is the first stage of
my discipleship and no power,

332
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:45,720
visible or invisible must grudge me.
My coming to Jesus Christ,

333
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,630
fire crossed beast fighting,

334
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:53,130
hacking and quartering splintering
a bone and mangling of limb.

335
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,860
Even the pulverizing of my entire body,

336
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,890
let every horrid and diabolical
torment come upon me,

337
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,340
provided only that I can
when my way to Jesus Christ.

338
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,980
This is martyrology stuff,
folks.

339
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,230
This is the beginning of entire cult of
the martyrs in Christianity to become so

340
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:12,210
important in early Christianity.

341
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,570
And then for hundreds of
years he even now, now,

342
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:20,310
Paul had also talked about chains, his
chains being, uh, something that was good.

343
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,460
He, he glorified, he gloried in
his chains and being in prison,

344
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,860
Ignatius takes this from Paul and just
runs with it even more. So in Ephesians,

345
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:32,280
the 11th chapter of Ephesians, the
litter, not appalled to the Ephesians,

346
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:33,810
but the letter of
Ignatius to the Ephesians.

347
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,310
He talks about his per his
chains as pearls are he in,

348
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,130
in the first chapter of this letter
of Ignatius to wrote to the Romans,

349
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,230
he talks about the chains of Jesus.

350
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,130
And then also I mentioned that he sees
himself though as in his martyrdom,

351
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,830
he will get closer to Jesus.
And in this he's becoming himself.

352
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:57,690
He calls himself in in the first part
of this, to the, and the second chapter,

353
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,510
the letter to the Romans,

354
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,510
the logos [inaudible] and what do we
know that means we've seen this log off

355
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:04,640
stuff before,
right?

356
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,810
Transliterated remember,
remember what logos means?

357
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,730
The word correct. [inaudible].
Anybody know I've God.

358
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,230
Ignatius himself is the word of God.

359
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,150
This is what the gospel of John called
Jesus. Jesus was the word of God,

360
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,410
but Ignatius can even claim
for himself the status that he,

361
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,430
especially to his martyrdom
is the word of God. What does,

362
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:38,660
where does he get all this?
Well,

363
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,950
this is this developing martyrology
kind of ideology and literature.

364
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,590
The idea was,
and most of our Christianity,

365
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,550
when if you're a good Christian people,
when you die,

366
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,050
you won't immediately go to heaven.

367
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,140
It's not like popular thinking
about Christian doctrine.

368
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,630
True Christian doctrine doesn't say that.

369
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:58,200
You immediately go to
heaven unnecessarily.

370
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,070
It says that you maybe sleep
or do something with your body.

371
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,290
You have to wait for the
resurrection of the body.

372
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,700
It's why when you confess things
like in the Nicene creed popsicle,

373
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,860
you confess the resurrection of the
body of the resurrection of the flesh.

374
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,490
That's because that's in by Christian
doctrinally. That's the true afterlife.

375
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,450
Experience is not the immortal
soul just living forever,

376
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,330
but the resurrection of your
body as a new made body.

377
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
But what happens before the resurrection
because we all know that comes at the

378
00:22:23,361 --> 00:22:26,600
end of time. Well, most of the
Christians believed you slept somewhere,

379
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:30,950
or maybe your soul or your spirit
would go to some kind of halfway house.

380
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,640
This is develops into the,

381
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:37,290
the notion of of purgatory or some kind
of Haiti's type place or the sleep,

382
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,220
a place where you would either sleep or
you at your soul will go someplace else

383
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:45,170
and you'd wait for the resurrection. Well,
according to develop Christian ideas,

384
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,640
martyrs didn't have to wait for the
resurrection once they were martyred as a

385
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:52,100
reward for their martyrdom,
their spirit,

386
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,010
and go straight to heaven to
be with Jesus immediately.

387
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:00,290
So you bypass some, you know, bad
waiting room type experience. Uh,

388
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,124
if you're martyred,

389
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:06,080
this became even so important that
people who were condemned to mark to be

390
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:09,360
martyred but then weren't actually
killed for whatever reason.

391
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:13,730
Sometimes see people would be condemned
and maybe the beast Jorn hungry that day,

392
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,040
cancel being after thrown to the beast.

393
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:18,770
They might be turned loose later or
they might be in prison for a while,

394
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,400
or they might have a different governor
who comes along and decides to pardon

395
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,260
people are release them.
So what are you do?

396
00:23:24,261 --> 00:23:29,000
People who are condemned to martyrdom
but not actually martyred? Well,

397
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:32,420
they were very close to martyrdom.
So that makes them very close to God.

398
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:36,680
Because remember if martyrs right after
they die, go to heaven to be with Christ.

399
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,450
They're right there in heaven.

400
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,340
And therefore you can kind of pray to
martyrs to intercede with God or Christ

401
00:23:43,341 --> 00:23:45,740
for you because they're in already.

402
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,780
So this idea that martyrs
could be intercessors for
Living Christians develops

403
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,681
and they,

404
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:55,310
this even carries over to where if you
are condemned to martyrdom but you don't

405
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:58,700
actually get martyred,
you become what they call a confessor.

406
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,620
And this is because
people can confess to you,

407
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,030
they can confide in you,
that can help you.

408
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,290
So even people who are not
actually martyred that had
been condemned to death at

409
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,550
some point for their faith,

410
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,320
they attained a certain kind of closeness
to God through that activity. And they,

411
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,230
they gained therefore a
certain kind of authority. Now,

412
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:24,260
this was not an official
ecclesiastical authority.

413
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,990
No institution of the Church granted
these confessors their authority,

414
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,470
but they developed this authority because
people respected them and trusted them.

415
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,800
And so martyr martyr confessors became
somewhat of like charismatic authority

416
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:42,350
figures in the early church.

417
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,850
Now this caused problems in a few places
because what if you have a bunch of

418
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:51,020
people going out to some to see some
monk who's now a confessor because he was

419
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:55,820
condemned to martyrdom but then still
live and they're asking his opinions about

420
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:01,190
should I eat meat on Friday?
What days of the week should I pray on?

421
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,650
Is it okay to do this and okay,
do that.

422
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,300
And what if the confessor gives a
different answer from the Bishop?

423
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,070
Well,

424
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,060
some people might think the confessor
who's closer to God after all has more

425
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:17,390
authority than even then the bishop.
Well, bishops don't like this.

426
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:22,130
Of course they consider themselves the
authority in that location. So you get,

427
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,780
I get sometimes problems of WHO's
the greater authority, the confessor,

428
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,190
the martyr type figure or
the ecclesiastical official
figure of the Bishop.

429
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,560
So notice what Ignatius does with this,
though.

430
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,670
He spends a lot of times in his letters
claiming the authority of a martyr

431
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,900
because he's on his way to being
killed and he says, don't save me,

432
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,160
I want to be killed as a martyr.

433
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,750
But Ignatius also is one of the earliest
people we have in Christianity who

434
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:51,770
claims great authority
also for himself as bishop.

435
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,030
Now, he wouldn't necessarily have
authority as a bishop over any of the,

436
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,080
but the part of the, he was actually a
bishop. He wasn't the bishop of the world.

437
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,660
He was the bishop of Antioch,
the town in the,

438
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,750
in the east where where Paul and
Barnabas spent a good bit of their time.

439
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,640
So his actual official Ecclesiastical
Authority as Bishop was only an Antioch

440
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:11,510
and its environs.

441
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,250
So he's playing up his martyrology kind
of authority so that he can exercise a

442
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:19,700
bit of authority even over these
other churches that he's writing to.

443
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,640
That gives them a little
bit of a reach of authority.

444
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,460
But notice what he does then
with all this bishop stuff.

445
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:29,930
And here we see the beginnings of the
development of the Catholic church

446
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:34,220
structure at this very early time.
And this is early because we think that,

447
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,370
you know, Ignatius is writing these
letters around the year one 10.

448
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,840
And if you have this
developing, uh, episcopacy,

449
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,720
that's just the uh,
Greek sort of sounding word for bishop,

450
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,820
our bishop Rick or something like that.

451
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,310
If you had this developing
office of the bishops,

452
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,490
then it that happening at a fairly
early time in a Christianity look.

453
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:58,260
Therefore at the letter to the tray Lee's

454
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,040
it's right before the
letter to the Romans,

455
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,700
chapters two and three,

456
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,410
your obedience to your bishop
as though he were Jesus Christ.

457
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,333
Wow.

458
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,200
Talk about raising the bishop up shows
me plan the enough that yours is no

459
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:20,310
Wardley manner of life,

460
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:23,220
but that of Jesus Christ himself
who gave his life for us,

461
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:26,460
that faith in his death might save you
from death. At the same time. However,

462
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,180
it is essential that you should never
act independently of the bishop as

463
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:34,110
evidently you do not. You must also
be no less submissive to your clergy.

464
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,260
Now though,
the Greek word here is presbyters amber.

465
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,880
We've already seen his word come up, which
means elders more literally in Greek.

466
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,070
Now it's starting to be used for
particular kinds of clergy in the church.

467
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,170
So what we'll see is

468
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,823
the bishops

469
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,923
presbyters,

470
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,730
which we'll come to be priest

471
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,620
and remind them of as
apostles of Jesus Christ,

472
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,830
our hope in whom we shall one day be
found if our lives are lived in him,

473
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,150
the deacons to.
So now we have this other office.

474
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,600
We've seen these before,
right? We saw bishops,

475
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,630
presbyters and deacons and bishops in a
certain sense in the pastoral epistles,

476
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,560
but they weren't carefully
formed into a three tiered,

477
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,810
a institution of opposites. Now
we're getting it. And Ignatius,

478
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,490
what will become later basic,
uh,

479
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,530
church structure that lasts up until
the reformation will be bishops on top,

480
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,960
uh, pointed to particular
locations. So the bishop,

481
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:50,610
we over a city and all the
churches over this city.

482
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,320
And then under that will be priests
who have certain duties. For example,

483
00:28:55,321 --> 00:28:58,920
administering the Eucharist and the mass
and baptizing and under that will be

484
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:02,430
deacons who have other kinds of duties
in church and they're in that one, two,

485
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:03,690
three hierarchy.

486
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,890
The deacons to who serve the mysteries
of Jesus Christ must be men universally

487
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:11,310
approved in every way since they are
not mere dispensers of meat and drink,

488
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,220
but servants of the Church of God and
therefore under obligation to guard

489
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:18,360
themselves against any slur or amputation
as strictly as they would against fire

490
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:21,540
itself. Equally. This is paragraph three.

491
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,040
It is for the rest of you to hold the
deacons in as great respect as Jesus

492
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,340
Christ.

493
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,540
Just as you should look upon the bishop
as a type of the father and the clergy

494
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:34,740
as the epistolic circle forming
his counsel. Notice what we've got.

495
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:39,741
Then we've got to trinity
almost of offices there are
matched by something like

496
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,300
a trinity of these figures.
God,

497
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,130
the Bishop is the father.

498
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,600
The deacons are Jesus
Christ and the presbyters.

499
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,640
He calls him an episodic council.

500
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What he's doing is he's actually setting
up these offices of the early church to

501
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:04,540
look kind of like a law court where
you'd have a judge who sat on a,

502
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,810
on a die and you'd have other officials.

503
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:13,020
So He's imitating Roman official legal
and political governmental structures by

504
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:20,221
having regional bishops presiding over
a plurality of priests who then are also

505
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:25,870
over a plurality of deacons
your hand up. Okay. So,

506
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,660
but what makes it really odd
is that he equates, you know,

507
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,050
Jesus the father and apostles
with deacons, bishop and clergy.

508
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,140
And so this is giving them,

509
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,700
this is giving these men in these
offices a great deal of power. In fact,

510
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,770
it's giving them way more power and
authority than most of us historians think

511
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:49,510
they actually had at this point.

512
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:54,100
We think we know from other historical
documents that bishops didn't have that

513
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:55,750
much power until much later.

514
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,420
Presbyters didn't have that
much power til way later.

515
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,580
So Ignatius is trying to pump up
what is actually a fairly new, uh,

516
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,620
structure of authority and a institutional
structure in these. So he does.

517
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,550
He says all the time things like, dude,
don't do anything without the bishop.

518
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,270
He talks about in the letter to the
magnesium [inaudible], paragraph six,

519
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,830
he talks about the Bishops Authority is
the authority of God. The father, uh,

520
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:24,310
he says in the,
in magnesium letter of Chapter Seven,

521
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,840
the Bishop has to be regarded as the
Lord himself. So what is he doing here?

522
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:33,700
He's writing these letters to these
different churches and even in fact,

523
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:34,870
scriptural interpretation.

524
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,900
The main thing about modern Protestantism
is the idea that every Christian is

525
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,190
responsible only to reading of scripture.

526
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,420
Scripture only your responsibility is to
find the will of God through scripture,

527
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:49,900
through the revelation of scripture.
Ignatius totally disagreed with that.

528
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,041
He says,

529
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:55,300
there should be no individual
interpretation of scripture
apart from your bishop.

530
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,870
Why? Ignatius knows what
we've all learned ourselves,

531
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,110
that you can make a text mean anything
you want. And as we see from the road,

532
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,460
from Protestantism fracturing up into
a million different denominations and

533
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:09,250
churches all claiming to
be following the Bible,

534
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,260
you can make the Bible say whatever
you want it to say, and everybody does.

535
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,910
So Ignatius also, he says, you can't
even interpret scripture on your own.

536
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,440
You have to do that in agreement
with the Bishop. So what?

537
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,320
What are we seeing here going on?
We see Christianity,

538
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,030
this fledgling movement
starting to imitate the
structures of the Roman Empire.

539
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,220
It's no longer a bunch of simply house
churches that are loosely federated by

540
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:39,950
the fact that they send letters back and
forth and have emissaries between them.

541
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,490
It's no longer an authority structure
where Paul simply has to exert his

542
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:47,000
authority as much as he can through his
own force of will in this charismatic

543
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:50,600
authority and Claim Authority
as an apostle, although
it doesn't have any paper,

544
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,390
nobody ever gave Paul a diploma that
said, you know, Paul, the apostle is net.

545
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,560
Now an apostle. He couldn't
refer to his, you know,

546
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,510
Princeton seminary theological seminary
diploma to prove that his authority,

547
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,800
he just had depend upon this claim that
he had, that he had seen the risen Jesus,

548
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,540
that he had had this
revelation experience.

549
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,190
So we're moving from that
kind of charismatic exercise
of authority to what is

550
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,880
now much more institutional kinds of
hierarchical structures of authority.

551
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:22,010
Medieval Christianity would
itself therefore imitate,

552
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,460
uh, the structures of
monarchy and empire. Who,

553
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,230
who elects the pope well in.

554
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,020
And we'll see later that,
uh,

555
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,770
in this period po bishop seemed to have
actually been elected by the people,

556
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,550
or at least by the,

557
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:42,550
by other presbyters and bishops were
often elected bishops in the modern Roman

558
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,860
Catholic church are not elected by the
people that are appointed by the Vatican

559
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,570
who elects the pope while the cardinals.
So they're, the pope is elected but in,

560
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,460
but by only a limited number of men,

561
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,880
old men who themselves were
appointed by previous popes.

562
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,300
So this is not a democratic system that,
uh,

563
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,570
the Roman Catholic church is structured
on. What does it structured on?

564
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:07,810
It's structured on a monarchical and
imperial ideas of politics in the ancient

565
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:09,200
world in the Middle Ages.

566
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,180
So you have an emperor and you have a
pope and they come to hold their power and

567
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:16,700
remarkably similar ways.
They each have a court,

568
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,260
the emperor or the king has a
quarter of officials that, um,

569
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,510
nights and that sort of thing that
advise him and carry out as well.

570
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,960
The pope has a house of
cardinals and bishops.

571
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,640
The reformation comes along
and decides to change things.

572
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,150
But the referee and the reformers of
course sort of claim that what they were

573
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:38,720
doing was simply getting back to the
biblical model. That's not really right.

574
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,570
What they were doing was
reflecting what were arising,

575
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:46,571
bourgeoisie forms of at least a bit
more Republican or democratic political

576
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,350
structures. So Rep, uh,

577
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:52,190
Protestant churches have their different
kinds of ways of structuring themselves,

578
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,800
which are not free from
political influence either.

579
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,810
They just represent the early modern
political structures that arose as the

580
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:04,220
bourgeoisie in Europe developed more
and more power and took more powers onto

581
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:04,970
itself.

582
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:09,970
So the growth of a mercantile middleclass
and the decline of the aristocracy in

583
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:14,630
Europe led to more democratic tendencies,

584
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:17,420
first in towns and then in countries.
Overall,

585
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,720
it led to republicanism the Dutch with
a first to completely get rid of kings

586
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:28,070
and have a modern republic. And then
of course, the United States becomes,

587
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,310
uh,
the,

588
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:34,311
the most famous of modern republics in
the beginning and in place of having the

589
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:36,260
king or the emperor in control.

590
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,390
You're supposed have
constitutional controls,

591
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,010
things that bodies of people come
together to make laws and constitutions,

592
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:47,940
and then you use that
constitutional control to bring
about unity. Now, of course,

593
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:49,860
as we've seen in our own modern politics,

594
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,750
you can't always depend
upon the constitutions to
protect you from a certain

595
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:59,040
rulers, but that's the ideal
reflecting a modern movement.

596
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,020
So that's one of the ways that you see
how Christianity both comes out in the

597
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:04,830
ancient world,

598
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,740
changes in the medieval period and then
changes it again in the early modern

599
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:08,520
period.

600
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,390
It's reflecting the changes that are
going on also in politics and society,

601
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,460
which we of course shouldn't
be surprised about.

602
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,780
The other thing that we can
see developing though too is,

603
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:20,280
and we see this more from the Dda,
k,

604
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,990
the other document I
asked you to read today,

605
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,520
this shift toward trying to
control things like liturgy,

606
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,360
the dedicated,
um,

607
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,710
was discovered in the dedicate
is simply a Greek word.

608
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:35,790
It means the teaching.

609
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:40,830
Because this document purports to be
the teaching of the 12 apostles. Now,

610
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,710
it wasn't actually written by the 12
apostles. It was written much later.

611
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:46,320
It may have been written around the
same time that the letters of Ignatius,

612
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,660
most people place it around
the turn of the first century.

613
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:51,600
So around the year 100 or
a little bit after that,

614
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,060
it's called the teaching
of the 12 apostles. It's,

615
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,410
and it's the first time we get an
Christian literature is something like a

616
00:36:58,411 --> 00:37:02,190
manual on how to do it. Here's how
you're supposed to do a worship service.

617
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,780
Here's how you're
supposed to do a baptism.

618
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,970
Here's how you're supposed to
do the Eucharist or the mass.

619
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,950
Here's what authority structures you have.

620
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,990
It was discovered in 1873 so really only,

621
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,630
you know it's fairly modern,
is a very modern discovery,

622
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,290
didn't exist from the ancient period
for Oregon analogies as far as we know.

623
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,280
It was discovered in a monastery
in Istanbul, Constantinople,

624
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:24,770
that is now Istanbul.

625
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,010
So the importance of the discovery
of this document was Ken is hard to

626
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,920
overestimate because it's just a great,

627
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:39,921
great document for an early period of
seeing how did Christians actually do

628
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:40,944
their liturgy.

629
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,140
It's very dependent upon the gospel of
Matthew and the letter of James in the

630
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,240
New Testament.
It shows a lot of things like that.

631
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:52,560
It's also dependent upon certain Greek
philosophical and Hellenistic Jewish

632
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,350
ideas. But now let's just look
at some of the things that says,

633
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:01,050
look on paragraph seven
chapter seven of the DDA. K

634
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,590
We get hints about how early Christians
did baptisms from different places.

635
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,650
We think most of the time that
it was an earliest period,

636
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,680
not splunking a water or are
dipping a little water on something,

637
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,690
but putting people all
the way under the water.

638
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:20,250
We also get hints maybe that they had
people do it at night and they had it.

639
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,610
People do it naked. So you took off your
clothes, you went down into the water,

640
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,421
you were baptized,

641
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:27,090
you came up and they'd put a white
robe or something else on you.

642
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,330
So we have a few hints about this,
but this is one of the,

643
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:32,970
this is the earliest time we have
anything like these instructions.

644
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,490
It says now about baptism.
This is how to baptize,

645
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:41,350
give public instruction on all these
points, and then baptize in running water.

646
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,350
Notice he wants you to,
it's extra as living water and the Greek.

647
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:48,340
But what he means is try to baptize in
a river or something that has actual

648
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:52,330
running water and not instill water if
you can in the name of the father and of

649
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,410
the son and the Holy Spirit.

650
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,320
So you have trinitarian
formula as part of the baptism.

651
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,470
If you do not have running water,
baptized in some other,

652
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,880
if you cannot in cold than in warm. So
they had to be bad Tizen, Coldwater. Yep.

653
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,380
Uh,

654
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,590
before the baptism or over at the one
who baptized into one being baptist most

655
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:12,280
fast. So you have fasting ahead
of time and any others who can,

656
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:15,310
and you must tell the one being baptized
to fast for one or two days beforehand.

657
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,700
And then he goes into fasting. Here's how
you, here's how you're supposed to fast.

658
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:22,500
You're supposed to fast on, um, uh,

659
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,160
three times a day and other prey. Now
this is the prayer. I can't see it here.

660
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,660
Oh yeah. Uh, you, you're fast must not be
identical with those of the hypocrites.

661
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,400
They fast on Mondays and Thursdays,

662
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:36,730
but you should fast on Wednesdays and
Fridays. Well, who are the hypocrites?

663
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,190
Probably Jews.
He's probably trying to say,

664
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,510
I don't want you Christians to fast on
the same fast days of the week that Jews

665
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:47,050
are fasting on, so he gives them other
days to fast. Notice what he says.

666
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,840
He gives the Lord's prayer,
which is familiar to most modern people.

667
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,990
Our Father in heaven, hallowed
be your name. Your kingdom come,

668
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,800
your will be done on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our bread for the morrow.

669
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,160
Forgive us our debts as we forgive our
debtors. Do not lead us into temptation,

670
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,830
but save us from the evil one for yours
is the power and the glory forever.

671
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:07,660
That sounds a lot like the Lord's prayer
that you yourself may often say in

672
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:11,110
church if you ever go to church,
but if you, if you notice carefully,

673
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,760
this prayer is actually more like what
most modern Christians pray in church

674
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,210
then is either the version of the
Lord's prayer in Matthew or Luke.

675
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,513
In other words,

676
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,380
he's closer to what we actually prayed
today than either the prayer version in

677
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:27,071
Matthew or Luke,

678
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:30,700
which is a very interesting fact in
itself that our prayer comes more from a

679
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:33,940
tradition that's closer to the
DDA, Kay, than it is to the Bible.

680
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,810
Notice he gives instructions
on the Eucharist.

681
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,570
One of the interesting things is
if you go to a church nowadays,

682
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,470
usually what they do is they blessed the
bread first and then the cup of wine.

683
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,390
He actually has it the other way around.
He says,

684
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,610
you give the cup first and then the bread,

685
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,520
you have first prayers of thanksgiving,

686
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,600
and it's this word Thanksgiving that
we actually get the term Eucharist.

687
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:03,820
If that just comes from the
Greek word Thanksgiving, uh,

688
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,230
if you go to different
Christian denominations,
they'll call this differently.

689
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:12,280
Some places call it the Lord's supper.
Some people call it just the communion.

690
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,220
And if you and some churches,
especially episcopal churches,

691
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:18,820
we'll call it the Eucharist. In Catholic
churches, he used to call it the mass,

692
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,860
but they're all referring
basically to the same thing.

693
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:24,640
There's the sharing of the bread and the
wine. So he gives instructions on that.

694
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,440
Uh, he also noticed says the Eucharist
is to be restricted to only baptized

695
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:32,770
Christians so you don't give the bread
and the wine to people who are not

696
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,613
baptized.

697
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,150
Then he gives some prescribed prayers
in chapter 10 and it's interesting.

698
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,420
He's now we're not in a time where people
are just allowed to pray any away they

699
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:45,260
want to. He actually gives written prayers
that there that he wants them to use.

700
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,780
Again, don't exaggerate. This guy's
control. Whoever's writing this, we don't,

701
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,820
we don't believe that this document was
actually controlling behavior of all

702
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,813
Christmas at this time.

703
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,500
He's trying to bring about some unity
and conformity and a time that we,

704
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:04,160
historians assume there was
still a huge amount of diversity,

705
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,730
but by publishing this document and
telling people even how to pray,

706
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:12,820
he's trying to bring about this kind
of unity in chapter 14 it's interesting

707
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:16,220
because it gives the different events
that would take place on the Lord's Day.

708
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,980
That is Sunday. For example,
you're supposed to have confession.

709
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:20,120
You confess your sins.

710
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,930
You're supposed to reconcile with anybody
that you're not in agreement with.

711
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:29,030
And then you have the Eucharist, which
he talks about as a sacrifice. So by now,

712
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,460
Paul had never talked about sort of uh,

713
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,160
the Lord's supper as being
something like a sacrifice.

714
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,710
And later Christianity,

715
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:40,580
it will be considered something like a
sacrifice when then, so that's why the,

716
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,270
you can only have a priest do it because
it actually changes the elements and

717
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,250
something's real is going on there.

718
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,570
So the Eucharist has by this time started
becoming considered something like a

719
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:54,500
sacrifice for Christians who don't have
any other form of sacrifice, right?

720
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:58,040
Because Christians don't go around
sacrificing lamb or any lambs or anything

721
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:00,170
else.
And then you have different leaders.

722
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:03,860
He has in chapter 11
roles for apostles and,

723
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,190
but he also has roles for profits.
Notice what he said in chapter 11.

724
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:08,150
I think this is really interesting.

725
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:12,950
This is a time when there seems
to be regular sorts of officers,

726
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:18,170
but then there are these non sort
of regular officers. Where am I?

727
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,153
Oh

728
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,813
yeah.

729
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:30,620
Okay.

730
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,340
Now about the apostles and prophets
act in line with the Gospel precept.

731
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:37,370
Welcome every apostle on arriving,
arriving as if he were the Lord.

732
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,600
But he must not stay beyond one
day in case of necessity. However,

733
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:43,280
the next day too,
if he stays three days,

734
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:48,281
he has a false prophet on departing and
apostle must not accept anything safe,

735
00:43:48,441 --> 00:43:51,860
sufficient food to carry him till his
next lodging. If he asked for money,

736
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,500
he's a false prophet. So just kind of
mixing these Word Apostle and prophet.

737
00:43:55,501 --> 00:43:59,270
Remember Apostle just means one who is
sent out in Greek boy he's talking about

738
00:43:59,271 --> 00:44:03,050
are roving prophet who go around to
different churches and it is really

739
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:06,440
introduced as you know,
let him stay with you two or three days.

740
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,240
If he's going to stay longer than that,

741
00:44:08,241 --> 00:44:10,340
he's gonna have to start
working for his bread.

742
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:14,150
And if you have a prophet who
says, hmm, I'm getting a message,

743
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,320
I'm getting a message. Oh yeah, you're
supposed to give me $5. Jesus. So

744
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,370
then you know he's a false
prophet and you kick them out.

745
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,030
So it's a nice way to figure out what
your genuine profits in which were false

746
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:27,620
prophets.
If this were followed in,

747
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:30,860
most modern Christianity
would have a lot of false,

748
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,700
not on TV.

749
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,620
Unfortunately it doesn't
work in modern Christianity.

750
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,520
So we have a lot of false prophets
on TV asking for a lot of money.

751
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,330
So there's also in chapter 12,
this is not just true for profits.

752
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,690
He talks about how to treat
other travelers. So this,

753
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,480
the churches are becoming
something almost like hotels,

754
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,690
which is makes sense because
in the ancient world there
aren't really very many

755
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:01,380
hotels. You couldn't just, you know, check
in at the motel six. So the Holiday Inn,

756
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,840
when you're traveling around,
you have to stay with friends.

757
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,690
There are a few taverns,
yes, some brothels,

758
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,560
but they're not very safe and that
they're very unsafe and they're not

759
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:15,120
respectable places for a good person to
stay, uh, their houses of ill repute.

760
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,160
And so what do you do if you're a good,

761
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:20,340
respectable Christian and you want all
of your other fellow Christians know that

762
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:23,400
you haven't been sleeping around, uh,
when you're on your business trip? Well,

763
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:27,330
you have to either stay with friends or
now increasingly you can stay with the

764
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:29,160
church.
But he says,

765
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,280
if you have these travelers who come in
and they want to stay more than two or

766
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:35,790
three days, then they have to get a job.
They had to start supporting themselves.

767
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:40,560
So you see him developing this
church as a networked organization.

768
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,251
Again,

769
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:45,450
we have more and more organization
coming into play here that has d defined,

770
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,733
uh,

771
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:51,300
offices and some others that aren't
so well defined like these traveling

772
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:53,700
profits,
which he's trying to regularize.

773
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,940
So he's trying to give rules for an
institution of the profit because that

774
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:03,420
itself is not an institutional kind
of office in early Christianity.

775
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,860
So with Ignatius and with the [inaudible],

776
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:13,820
we've moved along way from this tiny
little band of followers of a Jewish

777
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,990
apocalyptic prophet named
Jesus of Nazareth. In fact,

778
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:24,110
we've even moved a good ways away from
the informal charismatic kind of House

779
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:28,140
Churches planted by the Apostle Paul,
right?

780
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,180
We're now seeing the institution.

781
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,920
We've not yet arrived at what
will become Christianity.

782
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:39,060
That is with all the
trappings of late antiquity,

783
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,200
full church structures, creeds, doctrines,

784
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:48,060
social networks, monasticism. This'll
be a big thing that starts developing,

785
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:49,740
especially in the third,
fourth and fifth century,

786
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,210
the rise of monasticism as another form
of Christianity that provides a very

787
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,150
important structure for it that will
last all the way through the medieval

788
00:46:57,151 --> 00:47:01,680
period. We don't have that
yet. We don't have a canon yet.

789
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:04,590
We don't have a canon even though the old
testament Muslims or the new testament

790
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:09,180
yet, but we see developing in the letters
of Ignatius and in the DDA DTK the

791
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:12,810
beginnings of this later development
into what will come in more mature

792
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:13,644
Christianity.

793
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,990
The move from that late
Antique Christianity though
say to the Christianity of

794
00:47:18,991 --> 00:47:20,970
the fourth century when
we get the major creeds,

795
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:25,971
like the Nicene creed and the creed of
Eden to modern Christianity and it being

796
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,100
what we call a world religion
is itself centuries away though,

797
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,150
and I'll talk about that next time.

798
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,480
What we've done this whole semester is
barely scratched the surface though of

799
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:44,170
what would be the history of Christianity
and the main point of the scratching

800
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,810
has been to get you to see
that at the very beginning,

801
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:49,810
the first 100 years of
this Christian movement,

802
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:52,570
because that's basically all we've
covered, and not all that either,

803
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,760
but the basic first 100 years,

804
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,990
this was not anything like the
religion it came to be. It was diverse.

805
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,410
It was widely different
across geographic areas.

806
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,060
It had lots of different doctrines.

807
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,140
There wasn't anything called
orthodoxy yet and Harrison yet.

808
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,990
That all develops later, but it's,
this is the very beginnings of it.

809
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,420
Any questions,
comments or outburst?

810
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,770
Okay,
I'll see you next time.

811
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,820
We will also hand out the final paper
instructions next time in class.
