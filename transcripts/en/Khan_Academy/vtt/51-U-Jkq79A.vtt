00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.230
Divide.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.770
Simplify the answer and write
as a mixed number.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.230
And we have 2 and 1/4 divided
by 1 and 3/4.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.150
So the first thing we want to
do since both of these are

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.260
mixed numbers is to
convert them both

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.500
into improper fractions.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.740
So let's start with 2 and 1/4.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.850
So we're still going to have
4 in the denominator, but

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.030
instead of 2 and 1/4,
remember, 2 is the

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.680
same thing as 8/4.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.340
So we have 8/4, and then
we have another 1/4.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.230
That gives us 9/4.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.900
Or another way to come up with
this 9, you take 4 times 2,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.990
which is 8, plus 1.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.370
That gives you 9.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.720
And then the 1 and 3/4,
same process.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.880
You're going to have 4 in the
denominator, and then the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.780
numerator is going to be 4 times
1, which is 4, plus 3,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.450
which is 7.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.990
So this is the exact
same problem here.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.370
2 and 1/4 divided by 1 and 3/4
is the same thing as 9/4

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.860
divided by 7/4.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.200
And we saw in several videos
already that dividing by a

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.000
fraction is the same thing as
multiplying by its reciprocal.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.900
So this is equivalent to-- so
these are all equivalent.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.960
This is equivalent to 9/4 times
the reciprocal of this.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.833
We're changing the division
operation to a multiplication,

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:21.390
and we're taking the reciprocal
of the 7/4.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.490
For the reciprocal of 7/4, you
swap the numerator and

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.100
denominator, or the top
number and the bottom

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.730
number, and you get 4/7.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.950
Now, we could just
multiply these.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.380
We could just say this is 9
times 4, which would be 36,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.590
over 4 times 7, which is 28,
and then try to put it in

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.900
lowest terms, or we could do it
right now because it would

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.290
be simpler.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.820
We have a 4 in the numerator.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.560
We have a 4 in the denominator,
that'll

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.080
eventually be in the
denominator, so let's divide

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.280
our eventual numerators
and our eventual

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.960
denominators both by 4.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.040
So you divide this 4
by 4, you get 1.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.070
This 4 by 4, you get 1.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.990
So now when you multiply it, you
get 9 times 1, which is 9,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.660
over 1 times 7, which is 7.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.680
So we have our answer,
but right now,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.150
it's an improper fraction.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.160
They want us to write it
as a mixed number.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.560
And to figure it out as a mixed
number, we can do it in

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.160
our heads now.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
I think we've seen this
enough times.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.190
We say how many times
does 7 go into 9?

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.020
Well, it goes into it exactly
one time, but when you take 7

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.720
into 9 one time, what do
you have left over?

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.190
Well, you're going to have
2 left over, right?

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.650
7 times 1 is 7, and you're going
to have 2 left over.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.015
You need 2 more to get to 9.

00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:37.920
So you're going to have 2 left
over, so this is 1 and 2/7.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.520
And we're done!
