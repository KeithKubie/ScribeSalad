00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.259
that I won't have anything to say I'm
worried that they won't think that I'm

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269
worried that they won't think that I'm
 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.449
worried that they won't think that I'm
high up enough to actually care about

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459
high up enough to actually care about
 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.250
high up enough to actually care about
what I'm gonna say I'm not gonna add

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260
what I'm gonna say I'm not gonna add
 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.170
what I'm gonna say I'm not gonna add
value and he'd said great just by

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180
value and he'd said great just by
 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.849
value and he'd said great just by
actually articulating the undesired

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859
actually articulating the undesired
 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.129
actually articulating the undesired
State you are naming it and you're

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139
State you are naming it and you're
 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.750
State you are naming it and you're
taming it you're gonna be more aware

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760
taming it you're gonna be more aware
 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.210
taming it you're gonna be more aware
when those undesired states manifest and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220
when those undesired states manifest and
 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.099
when those undesired states manifest and
that's the first step and so he said

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109
that's the first step and so he said
 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.800
that's the first step and so he said
step two is that you have to articulate

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810

just put out a study a couple years ago

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580
just put out a study a couple years ago
 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.420
just put out a study a couple years ago
and they found out that 60% of all

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430
and they found out that 60% of all
 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.090
and they found out that 60% of all
people identify struggling with shyness

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100
people identify struggling with shyness
 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.510
people identify struggling with shyness
or social anxiety 60% so if you've

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520
or social anxiety 60% so if you've
 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.610
or social anxiety 60% so if you've
struggled with that kind of intimidation

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620
struggled with that kind of intimidation
 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.650
struggled with that kind of intimidation
you've had that self-critical internal

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660
you've had that self-critical internal
 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.290
you've had that self-critical internal
dialogue you are in the majority and so

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300
dialogue you are in the majority and so
 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.210
dialogue you are in the majority and so
you need to be easy on yourself and say

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220
you need to be easy on yourself and say
 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.189
you need to be easy on yourself and say
that those feelings are natural and

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199
that those feelings are natural and
 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.770
that those feelings are natural and
they're ubiquitous everyone has those

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780
they're ubiquitous everyone has those
 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.050
they're ubiquitous everyone has those
and so when we have those feelings we

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060
and so when we have those feelings we
 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.640
and so when we have those feelings we
should notice that most times when we

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650
should notice that most times when we
 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.529
should notice that most times when we
have that kind of intimidation factor we

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539
have that kind of intimidation factor we
 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.600
have that kind of intimidation factor we
feel unworthy we're comparing ourselves

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610
feel unworthy we're comparing ourselves
 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.939
feel unworthy we're comparing ourselves
to others we're looking at other people

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949
to others we're looking at other people
 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.260
to others we're looking at other people
and saying oh wow there's so much

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270

oh wow I'm never going to be that good
and so comparison is the thief of joy if

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599
and so comparison is the thief of joy if
 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:14.939
and so comparison is the thief of joy if
we're constantly comparing ourselves
