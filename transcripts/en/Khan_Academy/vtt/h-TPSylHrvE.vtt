00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:03.728
Let's say that I've got some angle theta,

00:00:03.728 --> 00:00:07.430
some angle theta right over here.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.208
And I'm drawing it on our unit circle

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.376
with a typical convention

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.125
that we started with a ray

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:13.913
that's along the positive X axis,

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.542
and the terminal side of this angle,

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:17.907
is the terminal side of the angle,

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:19.875
where it intersects the unit circle,

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:21.799
determines essentially the sine

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:24.460
and cosine of that theta,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.419
so the cosine of theta is the X...

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:27.411
is the...

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.954
let me just set a color
I haven't used before.

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:32.202
The cosine of theta is the X coordinate

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:33.943
of where this terminal ray

00:00:33.943 --> 00:00:35.245
intersects the unit circle.

00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:37.141
Or another way of thinking about it is

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:41.034
the cosine of theta is the length of

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:44.065
what I'm drawing in
purple right over here.

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:45.058
It's this length.

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:46.850
That length right over there

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.820
is cosine of theta,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.197
and the sine of theta is the Y coordinate.

00:00:52.197 --> 00:00:53.434
Or another way of thinking about it

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:57.864
the sine of theta is the length of

00:00:57.864 --> 00:01:00.109
this line right over here.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.503
The how high you are above the X axis,

00:01:02.503 --> 00:01:04.613
that is essentially the Y coordinate,

00:01:04.613 --> 00:01:07.981
and so the length of that is sine theta.

00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:09.400
And this makes sense,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.176
this actually shows why
the unit circle definition

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:15.425
is an extension of the
Soh Cah Toa definition.

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:16.644
Remember, Soh Cah Toa.

00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:17.537
Let me write it down.

00:01:17.537 --> 00:01:18.800
Soh Cah Toa.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:28.128
Soh Cah Toa.

00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:29.231
So sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:01:29.231 --> 00:01:31.659
So if I want to do the sine of theta,

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.145
what's it going to be?

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:35.996
So if I think about the sine of theta,

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:38.366
sine of theta by the
Soh Cah Toa definition,

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.378
it's going to be equal to

00:01:39.378 --> 00:01:41.606
the length of the opposite side.

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:43.856
Well, we're saying that
that's sine of theta,

00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:46.373
it's sine of theta,

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:47.695
over the hypotenuse.

00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:48.582
Well the hypotenuse here,

00:01:48.582 --> 00:01:49.481
this is a unit circle,

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:51.386
so it's going to be one.

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.319
So this shows that this is consistent.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.387
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:01:55.387 --> 00:02:00.390
sine of theta is equal
to the opposite side

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.479
over the hypotenuse.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.038
In this case it's going to be equal to

00:02:04.038 --> 00:02:05.160
the opposite side,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.158
and what's the hypotenuse?

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:07.043
This is a unit circle,

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:08.549
so it's going to be one.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.135
In this case, sine of theta is equal

00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:12.112
to the length of the opposite side.

00:02:12.112 --> 00:02:13.232
The length of the opposite side

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:14.713
is equal to sine theta.

00:02:14.713 --> 00:02:16.694
And same exact logic.

00:02:16.694 --> 00:02:21.292
The cosine of theta is equal to

00:02:21.292 --> 00:02:23.436
adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:27.963
is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:02:27.963 --> 00:02:29.046
And so that's...

00:02:29.046 --> 00:02:30.678
since the hypotenuse is equal to one,

00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:32.520
it's just the length of the adjacent side,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.412
so cosine of theta is the
length of the adjacent side.

00:02:35.412 --> 00:02:37.534
So this is all a little bit of review,

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:39.244
just showing how the
unit circle definition

00:02:39.244 --> 00:02:41.770
is an extension of the
Soh Cah Toa definition.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.278
But now let's do something interesting.

00:02:43.278 --> 00:02:44.714
This is the angle theta.

00:02:44.714 --> 00:02:46.264
Let's think about the angle theta

00:02:46.264 --> 00:02:48.509
plus pi over two.

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:52.075
So the angle theta plus pi over two.

00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:54.150
So if I were to essentially
add pi over two to this,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.265
I'm going to get a ray
that is perpendicular

00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:57.542
to the first ray,

00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:58.376
pi over two.

00:02:58.376 --> 00:02:59.252
If we think in degrees,

00:02:59.252 --> 00:03:01.004
pi over two radians,

00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:02.165
so when I say theta plus pi over two,

00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:03.325
I'm talking in radians.

00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:04.668
Pi over two radians is

00:03:04.668 --> 00:03:06.458
equivalent to 90 degrees.

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:08.856
So we're essentially
adding 90 degrees to it.

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.236
So this angle right over here,

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:12.538
that angle right over here is

00:03:12.538 --> 00:03:16.882
theta plus pi over two.

00:03:16.882 --> 00:03:19.755
Now, what I want to explore in this video,

00:03:19.755 --> 00:03:21.537
and I guess this is the
interesting part of the video,

00:03:21.537 --> 00:03:26.635
is can we relate sin of theta plus

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:31.976
pi over two to somehow sine of theta

00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:33.624
or cosine of theta?

00:03:33.624 --> 00:03:35.428
I encourage you to pause this video

00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:36.763
and try to think this through on your own

00:03:36.763 --> 00:03:38.912
before I work it out.

00:03:39.413 --> 00:03:40.712
Well let's think about what sine of theta

00:03:40.712 --> 00:03:41.865
plus pi over two is.

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:43.712
We know from the unit circle definition,

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:45.756
the sine of this angle,

00:03:45.756 --> 00:03:46.915
which is theta plus pi over two,

00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:48.574
is the Y coordinate.

00:03:48.574 --> 00:03:51.687
It's that, it's this
value right over here.

00:03:51.687 --> 00:03:53.244
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:03:53.244 --> 00:03:59.951
it's the length of this line in magenta.

00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:04.432
This right over here is the sine of theta,

00:04:04.432 --> 00:04:06.671
plus pi over two.

00:04:07.373 --> 00:04:08.982
So that right over there.

00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:10.767
Now how does that relate

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:13.591
to what we have over here?

00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:14.649
Well when you look at it,

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:16.190
it looks like we just took this triangle,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.421
and we just kind of...

00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:18.653
we rotated it.

00:04:18.653 --> 00:04:20.887
We rotated it counter
clockwise by 90 degrees,

00:04:20.887 --> 00:04:22.765
which essentially what we did do.

00:04:22.765 --> 00:04:24.347
Because we took this terminal side,

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.195
and we added 90 degrees to it,

00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:27.936
or pi over two radians.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.837
And if you want to get

00:04:28.837 --> 00:04:30.263
a little bit more rigorous about it,

00:04:30.263 --> 00:04:34.238
if this whole white angle here is

00:04:34.238 --> 00:04:36.014
theta plus pi over two,

00:04:36.014 --> 00:04:37.431
and the part that's in the first quadrant

00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:38.971
is pi over two,

00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:40.734
then this part right over here,

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:43.534
that must be equal to theta.

00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:44.859
And if we think about it,

00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:47.007
if we try to relate the side

00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:48.576
this side that I've put in magenta

00:04:48.576 --> 00:04:49.890
relative to this angle theta

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.834
using the Soh Cah Toa definition,

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:54.728
here, relative to this
angle theta in yellow,

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:56.656
this is the adjacent side.

00:04:56.888 --> 00:04:58.426
So let's think about it a little bit.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.734
So if we were..

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.942
so what deals with the
adjacent and the hypotenuse,

00:05:01.942 --> 00:05:02.857
and in this case of course

00:05:02.857 --> 00:05:04.225
our hypotenuse has length one,

00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:05.767
this is a unit circle,

00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:09.045
what cosine deals with
adjacent and hypotenuse?

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:10.793
So we could say that the cosine

00:05:10.793 --> 00:05:12.367
of this theta

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:15.345
so the cosine of that theta

00:05:15.345 --> 00:05:17.975
is equal to the adjacent side,

00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:19.248
the length of the adjacent side

00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:20.223
which we already know

00:05:20.223 --> 00:05:24.374
is sine of theta plus pi over two.

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:25.164
Let me write it this way.

00:05:25.164 --> 00:05:31.625
Sine of theta plus pi over two.

00:05:31.824 --> 00:05:33.518
over the hypotenuse.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.550
Over the hypotenuse,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.588
which is just one,

00:05:35.588 --> 00:05:37.219
so that doesn't change its value.

00:05:37.482 --> 00:05:38.768
So that was pretty neat.

00:05:38.768 --> 00:05:40.025
Just like that,

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:40.961
we were able to come up

00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:42.381
with a pretty neat relationship

00:05:42.381 --> 00:05:44.218
between cosine and sine.

00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:46.048
The cosine of theta

00:05:46.048 --> 00:05:48.645
is equal to sine of
theta plus pi over two,

00:05:48.645 --> 00:05:51.360
or you could say sine of
theta plus pi over two

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.381
is equal to cosine of theta.

00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:56.945
Now what I encourage you to do is,

00:05:56.945 --> 00:05:57.912
after this video,

00:05:57.912 --> 00:06:00.504
see if you can come up with other results.

00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:01.609
Think about what happens to...

00:06:01.609 --> 00:06:04.593
what sine of theta relates to?

00:06:04.593 --> 00:06:06.503
Or what cosine of theta

00:06:06.503 --> 00:06:09.163
plus pi over two might relate to?

00:06:09.163 --> 00:06:10.455
So I encourage you to explore that

00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:12.234
on your own.
