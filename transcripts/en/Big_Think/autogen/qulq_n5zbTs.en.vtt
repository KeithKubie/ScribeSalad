basic improvising techniques and

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070
basic improvising techniques and

exercises like the mirror exercise where
 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.370
exercises like the mirror exercise where
you become my mirror and whatever I do

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380
you become my mirror and whatever I do

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.890
exactly the same time as if here is a
mirror with no lag time well if I'm the

mirror with no lag time well if I'm the
 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.750

communication is because it's my job if
 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.520

you don't understand it's my job to help
 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.180
you don't understand it's my job to help
you understand and improvising each

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190

experience right the principle of yes

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780
experience right the principle of yes
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.190
experience right the principle of yes
and is an example of that it's an

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200
and is an example of that it's an
 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.760
and is an example of that it's an
improvising tool to use this idea of yes

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770
improvising tool to use this idea of yes
 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.440
improvising tool to use this idea of yes
and for instance we're in a scene

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450
and for instance we're in a scene
 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.070
and for instance we're in a scene
together and you look down and you say

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080
together and you look down and you say
 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
together and you look down and you say
whoa look at all that water down there

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090
whoa look at all that water down there
 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.480
whoa look at all that water down there
and I say that's not water that's the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490
and I say that's not water that's the
 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.240
and I say that's not water that's the
floor well maybe I'll get a laugh out of

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250
floor well maybe I'll get a laugh out of
 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.280
floor well maybe I'll get a laugh out of
that from the audience but I've just

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290
that from the audience but I've just
 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.590
that from the audience but I've just
destroyed the scene and I've made you

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600
destroyed the scene and I've made you
 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.400
destroyed the scene and I've made you
look foolish

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410
look foolish
 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.680
look foolish
you called it water it's obviously a

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690
you called it water it's obviously a
 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.190
you called it water it's obviously a
floor that's yes it's not even yes it's

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200
floor that's yes it's not even yes it's
 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.030
floor that's yes it's not even yes it's
just no and you can say yes but and cut

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040
just no and you can say yes but and cut
 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.430
just no and you can say yes but and cut
it off with the but but if you say yes

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360
in and swim out to that whale and catch
 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.060
in and swim out to that whale and catch
on to the whale and swim away with the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070
on to the whale and swim away with the
 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.000
on to the whale and swim away with the
web now I've accepted what you've given

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010
web now I've accepted what you've given
 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.270
web now I've accepted what you've given
me and I've added to it this is a really

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280
me and I've added to it this is a really
 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.240
me and I've added to it this is a really
valuable technique in communication to

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250
valuable technique in communication to
 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.440
valuable technique in communication to
not say to the person yes but you know

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450
not say to the person yes but you know
 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.890
not say to the person yes but you know
that's not true but there's something

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900
that's not true but there's something
 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.360
that's not true but there's something
about it that may be true maybe it's

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370
about it that may be true maybe it's
 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.940
about it that may be true maybe it's
under the surface the person is saying I

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950
under the surface the person is saying I
 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.970
under the surface the person is saying I
wish I understood how the universe

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980
wish I understood how the universe
 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.599
wish I understood how the universe
worked

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:13.609
worked
 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.220
worked
and I think the unit

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
and I think the unit
 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.589
and I think the unit
works like this we're all connected

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599
works like this we're all connected
 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.039
works like this we're all connected
psychically and we all have we're all

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049
psychically and we all have we're all
 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.390
psychically and we all have we're all
telepathic we can and you know and it

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400
telepathic we can and you know and it
 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.460
telepathic we can and you know and it
could go up into some place where you

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
could go up into some place where you
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.280
could go up into some place where you
don't really agree at all but the person

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290
don't really agree at all but the person
 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.649
don't really agree at all but the person
is trying to figure out things and you

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659
is trying to figure out things and you
 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.420
is trying to figure out things and you
can agree about that because nobody has

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430
can agree about that because nobody has
 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.339
can agree about that because nobody has
the final answer on anything I don't

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349
the final answer on anything I don't
 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.670
the final answer on anything I don't
think so you can say yes to that part of

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680
think so you can say yes to that part of
 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.369
think so you can say yes to that part of
it and you can explore some part of it

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379
it and you can explore some part of it
 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.110
it and you can explore some part of it
that you both can explore together but

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
that you both can explore together but
 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.630
that you both can explore together but
the idea is if you cut off the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640
the idea is if you cut off the
 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.110
the idea is if you cut off the
connection then communication stops and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
connection then communication stops and
 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.500
connection then communication stops and
it's your job to keep the other person

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510
it's your job to keep the other person
 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.170
it's your job to keep the other person
with you and the way you do that the way

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180
with you and the way you do that the way
 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.729
with you and the way you do that the way
you keep the other person with you is

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739
you keep the other person with you is
 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.670
you keep the other person with you is
keep reading the clues you're getting

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680
keep reading the clues you're getting
 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.759
keep reading the clues you're getting
from the person the person the person's

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769
from the person the person the person's
 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.160

face the person's eyes the tone of voice
 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.619
face the person's eyes the tone of voice
the body language the way they occupied

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629
the body language the way they occupied
 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.199
the body language the way they occupied
it share all of this all of these things

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209
it share all of this all of these things
 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.390
it share all of this all of these things
are clues to what's going on in their

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400
are clues to what's going on in their
 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.160
are clues to what's going on in their
head as you try to communicate with them

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170
head as you try to communicate with them
 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.460
head as you try to communicate with them
and the funny thing is I think I've

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470
and the funny thing is I think I've
 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.699
and the funny thing is I think I've
found that this works not only when

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709
found that this works not only when
 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.490
found that this works not only when
you're talking to them face to face it

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500
you're talking to them face to face it
 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.830
you're talking to them face to face it
also works when they're separated from

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840
also works when they're separated from
 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.680
also works when they're separated from
you by time and distance like when you

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690
you by time and distance like when you
 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.530
you by time and distance like when you
write something for them and you don't

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540
write something for them and you don't
 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.970
write something for them and you don't
know who's going to read it where or

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980
know who's going to read it where or
 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.059
know who's going to read it where or
when but you can figure out when you put

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069
when but you can figure out when you put
 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.190
when but you can figure out when you put
down the first sentence what that's done

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200
down the first sentence what that's done
 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.890
down the first sentence what that's done
to their mind where that where are they

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900
to their mind where that where are they
 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.659
to their mind where that where are they
now

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669
now
 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.360
now
so where is my next sentence going to

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370
so where is my next sentence going to
 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.490
so where is my next sentence going to
pick up on where they are now and take

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500
pick up on where they are now and take
 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.430
pick up on where they are now and take
them to the next place and if we don't

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440
them to the next place and if we don't
 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.409
them to the next place and if we don't
think about the person we're writing for

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419
think about the person we're writing for
 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.770
think about the person we're writing for
we're just formulating thoughts in our

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780
we're just formulating thoughts in our
 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.650
we're just formulating thoughts in our
head we're caring about ourselves

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660
head we're caring about ourselves
 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.930
head we're caring about ourselves
we're not caring about the other player

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940
we're not caring about the other player
 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.199
we're not caring about the other player
I think communication is a partnership
