00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.796
&gt;&gt;Hi, Lennie and John.

00:00:11.096 --> 00:00:15.006
&gt;&gt;These students from Birmingham,
Alabama and Los Angeles, California,

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:18.786
are collaborating with their
professional heroes on live TV.

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:21.276
&gt;&gt;Well we had some
questions on this, Lennie,

00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:22.756
because he's getting comments.

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:25.306
We kinda wanted to get
your take on it, okay?

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:28.286
&gt;&gt;Part of an innovative
program called Acme Animation,

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:32.246
this twice a month teleconference
offers students instant feedback

00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:36.386
on their animation projects from
some of the top pros in the business.

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:40.466
&gt;&gt;This is something we used to
keep in mind at Disney a lot.

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:43.236
If we had a character like this,

00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:45.756
a side view could show
that really nicely.

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:45.976
Now--

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:49.866
&gt;&gt;The Acme Animation
program was founded in 1996.

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:52.716
Teacher Dave Master
realized that the evolution

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:56.816
of new technologies could transform
the teaching of the art form.

00:00:56.926 --> 00:00:59.896
But his initial efforts
met with resistance.

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:04.386
&gt;&gt;We came into schools that
didn't have computer technology

00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:07.666
and if they did have it, they
didn't wanna use it for the arts.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.426
They were using it
in computer classes.

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:12.306
The arts have been considered
a frill, even though arts

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.616
and entertainment is the
second largest export

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.226
of the United States right now,

00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:20.466
and it's a multi multi billion
dollar industry, and that there are

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:24.286
so many jobs and so many
ancillary fields in the arts.

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:28.156
&gt;&gt;Okay, wow, we're really
impressed by your clear poses.

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.836
Made us laugh over here.

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:30.986
That's great.

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.336
And usually, that's the hard part--

00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:35.366
&gt;&gt;What we're really trying to
do is get kids to understand

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.446
that there are many
ways to communicate.

00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:39.966
There are studies that show
from eighty to ninety percent

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.556
of most people's information
comes off of screens,

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:45.856
whether it be computer screens
or TV screens or movie screens.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.256
We're trying to get kids to
not just be consumers of that,

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:53.886
but to be educated consumers of
that kind of material, and also,

00:01:54.226 --> 00:01:57.706
at the same time, creators
of their own material.

00:01:57.786 --> 00:01:59.746
&gt;&gt;We weren't sure if we
should add something.

00:02:00.616 --> 00:02:02.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Every other
Tuesday, Acme mentors gather

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:06.426
at various studio sites and
are connected to schools

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.986
across the country via
teleconferencing gear

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:15.016
that includes digital projectors and
laptops to run animation sequences.

00:02:15.186 --> 00:02:17.506
&gt;&gt;Okay, you're gonna
have to make that clear

00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:19.586
so the audience will understand
it, because you don't want--

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:21.406
&gt;&gt;We have principles in animation

00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:25.326
that over the last 200 years have
been developed, that enable a student

00:02:25.326 --> 00:02:28.436
if they learn them, to better
convey their creative ideas.

00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:32.676
To learn these principles takes time,
so it goes from a bouncing ball,

00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:36.356
which has about 80 percent of all
the physical principles and timing

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:39.156
that a student will ever have to
learn in their entire history,

00:02:39.156 --> 00:02:42.676
and it's all wrapped up in that
little ball, bouncing and squashing

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:46.026
and stretching, with inertia
at the top, and slowing down,

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:47.716
decreasing speed, increasing speed.

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:50.536
All of the things that they're
gonna do when they create characters

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:53.766
in whole films are all wrapped
up in that little bouncing ball

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.646
that they learned in the
beginning when they start.

00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:59.356
So the design principles and
the composition principles

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:02.526
and the principles of
good storytelling, music,

00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:04.546
are all brought into animation.

00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:09.216
&gt;&gt;To progress in the course, Acme
students must demonstrate their grasp

00:03:09.216 --> 00:03:13.496
of basic animation principles in
exercises like the bouncing ball,

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:16.166
the leaf drop, and the brick fall.

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:17.706
&gt;&gt;This is very good.

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:18.316
That's excellent.

00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:21.676
Another thing you might do
is have the brick teeter

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:24.076
at the top before it falls.

00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:27.436
See, what you do in
animation is, you set people

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:29.636
up for what they're about to see.

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.096
Then you give them what
you set them up for.

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:35.606
&gt;&gt;Since not every new animation
student can participate

00:03:35.606 --> 00:03:39.396
in live teleconferences, Acme
has adapted their mentoring model

00:03:39.396 --> 00:03:39.766
to the web.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:44.886
&gt;&gt;And the student will put their file
in here, and they do a little bit

00:03:44.886 --> 00:03:48.036
of an explanation about
what they were trying to do.

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:52.286
&gt;&gt;Now anyone anywhere in the world
can upload their work and get answers

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:53.786
to their specific questions.

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:58.096
&gt;&gt;And she wants to know, are the
poses and timing working well?

00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:01.316
And, you know, what
else should she fix?

00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:05.356
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Cardon Klein
learned animation in one

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:07.906
of Dave Master's high school classes.

00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:11.096
Now, as a professional
animator and mentor,

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:13.816
she's helping others
along the career path.

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:15.466
&gt;&gt;What do you think
about the overlap that--

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:17.446
&gt;&gt;Animation really is a craft

00:04:17.536 --> 00:04:22.516
and unless you have a
mentor student relationship,

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:26.196
you really cannot fully
learn that craft.

00:04:26.196 --> 00:04:27.766
And that's how I learned my craft.

00:04:28.016 --> 00:04:31.816
That's how all the best animators
that I know and best film makers

00:04:31.816 --> 00:04:33.036
that I know learned their craft.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:37.276
So for me to get in the position
as a mentor and be able to pass

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:40.416
on what I know to a student
is incredibly rewarding.

00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:44.386
&gt;&gt;I actually give them a
step by step kind of guide

00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:47.976
as to how they might be
able to fix their own scene.

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:50.356
&gt;&gt;In addition to written responses,

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:53.846
mentors like James Lopez can
upload their own sketches.

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:56.396
&gt;&gt;You know, animation
is such a visual medium.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:05:00.066
You can't really just type out
what you wanna convey in text.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.386
&gt;&gt;You have to do it
visually, I think.

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:07.616
So I will actually, you know,
draw it all out, you know,

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:09.106
as simple as I can do it.

00:05:09.536 --> 00:05:12.296
And, you know, it's like they say,
a picture says a thousand words.

00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:15.776
&gt;&gt;Lennie: Harry, this right
here is just a little polishing

00:05:15.776 --> 00:05:16.566
that you have to do.

00:05:17.076 --> 00:05:23.096
&gt;&gt;To get exposure to professionals
that can tell you the reason things

00:05:23.096 --> 00:05:25.096
that happen, that can
express the potentials

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:27.156
and the principles
behind things happening.

00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:29.896
If I had something like
that when I was a child,

00:05:30.766 --> 00:05:32.196
it would have meant the world to me.

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:35.726
&gt;&gt;I'm privileged to actually
have someone that's working

00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:40.216
with Walt Disney and other
companies like Warner Brothers

00:05:40.216 --> 00:05:43.456
and all those cool companies,
to actually take their time out

00:05:43.456 --> 00:05:45.626
and help us with our artwork.

00:05:45.736 --> 00:05:49.666
And it's actually helping me
in my science class as well,

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:54.276
the bone structures and different
types of bones we have to learn.

00:05:54.656 --> 00:05:56.796
&gt;&gt;Okay, so you're showing
us your character designs?

00:05:57.066 --> 00:05:57.466
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:05:57.916 --> 00:06:00.256
&gt;&gt;Now the type of character
you've got there,

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:01.686
kind of like a high school bad boy,

00:06:01.686 --> 00:06:05.446
he's going to put all his
weight on one leg, right?

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:10.406
Probably cross his arms,
cock his head to one side

00:06:10.406 --> 00:06:12.056
and give us a little
bit of an attitude.

00:06:12.486 --> 00:06:14.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Educators see
benefits of the Acme program

00:06:14.946 --> 00:06:17.116
that go beyond learning how to draw.

00:06:17.116 --> 00:06:17.976
&gt;&gt;If it looks like this, a circle--

00:06:18.226 --> 00:06:22.336
&gt;&gt;They seem to do better when
they know they're preparing work

00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:26.856
that professional people will take
a look at and give them comment on.

00:06:26.856 --> 00:06:29.136
So it's very helpful
in the classroom.

00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:33.296
Also, working toward deadline,
in their personal lives,

00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:35.486
I think that it's really
affected them,

00:06:35.486 --> 00:06:37.716
that the know the urgency
of a deadline.

00:06:38.036 --> 00:06:42.136
It's matured them in that sense,
that they know, "When I put my work

00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:43.536
out here, this represents me."

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.896
&gt;&gt;Tilt it this way a little bit.

00:06:46.256 --> 00:06:48.056
There you go.

00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:48.516
All right.

00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:52.266
&gt;&gt;I think any time a kid is
interested in something at school,

00:06:52.406 --> 00:06:55.746
there's some draw for him, that he
or she really wants to be a part of,

00:06:56.726 --> 00:06:59.186
I think they start taking a
little bit more responsibility

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:00.056
for their own action.

00:07:00.056 --> 00:07:01.696
They show a little
bit more initiative.

00:07:01.816 --> 00:07:06.206
They don't wanna miss school and
they develop their language skills,

00:07:06.276 --> 00:07:09.036
their technology skills,
even their math skills.

00:07:09.576 --> 00:07:11.256
And sure, that has
a spill over effect.

00:07:11.936 --> 00:07:14.176
&gt;&gt;We have students doing
mathematics projects.

00:07:14.176 --> 00:07:17.016
We have students doing historical
projects, literature projects.

00:07:17.546 --> 00:07:21.026
&gt;&gt;Animation is a vehicle to
get across the major ideas,

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:23.956
the big ideas of our
civilization, of our world.

00:07:24.396 --> 00:07:26.966
&gt;&gt;Okay, we'll go to Carver
High School in Alabama.

00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:29.776
&gt;&gt;We have made it possible

00:07:29.776 --> 00:07:33.756
that a professional can
spend a few minutes a week

00:07:34.106 --> 00:07:40.266
to actually mentor a kid,
somewhere, in a distance city,

00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:42.596
who had the same dream they did

00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:45.896
and who has no opportunity
without that mentorship.

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.396
And really, that's the magic
of this new technology.

00:07:52.726 --> 00:07:56.876
