00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:13.646
&gt;&gt;Douglas: We're very diverse.

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:16.846
We have all the same issues that
any high school in America has,

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:20.506
but by offering kids
options that they can see

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:24.256
that what they're learning
is relevant beyond the walls

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:26.116
of the high school, is what's key.

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:31.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In 1995, Laguna
Creek opened its first school

00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:33.606
within a school career academy.

00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:37.086
The Manufacturing Production
Technology Academy.

00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:38.906
&gt;&gt;Student: You designed that
one in Engineering class?

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:39.496
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:40.666
&gt;&gt;Student: You lucky son of a gun.

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:42.526
&gt;&gt;Dave: Today we're
launching rockets.

00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:46.776
Students have designed these rockets
on a CAD program called, RockSim,

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:49.686
and so that program allows them
to test a number of parameters.

00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:51.776
The point is to help
them learn the physics.

00:00:51.936 --> 00:00:54.436
The fun part is that they get
to design and launch a rocket.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.476
&gt;&gt;In order to determine the height,

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:59.836
we have one known angle,
so theta here.

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Today, Laguna
Creek has three academies.

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:06.646
Each academy accepts
about 70 students who move

00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:08.286
through the curriculum as a group.

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:11.256
They take project based
college prep courses

00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:15.536
that integrate core academic
subjects with technical training.

00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:16.926
&gt;&gt;Dave: We have students
in this physics class,

00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:18.226
everything from special ed.

00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:20.986
students to AP students,
and everything in between.

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:24.176
And when they've taken the
standardized tests in the past,

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:27.296
they tend to do much better
than the general population.

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.696
It seems that they
understand the material better

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:34.096
if we're not just focused on taking
lecture notes and doing calculations.

00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:37.046
So when they can experience it,
it seems to make a big difference

00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:38.276
in their level of understanding.

00:01:39.026 --> 00:01:42.446
&gt;&gt;Chris: The wind turbine uses the
fan's power to create electricity,

00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:44.676
and then when we flip the
circuit, it will power the pump.

00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:48.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Green Energy
Technology Academy, or GETA,

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:53.196
is dedicated to the burgeoning field
of alternative energy production.

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:55.246
&gt;&gt;Chris: And I get to,
like, work with my hands,

00:01:55.246 --> 00:01:59.576
and think about problems and work
through them, more than just, like,

00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:00.916
sitting at a desk and writing down.

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:03.636
It's more fun, and you get
to learn in a better way.

00:02:04.236 --> 00:02:07.096
&gt;&gt;Eric: So those things that
you've found should be able

00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:08.276
to increase the growth.

00:02:08.276 --> 00:02:10.866
&gt;&gt;In designing the curriculum,
I looked at a couple of things.

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:14.336
What were the types of renewable
energy that existed, wind and solar

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:17.236
and biofuels, and geothermal,
and hydroelectric,

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:20.816
are all types of renewable energies,
and then from there, I said, okay,

00:02:21.116 --> 00:02:24.676
of these different types, which
would allow for pretty decent hands

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:27.566
on projects, and that really guided
my development of the courses.

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:30.036
&gt;&gt;Sobe: This is our go-kart.

00:02:30.456 --> 00:02:33.636
We got a grant from
Lowes for 200 dollars

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:37.206
to get all the supplies,
the metal, the wood.

00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:40.156
We researched design,
how to make it efficient,

00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:43.586
and we spent about nine
weeks designing it,

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:45.046
planning it, and making it.

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:46.496
It's been great.

00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:50.026
You know, there's been a
lot of time and effort,

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:51.796
blood and sweat that
went into our work.

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:53.116
It's been quite an experience.

00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:57.166
&gt;&gt;Eric: Each project is
a team driven project.

00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:01.436
You know, each team has a project
manager, a technician, an auditor

00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:05.546
and a recorder, and each day, each
student is given a job they need

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:08.016
to fulfill for that
particular project.

00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:10.886
They take pictures and video
and put together a PowerPoint

00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:12.776
that chronicles their
work throughout the term.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:16.936
At the very end, they always
present to a panel of experts

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.826
that we bring in, that's
related to that field.

00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:20.916
&gt;&gt;Chris: This is a closed
loop photobioreactor

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:23.746
and it's a very good
apparatus for growing

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:26.956
about 40 gallons worth
of algae for testing.

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:30.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The academy has partnered
with several green businesses,

00:03:30.726 --> 00:03:33.106
who provide expertise
and mentorships.

00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:36.176
&gt;&gt;Chris: It's our responsibility as
industry people who are out there

00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:39.546
on the cutting edge, to be mentors
and help the students understand

00:03:39.546 --> 00:03:42.046
where the industry is going,
and give them some of the tools

00:03:42.046 --> 00:03:43.166
to help them succeed in that.

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:45.206
&gt;&gt;Reanna: How does this
help our job market?

00:03:45.296 --> 00:03:47.986
&gt;&gt;Chris: So there's a lot of jobs
that are created from the production

00:03:47.986 --> 00:03:50.966
of the material, and then
there's lots of jobs created

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:53.006
from the pipe fitting and
these kinds of things that need

00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:54.246
to be done, to put them together.

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:56.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition to
offering career options,

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.446
the green academy kept Reanna
from dropping out of school.

00:04:00.776 --> 00:04:03.016
&gt;&gt;Reanna: My mom would go to
work, and I would just stay home

00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:06.746
when she went to work, because she
would leave before I even woke up,

00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:10.416
and she wouldn't know I didn't go to
school, because she wouldn't be home

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.756
until after I got out of school.

00:04:11.806 --> 00:04:15.426
So it was just basically easy
to stay home, and I did that for

00:04:15.426 --> 00:04:18.456
about six months, and
then I started, like,

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:22.666
seeing what Mr. Johnston's projects
were about, and I started just coming

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.736
to fourth period, which
was Mr. Johnston's class,

00:04:25.736 --> 00:04:28.336
and then I started coming
to third and fourth period,

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:31.706
and then gradually started
working my way up to first period.

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:37.766
And I currently maintain a 4.0--
almost my whole junior year.

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:43.566
&gt;&gt;Douglas: When you take a look
at academy versus a general ed.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:47.876
population, you find that the
academy students, generally,

00:04:48.046 --> 00:04:54.776
are academically stronger, they test
better, the attendance is better,

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:58.826
everything has increased positively.

00:05:00.106 --> 00:05:01.456
