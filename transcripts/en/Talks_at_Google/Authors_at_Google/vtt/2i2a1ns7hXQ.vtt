[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.470
JON SKEET: Welcome
to Hadley Freeman,

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.640
author of "Life Moves Pretty
Fast" and various other things.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.377
So a very warm welcome to you.

00:00:14.377 --> 00:00:15.460
HADLEY FREEMAN: Thank you.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.376
JON SKEET: It seems we're
in a room, at least,

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:20.170
with people who haven't
read the book yet.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.640
So I wonder if you
could just start

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.607
by giving us a brief
precis of what it's about

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:25.690
and why you've written it.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.606
HADLEY FREEMAN: Right.

00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:29.290
So this book, which I wrote
about almost three years ago

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.590
now, is about '80s movies,
which I love very deeply.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.210
And it's not just
a nostalgia fest.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.970
Because, obviously, you can
turn on Channel 5 any night

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.520
and see loads of utterly
random talking heads just going

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.090
"Oh, yeah, "Mannequin"
is amazing."

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.881
"Oh, yeah, "Back to
the Future" is amazing.

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:44.386
Like, obviously
those are all true.

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:45.760
Although I might
actually quibble

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.140
with the "Mannequin"
thing there.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.850
But what I wanted
to write about is

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.830
how these movies,
from the '80s movies,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.470
these movies from the
'80s, teach us lessons

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.580
that we don't get today.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.940
And that is because actually
Hollywood was weirdly very

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.440
liberal in the
'80s and they were

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.510
able to do really interesting
things with movies

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.510
that we don't get today.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.970
So for example,
depicting abortion

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.510
on screen in a positive
light, or having a black actor

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.994
take a role that was
written for a white actor,

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:11.410
and all sorts of
things like that.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.600
Depictions of
masculinity, movies

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.560
made about and just for
women, all those things

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.560
were coming out of the
'80s, and we don't really

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.720
get those anymore.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.990
JON SKEET: OK.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.810
So that's sort of
why you wrote it.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.990
One of the things that strikes
me most when reading it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.450
is just how much fun it
seemed that you were having.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.920
HADLEY FREEMAN: So much fun.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.400
JON SKEET: Was that
genuinely real,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.400
or are you just really
skillful at writing

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.600
as if it were that much fun?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.730
HADLEY FREEMAN: Well, there was
a lot of angsting beforehand,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.220
once I had this idea, because
my publishers were really

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.850
not into it.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.450
They just thought nobody
buys books about movies,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.359
which I quibble with.

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.900
Almost all my bookshelves are
filled with books about movies.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.089
And "Hm, '80s movies,
a bit passe now.

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:50.630
Does anybody really
care about that?"

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.054
And I just knew they did.

00:01:52.054 --> 00:01:52.720
I knew they did.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.140
All my friends love '80s movies.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.330
I love '80s movies.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.100
And I very much
live by the maxim,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.940
"You should write
about what you're

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.280
interested in, not trying to
guess what other people are

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.210
interested in."

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.860
Which sometimes doesn't
always work probably readers

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.110
would say from "The Guardian."

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.110
But I believe if someone is
passionate about their subject,

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.520
that really comes through.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.470
And so I angsted a lot about
how am I going to do this?

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.150
And I thought, "How do
I sell this to people?"

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.204
And then I just thought,
"Stop worrying about it.

00:02:15.204 --> 00:02:16.870
Stop trying to convince
your publishers.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.310
Just write the book
you want to write.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.210
Write the book
you want to read."

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.370
Which is always what I
say to aspiring writers

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.350
when they ask how do
they find their voice

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.460
or what should they
be writing about.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.020
I just say, "Write
what you want to read."

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.890
and I just thought, "I'm going
to write what I want to read."

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.960
And it was so much fun.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.950
And the more I wrote
it, and the more I

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.440
spoke to friends about it,
and the more enthusiastic

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.990
I saw all my friends were
and my parents' friends were

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.490
and other, people getting
into it and saying,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.989
"Oh my god, you've got to talk
about, obviously, the 10 best

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.910
montages, and you've got to do
the 10 greatest power ballads."

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.660
Everybody had all these
list ideas for me.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.740
"And obviously
you're going to have

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.044
to include "The Lost Boys"
and the this and the that.

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:49.210
And thought, "Oh, wow,
people really are into this."

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.590
And then I suddenly got
a burst of confidence,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.380
and then it was so
much fun to write.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.120
JON SKEET: Well, I
think we can see,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.330
even if it weren't for the book,
by "Stranger Things" and "Ready

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.540
Player One" there
is so much almost

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.082
pent up nostalgia for the '80s.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.540
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah, and that
really wasn't around as much

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.190
when I was writing it.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.610
Because I was
writing it in 2014.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.359
JON SKEET: So you
created the environment.

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.600
HADLEY FREEMAN: I created it.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.844
I think I'm part of it.

00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:14.260
Which is, I don't mean like
I'm anywhere on the same level

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.324
as "Stranger Things,"
but I have this idea

00:03:16.324 --> 00:03:17.740
that there's a 30
year rule, which

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.240
is that it takes
30 years for people

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.747
to look back on a
decade with nostalgia.

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:23.830
And that's because kids
who grew up in that decade

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.140
are now adults, and they're
now making the content,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.190
and they're looking
back and going

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.240
"See, that was what was great."

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.420
And they're putting
it out there.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.878
So I'm very much
of that generation

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.400
that is putting it out there.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.430
JON SKEET: Cool.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.310
So let's dive straight
into specific films

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.796
and specific messages that
you've taken out of them.

00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:42.580
And I'm going to start with
"Ghostbusters," because I

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.664
watched it all last night.

00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:44.746
HADLEY FREEMAN: Lucky you.

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:46.480
JON SKEET: I was meant
to writing a book,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.050
and I thought, "Blow it.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.740
I'm meeting Hadley.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.930
I'm gonna watch "Ghostbusters."

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.305
HADLEY FREEMAN:
"Blow it" indeed.

00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:54.340
JON SKEET: And it's
aged pretty well.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.940
HADLEY FREEMAN: It's amazing.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.720
JON SKEET: For the most part.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.770
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.240
JON SKEET: So you bring you
know this is as almost male role

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.680
models of friendship.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.330
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.830
JON SKEET: Obviously,
as soon as you

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.663
start talking about the
'80s "Ghostbusters,"

00:04:07.663 --> 00:04:09.820
you think 2016 "Ghostbusters."

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.540
How would you compare
them in terms of,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.480
does the reboot, whatever
you want to call it,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.950
of "Ghostbusters" portray female
friendships in the same kind

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.305
of way, or is it more extreme?

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:25.900
I mean, the friendships
in original "Ghostbusters"

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.860
are reasonably extreme
and non-normal.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.799
But there's a
certain truth there.

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:31.840
HADLEY FREEMAN: There is.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.140
And also, obviously, part of
the charm of '80s "Ghostbusters"

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.870
is it was so based on their real
life friendship, particularly

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.786
Bill Murray and Dan
Aykroyd, who were friends

00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:40.910
from "Saturday Night Live."

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.160
And in fact, Dan
Aykroyd originally

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
wrote "Ghostbusters" for
him and his best friend

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.290
John Belushi, who
died in the middle.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.765
He wrote a line
in the script, he

00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:51.640
got a phone call saying
that John Belushi had

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.342
overdosed in Beverly Hills.

00:04:54.342 --> 00:04:56.050
So he was writing it
for the two of them,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.565
and you can sense
that friendship

00:04:57.565 --> 00:04:59.690
and how Ramis was a close
friend of theirs as well.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.080
And I really feel you
can have that feeling

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.670
that these guys all know
each other, love each other,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.140
and appreciate each
other's weirdness.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.380
You know, they all called
Bill Murray the Murricane.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.635
And obviously Harold Ramis
then made other movies,

00:05:09.635 --> 00:05:11.760
and Dan Aykroyd made other
movies with Bill Murray.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.760
Harold Ramis obviously
then made "Groundhog Day"

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.700
with Bill Murray.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.530
And they had a very
complicated friendship.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.571
They were all always
falling out with each other.

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:21.300
It was a very weird time to be
a very successful male comedian

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.026
in the '80s.

00:05:22.026 --> 00:05:23.400
But I feel that
all comes across,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.150
and you sense that,
despite the weirdness,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.050
they all love each other truly.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.650
And now, I had so much goodwill
towards the 2016 female

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.287
"Ghostbusters".

00:05:32.287 --> 00:05:33.870
First of all, I love
the idea of women

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.389
carrying a great franchise.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.180
I really love Paul
Feig, that he is the one

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.420
he's championing this idea.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.170
He's the one who
directed it and I believe

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.425
wrote the screenplay for it.

00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:44.571
I think Melissa McCarthy,
Kristen Wiig, all good things.

00:05:44.571 --> 00:05:47.070
And it just completely didn't
work, which was disappointing.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.660
It was a bit like watching
Hillary Clinton's presidency

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.160
bid.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.034
It was just like, you
really want it to work,

00:05:52.034 --> 00:05:54.340
and it just didn't work.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.760
And I think so many of the
things that were wrong with it

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.218
exemplify what's wrong with
movies, this kind of big movies

00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:00.409
today compared to the '80s.

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.700
I mean, for a start, it was
all filmed on a studio lot.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.400
So the whole city looks
really anonymous and generic.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.110
You don't really
get a sense of where

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.262
on earth these people are.

00:06:08.262 --> 00:06:09.720
Whereas in the '80s
"Ghostbusters",

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.326
it's very much New York City.

00:06:11.326 --> 00:06:12.950
Like, they are on
the New York streets.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.220
They're going to
Tavern on the Green,

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.930
this restaurant in
Central Park, which

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.910
is where Rick Moranis
has his freak out when

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.659
he's turned into the ghoul.

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.450
You see the taxis going
around the corners,

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.845
the piles of garbage,
Larry King on TV,

00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:25.470
and there is a
specificity about that--

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.094
obviously the New
York Public Library--

00:06:27.094 --> 00:06:28.650
that is very charming.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.390
And people then sense
that this is real.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.830
This is real.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.430
JON SKEET: I think it helps
if you've been to New York.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.220
HADLEY FREEMAN: It
definitely helps.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.880
And if you grew up
in New York as I did.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.240
But I feel you're watching
this, you're like,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.760
"OK, this is real."

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.290
I mean, I watched
"Ferris Bueller"

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.570
when I was like 8
when I first saw it.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.740
And I'd never been to Chicago.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.120
I didn't go to
Chicago until I was

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.410
an adult, which is
weird, because I only

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.220
lived in New York.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.350
But I liked that they
were on the streets.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.640
They were going to the museum.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.100
They were going to restaurants.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.710
I got a sense of Chicago.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.490
It wasn't just some
generic studio lot

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.340
that could be used for
a sitcom the next day.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.050
And there was no rough edges
to the 2016 "Ghostbusters".

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.250
I mean, Bill Murray, in the
original "Ghostbusters",

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.940
is really freaking weird.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.910
I mean, he's giving
electric shocks

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.160
to this teenage
boy when it opens.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.450
He's leching on everything.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.420
He's basically stalking
Sigourney Weaver.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.360
And the movie accepts all
that and isn't excusing it.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.510
And in fact, she's making
fun of his face to it.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.621
Whereas you don't
get that as much.

00:07:19.621 --> 00:07:21.120
It felt more try
hard what they were

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.760
trying to do with
the characters there.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.460
And I mean, first of
all, I really don't--

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.360
I think it's a mistake to try
to reboot such a beloved movie

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.260
as "Ghostbusters".

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.550
I mean even "Ghostbusters"
couldn't do it

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.883
in the '80s when they made
"Ghostbusters 2" and everyone

00:07:34.883 --> 00:07:35.760
got cross about it.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.030
So I don't really know
why you would do that.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.820
Why not just make
your own new movie?

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.290
JON SKEET: Right.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.000
Which, I guess,
at the same time,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.600
we have if we're looking
for strong women leads etc,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.740
we have "Wonder Woman."

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.900
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.490
Which although is
an old movie too.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.002
I mean that is piggybacking
on another old franchise.

00:07:53.002 --> 00:07:53.585
Which is fair.

00:07:53.585 --> 00:07:54.180
Which is true.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.440
Which is fair.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.592
But people will always
have sentimental feelings

00:07:57.592 --> 00:07:58.300
about old movies.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.780
I feel like that is the wrong
way to rehash '80s movies.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.210
The right way is to do something
like "Stranger Things,"

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.340
which kind of digests
all these '80s movies

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.100
and makes something
totally new through them,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.530
without then having people
my age and older being like

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:11.640
"Oh, it's not as good
as the original,"

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.900
because it is original.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.700
It's just doing all
these amazing homages

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.790
to "Stand by Me" and "Alien"
and all this cool stuff.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.174
JON SKEET: So that brings
me to TV in general.

00:08:20.174 --> 00:08:21.090
HADLEY FREEMAN: Mm-hm.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.460
JON SKEET: You go in
detail in the book

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.880
into the economics
of why films aren't

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.480
made in the same way, why
things like "Dirty Dancing"

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.920
just wouldn't get made now.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.510
HADLEY FREEMAN: At all.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.360
JON SKEET: But it feels to
me like interesting things

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.620
are happening on TV.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.070
HADLEY FREEMAN: Definitely.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.028
I mean, that is where
things are happening now.

00:08:40.028 --> 00:08:42.330
And I don't necessarily
think that's a bad thing.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.954
I do think you lose something
from not having that big "go

00:08:44.954 --> 00:08:45.870
to the cinema" moment.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.995
I know I sound like I'm
sitting in my rocking chair

00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:50.610
on a porch talking
about this, but you

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.660
know, I remember the week
"Batman" came out in 1989

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.640
and going to the movie
theater with my dad,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.960
and it was such a huge deal.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.210
I mean, probably you guys
all weren't even alive then,

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.610
but it was such a big
deal when this came out.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.602
This movie had been
building up all summer.

00:09:04.602 --> 00:09:06.810
You go to the cinema, there's
all these Batman logos,

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.720
insignia everywhere.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.040
And obviously at the
time, grown-ups are like,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.640
"Oh, this is disgusting.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.600
It's so commercial."

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.130
For a kid, this
is amazing, and it

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.160
felt like a really
collective experience,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.760
sitting in the cinema, watching
Tim Burton's Gotham City,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.350
seeing Jack Nicholson.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.700
It was amazing.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.870
And you don't have quite that
same feeling watching something

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.620
on TV.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.389
You just don't.

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:28.680
And it's not even about "Ooh,
the glory of the cinema."

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.430
It's more that everybody's
watching things

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.470
at different times now.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.930
And it's more of an
individual experience

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.760
rather than a
collective experience.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.770
JON SKEET: I guess I think about
when "Handmaid's Tale" was on.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.260
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.330
JON SKEET: I would
watch it without being

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.227
able to breathe barely
until the adverts

00:09:44.227 --> 00:09:45.560
and then suddenly check Twitter.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.650
HADLEY FREEMAN: Check
Twitter and see everything.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.190
JON SKEET: So there's a sort
of different collectivism.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.560
HADLEY FREEMAN: It's a
different collective experience.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.290
It is.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.050
Judd Apatow talks
very sentimentally--

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.800
I think in the book I
used the quote where

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.966
he talks about going to the
"Ghostbusters" when that

00:09:57.966 --> 00:09:59.740
opened, going to the
"Ghostbusters" movie

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.390
and standing in the
line around the block.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.015
And yes, this does
sound like we're all

00:10:03.015 --> 00:10:05.720
talking about going to drive-ins
in the 1950s or something.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.940
But there is something
to gain from that,

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.500
and there is something else to
be gained from watching things

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.180
on TV and tweeting about
it with your friends

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.280
and seeing what Armando Iannucci
is saying about something

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.446
that you just watched and
other people who you like,

00:10:15.446 --> 00:10:17.210
Sharon Horrigan or whoever.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:22.052
But I think there is something
sad about the slow death

00:10:22.052 --> 00:10:24.510
of big cinema, really, because
that is what I grew up with.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.150
JON SKEET: Yeah,
I think it will be

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.430
interesting to see what happens
to cinema in the next 10,

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.135
20 years.

00:10:30.135 --> 00:10:31.010
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.040
JON SKEET: With more
and more great stuff

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.190
going on TV, basically.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.420
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah,
which they're not even

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.860
trying to compete with,
because they're too scared

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.020
to compete with it, really.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.560
JON SKEET: And
occasionally cinemas

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.150
will show TV series
at the cinema.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.310
This is a strange,
strange situation.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:51.700
Going back to the lessons that
we should have been learning,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.850
the title is "The Lessons
We Learned" as if "Job done.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.680
We don't need to talk
about those things.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.305
We've learned."

00:10:58.305 --> 00:10:59.762
Now, I'm pretty
sure you'll agree

00:10:59.762 --> 00:11:01.220
that a lot of those
lessons haven't

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.000
been learned completely.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.810
HADLEY FREEMAN:
No, that's right.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.518
JON SKEET: Is there
any one in particular

00:11:04.518 --> 00:11:06.320
that you think we really need?

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.190
Is there one of these films
that you should say "Right,

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.760
this should be on
the curriculum.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.110
Everyone should just
get the message"?

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.927
HADLEY FREEMAN: I mean, I,
as a woman and feminist,

00:11:15.927 --> 00:11:18.260
all the rest of it, I mean,
I would say "Dirty Dancing."

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.551
Really, I do think "Dirty
Dancing" is an amazing movie.

00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:23.990
And people, particularly, not
wanting to gender stereotype

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.730
here, particularly men tend to
laugh at me when I say that.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.267
I have yet to meet a man who
has ever seen "Dirty Dancing"

00:11:29.267 --> 00:11:31.600
willingly and not been forced
by his girlfriend or wife.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.355
JON SKEET: You
absolutely have now.

00:11:33.355 --> 00:11:35.230
HADLEY FREEMAN: This is
why I come to Google.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.940
Everything is here.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.190
But it is an incredible movie.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.427
It's a movie about the
importance of legal abortion,

00:11:42.427 --> 00:11:44.510
which is what Eleanor
Bergstein, the screenwriter,

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.590
wrote it to be.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.500
She felt in the '80s that women
were taking feminism and access

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.210
to abortion for granted and that
Roe v. Wade was under threat.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.970
And so she wanted to write
a movie for teenagers that

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.500
stressed the importance of it.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.240
And so she took this
movie, set it in,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.260
I believe it's the
end of the '50s.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.400
It's the '60s, isn't it?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.070
No, it must be the '50s,
where abortion was still

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.207
illegal in America.

00:12:05.207 --> 00:12:07.790
And there's a character in the
movie who gets pregnant and has

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.350
to have an illegal
abortion and then

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.780
has to be saved
by Jennifer Gray,

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.680
a character called Baby,
Jennifer Gray's dad,

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.810
who's a doctor.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.000
And this is really just
slid into the movie.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.500
I mean, obviously when people
think of "Dirty Dancing,"

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.850
they think of Patrick
Swayze holding up

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.920
Jennifer Gray in the
lake, and the two of them

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.330
having sex, and all the cool
songs on the soundtrack.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.360
I mean, and that is what
you're supposed to see.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.670
But she buried
this subplot in it

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.730
and made it so essential to the
movie that no one could take it

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:32.270
out.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.329
And the studio made it.

00:12:33.329 --> 00:12:35.620
The producers at first didn't
have any problem with it,

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.667
and then a pimple cream
wanted to sponsor the movie,

00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:40.750
and they saw it, and they
were like, "Oh, we can't

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.060
have this abortion thing."

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.790
And Eleanor Bergstein was
like, "Oh, what a shame.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.373
Because the movie
kind of hangs on it.

00:12:45.373 --> 00:12:46.760
It can't really
work without it."

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.080
And they were like, "OK, fine."

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.030
And in the end, the
movie made so much money

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.946
that obviously it didn't
matter that it wasn't

00:12:51.946 --> 00:12:53.510
sponsored by a pimple cream.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.290
And the really sad
thing is, recently

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.620
some Hollywood producers went
back to Eleanor and said,

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.367
we'd love to remake "Dirty
Dancing," obviously.

00:13:01.367 --> 00:13:02.450
And she was like, "Great."

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.340
And they said, "But
we're going to take out

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.510
the abortion thing."

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.670
And she said, "No way."

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.555
And what she did instead was,
she rewrote it for the stage.

00:13:10.555 --> 00:13:11.930
And you guys might
have seen this

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.388
in the West End, the "Dirty
Dancing" musical which she did.

00:13:14.388 --> 00:13:17.510
And she oomphed up
the abortion subplot

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.466
and emphasized about
how the doctor really

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:21.590
could have gone to prison
for helping a woman who'd

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.600
had an illegal
abortion and was dying

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.670
on a table from
internal bleeding

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.530
and really made it very
central in the play.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.212
I mean, you can't
ignore it in the play.

00:13:30.212 --> 00:13:32.420
In a way, in the movie, you
could almost overlook it.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.710
In the play, you really can't.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.710
And that movie has made almost
a billion around the world.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.880
Which just emphasizes, how
cowardly and wrong Hollywood

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.720
movies are now.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.590
I mean, you try to think of
a movie that depicts abortion

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.090
now.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.140
OK, so the obvious
one would be "Juno."

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.890
That was made, came
out about 10 years ago

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.890
now, in which abortion
is depicted unbelievably

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:52.860
negatively.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.240
So negatively, even though
this is a schoolgirl--

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.900
I think she's like
15 in the movie--

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.050
who is not in a relationship
and needs to do something

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.990
when she's pregnant.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.570
And she goes to the
abortion clinic.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:03.650
It's dirty.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.640
It's seedy.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.580
The woman at the reception
desk is licking this lollipop

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.620
in a salacious way.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.527
And in the end,
the character Juno,

00:14:12.527 --> 00:14:14.110
who's played by Ellen
Page, of course,

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.440
is persuaded not
to have an abortion

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.815
because an abortion protester
tells her outside "You know

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:19.220
your baby has fingernails."

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.319
Now, there are a lot
of reasons a woman can

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:22.610
choose not to have an abortion.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.870
I mean, I have two
children myself,

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.730
so obviously there was
a period in my life

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.080
when I chose not to
have an abortion.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.280
I'm not saying every woman
who's pregnant should

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.250
have an abortion.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.590
But you cannot have an abortion
protester use a stupid argument

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.520
like that and on screen
show that as that's OK.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.364
That's not OK.

00:14:39.364 --> 00:14:41.030
Particularly since
the movie was written

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.670
by a self-professed feminist,
Diablo Cody, and stars

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.840
one, Ellen Page.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.240
And I find it really upsetting
that at no point in this

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.074
did they think this is
not right to do this.

00:14:50.074 --> 00:14:51.615
JON SKEET: And I
know you interviewed

00:14:51.615 --> 00:14:52.570
Ellen Page about that.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.650
Did you also
interview the writer?

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.664
HADLEY FREEMAN: Diablo.

00:14:55.664 --> 00:14:57.580
JON SKEET: Why she chose
to write it that way?

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.746
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah, I did.

00:14:58.746 --> 00:15:00.780
I did interview her,
and I said to her,

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.577
"I don't understand why you
depicted abortion so negatively

00:15:03.577 --> 00:15:04.160
in this movie.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.030
You could have just had
her say, 'Do you know what?

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.800
I actually want to have this
baby and give it to a couple

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.490
who don't have a baby.'

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:09.990
That's a perfectly
reasonable reason

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.110
not to have an abortion."

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.562
And she said to
me, "Any woman who

00:15:12.562 --> 00:15:14.520
doesn't think I'm not
doing enough for feminism

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.960
can kiss my butt."

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.460
I mean, that is not a response.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.430
That is not a response.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.190
JON SKEET: It's whataboutism.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.231
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah,
that's just not a response.

00:15:22.231 --> 00:15:23.580
That's a stupid response.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.800
And then "Knocked Up"
was the other obvious one

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.966
in which a woman gets
pregnant on a one night stand.

00:15:27.966 --> 00:15:30.360
She's 22, just got her
dream job being a TV host,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.140
and she rejects flat out
not having an abortion.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:34.990
Which is fine.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.900
Maybe a lot of
women would do that.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.060
It seems unlikely
in that circumstance

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.450
that a woman in LA who
just got her dream job

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.200
would reject having
an abortion, but fine.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.074
And the only character
who mentions it to her

00:15:45.074 --> 00:15:45.750
is her mother.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.260
And the mother is styled in the
movie as basically horrendous.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.730
And the mother
says to her, "Just

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.940
get it taken care of and one
day you'll have a real baby."

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.430
Now, obviously that's a
terrible way to put it.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.810
That's a terrible way.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.114
And nobody who is pro-choice
as I am would say it like that.

00:16:01.114 --> 00:16:02.280
Just say, "It's your choice.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.730
It doesn't matter.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.560
It's your life."

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:04.860
JON SKEET: I'll
support you either way.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.060
HADLEY FREEMAN: Do you want
to be looking after a baby?

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.740
Just say, "Do you want
to have a baby right now?

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.310
You're 22.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:09.670
You don't even know
this guy's name.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.545
Like, seriously, do you
want to have a baby?"

00:16:11.545 --> 00:16:13.110
If she goes, "Yes,
I do, actually.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.730
It feels important to
me," then you say fine.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.584
What you don't say is,
"Just get rid of it.

00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:17.250
It's disgusting.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.880
It's not a real baby anyway."

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.370
That's not the way people
talk about abortion.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.828
JON SKEET: So
between "Juno," we've

00:16:21.828 --> 00:16:27.360
got a pro-life campaigner
who's giving bad reasons.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.160
And then we have a
pro-choice person

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.340
who's giving bad reasons.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.480
It feels like we need a
more mature representation,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:33.600
basically.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.680
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah,
there's positive way.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.300
And there's only
been one movie that's

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.550
really dealt with it, which
was a small independent movie

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.175
called "Obvious
Child," which came out,

00:16:40.175 --> 00:16:43.802
I think, in 2016, starring the
very excellent Jenny Slate.

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:46.260
Which is about a girl who gets
pregnant-- well, not a girl.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:46.700
She's in her 20s.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.783
A woman who gets pregnant
after a one night stand.

00:16:48.783 --> 00:16:51.000
But the thing is,
the whole movie

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.940
is about her decision whether
or not to have an abortion.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.347
And they then show her,
the camera's over her.

00:16:56.347 --> 00:16:57.180
She's on the gurney.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.150
She sighs too, and there's
tears rolling down her face.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:04.140
And you think, sure, some women
really do feel this very strong

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.050
way about it, but for a lot
of women now, they don't.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.020
They don't.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.740
I mean, I had an
abortion when I was 24.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.160
I'm very happy to talk about it.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.680
And it was just a relief.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.079
And everybody in here
will know somebody,

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:17.579
whether they know
it or not, who has

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.109
had an abortion at this point.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:21.721
It doesn't have to be
depicted as this seismic thing

00:17:21.721 --> 00:17:22.470
in someone's life.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.804
It is just something that
happens, and you deal with it.

00:17:24.804 --> 00:17:26.553
Whereas in '80s movies,
you have something

00:17:26.553 --> 00:17:28.260
like "Fame," which
everyone forgets

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.540
had an abortion in it, in
which a girl in the school

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.550
gets pregnant and she's
white and he's black.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.599
Already you cannot imagine this
happening in a movie today.

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:37.390
And she just goes to
the clinic, it's done,

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.931
and then she goes
back to the school.

00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:41.334
"Fast Times in Ridgemont
High," 1980, I believe,

00:17:41.334 --> 00:17:43.250
Amy Heckerling, written
by 18-year-old Cameron

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.540
Crowe, a 14-year-old played
by Jennifer Jason Leigh

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.127
gets pregnant.

00:17:46.127 --> 00:17:48.210
She gets taken to the
clinic by her older brother,

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.085
played by the much loved and
much missed Judge Reinhold.

00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:52.210
He picks her up afterwards.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:52.500
They go home.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.500
She goes back to school.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.950
I mean, these are just
making abortion part

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.630
of life, which is
what it is now,

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.730
rather than making it either
a big deal or a terrible deal.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.250
JON SKEET: And do
you think that it

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:07.620
was acceptable to do that in
the '80s because society was

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.260
different, because people
weren't paying attention

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.700
to what was going
on in the films,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.372
or just because
Hollywood was bolder?

00:18:14.372 --> 00:18:16.080
HADLEY FREEMAN: Well,
two things, really.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.480
I think people weren't
paying as much attention.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.897
I think also movies
were able to be riskier.

00:18:20.897 --> 00:18:22.480
Those movies that I
mentioned, "Fame,"

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.820
"Fast Times at Ridgemont
High," "Dirty Dancing,"

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.152
were all made fairly cheaply.

00:18:25.152 --> 00:18:26.610
They were seen as
mid-range movies.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.940
So they weren't required to make
a billion dollars back right

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.460
away.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.530
Which is what movies now are.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.150
Movies are now marketed
around the world.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.380
It costs a billion dollars to
market movie around the world.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.588
So every movie that comes
out that gets a big release

00:18:37.588 --> 00:18:39.600
like that has to be
basically "Transformers"

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.520
or something that doesn't need
a lot of translation, that

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.470
isn't going to upset
people in China, which

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.154
is a massive market
now, and isn't

00:18:45.154 --> 00:18:47.070
going to upset the
Christian right in America.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.380
So things are much blander.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.220
Everything specific
is taken out.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.060
Everything real is taken out.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.120
And that's why movies
today feel very bleached.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.078
JON SKEET: And is that
just Hollywood, or is it

00:18:56.078 --> 00:18:58.207
the global film industry?

00:18:58.207 --> 00:18:59.790
HADLEY FREEMAN: It's
mainly Hollywood.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.270
It's mainly Hollywood.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.410
Because it's mainly
Hollywood movies

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.800
that get to go around the world.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.466
I mean, the French film industry
doesn't spend a billion dollars

00:19:05.466 --> 00:19:08.200
sending movies around
the world, generally.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.980
But also, Hollywood
underestimates things a lot

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:11.490
of the time.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.900
So Hollywood is now--

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.840
in the '80s, a movie
made 80% of its money

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.670
in America, 20% overseas.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.587
And now that's flipped around.

00:19:19.587 --> 00:19:21.420
And in some ways, you
could say that's good,

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.790
that Hollywood is aware that
the rest the world exists.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.130
But it does mean that they
have these weird assumptions

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.040
about what people in
China like to watch.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.089
So they'll say, "Well,
in China, they're not

00:19:31.089 --> 00:19:32.880
going to go see a movie
with a female lead,

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.780
or they're not going
to have a movie

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.950
with a woman on the poster."

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.750
There are loads of
examples online.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.990
You can look at it through a
website called Google of which

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.400
movies that had female women--

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.220
female women-- had
female actors or women

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.140
on the posters in
America and Britain

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.844
that have men on
the poster in China.

00:19:48.844 --> 00:19:50.760
They do this also with
black and white actors.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.517
So like "12 Years a
Slave," for example,

00:19:52.517 --> 00:19:54.600
had Brad Pitt on the poster
when it went overseas.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.909
I mean, there's a lot of that.

00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:58.200
But actually, if you look at
the Chinese film industry,

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.030
a lot of their movies
do have female leads.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.540
They do take much
riskier things.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.060
It's just that America
is just like, "Whoa,

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.230
we can't annoy the Chinese.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.750
We have to be really
careful with this."

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.265
JON SKEET: So is "Black
Panther" out in China

00:20:07.265 --> 00:20:08.780
yet and what are
they doing with it?

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.800
HADLEY FREEMAN: It'd be
really interesting to know

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.925
what happens with "Black
Panther," because actually

00:20:11.925 --> 00:20:14.390
the last movie that made a
lot of money overseas that

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:18.360
had an all black cast was
"Coming to America" in 1989.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.530
It would be amazing if "Black
Panther" can kind of restart

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.160
that again 30 years later.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.000
JON SKEET: So I wasn't sure
whether we should discuss this.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.850
Two white people talking about
racism is never a great look,

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:34.250
but just briefly, in the book
you talked about Spike Lee

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.530
and Eddie Murphy having
very different ways

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.182
of empowering African-Americans,
different ideologies about it

00:20:40.182 --> 00:20:40.682
almost.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.710
Whether you make films that are
about black communities or you

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:52.740
have black people in
white communities.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.435
Eddie Murphy in several films
may be the only black actor.

00:20:56.435 --> 00:20:57.750
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.300
JON SKEET: And it
struck me thinking

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.060
through that argument
how "Hamilton"

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.804
has done something interesting
to take a third position there.

00:21:04.804 --> 00:21:05.970
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah, right.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.174
Yeah.

00:21:07.174 --> 00:21:08.840
JON SKEET: Do you
think that's something

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.190
that works to compromise
on those two positions,

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.400
or is it just, would either
Spike Lee or Eddie Murphy

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.375
be happy with what's
happened there,

00:21:19.375 --> 00:21:21.500
or do you think they still
have an issue around it?

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.550
HADLEY FREEMAN: I don't
think Eddie Murphy

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.799
is that happy about anything
these days, which kind of

00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:27.170
breaks my heart, because he
really is my favorite of all

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.394
the '80s actors.

00:21:29.394 --> 00:21:32.060
But I think Spike Lee would kind
of love it, surely, "Hamilton."

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.800
I mean, I hope most of
you have seen "Hamilton."

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.820
It is amazing as you watch it.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.290
When you first see
it, you're just like,

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.970
"Whoa, Thomas Jefferson
is a black guy."

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.680
And then you literally
don't even see it

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.721
like within five seconds.

00:21:40.721 --> 00:21:42.480
It's amazing.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.860
JON SKEET: In fact, I'd
say almost goes in reverse.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.780
So in fact, I bought
this copy of the book

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.030
on my way to see
Hamilton in December.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:54.140
And then, in February, I went
to Hamilton Grange in New York

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.689
and saw various pictures of
Hamilton and Jefferson and all

00:21:56.689 --> 00:21:58.730
these people and I thought,
"Wow, they're white."

00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:59.990
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah,
they're all white.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.281
JON SKEET: It was really weird.

00:22:01.281 --> 00:22:02.365
HADLEY FREEMAN: All white.

00:22:02.365 --> 00:22:02.864
That's true.

00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:03.510
That's true.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.840
That's true.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.540
And you suddenly think back
on other plays and movies

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:05.840
you've seen.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.220
You're like, "That's so weird.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.680
Everyone was white in them.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.210
That's such a weird
casting decision."

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:14.300
Anyway, anyway, so Eddie
Murphy's whole thing was

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.910
he was going to infiltrate
the mainstream Hollywood

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.580
industry in a way that no black
actor had been able to before,

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.788
and Richard Pryor had been
too self-destructive to do

00:22:21.788 --> 00:22:24.500
so before, and then
make movies from within,

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.520
and kind of recreate
the system from within.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.130
Which he successfully,
incredibly successfully, did.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.720
And it's a testament to his
talent that he did that.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.270
Because a black actor famously
needs to be like 10 times more

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.980
talented than a white
actor to get a role,

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.840
and he was a million times
more talented than everyone,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.940
and he was the most successful
actor of the decade.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.440
Whereas Spike Lee
was all about giving

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.090
a voice to the black community
and what the black community

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.590
was going through at the
time, so making things

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.020
like "She's Gotta Have It"
and those kinds of movies.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.120
And they were absolutely
polar opposites.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.230
And Eddie Murphy, as
the decade went on,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.970
got increasingly attacked for
this by the black community,

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.680
feeling that he'd
abandoned them,

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.660
that he was making
"Beverly Hills

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.940
Cop" and "The Golden Child,"
in which he's basically

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.740
the only black guy
in it and making

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.630
movies for white audiences
and not reflecting

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.130
the black experience.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:08.930
And he became more
and more embittered

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.090
and drew grew more
and more into himself.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.710
And then he made
"Coming to America,"

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.430
which is an incredible movie
in that it has an entirely

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.280
black cast and no
white audiences

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.714
seemed to notice
that in America.

00:23:20.714 --> 00:23:22.880
And if any of you know
anything about racial history

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.220
in America, that really
is kind of a miracle.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.770
And then after that, he
started doing more of that.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.770
So like "Boomerang" he
did in the '90s, in which

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.830
he sort of launched Chris Rock.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.400
But he became
angrier and sadder.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.180
And anyone who has the kind of
success that he did so quickly,

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.800
it's going to screw
up your brain.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.860
And Spike Lee, I mean, I think
Spike Lee is just incredible.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.710
I mean, his movies
from the '80s and '90s

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:49.730
are some of my favorite.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.689
But he found himself being
painted into this tiny corner

00:23:52.689 --> 00:23:54.230
that he couldn't
really break out of.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.584
But if you look
at the early '90s,

00:23:56.584 --> 00:23:59.000
there were so many amazing
movies about African-Americans,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.624
particularly people
like John Singleton

00:24:00.624 --> 00:24:03.350
and "Boyz n the Hood,"
stuff like that, that you

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.790
don't see anymore today.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.520
And I personally believe
that it was the combination

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.530
of Eddie Murphy and
Spike Lee together

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:13.824
that helped that era of the
'90s movies of African cinema.

00:24:13.824 --> 00:24:14.490
JON SKEET: Cool.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.220
Thank you.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:21.530
Let's take away from politics
entirely for just briefly.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.570
One of the things
I love that you say

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.490
is that the "Princess
Bride," which

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.370
is one of my
favorite films ever,

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.240
works brilliantly because
it is a fairy tale,

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.760
and it's a spoof
of a fairy tale.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.450
Much like "Into the
Woods" is a spoof

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.580
of a fairy tale as a musical,
and an absolutely awesome

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.380
musical.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.140
And various films
have tried to do this.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.600
And some succeed and
some really don't.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.810
So for me, ones that
succeed, "The Frighteners"

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:55.340
is a great sort of horror
film and spoof horror film.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.540
And "Starship Troopers"
manages to work

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.171
in various different ways.

00:24:59.171 --> 00:25:01.670
I remember I was at university
when "Starship Troopers" came

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.500
out, and I was in
the fourth year

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.730
and had various friends
in the first year.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.970
And "Titanic" was out at
roughly the same place.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.470
And all of my first year friends
said "Oh, I love 'Titanic.'

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:11.129
It's so deep.

00:25:11.129 --> 00:25:11.795
No pun intended.

00:25:11.795 --> 00:25:14.190
But 'Starship Troopers' is
just mindless violence."

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.350
And all my fourth year
friends were going, "Wow,

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.960
'Starship Troopers'
is very, very cunning.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.619
'Titanic' is extremely dreary."

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:21.660
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yes, yes.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.161
That's true.

00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:23.326
JON SKEET: It worked for me.

00:25:23.326 --> 00:25:25.230
And then you've got
films like "Scary Movie"

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.410
which are very explicitly
trying to be a spoof.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.540
And again, for me,
it doesn't work.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.332
HADLEY FREEMAN: No.

00:25:31.332 --> 00:25:33.415
JON SKEET: What do you
think is the key to getting

00:25:33.415 --> 00:25:34.050
that balance?

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:35.040
HADLEY FREEMAN: I feel
that the filmmaker

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.249
has to really love the genre.

00:25:36.249 --> 00:25:38.498
I mean, another one I would
add into that that's quite

00:25:38.498 --> 00:25:39.870
like that is "Mars Attacks."

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.800
And I know people have mixed
feelings about "Mars Attacks."

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.230
I am a big Tim Burton
fan, as you might

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.354
have guessed at this point.

00:25:44.354 --> 00:25:46.020
And I feel like you
get that he really

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.580
loves that genre of that kind of
schlocky alien movie, obviously

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.640
Ed Wood, the whole thing.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.410
Like, he loves "Plan 9."

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.582
And he's sending that
up but also doing it.

00:25:55.582 --> 00:25:57.540
And with the "Princess
Bride," William Goldman,

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.370
who wrote the original book,
which I highly recommend

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:00.240
if any of you haven't read it--

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.890
It's so amazing-- obviously knew
those books from reading them

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:03.810
to his daughters at night.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:04.790
I mean, he said he
wrote "The Princess

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.050
Bride" because his daughters
loved princesses and brides,

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.633
and they loved books about them,
and he just combined the two.

00:26:09.633 --> 00:26:11.400
And he knows those
stories, and he also

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.820
knows those kinds of pretentious
academic approaches to them,

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.010
which is what he makes
fun of in the book.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.254
A little bit like "Possession"
by AS Byatt as well.

00:26:19.254 --> 00:26:21.420
They're making fun of this
kind of academic attitude

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.170
towards literature,
which is what he does.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:24.330
You have to love the genre.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:25.080
You can't hate it.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.970
And I feel like the scary
movie genre, the "Scary Movie"

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:27.890
movies--

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.290
does that make sense?--

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.200
they're just hating on it.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.610
They're just making fun of it.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:33.990
And you have to
have love for it.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.050
And I don't mean to keep
mentioning this TV show,

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:37.850
with "Stranger Things,"
you feel the love.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.310
JON SKEET: Right,
oh, absolutely.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.050
HADLEY FREEMAN:
It's not just making

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:44.040
fun of '80s hairstyles
and '80s music.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.760
Normal homages to '80s stuff
just take the silly surface.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.920
You have to have
a deeper feeling.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.170
And with "Princess Bride,"
you get the deeper feeling.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.044
It's not just like, "Oh,
princesses screaming

00:26:54.044 --> 00:26:55.730
in a tower and dragons."

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.895
No, there is deeper
emotions going on.

00:26:57.895 --> 00:26:58.770
JON SKEET: Fantastic.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.370
Yes.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.110
Back to the politics side.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.982
So I was thrilled.

00:27:03.982 --> 00:27:05.940
I started reading the
book thinking, "Hey, this

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.350
is a book about movies."

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.475
And then thought, "Hey,
it's another feminist book.

00:27:09.475 --> 00:27:10.400
Hurray!"

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.430
I just finished a bunch
of feminist books.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:14.485
Life moves pretty fast.

00:27:14.485 --> 00:27:15.026
It's another.

00:27:15.026 --> 00:27:15.872
Yay.

00:27:15.872 --> 00:27:18.106
And you have the Magnolia Test.

00:27:18.106 --> 00:27:20.730
Before I go further, do you want
to describe the Magnolia Test?

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.095
HADLEY FREEMAN: Oh my gosh.

00:27:22.095 --> 00:27:23.970
No, you describe the
Magnolia Test, actually.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.300
You'll do it better
than me if you read--

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.591
JON SKEET: Oh, it's so long
since I wrote the question,

00:27:27.591 --> 00:27:33.240
but it's about a strong
woman-led film that depicts

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.970
women doing awesome
things and tends to have--

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.450
and this is the bit that
I want to talk about--

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.780
men who are really not much.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.001
We'll say, either they're
explicitly despicable

00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:47.250
or they're just a bit useless.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.750
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yes.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.550
JON SKEET: Do you
have any good examples

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:54.025
for allies and just men who
want to be decent human beings?

00:27:54.025 --> 00:27:55.650
HADLEY FREEMAN: Oh,
for sure, for sure.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.330
JON SKEET: Of strong
women-led films

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:01.080
that depict men not
in a romantic role

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.095
but being decent human beings?

00:28:03.095 --> 00:28:04.470
HADLEY FREEMAN:
Yes, so obviously

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.740
the Magnolia Test is, as
I'm sure you've all guessed,

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.210
named for "Steel Magnolias,"
which is my favorite women's

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.171
movie of all time.

00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:11.670
And any man who's
like, "Ew, I don't

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.860
want to see a movie about lots
of old women," you're so wrong.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.150
It's one of the funniest
movies ever written.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.590
JON SKEET: It's the one of
these that I haven't seen yet.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.756
HADLEY FREEMAN: I mean,
again, like "Dirty Dancing,"

00:28:18.756 --> 00:28:21.060
no man has ever willingly
watched "Steel Magnolias."

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.910
It was written by a
man, I should add,

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.535
and it's a true story
about his sister.

00:28:24.535 --> 00:28:26.730
Anyway, that's a
whole other issue.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.460
My favorite movie that depicts
platonic male-female friendship

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.739
is "Say Anything."

00:28:30.739 --> 00:28:33.155
I'm amazed by how few people
in this country have seen it.

00:28:33.155 --> 00:28:35.890
In America, it's such
a major teen movie.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.480
It's up there with "Dirty
Dancing" or whatever,

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.410
or "Breakfast Club."

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:41.670
"Say Anything" is so great.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.212
So how many have seen it?

00:28:44.212 --> 00:28:45.420
Most of you probably haven't.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.020
Just a few?

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:46.710
Oh my god.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.090
All of you guys need to go home.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:48.690
Not just guys.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.939
Guys, girls, everyone, just
go and watch it right now.

00:28:50.939 --> 00:28:53.140
I excuse you from
work for the day.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.630
So it's about John Cusack.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.297
JON SKEET: Oh, it's
John Cusack as well?

00:28:56.297 --> 00:28:57.630
HADLEY FREEMAN: Do you not know?

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:58.350
Oh my god.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.980
Oh my god.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.290
It's John Cusack at
his most John Cusacky.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.639
It's his ultimate role.

00:29:02.639 --> 00:29:04.680
Forget about "Grosse Point
Blank" and "Grifters."

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.710
It's the ultimate Cusack role.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.290
He's like the weird kid in
high school, wears a trench

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.710
coat and stuff.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.130
And he's in love with Ione Sky,
who's the class princess, who's

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:15.930
very beautiful.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:19.830
And her father is played by John
Mahoney, the recently deceased

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.470
father of Frasier, as you all
probably better know him as,

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.030
who is wonderful in it.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.540
So it's about John Cusack
trying to get with Ione Skye.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.360
But in the background, he's
got his two best female friends

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.480
called DC and Corey, one of whom
is played by the immense Lili

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.010
Taylor, who is amazing.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.530
And you're watching this
movie, and the opening scene

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:38.280
is them talking.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.100
And the three of them obviously
have an incredibly close

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:41.730
friendship.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:42.810
They're very similar.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:43.750
They totally get each other.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.700
They get each other's music.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.070
They go shopping for guitars
together and everything.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.710
And you're watching this movie
and thinking, "Surely, he's

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.970
just going to get with
one of them in the end.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.260
He's going to forget
about this princess."

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.040
But no.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:53.790
No.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.584
They just want him to
be happy, and he just

00:29:56.584 --> 00:29:57.750
loves hanging out with them.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.150
Because as the movie shows,
his male friends at school,

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:03.030
one of whom is played
by Jeremy Piven,

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.640
are just total idiots,
played by Jeremy Piven.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.380
Let's just reiterate that.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.820
Who are just total jerks.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.360
And he gets his most fun
with his female friends.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.760
And it's a wonderful depiction
of male-female friendship.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.469
And I went to a coed
school for six form.

00:30:16.469 --> 00:30:18.510
And I was like, "Yeah,
that is what it was like."

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.170
Not all men and women who get
on then have to sleep together.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:21.390
JON SKEET: Right.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:22.290
HADLEY FREEMAN: That's
a very nice message

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:23.234
to get from a movie.

00:30:23.234 --> 00:30:24.400
JON SKEET: Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.730
And it's almost the anti-message
of "When Harry Met Sally."

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.200
HADLEY FREEMAN: I know, I know.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.958
Although, I do feel like--

00:30:30.958 --> 00:30:32.624
I mean, it's not
really, but it is true.

00:30:32.624 --> 00:30:33.915
It is the anti-message of that.

00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:36.330
But there is also the
cross-friendships there,

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.252
with Bruno Kirby
and Carrie Fisher.

00:30:38.252 --> 00:30:39.960
They are all hanging
out, and they're not

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.168
all sleeping with each other.

00:30:41.168 --> 00:30:42.822
It's not like some mass orgy.

00:30:42.822 --> 00:30:44.520
JON SKEET: And anything that
has Carrie Fisher it just

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.561
gets my vote immediately.

00:30:45.561 --> 00:30:47.440
HADLEY FREEMAN:
Exactly, exactly.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.570
Good.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.790
JON SKEET: Yeah, so sad.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.610
OK, I have no idea
what the time is,

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:55.530
but it feels like we've
been chatting away.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:56.580
HADLEY FREEMAN:
Sorry, I talk so much.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.496
JON SKEET: No, no, no.

00:30:57.496 --> 00:30:58.960
Quite the reverse.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.280
It's extremely needy for me.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.210
Other people may have questions,
and I'll just interject more.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:08.194
Yeah.

00:31:08.194 --> 00:31:10.110
AUDIENCE: First, I wanted
to answer a comment.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:14.760
You said that one day TV shows
will be shown in the cinema.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.220
They are shown in the cinema.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.190
For example, "Game of Thrones"
was shown in the cinema.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.960
JON SKEET: Right.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.890
AUDIENCE: Of course,
it must be a spectacle.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:25.350
But politics and
all that stuff--

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.360
what do you think about
forcing diversity in cinema?

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.870
What do you think about
scandal in the Academy Awards

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.490
about not enough black
actors and all that?

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.585
What do you think about it?

00:31:45.585 --> 00:31:46.980
What are your thoughts?

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.360
HADLEY FREEMAN: I mean, I
write about it quite a lot.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.776
Because until The
Guardian stopped

00:31:49.776 --> 00:31:51.610
being able to send me
to LA for the Oscars--

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.151
Very sad-- I used
to go to the Oscars

00:31:53.151 --> 00:31:54.360
every year to write about it.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.299
And of course I think
it's good for it

00:31:56.299 --> 00:31:57.340
to be drawn to attention.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.215
It's not like I think
there should be quotas,

00:31:59.215 --> 00:32:03.000
but I do feel like the Academy
should be shamed into the fact

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.710
that so few black winners
of Academy Awards.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:08.940
It is amazing.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.780
So few women directors have
been nominated or won awards.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.827
It's mortifying.

00:32:14.827 --> 00:32:16.410
And this should be
drawn to attention.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.160
And the problem is,
is that the Academy is

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.250
very largely old white men.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.840
There are many
statistics about it.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.520
And they just see themselves.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.990
They look for themselves.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.510
AUDIENCE: OK, but
what about there

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:32.442
are less black actors in work?

00:32:32.442 --> 00:32:34.650
HADLEY FREEMAN: I mean, it's
never going to be 50-50,

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.630
but there obviously
should be more.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.510
I mean, there have been
plenty of incidences

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.510
of African-American actors just
being completely overlooked.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.670
I mean, Eddie Murphy?

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.900
How has Eddie Murphy
not won an Oscar?

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.210
I mean, he clearly should have
won an Oscar at this point.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.464
AUDIENCE: What about the
same thing about DiCaprio?

00:32:52.464 --> 00:32:53.380
HADLEY FREEMAN: About?

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.265
AUDIENCE: About
DiCaprio [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:55.265 --> 00:32:57.390
HADLEY FREEMAN: Well, he
did win his Oscar, though.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.850
I mean, he got there.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.870
I mean, I'm sorry.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:04.170
I mean, I genuinely
believe Eddie Murphy is one

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.520
of the greatest actors around.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.440
I mean, he got nominated
for "Dreamgirls."

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.981
I personally would
have nominated him

00:33:08.981 --> 00:33:11.555
for "Bowfinger," which he is
incredible in, and all of you

00:33:11.555 --> 00:33:12.430
need to see that too.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:13.388
It's not an '80s movie.

00:33:13.388 --> 00:33:15.060
It's a '90s movie,
him and Steve Martin.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.810
I mean, Eddie Murphy's
performance in that

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:19.350
is just astonishing.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:22.290
And as he said, I mean, you
can Google Eddie Murphy.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.510
You can Google
"Eddie Murphy speech

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.560
at the Academy Awards."--

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.626
It's so hard not to do that--

00:33:27.626 --> 00:33:30.000
in which he talked about this
in the '80s, saying, "Well,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.224
you guys gave an award to
a black actor last year--

00:33:32.224 --> 00:33:33.390
I can't remember who it was.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.860
Maybe Denzel
Washington.-- so you

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.050
don't need to do it for
another 30 years, right?

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.630
And it's like, yeah, that
is literally how it works.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:40.790
That is literally how.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:43.050
You know, Greta Gerwig,
why is she now overlooked

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:44.430
for Best Director?

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:45.330
It's stuff like that.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.130
You just think
this is ridiculous,

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:50.640
that it's these old white male
movies that win all the time.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:56.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:34:00.080
Do you think Netflix and Amazon
getting into film production

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.300
is going to revive this kind of
'80s tradition of being a bit

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.104
edgier?

00:34:05.104 --> 00:34:06.270
HADLEY FREEMAN: No question.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:06.770
I hope so.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.870
I mean, the film festivals
are really freaked out by it,

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:09.745
as far as I can tell.

00:34:09.745 --> 00:34:12.454
A lot of them refuse to show
Netflix and Amazon Prime

00:34:12.454 --> 00:34:13.520
productions.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.880
Which is just ridiculous.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.522
You can't fight against
what is happening.

00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:18.980
I don't know how
Netflix and Amazon

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.021
Prime have so much money.

00:34:20.021 --> 00:34:22.860
Probably you guys in this
room can enlighten me on that,

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.860
but they are making
really amazing stuff now.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.540
I mean, the conversation I
hear with my friends, what

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.730
used to be like, "Are you going
to see something in the cinema

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.314
this weekend?"

00:34:29.314 --> 00:34:31.563
It's now "Have you seen that
new Netflix documentary?"

00:34:31.563 --> 00:34:33.530
I mean, that is how
people talk to each other.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.031
That's how.

00:34:34.031 --> 00:34:35.404
I've got two very
young children,

00:34:35.404 --> 00:34:36.739
so I'm at home most evenings.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:38.120
And my boyfriend
and I, all we do

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.670
now is watch stuff on
Netflix and Amazon Prime,

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.027
and stuff that they've
made, original content.

00:34:43.027 --> 00:34:45.110
We're currently watching
"The Defiant Ones," which

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.109
is amazing, which is the
documentary about Jimmy

00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.920
Iovine and Dr. Dre.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.920
JON SKEET: I should've
been keeping a list.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.800
I really should.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.370
HADLEY FREEMAN: You know, this
is the stuff we watch now.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:55.400
It's not going to the multiplex
on Friday night anymore.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.030
The world has changed.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.740
JON SKEET: But one interesting
thing, to come back to films,

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.440
I was thinking
about films that I

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.790
have found not necessarily
edgy, but have at least promoted

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:13.970
a more diverse worldview
and engaging young people

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:17.720
politically, I think, tend
to be around either superhero

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.102
or superhero-like.

00:35:19.102 --> 00:35:20.810
Even if you didn't
like "Ghostbusters,"--

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:21.150
HADLEY FREEMAN: No, it's true.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.300
No, it's true.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:21.800
It's true.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.466
JON SKEET: The remake
of "Ghostbusters,"

00:35:23.466 --> 00:35:25.290
you can think it's
kind of superhero-ish.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.000
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah, Yeah.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.155
Absolutely.

00:35:26.155 --> 00:35:26.780
No question.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.164
JON SKEET: And by the time we've
got "Wonder Woman" and "Black

00:35:30.164 --> 00:35:33.860
Panther" and at the same
time, young people certainly

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.690
in America and I
think over in the UK

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:39.070
as well to a slightly
lesser extent, appear

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.310
to be more politically aware.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:41.690
HADLEY FREEMAN:
Yes, no question.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.754
JON SKEET: Is there a
correlation, causation?

00:35:43.754 --> 00:35:45.170
HADLEY FREEMAN: I
mean, it may be.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:46.550
I mean, it's certainly
true that superhero movies

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.740
have been good at
smuggling in good roles

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.054
for women and ethnic minorities.

00:35:51.054 --> 00:35:52.220
They have been good at that.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.590
In "Ghostbusters," one
of the specific things

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:57.987
was to improve the
representation of--

00:35:57.987 --> 00:35:59.570
this is a terrible
way of putting it--

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:00.800
the black Ghostbuster.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.758
I mean, one of the big
faults with the original

00:36:02.758 --> 00:36:05.230
"Ghostbusters" is how Ernie
Hudson is so sidelined in it,

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.110
like for no reason.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:08.440
Either have a minute or don't.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.050
And oh, god, Leslie, what
is her name who plays her

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.610
in the new "Ghostbusters"?

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:14.810
My mind's just gone blank.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.160
Can someone google it for me?

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.070
Anyway, she has a
real role in it,

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:23.120
and she's in it the whole
movie, and she's not pushed out.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.090
And that is great.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:24.860
That was great.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.580
And definitely young people--

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.830
I don't know if it's
because of superhero movies

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.030
that young people
are more in line.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.946
I think young people
always need to go further

00:36:30.946 --> 00:36:32.150
than the generation before.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.640
And young people are going
further in this than we did.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.380
JON SKEET: Right.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.880
And another thing
I find interesting

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.320
about superhero films,
you talked about "Batman,"

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.465
even though it was dark in a
way, it had huge light moments.

00:36:45.465 --> 00:36:46.340
HADLEY FREEMAN: What?

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.427
Tim Burton or?

00:36:47.427 --> 00:36:48.510
JON SKEET: The Tim Burton.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.980
HADLEY FREEMAN:
The Tim Burton one.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:49.940
Yeah.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.841
JON SKEET: So big Gothic
feeling, but still hugely funny

00:36:53.841 --> 00:36:54.340
bits.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.430
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.120
JON SKEET: And when you
wrote the book was before--

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.320
I think before "Deadpool."

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.160
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yes, it was.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.690
JON SKEET: Definitely
before "Thor Ragnarok."

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:03.860
HADLEY FREEMAN:
Yeah, that's right.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:04.880
JON SKEET: Do you
feel that things

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.080
are taking an upswing there?

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:06.860
HADLEY FREEMAN: I think so.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.460
And it's weird.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.834
I've seen actors
like Chris Pratt

00:37:08.834 --> 00:37:10.800
or whoever get more in
these kind of roles.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.510
And they are funny rather
than tortured Christian Bale

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.760
and tortured Tom Hardy
with the mask on his face.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.802
I mean, I honestly--

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:20.010
do you guys all like those
movies, the modern Batman?

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:22.200
JON SKEET: I loved them,
but I didn't laugh at them.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.220
Whereas we recently rewatched
"Ragnarok" and it's hilarious.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:25.970
HADLEY FREEMAN: It's very funny.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:26.660
It's very funny.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.380
No, it's true.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:32.540
I mean, I loved the modern
Christian Bale Batman

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.440
with the Joker.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.370
I mean, that is a
great role, obviously,

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:36.890
with Heath Ledger as the Joker.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.930
But it's not a fun watch.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.240
I mean, it's quite heavy
weather, really, watching it.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.510
And everything is so dark.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.120
I mean, not just like mood.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.550
I mean, the lighting, you
can't fricking see anything.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:50.420
Whereas you watch Tim Burton,
I mean, it's so much fun.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.330
And watching Jack Nicholson
do his little dance

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.310
down the steps
towards Kim Basinger,

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:59.260
he's playing Prince on
his boom box, so much fun.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.950
And it looks like a cartoon.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.890
It doesn't look like it's
taking itself so damn seriously.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.870
And it doesn't have
the constant car

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.660
chases like you have with
the Christian Bale ones.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.070
And the Christian
Bale Batmans, I

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.000
don't mean to keep
knocking them.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.500
Obviously, they're
beautiful and they're

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.541
done in this amazing way.

00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:15.840
Christopher Nolan is obviously
an incredible filmmaker.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.290
But there is just too much.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:18.506
There's just too much.

00:38:18.506 --> 00:38:20.630
I feel there's too many
characters, too many people

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.030
being tortured,
emotionally tortured.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.320
You know you have Gary Oldman.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.160
You have Christian Bale.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.240
You have whoever the villain is.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.240
You have this and that.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.110
JON SKEET: And it
became more so, I think.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:29.510
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.160
JON SKEET: So by the time you
get to "Dark Knight Rises"--

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.250
HADLEY FREEMAN: Oh my god.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.250
JON SKEET: It's really all
on for a very long time.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.890
HADLEY FREEMAN: It's so long.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.598
And like Avengers,
there's just too much.

00:38:36.598 --> 00:38:38.660
They pack in so much
in these movies.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.810
Whereas I feel like with
Tim Burton's "Batman,"

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.330
you have just nice, clean
Michael Keaton a bit unhappy

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.990
in a castle, some
villain, the end.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.240
JON SKEET: There is the angst.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.614
HADLEY FREEMAN:
Yeah, oh, there's

00:38:48.614 --> 00:38:52.380
angst, but angst in a quite
interesting self-mocking way.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.350
Like he knows he's
this pathetic rich boy.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:57.170
Like, feel sorry
for me rich boy.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:00.000
Whereas Christian Bale
is just miserable.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.680
"This is a great night out."

00:39:04.082 --> 00:39:05.790
JON SKEET: Do we have
any other questions

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.021
so I can be slightly
less self-indulgent?

00:39:11.037 --> 00:39:13.120
AUDIENCE: I used to work
in children's publishing,

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.090
and I went once to a
marvelous showcase,

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:18.230
and I was really excited,
because I'm a big Marvel fan.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:21.240
And I remember being incredibly
disappointed because they

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.010
had this huge cinema
screen, and they were

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:24.540
showing all their new films.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.570
And then it came up in massive
letters "Everything we do

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.950
is to--" and I was just
really excited for it--

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.720
And it said "To
sell more product."

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.970
And I remember just thinking--

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.070
HADLEY FREEMAN: Whoa, yay!

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.750
AUDIENCE: --Is that what's
happening to cinema today

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.500
that they want to basically
make everything PG-12 so they

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.570
can appeal to as many
people as possible?

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:42.910
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.993
AUDIENCE: And that's why
I think films like Batman

00:39:44.993 --> 00:39:46.805
don't work anymore,
because they're darker

00:39:46.805 --> 00:39:48.180
and they're older,
and everything

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.722
feels a little bit safer, and
we don't have many 18s anymore.

00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:52.513
I remember when I used
to go to the cinema,

00:39:52.513 --> 00:39:54.470
I used to sneak into
18s all the time.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.340
And it's now like
there's no 18s.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.520
Everything's really
dry, and everything

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.100
is trying to sell more
product and merchandise,

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.070
and I wondered if
you shared that.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:03.370
HADLEY FREEMAN: I
mean, definitely

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.078
everything is trying
to sell merchandise,

00:40:05.078 --> 00:40:07.140
but you have to blame
'80s movies for that.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.090
I mean, it was the '80s movies
that really got onto that.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.590
Obviously, "Star
Wars" in the '70s

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.930
and then "Batman" in the
'80s and "Ghostbusters".

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.170
But I don't feel like they
were just made for that.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:17.970
They weren't seen as
vehicles for that.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.520
It was the merchandise came off
the greatness of the movies.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.019
And actually, the merchandise
just kind of took those movies

00:40:23.019 --> 00:40:24.510
by surprise, I feel.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:28.260
Whereas now the movie is
almost a sideshow to everything

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.310
around it.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:31.990
There's just not as much effort
put into scripts anymore,

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.185
is, for me, the real
problem between movies

00:40:34.185 --> 00:40:35.730
today and movies in the '80s.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.760
And that's because so
much of a movie's takings

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.620
comes from overseas,
that they don't

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.870
want to have movies that
have complicated scripts that

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:46.200
need a lot of translation, where
things have cultural references

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.610
that won't translate overseas.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:51.060
Which is why movies now, like,
for example the Christopher

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.960
Nolan Batmans are so full
of car chases and shootouts

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.100
and special effects.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.308
Because obviously, you don't
need to translate those.

00:40:58.308 --> 00:41:00.890
I mean, whereas you have
something like going back

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.870
to Tim Burton's Batmans, there's
a lot of dialogue going on

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.450
in those movies, whether
it's in the newspaper office

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.450
or whether it's
Bruce talking, having

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.450
the long conversations with his
butler and these weird parties

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:13.050
that he had.

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.720
There's emotional stuff
that needs translating.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.940
And it's just too
much of a faff.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.560
And like, why bother?

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.776
Big CGI effects
work well anywhere.

00:41:22.776 --> 00:41:24.900
Although I personally find
them incredibly tedious.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.775
One of the things I love
about "Ghostbusters"

00:41:26.775 --> 00:41:28.770
is how charming the
special effects are.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.840
They're so shonky.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.390
And now when I see special
effects in a movie--

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.562
I went to see the
modern "Jungle Book,"

00:41:35.562 --> 00:41:37.020
I'm watching the
actors thinking "I

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.690
know you're just standing
against a blue screen."

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.100
That's all that's
happening here.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.650
You feel no real connection
between what's going on,

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:47.254
the actor and the special
effects, I don't think.

00:41:47.254 --> 00:41:49.170
And I think that's
something that's been lost,

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.670
but that's what
translates overseas.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.260
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.390
Do you also have lessons
that we shouldn't

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.640
have learned from '80s movies?

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.390
HADLEY FREEMAN: Oh my
goodness, of course.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.085
So obviously '80s
movies, for all

00:42:03.085 --> 00:42:05.190
I'm talking about
Eddie Murphy, etc, etc,

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.322
were completely, totally racist.

00:42:07.322 --> 00:42:09.280
Which is why it's amazing
that Eddie Murphy was

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.250
such a success, which is another
reason why everyone should just

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.890
worship his talent.

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:15.659
If you look at--

00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:17.950
I mean, let's see, what's
the worst '80s racist movies?

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:18.910
I mean, where to even begin?

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:20.650
Obviously, there's
"Sixteen Candles,"

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.652
which is John Hughes' first
film with Molly Ringwald, who's

00:42:23.652 --> 00:42:26.110
upset because her parents have
forgotten her 16th birthday.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.165
What an innocent sweet
movie, you might think.

00:42:28.165 --> 00:42:31.210
Ah, but let me tell you about
their random Asian exchange

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:34.780
student called Long Duk
Dong, who just once had

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.420
sex with a white girl and does
things like fall out of trees

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.250
at inopportune moments.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.380
There's also this
unbelievably weird bit

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.043
in "Sixteen Candles,"
where the boy who

00:42:45.043 --> 00:42:48.310
Molly Ringwald's in
love with is talking

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:51.110
about how his girlfriend
has passed out at a party,

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.110
and he could have, quote,
unquote, "Had her five

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:55.930
times without her noticing,"
and then tells the school

00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:00.039
nurse, who is played by
Anthony Michael Hall,

00:43:00.039 --> 00:43:02.580
"Why don't you just go out in
the car and have sex with her?"

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.490
He doesn't say in those words.

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:05.050
He goes, "why don't
you go upstairs?"

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:06.220
And he does.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.950
And then the girl wakes
up next to this dorky guy.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:10.524
And she's like,
"Did we have sex?"

00:43:10.524 --> 00:43:11.440
And he goes, "Uh-huh."

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.480
And she's like, "Oh, hi."

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.820
It's the most weird
thing in the world.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.870
And '80s movies are full
of that kind of stuff.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.430
I mean, those kind
of movies don't get--

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:21.640
they haven't lasted so well.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.260
Things like "Porky's."

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.540
"Risky Business" is something
that everyone remembers

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.880
very fondly as this movie
in which Tom Cruise danced

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.762
in his underpants.

00:43:28.762 --> 00:43:30.220
But actually, if
you watch it, it's

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:35.059
a movie about how a boy
becomes a pimp, becomes a pimp

00:43:35.059 --> 00:43:36.850
and then gets into
Princeton because of it.

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.190
Because a Princeton
guy comes to his house

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:42.675
to meet Tom Cruise, who is
now fully a pimp, and probably

00:43:42.675 --> 00:43:44.800
sleeps with the hookers
that he keeps in his house,

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.210
and then gets him
into Princeton.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.418
It's the weirdest movie
you'll ever see in your life,

00:43:48.418 --> 00:43:49.929
I swear to God.

00:43:49.929 --> 00:43:51.220
So there's all that, obviously.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.500
And also racism
against black people

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.096
is so obvious in '80s movies.

00:43:55.096 --> 00:43:56.470
I mean, Eddie
Murphy's first film

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.410
was "48 Hours," in which
he's opposite Nick Nolte.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:02.080
And Eddie Murphy
plays this con who's

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.150
let out of prison to
help grizzled cop Nick

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:07.370
Nolte find a criminal ring,
if I remember this correctly.

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.964
It was actually it
was actually supposed

00:44:07.964 --> 00:44:10.297
to be Richard Pryor who was
supposed to be in the movie,

00:44:10.297 --> 00:44:11.815
but he was too
much of a disaster,

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:13.480
so they cast Eddie instead.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.890
Now, Nick Nolte is playing
the traditional grizzled cop.

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:20.080
A bit alcoholic,
has woman problems.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.360
And as part of his
charming grizzledness,

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.130
he is incredibly racist.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:28.480
And he calls Eddie Murphy
things like watermelon, a spear

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.380
chucker.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.930
Unbelievably racist terms.

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.850
And at no point is this
seen as like, "Oh, maybe we

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:35.200
shouldn't like this guy."

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.630
It's seen as part of
his charming, unreformed

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:38.890
grizzledness.

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:42.530
And Eddie Murphy was asked about
this in a couple of interviews.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:44.770
"Was this not a bit weird
for you to be doing?"

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:48.040
And he's like, "Well, you
know, because my character is

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.177
equal with him it makes it OK."

00:44:50.177 --> 00:44:51.760
And you're like,
"No, what makes it OK

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.000
is that Eddie Murphy is such
a charismatic actor that he

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.420
doesn't feel totally
subjugated by it."

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.360
He out-acts Nick Nolte
and steals all the scenes.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.940
But when you watch it, you're
like, "This is disgusting.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.440
And why am I supposed
to be cheering

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.540
on this grizzled,
old, racist cop who's

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.640
being totally racist?"

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.190
So there's obviously
tons of that.

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:15.457
And also when you look at
Eddie Murphy's movies, I mean,

00:45:15.457 --> 00:45:17.040
I'm sorry to be going
on about Murphy.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.360
It does happen.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.689
He was not allowed to do
very much within, really.

00:45:22.689 --> 00:45:24.230
I mean, even when
he was making them.

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:26.302
So you look at "Beverly
Hills Cop," for example,

00:45:26.302 --> 00:45:28.510
which was a movie that was
written for a white actor.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:31.827
Incredibly, it was supposed to
be Mickey Rourke who was in it.

00:45:31.827 --> 00:45:33.910
And then it was supposed
to be Sylvester Stallone.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:34.870
Ugh.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:39.020
And then to Don Simpson
and Jerry Bruckheimer

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.155
has enormous credit,
who are producers,

00:45:41.155 --> 00:45:43.280
they did something that
had never been done before,

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.190
which is they decided
to cast a black actor

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:48.022
in a white character's
role, and they cast Eddie.

00:45:48.022 --> 00:45:49.480
Yet when you're
watching this, it's

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.145
very notable that
Eddie Murphy's not

00:45:51.145 --> 00:45:53.500
allowed to have sex, really,
at any point in this movie.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.660
He has this white female
friend in Beverly Hills

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.002
who works in the art gallery.

00:45:57.002 --> 00:45:58.960
I'm sure all you have
seen "Beverly Hills Cop."

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.180
You know the girl who
works in the art gallery.

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.250
She's got that assistant with
the funny accent, Bronson

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:05.290
Pinchot.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:07.862
And there are lots of scenes
where this girl's sprawling

00:46:07.862 --> 00:46:09.070
on his bed in the hotel room.

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.530
They're hanging
out in hotel rooms.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:11.800
They're old friends.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.650
And clearly, in the
original script,

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:17.049
they were getting
it on, but no way

00:46:17.049 --> 00:46:18.340
is this happening in the movie.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.131
No way do you see Eddie
Murphy ever kissing

00:46:20.131 --> 00:46:22.390
a white woman in these movies.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:25.720
So you can how the restrictions
that were on black actors,

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.221
definitely.

00:46:26.221 --> 00:46:28.595
And this is Eddie Murphy, who
was the most powerful actor

00:46:28.595 --> 00:46:29.260
in the '80s.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.430
So stuff like that.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:32.680
And of course the Ernie
Hudson thing in "Ghostbusters"

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.370
is totally weird
and unacceptable.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:36.460
And I say that as someone who
loves "Ghostbusters" almost

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:37.376
more than life itself.

00:46:37.376 --> 00:46:39.850
JON SKEET: Yeah, I remember
watching various films

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:41.780
with my kids.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.835
So we have kids who
are 14, 11, and 11.

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:46.210
It's like, "This
is a great film.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:46.830
Ignore that bit."

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:47.700
HADLEY FREEMAN:
Ignore that bit, yeah.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.390
JON SKEET: Just ignore how
they're treating women.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.660
That's not how you treat women.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:52.180
HADLEY FREEMAN: Ignore that
really unfortunate bit.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.425
JON SKEET: But apart
from that, it's lovely.

00:46:53.425 --> 00:46:53.750
HADLEY FREEMAN: It's funny.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:55.670
John Hughes made
quite a few weirdly

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.520
racist movies in his
kind of slapstick thing.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:03.500
Because he came from a
real slapstick tradition.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.260
So his movies, like the National
Lampoon's Vacation movies,

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.324
which he wrote, are
so bizarrely racist.

00:47:09.324 --> 00:47:11.740
So there's this one scene, I
think it is in the first one,

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.660
"National Lampoon's
Vacation," Chevy Chase

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:18.260
is driving his kids
through the inner city.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.550
He lives in the suburbs.

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:21.674
So he gets to the inner
city, which obviously means

00:47:21.674 --> 00:47:23.120
a street full of black people.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.089
And their car stops at a
light, I think, at this point,

00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:28.130
and loads of black people
just swarm in and start

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:29.750
stealing their hubcaps.

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:32.760
And in all of Hughes' movies--

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.710
I love Hughes.

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:36.370
Ferris Bueller is literally my
favorite movie of all time--

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:37.880
the representation
of black people

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.620
makes you just want to
throw up on your shoes.

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.162
"Weird Science,"
for example, I don't

00:47:42.162 --> 00:47:44.411
know how many of you have
seen "Weird Science," that's

00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:46.190
also a terrible movie
in lots of ways.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:47.930
I mean, that's the
only other time

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:49.360
you see black people
in a John Hughes movie.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.776
I'm trying to think
of any others.

00:47:50.776 --> 00:47:53.660
And it's when Anthony Michael
Hall goes to a jazz club,

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.480
and there are loads
of jazz black people,

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.700
all being kind of
creepy and jazz.

00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.420
And that's it.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.375
So in John Hughes'
world, black people

00:48:01.375 --> 00:48:04.490
are either stealing your hubcaps
or basically smoking reefer

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.780
and being a bit creepy.

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:11.054
So yeah, lots of bad stuff
but also lots of good stuff.

00:48:13.715 --> 00:48:15.340
AUDIENCE: So I'll
ask another question.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.430
[INAUDIBLE] You
mentioned you have

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:17.360
a couple of young children.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.610
Have you given much thought
to what their introduction

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:20.735
to '80s movies is gonna be?

00:48:20.735 --> 00:48:22.360
HADLEY FREEMAN: It's
all I think about.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.230
It's really tragic.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:26.630
So I have two-year-old twins.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:29.120
So they don't really have
attention span for anything

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.790
beyond a two minute "Peppa
Pig" video at the moment.

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:34.142
So they're twin boys as
well, which is obviously

00:48:34.142 --> 00:48:36.350
slightly different for me,
although I very much think

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:37.650
that boys and girls should
just watch the same movies.

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:38.690
There shouldn't be
these kinds of limits.

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:40.310
But I do get that
certain things grab

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:43.160
boys' attention quicker than
maybe grab girls' attention.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.010
So for example, my first movie
from that era that I saw was,

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:48.290
I believe, "Ferris
Bueller's Day Off."

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:50.653
Whereas I already know,
from my boyfriend's stuff,

00:48:50.653 --> 00:48:52.486
the first '80s movie
they'll probably go see

00:48:52.486 --> 00:48:55.340
is going to be "Back to the
Future' or "Indiana Jones."

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.537
Those kind of more
actiony things.

00:48:57.537 --> 00:48:59.870
Whereas I got to those a
little bit later, and obviously

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:00.260
I loved them.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:00.900
There was no difference.

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:01.940
There shouldn't be a
difference between what

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:02.820
boys and girls watch.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:03.820
Let me just stress that.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.954
But I do think they'll probably
enjoy "Back to the Future"

00:49:06.954 --> 00:49:08.870
earlier than they might
enjoy "Ferris Bueller"

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:09.860
and "The Breakfast Club."

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.360
JON SKEET: It's an important
question about introducing kids

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.940
to films, "Star Wars."

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.980
Do you start with Episode 4 or
do you start with Episode 1?

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.063
HADLEY FREEMAN: I get so
confused with the episode

00:49:19.063 --> 00:49:20.490
numbers at this point.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.370
You've got to start
with Episode 4, right?

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.505
JON SKEET: Thank you.

00:49:22.505 --> 00:49:22.550
You can stay.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:23.930
HADLEY FREEMAN: I mean,
actually my first Star Wars

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:24.971
was "Return of the Jedi."

00:49:24.971 --> 00:49:27.614
I think that might have been the
first movie I saw in a cinema.

00:49:27.614 --> 00:49:28.780
It was "Return of the Jedi."

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.485
JON SKEET: Jinx.

00:49:29.485 --> 00:49:30.610
HADLEY FREEMAN: Oh, really?

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:31.370
JON SKEET: Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.482
HADLEY FREEMAN: Funny.

00:49:31.482 --> 00:49:33.662
And I loved it, because I
love the ewoks, obviously.

00:49:33.662 --> 00:49:34.870
So I was well down with that.

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:37.300
JON SKEET: And they changed the
ewok music for the rerelease.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:37.740
HADLEY FREEMAN: I know.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:38.750
JON SKEET: It was
just horrendous.

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.833
HADLEY FREEMAN: It's very
weird when they do that.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.107
I make lists all the
time about '80s movies.

00:49:45.107 --> 00:49:46.940
I've already got a
stockpile of DVDs of what

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.010
the kids are going to watch.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:53.120
So yes, "Back to the Future,"
"Indiana Jones," very much so.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.830
"Ferris Bueller,"
which I believe they

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:56.960
will truly love at some point.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.000
And so on and so
forth like that.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.285
"ET," Obviously "ET" might
be the first one even.

00:50:02.285 --> 00:50:04.910
JON SKEET: Do you know, I think
my kids got a bit bored by "ET"

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:06.950
but loved "Ferris Bueller,"
loved "Back to the Future."

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:08.330
HADLEY FREEMAN: Do you
know, I was scared by "ET"

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:08.750
when I saw it.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:10.010
I think I saw it when
I was about seven,

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:11.810
and I just thought
he was disgusting.

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:16.032
And I was like, "Why is this
weird kind of tree trunk living

00:50:16.032 --> 00:50:17.240
in this little girl's closet?

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.510
It's horrible."

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:21.010
JON SKEET: But watch
Drew Barrymore.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:23.470
HADLEY FREEMAN: I know, I know.

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:24.280
JON SKEET: Can we talk about
"Ferris Bueller" a bit more?

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.270
HADLEY FREEMAN: Please!

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:29.690
JON SKEET: So you talk about how
it's an interesting depiction.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:31.400
For one thing, I
love your take on it

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.830
as a sort of fantasy, which
suddenly explains things,

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:37.160
and it's one of those "Yeah,
why didn't I think of that?"

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.937
But it talks a lot about class.

00:50:38.937 --> 00:50:39.770
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yes.

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.920
JON SKEET: And I find the
whole class and wealth

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.632
divides in films
interesting, particularly

00:50:45.632 --> 00:50:47.840
because it seems to be an
international difference as

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.770
well.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:51.750
And I see it almost more
in soap operas, actually.

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:53.745
So in the US, there's
"Dallas" and "Dynasty."

00:50:53.745 --> 00:50:54.440
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah, right.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.330
JON SKEET: In Australia, they're
sort of middle class, "Home

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.460
and Away" and "Neighbors."

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.793
HADLEY FREEMAN: I mean, one
of them, in "Home and Away,"

00:50:59.793 --> 00:51:02.044
I remember when I moved here,
they ran a trailer park.

00:51:02.044 --> 00:51:04.460
I can't remember what their
names were in "Home and Away,"

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.692
but they're literally
over here "Eastenders."

00:51:06.692 --> 00:51:08.150
I couldn't believe
the differences.

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:10.560
JON SKEET: There's now middle
class, upper middle class

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.230
in Australia.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.810
And then we have "Eastenders"
and "Coronation Street."

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:19.150
And if you look at a lot of
the UK film industry output,

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:21.020
things like "Brassed
Off," "Billy Elliot,"

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:25.250
tends to be more working class
and will focus on the class

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.940
divide more.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:26.300
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.758
JON SKEET: So I
find it interesting

00:51:27.758 --> 00:51:30.470
how "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"
focuses is on the class divide

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.510
but between upper middle class
and really, really, rich.

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:36.500
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yeah, for sure.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.650
JON SKEET: And that
feels like wealth

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:42.230
as a proxy for
structure versus agency.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:43.070
HADLEY FREEMAN: Yes.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:46.370
JON SKEET: Which
I only found out,

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:48.590
learned about as terms
reading "Girls Will Be

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:49.797
Girls" by Emer O'Toole.

00:51:49.797 --> 00:51:50.880
HADLEY FREEMAN: Very good.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.254
JON SKEET: Awesome,
awesome book.

00:51:52.254 --> 00:51:54.250
Go read.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:56.500
What films should I
have watched to talk

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.294
about structure versus agency?

00:51:58.294 --> 00:52:00.460
HADLEY FREEMAN: I mean, to
me, the most obvious film

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.460
about class is actually a
slightly earlier John Hughes

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.500
film, which is "Pretty
in Pink," which

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:09.760
is very much about working
class kids versus the rich kids.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.620
John Hughes himself
was lower middle class,

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:13.480
and he grew up in an upper
middle class neighborhood

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.690
in the suburbs of Illinois.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:16.690
So he was always very
self-conscious about class

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:17.590
differences.

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.500
And in his movie, the rich
kids are always kind of evil,

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.846
and the poor kids are noble.

00:52:22.846 --> 00:52:24.220
But the rich kids
get everything,

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.770
and the poor kids
have to struggle.

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:28.300
And when he made
"Ferris Bueller,"

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.070
he kind of recreated that.

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:32.200
So "Pretty in Pink,"
there's a character,

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.085
Duckie, played by Jon Cryer,
who is very working class,

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:36.960
sleeps on apparently a
mattress on the floor,

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:40.060
and seems to not
have any parents.

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.280
And he is up against
the horrible rich kids

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.470
in school, played
by James Spader,

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:47.720
ultimate crush, who is
this kind of awful drugs,

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.740
taking obnoxious guy called
"Steff" for some reason.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.500
All characters in John Hughes
movies have really weird names.

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.730
One day, I want to
do a dissertion.

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:56.938
I want to go back to school
and do a PhD dissertation

00:52:56.938 --> 00:52:59.580
on the names of kids
in John Hughes' movies.

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:00.970
Anyway, so there's Steff.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:05.620
So anyway, Duckie is unpopular
because basically he's poor.

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.246
That's what "Pretty
in Pink" is saying.

00:53:07.246 --> 00:53:09.328
And the same for Molly
Ringwald's character, Andy.

00:53:09.328 --> 00:53:10.855
She's unpopular
because she's poor.

00:53:10.855 --> 00:53:12.730
I mean, she literally
lives on the wrong side

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:13.563
of the train tracks.

00:53:13.563 --> 00:53:16.000
They have her living next
to a train, for god's sake.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.070
So when he came to
write "Ferris Bueller,"

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:21.170
he rewrote Duckie
but as a fantasy.

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.930
And he got Matthew Broderick to
play the character of Ferris.

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:26.670
And Matthew Broderick and
Jon Cryer as teenagers

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.420
look basically identical.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.270
JON SKEET: Particularly
in the parade scene.

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:31.270
HADLEY FREEMAN: Exactly.

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:35.140
I mean, with the coif,
he's basically Duckie.

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.050
But he made Ferris Bueller
upper middle class,

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:39.250
and lives in this big house.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:40.750
And he made him
exactly like Duckie.

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.550
He likes weird British bands.

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:44.710
He wears weird two-tone shoes.

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:45.910
He knows about tech.

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:48.670
He's quite annoying,
but everyone loves him.

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:50.115
JON SKEET: Those aren't related,
by the way, knowing about tech

00:53:50.115 --> 00:53:50.906
and being annoying.

00:53:53.945 --> 00:53:55.570
HADLEY FREEMAN: Read
the room, Freeman!

00:53:59.475 --> 00:54:00.850
But they make him
really popular,

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:02.560
and everyone in
the town loves him.

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.854
And so it's kind of Duckie/John
Hughes' fantasy of what

00:54:05.854 --> 00:54:07.270
he could have been
like, what life

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:08.895
could have been like
if he'd been rich.

00:54:08.895 --> 00:54:10.894
And he could have skipped
school and gotten away

00:54:10.894 --> 00:54:11.730
with everything.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:13.188
If he stayed home
from school sick,

00:54:13.188 --> 00:54:15.672
there'd be banners in the
sky saying "Get well soon."

00:54:15.672 --> 00:54:16.630
All that kind of stuff.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:19.330
It's a real teenager's
fantasy of popularity.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:23.019
And for John Hughes, popularity
and wealth were synonymous.

00:54:23.019 --> 00:54:25.060
I think it is interesting
when British people see

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.580
American movies that show
social class divides,

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.404
because British
poverty and America

00:54:29.404 --> 00:54:31.445
in poverty in a lot of
ways are really different.

00:54:31.445 --> 00:54:34.776
A really interesting
illustration of that for me

00:54:34.776 --> 00:54:36.400
was when I went to
see "Blue Valentine"

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.090
a few years ago in this
country with some friends.

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:41.650
And "Blue Valentine" starring
Michelle Williams and Ryan

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:43.589
Gosling, I'm sure a lot
of you have seen it,

00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:45.880
I mean they're supposed to
be quite poor in that movie.

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.050
I mean, that's part
of the movie is,

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.490
they're struggling with money.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.397
But they always
have massive cars.

00:54:50.397 --> 00:54:52.230
And I didn't even notice
this when I saw it,

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:54.250
but when I came out my best
friend who's British was like,

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:56.749
"If they're so poor, why are
they driving these massive four

00:54:56.749 --> 00:54:57.730
by fours?"

00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:00.070
And I was like, "You see,
in America, obviously,

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:02.200
there's a whole thing
about American-like--"

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.050
basically, I don't even
know what they call it now.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:06.490
It's leasing cars.

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:07.907
And in American
suburbs, everybody

00:55:07.907 --> 00:55:10.531
has these massive cars that they
lease, and they're going poor.

00:55:10.531 --> 00:55:13.130
And that's not saying British
poverty and American poverty,

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.520
I don't know.

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.890
It's not like American
people aren't poor.

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:16.070
British people aren't poor.

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:16.930
It's just a different attitude.

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:18.721
So a lot of times in
these American movies,

00:55:18.721 --> 00:55:21.220
I feel like British people
see people with massive cars

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.600
and think "Oh, they're
not really poor,"

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.790
and actually it's a whole
different kind of weird poverty

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:25.690
system in America.

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:27.700
Anyway, that's a
different thing.

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.102
But also the big
houses in these movies,

00:55:30.102 --> 00:55:32.560
that's another thing that I
find British people find really

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.780
weirded out by, particularly
the suburban houses

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.130
in John Hughes' movies.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:38.290
Like, you look at the
house in "Home Alone."

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:40.640
I mean, the house seems
as big as the White House.

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.150
I mean, the house
is freaking massive.

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:45.209
But the truth is,
in the suburbs,

00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:46.750
they are probably
very expensive now,

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:49.780
but there are a lot of bigger
houses that don't necessarily

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.510
denote massive wealth,
that they would especially

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:53.880
here in the countryside.

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.160
I mean, you can get these big
houses in the suburbs things

00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:00.378
that don't require you
to be a billionaire.

00:56:00.378 --> 00:56:02.815
JON SKEET: Brilliant.

00:56:02.815 --> 00:56:04.990
I could chat with you all
day, but unfortunately, we

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:06.020
are running out of time.

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.804
Does anyone have one
final question for Hadley?

00:56:10.615 --> 00:56:12.490
HADLEY FREEMAN: I've
got to go back and write

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:13.614
a column about Ben Affleck.

00:56:13.614 --> 00:56:16.090
So please, by all means,
fill my day with questions

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:16.840
about '80s movies.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.173
Anything's better than Baffleck.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.880
JON SKEET: OK,
well, in that case,

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.220
just remains for me to
say thank you so much.

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.247
This has been a complete treat.

00:56:27.247 --> 00:56:29.080
And all of you who
haven't read the book yet

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.900
have a treat in store.

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:33.100
And do book next
week off, because you

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.350
will want to just spend the
whole time watching films.

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:36.641
HADLEY FREEMAN: "Say Anything."

00:56:36.641 --> 00:56:38.130
Go home and watch
"Say Anything."

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:39.580
I feel like I'm an
evangelical for this.

00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:41.621
JON SKEET: It's certainly
going to be on my list.

00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:46.340
I spent a happy, very
happy plane journey

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:48.539
having just finished the
book for the second time,

00:56:48.539 --> 00:56:50.080
watching, I think,
four of the movies

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.164
in here on one plane trip.

00:56:51.164 --> 00:56:52.330
HADLEY FREEMAN: Oh, amazing.

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:53.420
JON SKEET: Awesome.

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.160
So thank you ever
so much, Hadley.

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.360
And yeah, brilliant.

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.380
HADLEY FREEMAN: Thank
you for having me.

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.505
JON SKEET: We shall look
forward to your next book.

00:56:59.505 --> 00:57:01.030
[APPLAUSE]
