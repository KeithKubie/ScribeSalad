00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.190
I used simplified
numbers when we first

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.210
thought about how the Chinese
government can intervene

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.710
in foreign currency markets to
keep their currency devalued.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.709
What I want to do this
video is to actually look

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.250
at some of the real numbers.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.960
So this is from the US Bureau
of Economic Analysis, bea.gov.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.520
This is the URL where I
actually got this data.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.610
And this right over
here is the US balance

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.130
of payments relative to China.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.620
And this part right over
here is the current account,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.130
which really tells us the
imports verses exports.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.730
And this over here is
the capital account,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.320
sometimes called the
financial account,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.980
depending on how you
are accounting for it.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.830
And this tells us about
inflow or the outflow

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.840
of ownership of assets.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.555
So this is goods,
this is assets.

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:47.430
You could think of it's
money, or securities,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.962
or other things like that.

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:49.670
Now you can look.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.370
From 2006 we did
export some things

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.590
to China. $72 billion
worth in 2006,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.950
this is in millions of dollars.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.170
So $72,000 is $72 billion.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.780
Increased to $85
billion, $95 billion.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.070
Stayed at $95 billion in 2009.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.460
But the United States imported
a ton more, $330 billion.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.740
$330 billion in 2006.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.400
$380 billion in 2007.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.540
Almost $400 billion in 2009.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.560
So we're running almost a $300
billion trade deficit in 2008

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.440
relative to China.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.220
And then in 2009 it
goes down a little bit.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.440
This looks like about $260
billion trade deficit.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.360
And that's really just
because we imported,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.535
or the United States
imported, fewer goods.

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.160
And to a large degree
that was probably

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.370
because of the US recession
where consumption in general,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.310
slowed down.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.480
So we would have bought
fewer goods and services

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.800
from pretty much anyone,
including ourselves or China.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.610
Now you can see
that being offset

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.730
in the financial account.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.720
This, to some degree,
tells the story.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.459
It done give us the full
story, of the Chinese.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.250
And this isn't just
the Chinese government.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.150
This is all Chinese
ownership, that they

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.930
are increasing their
ownership of US assets.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.920
And those assets, they could
be US Treasury notes and bills.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.430
These could be US stocks.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.680
This could be US real estate.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.880
But you can see each year,
and this is the increase,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.580
Americans are buying assets
in China. $5 billion in 2006,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.310
$2 billion in 2007, $12 billion
in 2008, $18 billion in 2009.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.350
To some degree this is
limited by restrictions

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.796
imposed by the
Chinese government.

00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:36.170
But you could see
the Chinese are

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.380
buying way more
assets in the US.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.700
And this really kind of is part
of that picture of the Chinese,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.450
especially the Chinese
central government,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.810
is buying US assets.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.960
To do that, they
have to buy dollars

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.590
with yen, which keeps
the dollar strong

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.840
and allows their
currency to stay weak,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.070
wish to some degree allows--
or to a large degree-- allows

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.180
this balance of the trade
deficit to stay where it is.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.230
Now, I'll leave you
with one conundrum.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.410
To a large degree these
numbers right here,

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.290
they are offsetting the
trade deficit, and especially

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.862
in 2008, the Chinese bought way
more US assets than actually

00:03:11.862 --> 00:03:12.820
even the trade deficit.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.610
They more than made up for it.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.840
But in 2009, you
don't see them buying

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.100
enough to make up for
the trade deficit.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.200
They bought $143 billion.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.910
And actually on a net basis,
it'll probably be about $120

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.730
something billion,
which doesn't make up

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.830
for the whole $260 billion.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.617
So how did they still keep
their currency pegged?

00:03:31.617 --> 00:03:33.950
And the answer, and we'll
look at that into more detail,

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.640
is they don't have to
directly buy US assets.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.010
They could buy assets, or
they could buy currency

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.260
from another country.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.440
And that will put upward
pressure on that currency.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.410
So let me put it over here.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.570
China could go and
buy US currency.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.610
Or it could go to
another country

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.580
and buy their
currency, country A.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.460
And then country A is
going to feel pressure.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.622
It's currency is going
to go up in value.

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:03.080
And it doesn't want that because
that would hurt its trade.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.090
So then it might go and buy
US assets to keep it devalued.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.910
And that would not
show up in that chart.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.620
But we'll look at that
in the next video.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.940
This is Salman Khan of
the Khan Academy for CNBC.
