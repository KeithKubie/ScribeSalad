PHILIP TAN: My
name is Philip Tan.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.490
I'm a research scientist
here at the MIT Game Lab,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.960
and I've been teaching
various game courses here

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.230
at MIT for about 10 years.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.450
Every night I play StarCraft
for a couple of games,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.310
just to help me calm
down and get to sleep.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.470
So that's kind of
my regular ritual.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.000
Otherwise, lately,
I've picked up

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.840
this game called Desert
Golfing, which is just

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.160
kind of endless
golfing on the iPhone,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.120
which is strangely soothing,
yet maddening at the same time.

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:42.840
Right now I'm actually working
with Blizzard Entertainment

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.760
to try to create different ways
for players-- for people who

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.670
are interested in StarCraft--
to spectate a game being played

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.500
by professionals.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.090
So we're about fixing.

00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:01.960
I'm really looking forward
to what the students end up

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.900
making.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.630
They usually impress
me with some sort

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.400
of far-out-of-left-field
approach to the problems that

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.590
we put forward to them.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.809
And this year we are ramping
up the design challenge,

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.850
so I'm interested to see
where they go with that.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.660
Outside of this class,
I'm pretty much focused

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.000
mostly on my four-year-old
kid and relearning

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.540
what fun is, actually,
through her eyes.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.030
I'd like to just see a lot
more different kinds of games

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.610
about a whole bunch
of different things.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.130
Right now I feel we're
right at the cusp off

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.360
like a Cambrian explosion
of different ideas.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.750
Tools are out there.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.150
The knowledge is getting
out there-- with this idea

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.840
that anyone can make a game.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.250
But I feel that
there are still a lot

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.840
of social and systemic barriers
to prevent people from getting

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.850
every idea into distribution.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.630
So we're still
constrained to a small set

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.900
of genres-- familiar genres.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.440
We see a lot of those games.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.802
I'd like to get a greater
variety out there.
