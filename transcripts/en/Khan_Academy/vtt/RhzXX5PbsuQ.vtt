00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.730
We're asked to simplify log base
5 of 25 to the x power over y.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.640
So we can use some
logarithm properties.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.790
And I do agree that this does
require some simplification

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.840
over here, that having
this right over here

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.080
inside of the logarithm is not
a pleasant thing to look at.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.150
So the first thing that
we realize-- and this

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.110
is one of our
logarithm properties--

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.360
is logarithm for a given
base-- so let's say

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.640
that the base is
x-- of a/b, that

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.750
is equal to log base x of
a minus log base x of b.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.740
And here we have
25 to the x over y.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.160
So we can simplify.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.310
So let me write this down.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.120
I'll do this in blue.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.770
Log base 5 of 25 to the x over
y using this property means

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.730
that it's the same thing
as log base 5 of 25

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.660
to the x power minus
log base 5 of y.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.340
Now, this looks like we can do
a little bit of simplifying.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.010
It seems like the relevant
logarithm property here

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.430
is if I have log base x of
a to the b power, that's

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.620
the same thing as
b times log base x

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.700
of a, that this
exponent over here

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.540
can be moved out front, which
is what we did it right over

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.292
there.

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:21.750
So this part right
over here can be

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.420
rewritten as x times the
logarithm base 5 of 25.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.020
And then, of course, we
have minus log base 5 of y.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.810
And this is useful
because log base 5 of 25

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.830
is actually fairly
easy to think about.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.650
This part right
here is asking us,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.260
what power do I have to
raise 5 to to get to 25?

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.100
So we have to raise 5 to the
second power to get to 25.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.390
So this simplifies to 2.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.550
So then we are left
with, this is equal to--

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.540
and I'll write it in front
of the x now-- 2 times

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.950
x minus log base 5 of y.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.742
And we're done.
