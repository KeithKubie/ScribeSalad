00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:18.610
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.910
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I'm John Cole.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm Director for the Center for the
Book and the Library of Congress,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.770
the part of the library that
promotes books and readings

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.290
and literacy in libraries.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.390
It was created by Daniel Boorstin
when he was librarian of Congress,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.000
very much in the outreach
mode feeling that the Library

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.380
of Congress should
do more to reach out.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.630
In those days to promote books and
reading and literacy was not part

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.130
of the vocabulary in
particular in the 1977, 78.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.320
It is now and it's
another area for the Center

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.210
for the Book and our activities.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.970
We've been involved from
the beginning with out,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.550
outside activities such as
the National Book Festival

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.530
and we also have a network
of state Centers for the Book

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.350
to help promote books,
reading, literacy and libraries.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.420
Most of that is really
working writers in the states.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.930
And part of the spinoff from that
has been state book festivals

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.410
and regional book festivals,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.650
especially since humanities
councils have become involved in 10

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.060
of the states now as our partners.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.960
But here at the Library of
Congress, Books and Beyond,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.180
some seats up front
please Carolyn and Tim.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.430
The book festival has, the National
Book Festival has really inspired a

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.910
number of those regional book
festivals, because of our pavilion

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.790
of the states and with help from
IMLS and NEH and actually NEA

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.300
which also sponsors the
pavilion at the book festival.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.650
We have partnerships with
other government organizations

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.820
and it's turned out to be a very
successful way for the Library

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.670
of Congress to reach out inwardly.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.190
This Books and Beyond noon
time series, started in 1996

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.830
and it has featured books
that have been published based

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.160
on primarily the Library
of Congress' collections

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.210
but also collections
of other organizations,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.990
plus a topic sent people of
special interest to the Library

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.870
of Congress and it's programs.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.770
Abby is one of those who is
of special interest to us

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.750
because of her time at
the Library of Congress

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.580
and we're delighted
to have her back.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.960 position:56%
The program will last about an hour.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.810
We will, it is being filmed for
the Library of Congress' website,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.910
but it also will contain a
question and answer period

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.910
and we'll have the book signing
beginning in this room about 1:00.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.150
Abby will repeat the
questions from the audience

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.070
and we would welcome them and want
you to know also there's a chance

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.560
that you might be part of our
webcast and thank you in advance

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.500 position:56%
for your permission if that happens.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.090
Abby Smith Rumsey is a writer
and a historian who focuses

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.910
on the creation, preservation,

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.820
and use of the cultural
record in all media.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.900
Her specialized interest and I
had to go and take a few of them

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.920
out because there were a lot of
them, include digital preservation,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.730
the changing roles of libraries
and archives in the electronic age

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.510
and the effect of new
information technologies

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.310
on perceptions of history and time.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.990
Now a good chunk of Abby's
learning experience for better

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.880 position:56%
and of course sometimes for not so
better but basically better has been

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.210
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.850
Way back in the early Billington
years, administration is

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.220
when the two of us first met.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.330
Among other things she headed
several special projects

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.900
for Dr. Billington.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.390
But curated two major exhibitions,
one was I remember well Treasures

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.290
of the Library of Congress,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.950
the other called Unheard
Special Knowledge

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.790
of Russia called Living
Traditions of Russian Faith,

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.960
Books and Manuscripts
of Old Believers.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.870
Abby being a Russian
specialist, she also contributed

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.090 position:56%
to the library's historical display.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.450
And I remember this very
well from Dr. Billington,

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.720
the historical display of
documents and so does Abby

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.100
of classified Soviet archives,
Revelations of the Russian,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.450
from the Russian archives.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.290
And for more than a decade
she worked with NDIP,

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.450
the library's digital
information infrastructure

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.230
and preservation program.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.940
Abby's other contributions since
leaving the library include serving

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.760
on the National Science
Foundation's Blue Ribbon Taskforce

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.410
on sustainable digital
preservation and access

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.650
where she was the senior
writer and editor

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.200
of the taskforces second
year report.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.160
She served on the ACLS
commission on cyber infrastructure

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.570
for the humanities and social
services and also as director

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.100
of programs of the council and
library and information resources.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.270
Abby holds a B.A. from Radcliffe
College and an M.A. and PhD degrees

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.300
from Harvard University where she
specialized in early modern Russia

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.270
and intellectual history.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.860
She was a Fulbright fellow
and taught and Harvard

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.470
and at Johns Hopkins Universities.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.150
Would you help welcome me,
welcome Abby back to the Library

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.510
of Congress, Abby Smith Rumsey.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.620
[ Applause ]

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.920
&gt;&gt; Abby Smith Rumsey: Thank you.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.280 position:56%
It is very nice to back, even though
I'm back with a different name

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.320
and considerably grayer hair
but I'm very happy to be back.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.420 position:56%
As you will see as I give this talk
and I'm not going summarize my book.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.740
I'm just going to pull
out a few things

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.420
that I think are special interests
to this audience and other people

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.260
who love the Library of Congress.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.610
But you'll see that I'm going
to talk about the technologies

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.420 position:56%
of memory and why it is that we need
to pay attention to certain things

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.920
as technologies move
from print to digital.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.020
In particular, I want
to focus on how changes

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.860
in technology effect the faiths
of collective and personal memory.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.550
And the research that I did for
this book which included a lot

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.430
of science, led me the conclusion
that much of what we think

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.610
as our personal memory actually
is something that resides

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.110
in our collective memory.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.960
We think that the songs of our
childhood our in fact ours,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.730
our favorites but it's the culture
that provides this kind of richness

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.320
of experience and allows us
to understand the richness

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.990
of experience of past
generations as well.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.690
And so I think that of
collective and personal as being

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.010
in some ways very closely tied.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.830
Now the question that
I answer in this book

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.420
or at least I address shall we say

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.830
with some answers was
actually a consequence

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.400
of some rather frightening
wakeup call I got

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.830
when I was actually doing
the treasures of the Library

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.130
of Congress exhibition, when I
realized that all of the things

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.850
that we will be putting
out in the artifacts

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.150
that we would be putting
out, even high tech artifacts

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.900
like wire recorders and things

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.050
like that would actually
not even be there.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.170
There would be no artifacts in 100
years that we could put on display

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.970
for another treasures of
the Library of Congress.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.040
And so I started to ask
myself this question.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.690
What happens when this
format, the default format

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:50.040
for our memories is
replaced by this format

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.450
which incidentally is not only
holding my you know, lots of books

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.900
and music but lots of
other things as well.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:02.070
So in other words, what
happens when we go from,

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:08.170
I'm sorry this, there we go.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.980
What happens when we go from this
vision of accumulation of knowledge

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.030
to this vision of accumulation
of knowledge.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.330
So I make an argument in
the book that you know,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.600
as we ask this question,
how can technology keep pace

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.360
with information explosion?

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.310
We need to actually rethink
and reimagine memory itself.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.900
We too often think of it
as something that's fixed

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.610
on artifact when in fact it's not.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.510
So I want to talk about and
I want to show you in fact

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:40.240
that data storage is not
memory, that forgetting is key

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.160
to remembering and that
most important of all,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.330
memory's not about the past,
it is about the future.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.760
It is in fact the raw material

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.430
from which we manufacture
what is to come.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.830
So if you care about the
present and the future,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.230
you better be good
stewards of the past.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.930
Now I don't think I need to make
this argument too strenuously

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.010
to this audience, but since I
live in San Francisco I have

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.550
to really drill this
point home to people

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.270
who are busy inventing the
future with little knowledge

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.980
of how much the future is
actually just a reiteration

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.630
and a growth from the past.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.080
You would expect that I
would find the importance

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.520
of the past really important
because after all I'm a historian.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.600
But I really believe ardently that
the past is important to everybody,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.180
especially now the past will
be written in digital code

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.430
which can't be read by
human beings with eyes.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.210
Because you see, we humans
unlike all other species,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.510
all of whom have memory like we do.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.940
We have the unique ability
to accumulate knowledge

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.380 position:56%
over generations and it's this
knowledge accumulated over thousands

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.240 position:56%
of generations which is made us as
a species dominant over this planet.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.490
And in fact through our
technologies we are discovering

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.570
that we are dangerously dominant.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.490
So if we don't understand how
to be stewards of that past

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.590
and of the knowledge of
the technology gives us,

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.420
then in fact it's probably
the future is probably bleaker

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.210
than we can imagine.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.680
So I think of the importance of
learning how to manage memory

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.740
in the digital age, not as a
technical issue fundamentally,

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.760
but as a moral issue which has to
engage every citizen on the planet

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.200
because we have a big problem.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.500
The knowledge that resides in
these three buildings and beyond

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:28.720
at the Library of Congress is
really at risk of loss as you know.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.480
Aha it worked.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.840
So as you recognize this
room, it symbolizes everything

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.140 position:56%
about what is actually an obsolete
system of disseminating information.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.120
Because the publishing houses,
the movie and recording studios

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.670 position:56%
that create and publish, book stores
and theaters that act as points

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.050 position:56%
of distribution, libraries, archives
and museums as points of access

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.900
over multiple generations.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.780
They have worked symbolic,
symbiotically

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.590
and somewhat mysteriously
but always stunningly well

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.440
to keep the past accessible
to the present.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.740
But that world always operated in
an economy of information scarcity

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.190
and I know it sounds ridiculous
to say information scarcity

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.320
in the Library of Congress which
is overwhelmed by physical objects,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.710
but compared to the internet there
really is information scarcity.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.770
See the simple cost of
producing movies and books

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.950
and distributing them
and preserving them was

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.140
in a way a built in
filter of quality.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.720
It had to be worthy of major
corporations investing a lot

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.220
of money and producing something
and they had a vested interest

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.520
in preserving these things.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.430
It was one of the reasons why
they deposited copyright deposits

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.850
because they wanted that
information to be preserved.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.330
So the upfront cost of production
always guaranteed some measure

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.970
of stewardship even if it
wasn't of the highest quality.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.420
And then of course there
were libraries protected

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.460
by copyright legislation to take

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.320
on long-term stewardship
of these things.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.050
So the rule of thumb in the analog
world has always been put your

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.290
knowledge into a durable physical
object, outsource your memory

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.990
to durable physical objects.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:07.000 position:56%
You save the object and you save the
knowledge and it's been that simple,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.790
that complicated but
also that symbol.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.050
But now in fact as you
know there's no way

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.480
that it works with this phone.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.590
In a few years this phone
unless I update it constantly,

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.980
everything on it including my
personal contact information will

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.340
be inaccessible.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.990
And furthermore the people
who wrote the code for this,

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.650
they can open up this
machine right now

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.950
and they won't be able to read it.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.250
They wouldn't be able
to read anything

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.250
in here without more machines.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.990
I want to point out and basically
I know this only because I worked

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:47.080
at the Library of Congress
and I got to know,

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.530
okay I understand the back button
is actually the forward button,

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.850
that won't happen again.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.620
I want, I want to say for one of
the things, it's hard for people

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.520
to understand emotionally among
other things and technically

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.200
in the digital world is that
in fact digital machines stand

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.840
in the way of knowing everything.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.560
It encodes all of the information

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.960
and we need machines to
read the information.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.760
But I know from my friends in
MBRS that in fact it's been

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.370
that way for a long time.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.520
In fact in audio it was
among the first formats

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.980
where it was machine inscribed and
you actually had to have a machine

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.070
to play it back, that was a very
important lesson for me I have

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:28.940
to say, so that in fact audio
recording was invented in 1860.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.510 position:56%
But the man who invented it actually
couldn't play back what he had

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.910
recorded and it wasn't
until just a few years ago

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.550
when Carl Haber was able to
retrieve some of that information

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.780
through very high technology
that he could hear what it was

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.120
that the Frenchman had recorded.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.120
So in a way since the 1900s we've
always been dependent upon machines

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.110
for a lot of important information.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.250
So I want to address in this talk,

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.450
first I'll go a little further
talking about the nature

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.180 position:56%
of technology as such and how we are

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.020
to understand a relatively new
relationship of technology,

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.020 position:56%
not entirely new but relatively new.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.600
And then I want to pivot and talk
about memory since I wanted us

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.800
to reexamine what memory means so
I'll do a little bit of history

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.160 position:56%
and a little bit of science and then
I want to pivot from there and talk

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.650 position:56%
about some of the challenges that
we face and I would say actually you

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.180
in particular face as we
move into this new age.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:26.020
So first I just want to say
a few words about technology.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.430 position:56%
Technologies of memory are very old.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.850
They are probably the oldest
technologies besides tools

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.020 position:56%
for cutting up animals that we know.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.960
We've actually been using,
using durable objects

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.560
to remember things for
us for a long time.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.440
What I'm showing here is an
image from 35, 40,000 years ago

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.250
from a cave near Chauvet, France,

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.300
a Paleolithic memo
to self or a prayer.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.230
We really don't know what it means,
but we do know that it was created

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.110
by human beings because
after all they signed it.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:07.830 position:56%
And that's one of the things that's
so, to us in the present age missing

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.250
from moving from print
to digital is the

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.880
since that machines actually have
some human quality and I want

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.800
to talk about that,
because you'll see

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.540
that if this is a Paleolithic
selfie, the impulse to take selfies

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.570
and leave records of yourself
is just as vibrant today,

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.100
in fact it's more vibrant
in many ways.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.210
But the important thing
about technology is

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.590
that technology is simply a tool,
it is an extension of human will.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.630
It actually has no power of its
own other than what we grab to it.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.310
So I'm not at all a
technological determinist.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.700
I don't believe that technologies
will make us do anything

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.900
and the machines are
inherently threatening to us.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.750
If machines are threatening
to us it's

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.980
because we are threatening
to ourselves.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.390
So that's why I'm very
optimistic about trying

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.120 position:56%
to master memory in the digital age.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.290
Nothing is predetermined for us.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.000
You know, the reason I believe
and this is my personal opinion,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.380
the reason that we invented
memory technologies to begin with

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.060
and the moment in history
when we did was when I think

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.220
of when the Garden of Eden moment.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.260
The moment whenever that was
in history when human beings

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.060
and clearly it was homosapiens,
not just, not just Neanderthals

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.100
because they didn't leave
records of their thoughts behind.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.380 position:56%
But when human beings finally or
realized that they were going to die

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.050
and not just so that other
members of their species would die,

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.090
but that they personally
would die and that

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.810
at some point children
would grow up knowing

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.280
that they too were destined to die.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.110
And I think it's the reason that
we started to invent technologies

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.100
that essentially cheat death.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.870
And I think that if we, I
think memory technologies are

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.010
in fact wonderful ways
to cheat death

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.810
and that drives a lot
of their application.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.920
Technologies are also always
designed to solve a problem

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.600
or sometimes to meet a demand
or market demand for example.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.690
And I'll show you some
examples of that.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:03.000
But the think about clever human
beings and inventing tools is

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.050
that we solve one problem
and we create three

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.420
that we would never
have anticipated.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.340
And we know when a
technology is truly successful

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.410
because then it gets
used for many things

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.360
that the inventors would
never have anticipated.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.220
And we fall into this sort of
dizzying vertigo of lots of uses

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.160
of the technology no
one had anticipated

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.910
and this is what I call the havoc
phase of technology adoption.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.680
And you know when technology
is really successful

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.750
when it reeks extraordinary havoc
in the first couple of generations.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.440
So judging by that, I would say

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.800
that print was a hugely
successful technology

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.030
because it created huge
havoc after its invention

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:45.500 position:56%
and certainly digital technology is
also dismayingly successful and it's

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.350
at a dismayingly widespread
havoc phase.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.390
So the signs of havoc phase
and we can talk about this

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.130
if you want is always a
certain amount of infatuation

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.070 position:56%
with the new technology, infatuation

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.310
with the technology
for its own sake.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:03.540
A lot of fear about the technology,
a lot of [inaudible] inadvertent,

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.820
sorry information inflation.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.760
So we actually start using
technology to start creating a lot

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.300
of information that then we
don't know what to do with,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.260
that's the inflation phase.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.080
And we always find over
time after a couple

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.100
of native generations have grown
up with whatever technology

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.840
that we actually are able to
tap in a new human potentials,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.420
express something new about
the new human experience

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.720
through these new technologies

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.140
and that's why they're
so valuable to us.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.090
So we have new writers.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.150
We certainly have new audiences

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.250
and we also have changed
perceptions about human destiny.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.120
Another thing that I learned
working at the Library

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.800
of Congress is how very powerful
the invention of moving image,

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.350 position:56%
even silent film was in changing
the way that people were assimilated

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.730
into American culture
for example and the way

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.390 position:56%
that people started to tell stories.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:19:00.430
And the influence that, that movie
making narrative had subsequently

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.040
on the way we think,
the way we perceive time

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.700
and also the way we write.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.190
So I want to talk a little bit

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.790
about some the things we
can expect from technology.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.500
Technology always inspires
fear and also excitement

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.130
and some people praise a
new information technology

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.490
as disruptive and creative.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.800
I would say that's my tribe

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.830
of Silcon Valley technologist
where I live among now.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.500
And others condemn it as
disruptive and destructive.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:32.600
And I want to talk about why both
those things are a little bit too

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.520
extreme and unrealistic.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.070
But I want to take as this sort
of granddaddy example of this sort

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.600
of [inaudible] of technology.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.080
Socrates, who famously warned
that the invention of writing,

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.770
something I think we all love
ourselves, that the invention

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.950
of writing would lead to
ignorance and ultimately

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.010
to the death of memory itself.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:56.220
And here I want to quote
Socrates, "For this invention,

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.280
writing will produce forgetfulness
in the minds of those who learn

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.600
to use it, because they will
not practice their memory.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.490
Their trust in writing
produced by external characters

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.460
which are no part of themselves
will discourage the use

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.490
of their own memory within them.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.820
Users have invented an elixir
not of memory but of reminding.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.730
And you offer your pupils
the appearance of wisdom,

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:21.670 position:56%
but not true wisdom for they will
read many things without instruction

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.410
and will therefore seem to
know many things when they are

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.640
for the most part ignorant
and hard to get along

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.810
with since they are not
wise but appear wise."

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.830
I think we could say as
I've heard many parents say,

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.200
they don't know anything, they
know where to look things up.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.690
So I think that's actually
a very common reaction.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.730
But in my mind Socrates
got it wrong.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.240
It was actually the societies that
adopted writing that progressed

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.580
and extended the reach of knowledge
and as we will see the reach

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.430
of knowledge is also the reach of
self-autonomy and self-liberation.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.440
And after all let's not forget
if Plato had not been writing

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.590 position:56%
down what Socrates said, we wouldn't
know that Socrates was ever alive

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.050
and Socrates was a great ironist.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.180
I'm sure he knew that
he would be immortal

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.090
through the words of somebody else.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:10.640 position:56%
But I love this example of
Socrates because he points out first

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.200
and foremost, the moral hazard

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.090
of actually outsourcing our
memory to anything else.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:20.660
Once it leaves our physical custody
then in fact it begins to do things

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.130 position:56%
that we don't have any control over.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.600
And I think that's one
of the underlying fears

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.990
that we're encountering
now in the digital age

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.890 position:56%
when people put personal information
online for example, it's personal,

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.080
they're sharing it
personally and they don't

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.760
yet understand that's it's a
commercially owned platform

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.780
that is using that data
for its own purposes.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.160
So you know, the thing

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.300
about technology is no one
can predict how it's going

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.990
to be naturalized by those
curious beings, humans.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.580
And I want to take a case in point,
one very familiar to all of you

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.600
and that is the case of Johannes
Gutenberg, the goldsmith.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.270
He invented movable type and he met
it to meet a very specific demand.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.270
He didn't actually intend to invent
the Renaissance and the reformation

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.820
which is what historians
see in retrospect.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.400
He actually wanted to
create, he didn't want

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.180
to create even a new
fangled technology.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.310
He was trying to produce a
cheaper and faster version

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:18.370
of an old fangled thing, this
thing, the giant bible of mites.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.120
And those of you have been

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.390
to the Jefferson building will know
what an amazing job he did knocking

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.420
off the old form.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.020
He wanted to give people something
that looked like this only cheaper

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.790 position:56%
and faster, so he was market demand.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.880
And I know as a historian
of technology and ideas

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.600
that within 50 years the early
doctors of this technology,

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.310
you can say the early
print adopters,

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.900
the early print tech adopters
that ran with the technology

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.290
of most innovative and
effective ways come

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.310
in two tribes, then as they do now.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.800
Initially, there's a
flourishing of pornography

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.770
and there was then the pornographic
images of the Pope for example,

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.570
really quite vivid and
were highly in demand.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.300
And the second group are what
I would call euphemistically

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.170
ideological dissidence.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.910
In the case of the
Renaissance there were people

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.530
who were protesting the
power of the Papacy.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:19.530
And we call them because
they've become respectable,

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:23.890
we call them Protestants now
but in fact at the time they,

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:28.870
they were arguing for ideological
and I'd say theological utopias

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:34.020
that actually would be very
familiar to us from the headlines.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.230
There wasn't anything that
Isis had invented in the way

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.810
of human enforcement and
persuasion that wasn't used

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.140
by Protestant sex at that time.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.080
And the way they got a grip over
the human imagination was in fact

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.200
through the way of use
of printing technology.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.350
Not that everybody read but all
you had to do was talk to somebody,

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.450 position:56%
who had talked to somebody who had
read something that the Protestants,

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.950
these dissidents have published.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.660
But you know, there was always
more there was always an upside,

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.260
not just a downside.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.710
And my favorite upside story

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:10.400 position:56%
of the printing revolution is this
man Michel de Montaigne who was born

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.430
in 1533 and you could say
that he was among the first

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.950
of the born print natives.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:20.720
And he became an author,
he wrote his famous essays.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.660
He became an author
because there was printing.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.100
If there weren't printing he
would've written those essays

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.030
as manuscripts letters and
sent them to his family.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.100
Instead he wrote his essays, he
published them, he published them

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.520
over many additions
over his lifetime.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.860
And the whole genre of personal
essay that he invented was

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.550
so popular that it has never ever
gone out of print until this day.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:47.570
That's something that all authors
in new genres can aspire to.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:52.680
And if fact one of the things that
really struck me about Montaigne is

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.750
that he didn't just invent a new
genre, he invented a new appetite

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.610
and a new way of readers
thinking about themselves

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.490
and altering the way they
thought about themselves

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.200
and what they were capable of.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.730
I want to move quickly, we're just
going to jump over a few centuries

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.420
and talk about our very
dear friend and benefactor,

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.560
sort of a patron saint of libraries
in this country, Thomas Jefferson.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.820
Because by the time of the
enlightenment in the 18 Century,

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.110
knowledge itself, the thing that
was passed down through books

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:28.500 position:56%
and other forms was redefined not as
something that was self-reflective

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.900
where we could learn about
ourselves and learn about God

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.200
but it was also a political agent,
it was a way of changing the world.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.570
And I think because
we've grown up you know,

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.980
in the legacy of Thomas
Jefferson we failed

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.400
to understand how enormously
radical that was the time,

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.660
the idea that knowledge itself
was an agent of progress.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.440
I mean it was a very
irreligious idea in many ways,

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.850
the idea that you wanted to change
the world, not to know the world.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:58.010
But it was widespread and it has
taken over I think with the spread

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.860
of western thought and western
information technologies.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.950
It's widely acknowledged now
that the world is something

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:08.010
that we can change
through information.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:13.730
The other thing that we do
know about what happened

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.930 position:56%
with enlightenment view of
knowledge is it imposed entirely new

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.770
responsibilities on the government

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.270
to provide access information
to its citizens.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.440
There was no way that Jefferson
and his cohort believed

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.740
that we could be good citizens
without being well-informed

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.570
and so we have public libraries,
we have the freedom of the press

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.420 position:56%
and other things that we know about.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.460
The thing that fails to get lauded
as much as freedom of the press

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.480
and libraries as the responsibility

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.630
of the government is the
responsibility of citizens

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:46.720
to stay informed, that
was a part of the equation

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.120
that we don't talk
about very much today.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.170 position:56%
But it is in fact the vision behind
the people who invented the internet

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.510
and certainly the people
who put together Google.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.950
I mean they wanted to
organize the world's knowledge

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.300
so that people could have access
to it and make it easy to find.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.650
Things haven't turned out
exactly the way they planned

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.540
but that's just in
the nature of things.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:14.870
I want to talk briefly about this
boom, this is a reading room one

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.260
of the earliest reading rooms

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.650
of 19th Century, in
Paris in [inaudible].

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.120 position:56%
It was built in 1838 and you can see

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.790
that it embodies very revolutionary
ideas of accessed information.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.860
Before this there was no student
reading room at the university,

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.880
they used to have to take
books back to their garrets.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.030
But now they, he built
this large reading room

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:38.640
and because he used this incredibly
new technology called cast iron he

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.430
was able to elevate the ceiling
and put a lot of glass in

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:45.110
and he used a lot less
wood and it was another way

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:47.460
of protecting the books
from fire he thought.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.560 position:56%
So the thing about the technology is

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.050
that it always spurs other
innovations in ways of iterating

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.410
out the thoughts that
knowledge embodies.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:05.770
I want to say that is was in the
19th Century and the radical growth

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:09.740
of knowledge with the understanding
that we can understand the world

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.960
and change the world
by learning more.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.130
That we saw what I
think of as the root

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:16.430
of the today's information
inflation because I really believe

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:20.740
that it began in the 1800s,
it did not begin just a couple

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.650
of decades ago, that
was a difference

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.910
in scale I think and in format.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:30.360
Because by the time, 1838,
1848, 1850 when we were starting

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.980
to build libraries on
the scale that we saw.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.350
This ordering of knowledge, this
is Thomas Jefferson's catalog

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.930 position:56%
of course, organizing knowledge
into memory, reason and imagination.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.230
This was already obsolete.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:46.010
There was no way you could organize
all the world's knowledge this was

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.070
according to these
faculties of the mind.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:52.320
We started to develop, we started
to develop a demand for what turned

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.500
out to be the LC classification
system.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.160
When you actually started to
classify information according

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.730
to what it described in the world,
also a completely radical idea

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:04.340
that would have never occurred
to anybody in the 18th Century.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.870
So I just want to say before
passing on and pivoting to memory

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:11.710
that in sum, the real benefits
of memory technology, innovation

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.680 position:56%
and memory technologies become clear
only when infrastructures begin

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.330
to catch up with the innovations in
order to order it to provide access

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:26.230
to it and to provide long-term
stewardship and enter to what is

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.450
in effect the post havoc phase.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:32.030
I don't know how long we
will be in the havoc phase.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:36.360
I think the post havoc phase will
occur certainly after I'm gone

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.990
and probably when my granddaughter
who is a digital native,

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:44.500
when she reaches my august
age and lives well beyond it,

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.980
people born now will live
well beyond their 60s, 70s,

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.650
80s, well into their 100s.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.780
And they will actually be in
a position that most of us are

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.830
and when we look back
retrospectively and try

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.480
to make sense out of our
lives and that's when we begin

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.970
to understand the value of not just
keeping everything, but in ordering

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.380 position:56%
in such a way that it begins to tell
us a narrative and it makes sense.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:10.310
So in fact it does begin to map
what we know and experienced

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.730
in the world does begin to map
to something within our brain,

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.260
within our mind, within our spirit.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:19.670
So I want to pivot to
memory now and again,

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.750
I have to confess the whole idea
of investigating memory is a way

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.650
of the science of memory occurred
when I was here at the Library

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.040
of Congress and we hosted
the decade of the brain.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.500
It's funny how so many
of these insights I had

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.770
into memory really were born here.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:38.160 position:56%
So the purpose of memory which is
given to all creatures from amoebas,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.640
to zebras is to supplement the
pre-programmed thing we're all born

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.950
with, DNA.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.940
Everybody's born with DNA it
teaches us how to be an amoeba,

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.760
a zebra or a human being.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.770
But every one of us
that's born actually needs

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:53.410
to learn our environment and so
we're given this capacity by nature

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.990
to remember the environment
in which we live.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.400
We learn things and we
store that learning.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.280
And when that learning, that
memory is no longer applicable

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.210
for the world that we live
in, we lose that memory.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.870
Memory is highly dynamic and it's
intended to be highly dynamic.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.430
So just remember that forgetting
is very important in memory

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:14.000
because there's a limit to
what every creature can know.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.070 position:56%
The brain also has a capacity to
sort out what's new, I mean in order

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:23.640
to figure out what it needs to
remember, it memorizes the world.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.520
And in creatures that
are as complicated

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.170
as us it takes many years for us

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.310
to learn the world that's why
we spend the first two decades

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:34.060
of our lives learning from our
family and from the schools.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.370
And then by adulthood we start to
actually counter things that reify,

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.420
reinforce what we've learned
and begin to act in the world

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.050
and change what we
know about the world.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.580
And we, the brain mysteriously
can pick out what is,

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.250
we still don't have any
idea how it does this.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:51.890
But it actually takes in a lot

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.810
of information every day
in short-term memory.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.600 position:56%
At night when we're asleep,
incidentally sleep is very important

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.180 position:56%
for memory formation in ways that we
do not understand it actually starts

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.090
to sift out short-term memory

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.080
that it doesn't think
has any long-term value

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.550
and then consolidate the other
memory into long-term memory.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:14.430
So we know from biology and
we are biological creatures

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:17.660
and our cultural habits are
extensions of our biology.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.860
We know that information has
long-term value to the extent

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.320
that it has potential for reuse.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.280
Now I don't have to tell
librarians that the whole point

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.710
of preserving is in order to
provide use in the future,

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.780
but we don't actually
in the digital age

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.960
yet understand how data
will be useful in the future

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.970
and I'll talk about that in a bit.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.560 position:56%
But first this brief example which
I talk about in the book which seems

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.640
to come as a great
surprise too many people

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.800
that don't understand
libraries and long-term memory.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.860
The first is that bad things happen

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.370
when we don't say it
long-term memories.

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:53.780
And I give an example of a write
Iris Murdoch, this is Iris Murdoch

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.490
who was a prolific writer
and philosopher and later

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.260
in life succumbed to Alzheimer's.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.560
And I think this picture was taken
when she first began to succumb

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.870
to Alzheimer's before
she was diagnosed.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.620
Her husband John Bayley, a great
writer, wrote a very moving memoir

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:13.310
about what it was like to
lose Iris to this disease.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:16.930
When she lost her personality
it wasn't just her memory,

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:20.590
she lost her perky
personality, her sense of humor

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.500
and most important I
think her imagination.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.610
Because she had no memories
and she lost any understanding

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:30.220
of how the world worked, she
could not imagine anything.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.450
You can see this among
Alzheimer's patients.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:34.880
They get up in the morning and they
don't know what they are supposed

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.180
to do.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.780 position:56%
It isn't just that they don't know
where they are and that also happens

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.870
with deterioration of the
hippocampus and the disease,

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:46.170
but they actually have no
ability to imagine their future

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:51.080
because imagination is nothing
but memory in the future tense.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.790
Memory is not about the
past, it is about the future

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:58.000 position:56%
and the only reason we have a future
as humans is because we have enough

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.740
of the past to be able to
project into the future,

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.270
long-term into the future and
to do conjectural thinking

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.770
and solving problems.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:10.570
So I want to talk about
the second disorder

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.760
which I think will bring
home to many people

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.560
who worry about digital memory.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.170
And that is the fact that good
memory is not data storage,

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.470
it requires forgetting.

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:22.090
So we don't want to forget
everything and we certainly want

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.390
to keep long-term memories,
the equivalent

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:26.680
of what cultural memories
held in the Library

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.010
of Congress and elsewhere.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:29.940
But we also can't store everything

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.420
and think okay job
done, that's memory.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.910
In the book I talk about
the patient of this man,

00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:41.760
this man is [inaudible] he's a,
he was a Soviet aeroscientist

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.790
and psychologist who had a patient
who couldn't forget anything.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.210
And he had more than
a photographic memory.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.850
He had actually a kind of disorder

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:54.230
of the brain whereby he couldn't
consolidate any short-term memory

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.740
into a long-term memory.

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.690
So he memories information
stuck to his head

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:01.100
like I don't know,
flies to fly paper.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.960
But if you asked him to tell
you a story he couldn't.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.000
He couldn't understand how
to put a narrative together,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.300
he didn't understand cause and
effect and he said at the end

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.280
of his life that he actually was
sort of waiting for life to begin,

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.510
because he had never really
felt that it had quite begun,

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.250
he didn't know what to expect.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.020
He couldn't hold down a job because
he kept waiting for something

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.230
to happen even though he
had this great memory.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:25.230 position:56%
He really couldn't move beyond that.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.690
And his doctor said that in
reality his life took place

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.710
in dreams not in reality.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:34.660
He had a family, a fine wife
and his son who was a success,

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.450
but this too he perceived
through a haze.

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:40.560
Indeed one would be hard put to
say which was more real for him,

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.040
the world of imagination in which
you live or the world of reality

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.490
which he was but a temporary guest.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:53.520
So we, one of the tasks I
think so important for us

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.010
in this age is actually
to figure out how to sift

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.510
through important things, so
that we don't end up going

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.020
into our memory palace
and finding this.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.710
And I know this is an extremely
cheap shot, forgive me John.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.310
This is definitely one of my most
favorite photographs of any place

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.210
on the planet, let alone
the Library of Congress

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:13.740
and it is actually a sign

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.920
of librarians getting
their house in order.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:22.010 position:56%
But I do use this as an illustration
of the kind of sort of memory palace

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:25.270
that [inaudible] would have
encountered in his mind

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:31.210
because nothing sorted,
everything was just in piles.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.450
This is actually, this is and
understand this is not a picture

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.450 position:56%
of [inaudible] but this is an artist
wondering what [inaudible] must've

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:41.910
felt like when he was trying to
put things together in his head.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.490
And as you know this was actually
the library of Congress moving in,

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:51.810
in 19, 1997, in 1897 into its
new home, the Jefferson Building.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:55.950
And of the most treasured facts
is that of course they outgrew

00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:01.650
that building pretty quickly so we
know that library's a core vacuum

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:04.960
and so do servers,
so does the internet

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.580
and so does YouTube and Instagram.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.870
So given that this is the
challenge that I've laid out,

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.160
what do memory institutions
supposed to do now.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.320 position:56%
And here I'm not going to claim that
I have any more knowledge than you,

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.850
but I do want to let you know
what I have been telling people

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:25.910 position:56%
who don't understand what the tasks
at hand are and I'll go very briefly

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.750
through this because you
already know the answers to this.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.240
First I talk to people about
how we need to rescue the past

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.360
and we can do that a lot
through technologies.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.630
I really believe that in 20
years if our analog assets,

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.610
if our analog information is not
accessible and findable online,

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:45.670
even if it's just a pointer to
something then nobody will know

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.450
that it exists because people
will by default go to the web,

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:51.670
go to what the new
version of the web is.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.730
And I show here a picture of Carl
Haber, somebody that the Library

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:57.520
of Congress doesn't actually
supported a great deal in his work.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.680
He's a nuclear experimental
physicist,

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.850
developed an imaging technology
for the large Hadron Collider.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:06.560
He's a kind of a neighbor
of mine in Berkeley,

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:12.390
he works at the Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory and CERN in Switzerland.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:17.180
And he said that he could,
figured out his imaging technology

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.510
which goes down to you know, the
kind that can image it [inaudible]

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.730
when they actually catch one,

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:26.320 position:56%
was also good for imaging
deteriorated audio files, I'm sorry,

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.370
audio formats turning them
into three, two and 3D images.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:35.960 position:56%
So you could actually take a picture
of a broken platter and turn it

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.460
into a digital file
and play it back.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.060
So we can actually use
machines not just to digitize

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.320
but to capture information
which we can't play back.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.910
And as I think so many of you
know when we convert things

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:54.330
like ships logs that have a lot
of information about centuries

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:58.880
of sea conditions over time, there
are very hard to make sense of.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.750
As a scientist for climate
information you have

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.150
to read each page but now
that they've been digitized

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.760
by the Wellcome Trust
and Naval Museum

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.020
in London they are actually
a source of huge information,

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.350
pattern recognition and
great retrospective data

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.810
for climate scientists.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:19.870 position:56%
So I think again, I tell people that
there is more information lurking

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.450
in old formats than
we can possibly guess

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.440
because we don't what
technologies we'll be able

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.330
to discover from what exists.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:31.150
The other thing that I
preach I think to be fair is

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.940
to save the present and this is
an example of saving the present.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.700
You may know Brewster Kahle,
this is a picture of him

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.990
in the early days in
his internet archive.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:45.550
This is one of the few archives
dedicated to capturing the web

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.960
and also making it freely available
to people to actually upload

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.390
to their own images and
their own files online.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:57.260 position:56%
So it's more than just web archiving

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.810
that he does on behalf
of the public.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:04.210
He also allows individuals
to put their files up.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.680
Many of you will wonder
what can people do

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.970
in the interim while places like
the Library of Congress are getting

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:14.200
up to speed when the infrastructure
is being built out to start

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.400
to steward the digital
creation that's going on now.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.810
And I think this is
a critical time now

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.580
that individuals have a
huge difference to play.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.450
They need to develop their
own territorial profile,

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:29.010
save their own files and
develop a kind of digital persona

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:33.710 position:56%
and take responsibility for ensuring
that all of the data they want saved

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.880
which they posted to Facebook or
which is on Gmail or something,

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.650
some platform that's not out
their own, that they are able

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:45.630
to preserve it themselves and
if they wish to, to share it.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:47.230
And if there be more
places like the internet,

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:51.030
the archive can be
deposited and hopefully places

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.520
where it can be deposited without
being shown for longs periods

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.680
of time if they wish
to have an embargo.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:05.260
I just want to, before I close
say that the final risk I think

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.940
and I want to get back to the moral
issue is that we are in a period

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:15.100
when we believe that progress
is never-ending and that

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.720
in fact the knowledge that
we have now will sometime,

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.780
at some point supersede
the knowledge that we,

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.550
the knowledge that we create
supersedes past knowledge.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.210
And all I can say is that nothing
can be further from the truth.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:30.870
This is a, from an atlas in the
1850s in which the scientists

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:33.840
who became mad about
cataloging all extinct species

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.430
because they finally understood
there were extinct species,

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.980
put together catalogs full
of extinct species including,

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:43.690
and you can see in the corner
above the volcano, the dodo.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:46.890
And I would say my friends in
the Library of Congress finally,

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:50.300
the most important
lesson I learned here

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.830
which I hope I address
adequately for your sake

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:57.730
in my book is the importance
of never ever looking

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:01.080
at knowledge created by human
beings since society as extinct

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.680
and superseded, that
cultures can come and go

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:09.310
but no human knowledge is ever, is
ever extinct and it's never worthy

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:13.730
of being blown away or flushed
away or simply overwritten.

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:17.050
It's very important in the
digital world that we understand

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:21.710
that the faster a culture is ahead,
the more we actually need the past,

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:25.270
the ancient past in some cases to
help us struggle with the future

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.280
and I just give you
an example of that

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.300
without recovering the classical
learning that was mostly lost

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.480
from the Library of Alexandria

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.910
that we would never would
have had the Renaissance,

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:37.420
that we would never had
had the Reformation,

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.570
we would have the modern
era and it was simply

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:43.240
because in fact the Library of
Alexandria, although it was allowed

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.710
to dissipate never ever
actually totally disappeared.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:51.850
And so I think with that note I'll
say in mind there's nothing more,

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:54.380
there are no institutions
more important in this age

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.740 position:56%
than not just libraries, but
specifically the Library of Congress

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.590
which I think needs to
reexamine and redesign its role

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:05.170
in the digital world but I think
will be far more significant

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:08.440
as everybody its struggle dealing
with digital memory personal

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.500
and we'll look here first for some
guidance and how to think about it,

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.680
not just in policy issues
but also personally.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.520
So I want to thank
you all very much.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.100
And I know I've talked
for quite a while

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.510
and I'm eager to hear
your questions.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:27.510
[ Applause ]

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:34.040
[ Silence ]

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.900
Yes here's a question
in the back now, mm-hm.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:42.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Do you want to say anything about
a role that copyright will play

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:48.580
in assisting the preservation
from cultural heritage?

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.620
&gt;&gt; Abby Smith Rumsey: The question
is what role could copyright play

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.830
in assisting cultural heritage
preservation right, digital.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:59.110
Well it could actually if we had
some robust digitally friendly

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:00.410
copyright laws.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.720
Although I'll have to say and you
know, I mean I was involved in some

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.170
of this work with ended
as many of you may know

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.990
and it did look seriously
at making recommendations,

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:12.980
did make recommendations
for the copyright office

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.580
to updating the copyright
law for the digital age

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:22.140
and I've actually come to the
cautious conclusion and I'm sorry

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.070
to say this in this
company in some ways.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:28.700 position:56%
But I actually wonder if copyright
is any longer the most effective way

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.600
to ensuring that things get
deposited to a central location

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.330
like the Library of
Congress and then become,

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:37.680
the Library of Congress
become the sole institution

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.870
which I can actually take
responsibility for preserving this.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:42.570
At least in the UK there
is a distributed copyright

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:43.990
deposited system.

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:48.730
But I think because the copyright
has been so, lagging so far behind

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:52.880
in the digital age, the
people simply develop new ways

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.180
to get around it.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.930
It wasn't working and so
people now just, well you know,

00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:58.960
publishers actually
don't sell anything

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:03.570
and they don't allow copyright
in some ways to be invoked

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:08.470
because they license materials and
that seems to be working very well

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.780
as a business model for
many, for many publishers.

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.880
So I actually, I have to admit

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.730
that I don't know the
answer to that question.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:19.590
I really don't know how
copyright can serve as direct,

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:25.600
a salvation role shall we
say in cultural preservation,

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.610
because we will not be
saving physical objects,

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.690
you know we won't be able to
acquire an object and keep it safe

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:34.370
for a long period of time and
then look at it in 50 years.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:37.880
We have to also have the code and a
lot of things which are not covered

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.180
by copyright law in terms

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:45.470
of proprietary issues
but there's always hope.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:46.770
Yes.

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:50.860
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering what groups are
out there today that are trying

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:57.380
to perhaps interact with Library
of Congress or government agencies

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:00.590
to preserve the digital
information [inaudible]?

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.190
&gt;&gt; Abby Smith Rumsey: The question
was what are the groups out there

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.470
that are working with the Library
of Congress and government agencies

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:09.330
on extending the life of
digital information shall we say.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:13.780
Well I certainly know that, that
well I think it is reasonable

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.850 position:56%
to assume that there are two sectors
that have solved a large number

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:21.430
of problems that we in the
cultural area aspire to solve

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.420
and those would be first
the commercial sector

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:28.730
and we will be talking about the
technology bohemists like Amazon

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:33.910
and Apple and Google whose
[inaudible] is the use

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.210
of digital data.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:39.250
So they're very interested in
reusing data and reuse of data,

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:41.270
securing reuse of data
is the first step

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:44.220
in long-term preservation
in the digital world.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:48.850
The other group which I don't know
anything about, if anybody want

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:52.100
to enlighten me is of course
our national security agencies,

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.460
they also and the DOD.

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:57.340
And you said which government
agencies have been working

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.950
with the Library of Congress
and I'd say well I don't know

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.820
which ones have been working
with the Library of Congress.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.440
But there are, I do think
that and I can't say this

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:11.770
about National Security, but I
can say in my limited observations

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:18.540
of the technology sector is that if
consumers demand certain services

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:23.250 position:56%
from Facebook and Google and Apple,
they will be met more than half way.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:26.930
When consumers first
realized the privacy settings

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:29.760
in Facebook actually
weren't very private at all,

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.330 position:56%
they demanded that they be
modified and Facebook modified them.

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:36.570
I think you know, consumers
will always be one step behind,

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:41.110
but I just, I do think that
there are, there's reason to hope

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.650
that Amazon, Apple and Google,
well probably not Google but Amazon

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:47.830
and Apple are working
very strenuously

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:52.880
on developing consumer based
digital preservation solutions

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.710
so there would be just
like they have you know,

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.580
solutions for buying
music and buying books.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:02.340
You'll be able to do more than
just rent space on Amazon cloud.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.280
You will be able actually

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.680
to have very tailor made
digital archiving programs.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.380
But I don't know very much
more than people are working

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.960
on it at the consumer level.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.260
Yes Carl.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.800
&gt;&gt; Well I've mentioned in
the same breath in addition

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.320
to the ones you've
ticked off, science

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:26.350 position:56%
and the science related domains that
there's a tremendous amount going

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:29.400
on with weather data,
astronomical data and so

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:35.090
on that it's seemingly being
managed and curated and preserved.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:36.960
&gt;&gt; Abby Smith Rumsey: Right, Carl
was just pointing out the fact

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.440
that a lot of the weather data

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:42.850
and scientific data is seemingly
being managed and preserved.

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:47.550
And if fact we did when I was on
a NSF task force there was a fair,

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:50.870
it was a while ago but there
were, it's pretty clear

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:53.250
that they understand it's an
urgent issue and there are a lot

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.880
of problems that they haven't
solved, but they are endeavoring

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.990
to get money from the government
to solve them [inaudible] Carl.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.620
Yes.

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:12.080
&gt;&gt; Again I, when I ask questions
I always have to say I'm not

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:20.640
from the United States, I'm
from the Caribbean so I'm

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:27.710
from a different part of
the world which you know.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:32.920
And one of the big
problems that break away

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.390
from us obviously [inaudible]
is that in Africa,

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:41.600
in the Caribbean it's
a little bit different,

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:50.120
the Caribbean is second rate,
second you know but since we're

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.820
in America lots of places,
Latin American and Asia,

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:58.180
a lots this digitalization

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:03.890
at the same time tremendous
societal changes taking place

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:05.190
in oral based cultures.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:09.660
I mean you can decide
the fact that you know,

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:14.760
we need to remember the past to
be able to navigate the future.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.940
If this oral based culture is
[inaudible] I mean I see it even

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:26.720
in my [inaudible], you go to ask
Google about a name of a person

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:33.640
and click and no one
remembers the person, the,

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:38.950
the person just disappeared in
this kind of memory hole right.

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:43.470
So that's the first
thing, the second thing

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:48.590 position:56%
if it's a big problem then what kind

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:55.080
of memory is being
remembered here right.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.290
Mostly memory of so
called [inaudible] but all

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:08.910
of its [inaudible] right is
being, not fully remembered

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:11.110
but mostly remembered
right which [inaudible]

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:15.700 position:56%
and the third I think most important
thing we didn't talk about here

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:20.420
but I think others are touching
on is how do we keep memory alive

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.240
and keep memory vibrant even in a
digital sense when memory is based

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.860
on the essence of a whole
set of [inaudible] breaking

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.920
down at a horrific speed
and the realization

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:36.640
and the optimization of
the individual right.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.030
How does this play in role
in this entire creation

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.640
because I think it
complicates [inaudible]?

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.940
&gt;&gt; Abby Smith Rumsey:
Yeah you're right.

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.390
And let me just summarize
if I might,

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:48.900
certainly two points I can address,
one I'm not sure I can address.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:53.850
The first is about the loss of
oral culture and what happens

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:55.150
to that in the digital age.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:52:00.670
And I might say oral culture has
been lost in the print age too.

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:03.980 position:56%
And the second is how do we actually
think about a collective memory,

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:08.280
is that what you're saying because
of the atomization of society

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:13.250 position:56%
as such and it's very interesting to
me, because I actually gave a talk

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:18.280
at Google not too recent,
not too yeah fairly recently

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.550
and the audience was much younger

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:24.280
and they had an extremely
different set of experiences than

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.740
and perspective than this audience.

00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.200
And if fact they were,
they were very much saying

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.940
but you know the great
thing about the internet is

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.930
like I read this thing
about oral culture,

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:38.440
it's like we're reinstituting
an oral culture

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.640
where people tell each
other stories all the time.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.070
And we share things through
Instagram and Facebook.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:53.840
And so they actually wanted me
to talk about as an intellectual

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:58.180
about oral culture and the
shifts about the human psyche

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:03.160
and human community relations
when oral culture went to print

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.920
and so now they're saying but what

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:10.250
if print's actually
going something oral.

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:15.820
Because it is, the digital
is a femoral the way oral is

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:18.600
and it's filtered the
way that oral is.

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.290
So I've been thinking
a lot about that

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:22.510
and I think there's a lot too it.

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:24.620
And the second thing
is I would argue

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:30.280 position:56%
that whenever the world falls apart,
the world also comes together.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:34.900
I mean I think the world as
we now know it is fracturing,

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:39.520
but that doesn't mean that
it's going to remain fractured,

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.140
that it's simply realigning
itself in the way

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.560
that libraries are redefining
themselves that in fact people,

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:49.540
the urge for community actually
has been accelerated in the ability

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:53.190
to build communities, has
been rapidly accelerated

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:56.360
through these communication
technologies.

00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:00.020
I mean I call them memory
technologies because I'm interested

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.470
in you know, recorded history.

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:04.640
But in fact for most people these
things are like telephone calls.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.670
I mean they're actually
communication technologies

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:08.290
and through those they actually
are building very wide communities.

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:09.590
I think that the social
media are so successful,

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:10.890
because they enable
people to build communities

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.490
and to tailor communities and
to find like-minded people even

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:13.790
if they're physically distant.

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:15.090
So I would actually argue
that in fact although one set

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:16.390
of community organizations,
in my mind actually very much

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:17.860
around church are breaking down
in certain communities certainly

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.690
in the west, he said he's from St.
Martin so it might be different

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:20.990
in his, in the Caribbean.

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:22.290
But then in fact people
have a hunger for community

00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:23.590
and they're just one reason why
young people love this technology

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:24.890
so much is because they get to
create their own communities

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:26.410
and they glom on to it and they
don't care whether we approve

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:27.710
of it or not.

00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:29.010
Well that's a part of
being young I suppose.

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:30.310
So I'm actually quite optimistic
about that and I look forward

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:31.610
to actually following the emergence
or the redefinition of orality

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:32.910
as a kind of cultural
exchange through this medium.

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:34.210
Are there other question, comments?

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:35.510
Okay I want to thank
you all very much.

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:36.810
And I want to say a word before we
break about how really happy I am

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:38.110
to be able to thank John Cole
for everything that he's done.

00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:39.490
In some ways John is responsible
for at least the good parts

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:40.790
in this book, because if it weren't

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.090
for John I would never actually
have been hired and allowed to stay

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:43.720
on the Library of Congress and
John was the one who kept me

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:45.280
at the Library stubbornly you
know, contract after contract

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.580
until I landed a position here.

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:47.880
And so I want to thank you
personally and deeply John

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.180
for all that you've done for me.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.980
Thank you all for coming.

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:57.210
[ Applause ]

00:54:57.210 --> 00:55:00.470
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well thank you Abby,
that was not the part of the deal.

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:05.110
But I do have a story about the
picture that Abby showed in the 19,

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:09.770
the 1897 building of
everything on the floor.

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:14.310
That picture first appeared
in my first chronology

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.740
which was published in 1978.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.880
And the only reason it
was allowed to appear was,

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.560 position:56%
I didn't tell the publishing officer

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.690
that the communications officers
said never use that picture

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:31.060
and never allow it to be published
until suddenly there it is.

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.600
It's good to see that again.

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.860
So communication does
[inaudible] in every way.

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:42.020
Well Abby that was a wonderful talk
and I really, I want you to know

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.230
that Abby's book is
getting wonderful reviews.

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:49.070
And we're very pleased to
be, that she told us about it

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:52.750
and that she is here today,
so we're previewing this

00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:55.120
with the Library of Congress staff.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.530 position:56%
You can buy a copy if there are a
few left and it looks like there are

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:03.220
at the Library of Congress
discount and get her to sign it

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:08.950 position:56%
and let me offer our congratulations
to Abby on the learning the lesson

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:14.850
so well here and being able to
articulate them on our behalf just

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:17.450
in the way we liked to be
put forward into the world

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:21.370
and for her wonderful words about
the Library of Congress itself.

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:24.510
Let's give Abby Smith Rumsey
another round of applause.

00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:28.060
[ Applause ]

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:31.700

of Library of Congress.
