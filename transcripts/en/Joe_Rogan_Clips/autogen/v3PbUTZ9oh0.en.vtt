gene-culture co-evolution and the idea
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.610
gene-culture co-evolution and the idea
is that we create certain kinds of

is that we create certain kinds of
cultural environments those kind of

about half the world can adults can

about half the world can adults can
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.450
about half the world can adults can
drink milk the other half cannot they

drink milk the other half cannot they
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.660
drink milk the other half cannot they
get lactose-intolerant well why can you

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
get lactose-intolerant well why can you
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.880
get lactose-intolerant well why can you
drink milk as an adult have you ever

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
drink milk as an adult have you ever
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.380
drink milk as an adult have you ever
thought about that like why why are you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
thought about that like why why are you
 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.540

capable of drinking milk as an adult in

about 10,000 years ago only babies could

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
about 10,000 years ago only babies could
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.840
about 10,000 years ago only babies could
do driven to digest milk because only

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
do driven to digest milk because only
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150
do driven to digest milk because only
babies had milk babies would suckle at

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
babies had milk babies would suckle at
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.410
babies had milk babies would suckle at
their mother's breasts and have milk and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
their mother's breasts and have milk and
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.090
their mother's breasts and have milk and
then they'd be weaned and then they

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
then they'd be weaned and then they
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.770
then they'd be weaned and then they
would never drink milk again there'd be

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
would never drink milk again there'd be
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.959
would never drink milk again there'd be
no milk to drink there was therefore no

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
no milk to drink there was therefore no
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.850
no milk to drink there was therefore no
reason for any adult to be able to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
reason for any adult to be able to
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.890
reason for any adult to be able to
digest lactose which is the principle

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
digest lactose which is the principle
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320
digest lactose which is the principle
sugar in milk because there was no

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
sugar in milk because there was no
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.969

lactose in your diet you didn't

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
lactose in your diet you didn't
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.310
lactose in your diet you didn't
encounter milk so human beings were able

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
encounter milk so human beings were able
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.870
encounter milk so human beings were able
to digest lactose when they were babies

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
to digest lactose when they were babies
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.390
to digest lactose when they were babies
they lost that capacity all human beings

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
they lost that capacity all human beings
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.340
they lost that capacity all human beings
when they got to about two or three or

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
when they got to about two or three or
 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.600
when they got to about two or three or
four or five when they weaned they no

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
four or five when they weaned they no
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.980
four or five when they weaned they no
longer were able to just milk so the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
longer were able to just milk so the
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.600
longer were able to just milk so the
enzymes in their body were programmed as

suddenly domesticate animals we
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.270
suddenly domesticate animals we
domesticate milk producing animals like

and now all of a sudden there's a supply

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
and now all of a sudden there's a supply
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.899
and now all of a sudden there's a supply
of milk around us because of our

drink milk like we could
and we had a source of unspoiled water

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080
and we had a source of unspoiled water
 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.320

turns out that this has happened several

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
turns out that this has happened several
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.040
turns out that this has happened several
times this has been well documented the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050
times this has been well documented the
 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.240

doesn't stop with cows I think that when

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710
doesn't stop with cows I think that when
 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.120
doesn't stop with cows I think that when
we invent cities about over 5,000 years

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130
we invent cities about over 5,000 years
 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.310
we invent cities about over 5,000 years
ago we so we did we invent agriculture

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320
ago we so we did we invent agriculture
 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.230
ago we so we did we invent agriculture
about 10,000 years ago it's debated

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240
about 10,000 years ago it's debated
 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.400
about 10,000 years ago it's debated
exactly when we invent cities but

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410
exactly when we invent cities but
 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.570
exactly when we invent cities but
between five and ten thousand years ago

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580
between five and ten thousand years ago
 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.980
between five and ten thousand years ago
we start having fixed settlements

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990
we start having fixed settlements
 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.300
we start having fixed settlements
earlier you and I were talking about

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310
earlier you and I were talking about
 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.800
earlier you and I were talking about
population density and having to live

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810
population density and having to live
 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.300
population density and having to live
with other people which is not our

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310
with other people which is not our
 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.430

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.720

other we always lived as a group

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730
other we always lived as a group
 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.210
other we always lived as a group
socially I think that as we invent

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220
socially I think that as we invent
 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.610
socially I think that as we invent
cities people with different kinds of

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620
cities people with different kinds of
 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.320
cities people with different kinds of
brains are better able to survive in

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330
brains are better able to survive in
 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.110
brains are better able to survive in
cities so now that we've invented cities

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120
cities so now that we've invented cities
 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.090
