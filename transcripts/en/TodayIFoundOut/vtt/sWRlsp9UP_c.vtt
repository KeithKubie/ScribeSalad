00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:41.710
Although 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.520
many describe shoddy workmanship or a hasty,
temporary repair as jerry-rigged, in its original

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.110
incarnation, the term was actually jury-rigged.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.380
While jury as a noun meaning a group of peers
that decide the outcome of a legal proceeding

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.480
has been in use English since the early 14th
century, by the early 17th century, sailors

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.259
had taken to using jury as an adjective that
meant temporary / hastily contrived, first

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.490
referring to jury-masts.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.490
It is unclear why, however, and unfortunately
all we have are speculative hypotheses with

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.640
nothing in the way of evidence backing them
up.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.700
One such hypothesis is that French speaking
sailors had been describing their quick repairs

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.060
as ajurie, which meant help or relief, and
English speakers mistakenly assumed they were

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.460
saying jury.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.799
Perhaps slightly more plausible is that it
was originally joury mast, meaning “day

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.200
mast” (from the French “jour” meaning
“a day”)- essentially a temporary mast

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.869
meant to only last a short while.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.271
Yet another speculative hypothesis is that
the term came about because it took a jury

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:49.079
of sailors to put their heads together to
come up with a way to create a usable make-shift

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.079
mast.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.909
Whatever the case, sailors were calling the
temporary masts they rigged up to replace

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.009
those lost in storms as jury-masts from at
least the early 17th century, with the term

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.189
first appearing in Captain John Smith’s
1616 work A Description of New-England, “We

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.670
had reaccommodated her a Iury mast, and the
rest, to returne for Plimouth.”

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.891
He later used the term again in his The General
History of Virginia, New-England, and the

00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.340
Summer Isles, published in 1624.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.930
Captain Smith’s 1627 Seaman’s Grammar
also explicitly gives us a proper definition,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.730
A Iury Mast, that is, when a Mast is borne
by the boord, with Yards, Roofes, Trees, or

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.069
what they can, spliced or fished together
they make a Iury-mast.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.870
By the middle of the 17th century, jury was
being appended to a variety of other words

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.129
to describe something hastily put together,
as well as to give a humorous connotation,

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.290
such as this from Third Advice (1667):

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.830
Guard thy Posterior least all be gone, Though
Jury-Masts, tho’hast Jury-buttocks none.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.440
As for the exact expression in question, jury-rigged
first appeared in 1788 in Newte’s A Tour

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.620
in England &amp; Scotland with “ships to be
jury rigged; that is, to have smaller masts

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.439
. . . than would be required for actual service.”

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.640
As for jerry-rigging, it may be that jury
morphed into jerry via people just thinking

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.910
that’s what the expression was, though this
isn’t clear.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.870
Jerry-X first popped up around 1856 in the
form of jerry-built, more or less meaning

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.510
“built of poor quality materials.”

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.400
A decade or so later, the variant jerrry-builder
made its debut to describe the makers of such

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.400
product.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.849
In nearly all of these terms’ earliest usages,
they were referring to poorly constructed

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.620
homes or buildings.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.410
For instance, in the 1881 work Every Man his
own Mechanic:”It is unfortunately too often

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.079
the habit of builders—or rather jerry builders—to
use the worst possible description of bricks.”

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.319
Unfortunately for connecting the dots, there
was not any associated jury-built term known

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.980
at this time, meaning it’s possible jerry-built
rose up independently.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.159
It’s also worth noting that jerry-built
and jury-rig have slightly different connotations-

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.700
the former meaning something was purposefully
built of poor quality materials and the latter

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.400
meaning something poorly built out of necessity
in a pinch.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.069
Given the lack of a clear etymology on this,
speculative origins abound.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.889
Some hypothesize jerry in this sense may have
devolved from a weak and unlikable character

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.670
in the play The Mayor of Garratt (1820) whom
the author, Samuel Foote, named Jerry Sneak.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.150
Another hypothesis is that it’s a shortened
version of “Jericho.”

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.310
Perhaps the leading hypothesis is that there
was some building company that included the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.810
name Jerry in their business name and did
shoddy work.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.600
In this case, it’s possibly the previous
similar sounding jury-x terms then inspired

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.320
the ironic connection to the name Jerry in
the company name.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.130
However, as with the ultimate root of “jury-mast,”
these hypotheses are pure speculation with

00:04:49.130 --> 00:05:26.210
no hard evidence backing 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:06:13.970
them up.
