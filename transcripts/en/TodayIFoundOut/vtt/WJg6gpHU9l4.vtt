00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.650
The word “jumbo” can roughly be understood
to mean “a large specimen of its kind”

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.570
and it’s often posited that the word entered
the English language thanks to an elephant.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.570
While this is certainly a nice story, the
truth is a little more complicated.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.349
First things first, though etymologists are
in agreement that the word “jumbo” in

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.680
specific reference to something that is quite
big was popularised by an African bull elephant

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.370
called Jumbo, there is evidence that the word
existed long before he was even born.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.350
In the latter half of the 19th century, Jumbo
the elephant was arguably one of the most

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.220
famous animals on Earth.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.199
Throughout his life as a zoo attraction and
later a circus performer, he is estimated

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.629
to have been seen by several million people.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.170
While nobody is exactly sure when Jumbo was
born, it’s believed that he was captured

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.649
as a young calf in 1860 somewhere in East
Africa after his mother was shot by hunters.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.789
In 1862, after travelling hundreds of miles
on foot and by boat, Jumbo was sold to a large

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.100
botanical garden in France called the Jardin
des Plantes.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.140
Jumbo’s life at the Jardin des Plantes was
reportedly not so great; along with awful

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.560
conditions, Jumbo was constantly overshadowed
by the garden’s two other elephant attractions,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.049
Castor and Pollux (who are themselves famous
for being eaten during the 1870 Siege of Paris).

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.969
In 1865, Jumbo was sold to the London Zoo
after years of negotiations spear-headed by

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.039
the zoo’s Superintendent, Abraham Bartlett.

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.700
Bartlett had supposedly been very annoyed
to learn that the French had managed to get

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.950
their hands on the first African elephant
specimen to set foot in Europe; so much so

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.500
that he eventually agreed to send the Jardin
des Plantes the following list of animals

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.450
in return for the calf:“A rhino, a jackal,
two eagles, a pair of dingoes, a possum and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.000
a kangaroo”.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.799
When the young elephant finally arrived in
London, Bartlett immediately recognised that

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.020
it had been poorly looked after and handed
its care off to his most talented zoo-keeper,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.020
Matthew Scott.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.820
Scott, who was noted as having a knack for
understanding animals, quickly bonded with

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.120
the elephant and under his expert care, Jumbo
eventually grew to become one of the largest

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.260
elephants the world has ever known, standing
at an impressive 12 feet tall in his prime

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.760
(later advertised as over 13 ft. tall).

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.550
Jumbo’s massive size and gentle temperament
eventually led to him being bought by legendary

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.290
circus owner, P.T Barnum in 1882.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.769
The sale of Jumbo caused a considerable stir
in England and the London Zoo was heavily

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.739
criticised by the public for daring to sell
him.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.120
You see, during his time at the London Zoo,
Jumbo had become quite a celebrity and boasted

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.180
such high-profile fans as Queen Victoria,
who personally petitioned the zoo not to sell

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.180
him.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.590
The zoo, however, were worried about Jumbo
entering what is known as “musth“, a condition

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.019
that can affect bull elephants resulting in
an increased production of testosterone and

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.260
unpredictable, violent behaviour.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.760
Jumbo’s sheer size meant that if he entered
musth, he could have quite literally destroyed

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.189
the entire zoo if he felt like it.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.760
He had proven before that he was more than
capable of destroying the doors to his cage

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.460
and the chains that were supposed to hold
him in place; so the zoo decided that it simply

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.970
wasn’t worth the risk.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.180
Once he got to America, Jumbo’s arrival
was milked for all it was worth by Barnum

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.790
who had his image emblazoned on everything
he could find.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.629
Jumbo proved to be one of the most popular
attractions at Barnum’s zoo and he was billed

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.090
by the entrepreneur as “The biggest elephant
in the world“.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.180
Sadly, just 3 years later, Jumbo was killed
after being struck by a train and dragged

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.829
along for about 300 feet before the train
came to a stop.

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.750
Reportedly, as he was taking his dying breaths,
he used his trunk to hold the hand of his

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.930
long-time trainer.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.110
Ever the showman, expert marketer, and businessman,
Barnum had Jumbo’s remains preserved and

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.110
toured with them for many years.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.110
Back to the topic at hand.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.409
While it’s true that Jumbo was a humongous
specimen, even by elephant standards, and

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.159
also that after his death his name came to
be synonymous with anything large, the word

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.220
jumbo existed long before he did.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.689
As early as 1823, the word “jumbo” was
a slang term used to describe: “a big, clumsy

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.489
person, animal or thing.”

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.470
Unfortunately, we’re unable to trace the
meaning back much further than that because

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.560
it originated in slang speech, which is so
often notoriously poorly documented.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:38.150
One origin theory posited by a slang dictionary
published in 1823, with possibly the longest

00:04:38.150 --> 00:05:08.050
title of any dictionary in history (80 words),
is

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:16.440
that it perhaps derived from the phrase “mumbo-jumbo”.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.639
Mumbo-jumbo, which many of you will likely
understand as a synonym for something that

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.410
is meaningless or intentionally convoluted
and confusing, derives, according to the Oxford

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.419
English Dictionary, from “the name of a
grotesque idol said to have been worshipped

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.660
by some tribes,” often claimed to have been
called Maamajomboo.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.080
It’s believed the word was adopted by the
English language during the 18th century and

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.509
that it may have been used as a derogatory
term to refer to the so-called “incomprehensible”

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.530
languages used by Africans.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.870
How the singular word “jumbo” came to
be derived from this phrase isn’t precisely

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.180
known.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.630
As for how Jumbo the elephant got his name
in the first place, this is similarly not

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.630
known.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.919
One theory is that Jumbo was given his name
by Abraham Bartlett who reportedly just liked

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.500
the sound of the word, evidenced by the fact
that he once called a gorilla “mumbo”.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.270
Another theory is that it was actually Jumbo’s
trainer and handler, Matthew Scott, who named

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:16.080
him “Jumbo” after the slang term because
of his clumsy gait and heavy-set frame.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.750
Despite his huge size, Jumbo was a remarkably
calm elephant as long as his trainer was around

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.770
and he was known to have given thousands of
children rides on his back throughout his

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.770
life.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.389
Matthew Scott and Jumbo shared a very close
relationship throughout their time together

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.620
and Jumbo would reportedly throw tantrums
whenever Scott went home.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.500
When Jumbo was bought by P.T Barnum, Scott
was hired to be his keeper simply because

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.850
he was the only one Jumbo would listen to.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.340
Abraham Bartlett was so terrified at the thought
of Jumbo going on a rampage if something happened

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.130
to Scott that he wrote a letter to the Zoological
Society asking for them to provide him with

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.380
a method of killing Jumbo if Scott was ever
injured.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.210
As mentioned, reportedly as Jumbo was taking
his dying breaths, he used his trunk to hold

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.160
the hand of Scott.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.780
According to Matthew Scott, he would share
a bottle of beer with Jumbo every night.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.789
Scott claimed one night when he drank the
bottle himself and promptly fell asleep before

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:11.490
giving Jumbo his share, Jumbo gently lifted
Scott out of bed with his trunk and put him

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.789
on the floor in front of him.

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:40.990
When Scott woke up, he realised his mistake
and promptly got Jumbo a fresh beer.
