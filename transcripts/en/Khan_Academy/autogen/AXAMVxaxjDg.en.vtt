00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.910
 
and the last video in exponential

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920
and the last video in exponential
 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.760
and the last video in exponential
functions we saw that functions of the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770
functions we saw that functions of the
 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.160
functions we saw that functions of the
form y is equal to some number to the X

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170
form y is equal to some number to the X
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.470
form y is equal to some number to the X
say Y is equal to 3x was what we used in

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480
say Y is equal to 3x was what we used in
 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.839
say Y is equal to 3x was what we used in
the last video we saw that these grow

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849
the last video we saw that these grow
 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.530
the last video we saw that these grow
very very very quickly so the shape of

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
very very very quickly so the shape of
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.750
very very very quickly so the shape of
the graph that we got in the last video

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
the graph that we got in the last video
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.269
the graph that we got in the last video
looks something like this it looked

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
looks something like this it looked
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.950
looks something like this it looked
something like this gets very close to 0

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
something like this gets very close to 0
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.269
something like this gets very close to 0
slowly approaches away from 0 and then

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279
slowly approaches away from 0 and then
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.189
slowly approaches away from 0 and then
BAM starts to explode and this of course

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
BAM starts to explode and this of course
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500
BAM starts to explode and this of course
is when X is equal to 0 so the y

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
is when X is equal to 0 so the y
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.109
is when X is equal to 0 so the y
intercept there is y is equal to 1 but

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119
intercept there is y is equal to 1 but
 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.279
intercept there is y is equal to 1 but
the important thing is it just grows

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289
the important thing is it just grows
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.430
the important thing is it just grows
super fast but this was the case where

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
super fast but this was the case where
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.910
super fast but this was the case where
the base in the exponential function is

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920
the base in the exponential function is
 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.369
the base in the exponential function is
greater than 1 you know here it's 3 if

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
greater than 1 you know here it's 3 if
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.080
greater than 1 you know here it's 3 if
it's 2 it'll still grow quickly if it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
it's 2 it'll still grow quickly if it
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.049
it's 2 it'll still grow quickly if it
was Ted it would grow even faster what I

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
was Ted it would grow even faster what I
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.400
was Ted it would grow even faster what I
want to talk a little bit about in this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
want to talk a little bit about in this
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.260
want to talk a little bit about in this
video and really just introduce you to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
video and really just introduce you to
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.510
video and really just introduce you to
the idea is the notion of an exponential

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
the idea is the notion of an exponential
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.990
the idea is the notion of an exponential
decay function so this is an exponential

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
decay function so this is an exponential
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.709
decay function so this is an exponential
growth function an exponential decay

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
growth function an exponential decay
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.560
growth function an exponential decay
function has essentially as its base a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
function has essentially as its base a
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.500
function has essentially as its base a
number less than 1 so an example of an

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
number less than 1 so an example of an
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450
number less than 1 so an example of an
exponential decay function would be y is

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
exponential decay function would be y is
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.940
exponential decay function would be y is
equal to 1/3 to the X power this would

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
equal to 1/3 to the X power this would
 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.090
equal to 1/3 to the X power this would
be exponential exponential decay and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
be exponential exponential decay and
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.280
be exponential exponential decay and
notice another way I could write this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
notice another way I could write this
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.399
notice another way I could write this
1/3 is the same thing as 3 to the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
1/3 is the same thing as 3 to the
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.499
1/3 is the same thing as 3 to the
negative 1 so it's 3 to the negative 1

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509
negative 1 so it's 3 to the negative 1
 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.380
negative 1 so it's 3 to the negative 1
to the X power I could also write this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
to the X power I could also write this
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.069
to the X power I could also write this
as 3 to the negative x power this and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
as 3 to the negative x power this and
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.380
as 3 to the negative x power this and
this are equivalent and that's another

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
this are equivalent and that's another
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.520
this are equivalent and that's another
interesting way to think about

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
interesting way to think about
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.590
interesting way to think about
exponential decay functions it could

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
exponential decay functions it could
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.690
exponential decay functions it could
either be kind of a standard positive

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
either be kind of a standard positive
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090
either be kind of a standard positive
exponent with a base that's less than 1

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
exponent with a base that's less than 1
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.609
exponent with a base that's less than 1
or you could have a base larger than 1

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
or you could have a base larger than 1
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.800
or you could have a base larger than 1
but you're going to have a negative x as

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
but you're going to have a negative x as
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.139
but you're going to have a negative x as
the exponent but let's plot this just to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
the exponent but let's plot this just to
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.120
the exponent but let's plot this just to
get the general shape and the shape will

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
get the general shape and the shape will
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.710
get the general shape and the shape will
always be consistent I'm going to do it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
always be consistent I'm going to do it
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.230
always be consistent I'm going to do it
for one-third but it's going to have a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
for one-third but it's going to have a
 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.139
for one-third but it's going to have a
similar shape for 1/2 or for 1/10 or for

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
similar shape for 1/2 or for 1/10 or for
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.469
similar shape for 1/2 or for 1/10 or for
1/100 it'll just be scaled up or down so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
1/100 it'll just be scaled up or down so
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.810
1/100 it'll just be scaled up or down so
let's plot a few so let's have some X

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
let's plot a few so let's have some X
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.249
let's plot a few so let's have some X
values and let's have some Y values so

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259
values and let's have some Y values so
 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.830
values and let's have some Y values so
let's say let's start with some small

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
let's say let's start with some small
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.050
let's say let's start with some small
values so let's say that X is equal to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060
values so let's say that X is equal to
 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.830
values so let's say that X is equal to
negative

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
negative
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.420
negative
three well what is 1/3 to the negative

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430
three well what is 1/3 to the negative
 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.750
three well what is 1/3 to the negative
three power that's the same 1/3 to the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
three power that's the same 1/3 to the
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.630
three power that's the same 1/3 to the
negative 3 that's the same thing as 3 to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640
negative 3 that's the same thing as 3 to
 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.559
negative 3 that's the same thing as 3 to
the third power which is equal to 81

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569
the third power which is equal to 81
 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.610
the third power which is equal to 81
let's do another point what about

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
let's do another point what about
 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.210
let's do another point what about
negative 2 1/3 to the negative 2 power

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
negative 2 1/3 to the negative 2 power
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.960
negative 2 1/3 to the negative 2 power
is the same thing as 1 over sorry is

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
is the same thing as 1 over sorry is
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.080
is the same thing as 1 over sorry is
it's equal to 1 over 1/3 squared which

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090
it's equal to 1 over 1/3 squared which
 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.839
it's equal to 1 over 1/3 squared which
is the same thing as 3 squared you just

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849
is the same thing as 3 squared you just
 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.729
is the same thing as 3 squared you just
take the inverse of the number get rid

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739
take the inverse of the number get rid
 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.059
take the inverse of the number get rid
of the negative and that is equal to

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069
of the negative and that is equal to
 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.710
of the negative and that is equal to
equal to 9 oh I got this one wrong up

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
equal to 9 oh I got this one wrong up
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.380
equal to 9 oh I got this one wrong up
here 3 cubed isn't 81 that's 3 to the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390
here 3 cubed isn't 81 that's 3 to the
 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.479
here 3 cubed isn't 81 that's 3 to the
4th 3 times 3 times 3 is 27 27 my brain

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489
4th 3 times 3 times 3 is 27 27 my brain
 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.900
4th 3 times 3 times 3 is 27 27 my brain
is malfunctioning what about when X is

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
is malfunctioning what about when X is
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.170
is malfunctioning what about when X is
equal to negative 1 then you have 1 3 to

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
equal to negative 1 then you have 1 3 to
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.420
equal to negative 1 then you have 1 3 to
the negative 1 power 1 3 to the negative

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430
the negative 1 power 1 3 to the negative
 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.170
the negative 1 power 1 3 to the negative
1 which is just 3 what about when X is

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
1 which is just 3 what about when X is
 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.640
1 which is just 3 what about when X is
equal to 0 when X is equal to 0 remember

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650
equal to 0 when X is equal to 0 remember
 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.420
equal to 0 when X is equal to 0 remember
anything to the zeroth power is 1 and

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430
anything to the zeroth power is 1 and
 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.890
anything to the zeroth power is 1 and
then let's go to a couple of larger

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900
then let's go to a couple of larger
 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.500
then let's go to a couple of larger
numbers when X is equal to 1 what is y

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510
numbers when X is equal to 1 what is y
 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.490
numbers when X is equal to 1 what is y
1/3 to the 1 power is 1/3 let's do one

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500
1/3 to the 1 power is 1/3 let's do one
 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.839
1/3 to the 1 power is 1/3 let's do one
more when X is equal to 2 we have 1/3

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849
more when X is equal to 2 we have 1/3
 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.509
more when X is equal to 2 we have 1/3
squared which is 1/9 so let's plot this

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519
squared which is 1/9 so let's plot this
 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.410
squared which is 1/9 so let's plot this
exponential decay function right here I

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420
exponential decay function right here I
 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.699
exponential decay function right here I
want to draw it reasonably neatly

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709
 
 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.199
 
reasonably neatly and all of these

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209
reasonably neatly and all of these
 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.879
reasonably neatly and all of these
values once again are positive because

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889
values once again are positive because
 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.650
values once again are positive because
our base was positive so it looks like

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660
our base was positive so it looks like
 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.879
our base was positive so it looks like
that will start so let me go so let's

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889
that will start so let me go so let's
 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:02.270
that will start so let me go so let's
say that this is 10 20 30 and let's

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
say that this is 10 20 30 and let's
 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.729
say that this is 10 20 30 and let's
start at negative 3 negative 2 negative

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739
start at negative 3 negative 2 negative
 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:14.240
start at negative 3 negative 2 negative
1 0 1 2 so when X was negative 3 y was

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250
1 0 1 2 so when X was negative 3 y was
 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.060
1 0 1 2 so when X was negative 3 y was
27 when X was negative 3 y was 27 right

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070
27 when X was negative 3 y was 27 right
 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.779
27 when X was negative 3 y was 27 right
about there

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789
about there
 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.380
about there
when X was negative 2 y was 9 which is

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390
when X was negative 2 y was 9 which is
 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.740
when X was negative 2 y was 9 which is
right about there when X is negative 1 Y

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750
right about there when X is negative 1 Y
 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.270
right about there when X is negative 1 Y
is 3

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280
is 3
 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.529
is 3
right about there X 0 Y is 1 X is 1 Y is

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539
right about there X 0 Y is 1 X is 1 Y is
 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.520
right about there X 0 Y is 1 X is 1 Y is
1/3 and so we decline like this we

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530
1/3 and so we decline like this we
 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.850
1/3 and so we decline like this we
decline oh let me draw it a little bit

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860
decline oh let me draw it a little bit
 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.879
decline oh let me draw it a little bit
neater than that these the K functions

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889
neater than that these the K functions
 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.640
neater than that these the K functions
are harder for me to draw that's well

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650
are harder for me to draw that's well
 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.839
are harder for me to draw that's well
let me do it one more maybe I'll draw it

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849
let me do it one more maybe I'll draw it
 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:46.490
let me do it one more maybe I'll draw it
this way

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500
this way
 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.189
this way
draw it in reverse order now that's even

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199
draw it in reverse order now that's even
 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:50.580
draw it in reverse order now that's even
worse

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590
worse
 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.200
worse
one more shot I think you get the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210
one more shot I think you get the
 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.860
one more shot I think you get the
general idea that's my best shot right

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870
general idea that's my best shot right
 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.680
general idea that's my best shot right
there so you see a decay function it's

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690
there so you see a decay function it's
 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.170
there so you see a decay function it's
kind of reversed around the y axis we

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180
kind of reversed around the y axis we
 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.240
kind of reversed around the y axis we
start from a large quantity and we decay

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250

the doctor the population of bacteria is
 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.290
the doctor the population of bacteria is
2 million so at the start he's got 2

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300
2 million so at the start he's got 2

bacteria that reduces the bacteria to

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449
bacteria that reduces the bacteria to
 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.110
bacteria that reduces the bacteria to
one-fourth of its population each day or

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120
one-fourth of its population each day or
 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.909
one-fourth of its population each day or
that reduces the bacterial population to

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919
that reduces the bacterial population to
 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.790
that reduces the bacterial population to
one-fourth of its size each day so we

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800
one-fourth of its size each day so we
 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.070
one-fourth of its size each day so we
have the antibiotic anti biotic and it

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080
have the antibiotic anti biotic and it
 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.339
have the antibiotic anti biotic and it
cuts down the population so if on it

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349
cuts down the population so if on it
 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:23.629
cuts down the population so if on it
cuts down I guess we could say reduces

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639
cuts down I guess we could say reduces
 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:30.719
cuts down I guess we could say reduces
population to one-fourth of of I guess

things draw the graph of the size of the

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:42.839
things draw the graph of the size of the
 

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:44.329
things draw the graph of the size of the

against time in days so let's draw this

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580
against time in days so let's draw this
 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:57.019
against time in days so let's draw this
so day and then population population so

00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:57.029
so day and then population population so
 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:59.029
so day and then population population so
let's say on day 0 before you went to

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039
let's say on day 0 before you went to
 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.189
let's say on day 0 before you went to
the doctor your population is going to

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199
the doctor your population is going to
 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.749
the doctor your population is going to
be 2 million now on day 1 what happens

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759
be 2 million now on day 1 what happens
 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.839
be 2 million now on day 1 what happens
on day 1 you've taken their antibiotic

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849
on day 1 you've taken their antibiotic
 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:10.760
on day 1 you've taken their antibiotic
right the antibiotic is starting right

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770
right the antibiotic is starting right
 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.249
right the antibiotic is starting right
there so it reduces it to 1/4 of your

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259
there so it reduces it to 1/4 of your
 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:14.839
there so it reduces it to 1/4 of your
previous population so now your

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:14.849
previous population so now your
 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:18.019
previous population so now your
population is going to be 1/4 times 2

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:18.029
population is going to be 1/4 times 2
 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:23.989
population is going to be 1/4 times 2
million which is equal to what 500 equal

00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:23.999
million which is equal to what 500 equal
 

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:27.350
million which is equal to what 500 equal
to 500,000 then on day 2 what happens on

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360
to 500,000 then on day 2 what happens on
 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.079
to 500,000 then on day 2 what happens on
day 2 is going to be 1/4 of this it's

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:30.089
day 2 is going to be 1/4 of this it's
 

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:33.170
day 2 is going to be 1/4 of this it's
going to be 1/4 of your previous day 1/4

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180
going to be 1/4 of your previous day 1/4
 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.670
going to be 1/4 of your previous day 1/4
of 1/4 of your preview of that 2 million

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680
of 1/4 of your preview of that 2 million
 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.469
of 1/4 of your preview of that 2 million
of that 2 million so it's 1/4 of this

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479
of that 2 million so it's 1/4 of this
 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:47.179
of that 2 million so it's 1/4 of this
500,000 which is 125,000 I think you are

00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:47.189
500,000 which is 125,000 I think you are
 

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:48.679
500,000 which is 125,000 I think you are
starting to see the pattern that's

00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:48.689
starting to see the pattern that's
 

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:50.959
starting to see the pattern that's
emerging on day 3 what's it going to be

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:50.969
emerging on day 3 what's it going to be
 

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:53.299
emerging on day 3 what's it going to be
it's going to be 1/4 times this thing so

00:07:53.299 --> 00:07:53.309
it's going to be 1/4 times this thing so
 

00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:57.199
it's going to be 1/4 times this thing so
it's going to be 1/4 times this 1/4

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:57.209
it's going to be 1/4 times this 1/4
 

00:07:57.209 --> 00:08:03.129
it's going to be 1/4 times this 1/4
times 1/4 times 1/4 times 2 million

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:03.139
times 1/4 times 1/4 times 2 million
 

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:06.409
times 1/4 times 1/4 times 2 million
which is essentially 125,000 divided by

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:06.419
which is essentially 125,000 divided by
 

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:07.969
which is essentially 125,000 divided by
4 but the important thing is I want you

4 but the important thing is I want you
 

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:10.570
4 but the important thing is I want you
to see this pattern in general in

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:10.580
to see this pattern in general in
 

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.509
to see this pattern in general in

1/4 to the 0 of power right that's 1
 

00:08:42.449 --> 00:08:47.000
1/4 to the 0 of power right that's 1
so it's 1/4 to the nth power times our

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.010
so it's 1/4 to the nth power times our
 

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.010
so it's 1/4 to the nth power times our
starting population times 2

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:50.020
starting population times 2
 

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:55.200
starting population times 2
a million times 2 million and if we were

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.210
a million times 2 million and if we were
 

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.230
a million times 2 million and if we were
to graph it if we were to graph it using

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240
to graph it if we were to graph it using
 

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.790
to graph it if we were to graph it using
at least just the points that we have

00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800
at least just the points that we have
 

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.800
at least just the points that we have
here we're only going to be dealing with

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:01.810
here we're only going to be dealing with
 

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.580
here we're only going to be dealing with
positive X's so on day zero we start at

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:05.590
positive X's so on day zero we start at
 

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.340
positive X's so on day zero we start at
two million so let's let's say this is a

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:08.350
two million so let's let's say this is a
 

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.780
two million so let's let's say this is a
million so in day zero we're at two

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:09.790
million so in day zero we're at two
 

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.770
million so in day zero we're at two
million on day one on day one we're 1/4

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:13.780
million on day one on day one we're 1/4
 

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.280
million on day one on day one we're 1/4
of that so let's say that's 1 million so

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.290
of that so let's say that's 1 million so
 

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.000
of that so let's say that's 1 million so
then that is 500,000 on date two we're

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.010
then that is 500,000 on date two we're
 

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.770
then that is 500,000 on date two we're
1/4 of this so this is 250,000 that's

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:24.780
1/4 of this so this is 250,000 that's
 

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.050
1/4 of this so this is 250,000 that's
125,000 and then on day 3 we're 1/4 of

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:28.060
125,000 and then on day 3 we're 1/4 of
 

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.480
125,000 and then on day 3 we're 1/4 of
that so you see the population of our

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:30.490
that so you see the population of our
 

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.000
that so you see the population of our
bacteria really goes down very quickly

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.010
bacteria really goes down very quickly
 

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.580
bacteria really goes down very quickly
never gets quite to zero we're always

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:35.590
never gets quite to zero we're always
 

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.530
never gets quite to zero we're always
going to have some bacteria well

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:37.540
going to have some bacteria well
 

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.580
going to have some bacteria well
eventually you're gonna have one

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:38.590
eventually you're gonna have one
 

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.720
eventually you're gonna have one
bacteria and you're going to get the

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:39.730
bacteria and you're going to get the
 

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.310
bacteria and you're going to get the
antibiotic and it's going to have a 1/4

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.320
antibiotic and it's going to have a 1/4
 

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.380
antibiotic and it's going to have a 1/4
chance of hitting it so maybe eventually

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:43.390
chance of hitting it so maybe eventually
 

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.410
chance of hitting it so maybe eventually
you'll get to zero but it slowly gets to

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:46.420
you'll get to zero but it slowly gets to
 

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.290
you'll get to zero but it slowly gets to
zero but the absolute number decreases

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:49.300
zero but the absolute number decreases
 

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.760
zero but the absolute number decreases
very very fast now they're also asked us

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:53.770
very very fast now they're also asked us
 

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.860
very very fast now they're also asked us
find the size of the bacterial

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:55.870
find the size of the bacterial
 

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.920
find the size of the bacterial
population ten days after the drug was

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:58.930
population ten days after the drug was
 

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:05.610
population ten days after the drug was
first taken so after 10 days so that's

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:05.620
first taken so after 10 days so that's
 

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.380
first taken so after 10 days so that's
just n is equal to 10 so it's going to

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:07.390
just n is equal to 10 so it's going to
 

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.980
just n is equal to 10 so it's going to
be equal to 1/4 to the 10th power times

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:10.990
be equal to 1/4 to the 10th power times
 

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.950
be equal to 1/4 to the 10th power times
2 million now let's take our calculator

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:13.960
2 million now let's take our calculator
 

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:21.170
2 million now let's take our calculator
out to calculate this so let's take 1/4

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180
out to calculate this so let's take 1/4
 

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.840
out to calculate this so let's take 1/4
to the 10th power to the tenth power

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:24.850
to the 10th power to the tenth power
 

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.810
to the 10th power to the tenth power
that's equal to this very small number

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:27.820
that's equal to this very small number
 

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:34.020
that's equal to this very small number
times 2 million 1 2 3 1 2 3 is equal to

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.030
times 2 million 1 2 3 1 2 3 is equal to
 

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.320

we're only going to have 1.9 bacteria

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:37.330
we're only going to have 1.9 bacteria
 

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.990
we're only going to have 1.9 bacteria
after the tenth day so we're going to

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000
after the tenth day so we're going to
 

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.670
after the tenth day so we're going to
have this is going to be equal to one

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680
have this is going to be equal to one
 

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.050
have this is going to be equal to one
point nine bacteria so pretty much most

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:46.060
point nine bacteria so pretty much most
 

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.570
