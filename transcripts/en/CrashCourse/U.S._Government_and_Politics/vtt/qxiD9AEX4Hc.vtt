Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today we're going to talk

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.440
about what is, if you ask the general public,
the most important part of politics: elections.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.280
If you ask me, it's hair styles.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.620
Look at Martin Van Buren's sideburns, how
could he not be elected?

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.380
Americans are kind of obsessed with elections,
I mean when this was being recorded in early

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.440
2015, television, news and the internet were
already talking about who would be Democrat

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.659
and Republican candidates for president in
2016. And many of the candidates have unofficially

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.780
been campaigning for years. I've been campaigning;
your grandma's been campaigning.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.010
Presidential elections are exciting and you
can gamble on them. Is that legal, can you

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.370
gamble on them, Stan? Anyway, why we're so
obsessed with them is a topic for another day.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.120
Right now I'm gonna tell you that the fixation
on the presidential elections is wrong, but

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.240
not because the president doesn't matter.
No, today we're gonna look at the elections

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.860
of the people that are supposed to matter the
most, Congress.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:59.720
[Theme Music]

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.340
Constitutionally at least, Congress is the
most important branch of government because

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.080
it is the one that is supposed to be the most
responsive to the people.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.020
One of the main reasons it's so responsive,
at least in theory, is the frequency of elections.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.400
If a politician has to run for office often, he or she,
because unlike the president we have women

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.140
serving in Congress, kind of has to pay attention 
to what the constituents want, a little bit, maybe.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.460
By now, I'm sure that most of you have memorized
the Constitution, so you recognize that despite

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.180
their importance in the way we discuss politics,
elections aren't really a big feature of the Constitution.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.740
Except of course for the ridiculously complex
electoral college system for choosing the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.800
president, which we don't even want to think
about for a few episodes. In fact, here's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.689
what the Constitution says about Congressional
Elections in Article 1 Section 2:

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.889
"The House of Representatives shall be composed
of members chosen every second year by the

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:48.319
people of the several states, and the electors
in each state shall have the qualifications

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.590
requisite for electors of the most numerous
branch of the state legislature."

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.899
So the Constitution does establish that the
whole of the house is up for election every

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.450
2 years, and 1/3 of the senate is too, but
mainly it leaves the scheduling and rules

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.770
of elections up to the states. The actual
rules of elections, like when the polls are

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.209
open and where they actually are, as well
as the registration requirements, are pretty

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.789
much up to the states, subject to some federal
election law.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.689
If you really want to know the rules in your
state, I'm sure that someone at the Board

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:16.820
of Elections will be happy to explain them to you. Really,
you should give them a call; they're very, very lonely.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.340
In general though, here's what we can say
about American elections. First stating the

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.380
super obvious, in order to serve in congress,
you need to win an election.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.060
In the House of Representatives, each election
district chooses a single representative,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.700
which is why we call them single-member districts.
The number of districts is determined by the

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.310
Census, which happens every 10 years, and
which means that elections ending in zeros

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.370
are super important, for reasons that I'll
explain in greater detail in a future episode.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.340
It's because of gerrymandering.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.730
The Senate is much easier to figure out
because both of the state Senators are elected

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.970
by the entire state. It's as if the state
itself were a single district, which is true

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.610
for states like Wyoming, which are so unpopulated
as to have only 1 representative. Sometimes

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.510
these elections are called at large elections.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.960
Before the election ever happens, you need
candidates. How candidates are chosen differs

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.340
from state to state, but usually it has something
to do with political parties, although it

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.040
doesn't have to. Why are things so complicated?!

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.340
What we can say is that candidates, or at least
good candidates, usually have certain characteristics.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.460
Sorry America.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.880
First off, if you are gonna run for office,
you should have an unblemished record, free

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.240
of, oh I don't know, felony convictions or
sex scandals, except maybe in Louisiana or

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.159
New York. This might lead to some pretty bland
candidates or people who are so calculating

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.310
that they have no skeletons in their closet,
but we Americans are a moral people and like

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.459
our candidates to reflect our ideals rather
than our reality.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.129
The second characteristic that a candidate
must possess is the ability to raise money.

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.030
Now some candidates are billionaires and can
finance their own campaigns. But most billionaires

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.859
have better things to do: buying yachts, making
even more money, building money forts, buying

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.799
more yachts, so they don't have time to run
for office. But most candidates get their

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.480
money for their campaigns by asking for it.
The ability to raise money is key, especially

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.660
now, because running for office is expensive.
Can I get a how expensive is it? "How expensive

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.320
is it?!" Well, so expensive that the prices
of elections continually rises and in 2012

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.409
winners of House races spent nearly 2 million
each. Senate winners spent more than 10 million.

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.800
By the time this episode airs, I'm sure the numbers
will be much higher like a gajillion billion million.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.020
Money is important in winning an election,
but even more important, statistically, is

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.370
already being in Congress. Let's go to the
Thought Bubble.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.810
The person holding an office who runs for
that office again is called the incumbent

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.780
and has a big advantage over any challenger.
This is according to political scientists

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.400
who, being almost as bad at naming things as
historians, refer to this as incumbency advantage.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.980
There are a number of reasons why incumbents
tend to hold onto their seats in congress, if they want to.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.419
The first is that a sitting congressman has
a record to run on, which we hope includes

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.039
some legislative accomplishments, although
for the past few Congresses, these don't seem

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.940
to matter. The record might include case work,
which is providing direct services to constituents.

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.620
This is usually done by congressional staffers
and includes things like answering questions

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.060
about how to get certain government benefits
or writing recommendation letters to West

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.810
Point. Congressmen can also provide jobs to
constituents, which is usually a good way

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.240
to get them to vote for you. These are either
government jobs, kind of rare these days,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.400
called patronage or indirect employment through
government contracts for programs within a

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.449
Congressman's district. These programs are
called earmarks or pork barrel programs, and

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.460
they are much less common now because Congress
has decided not to use them any more, sort of.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.880
The second advantage that incumbents have
is that they have a record of winning elections,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.340
which if you think about it, is pretty obvious.
Being a proven winner makes it easier for

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.860
a congressmen to raise money, which helps
them win, and long term incumbents tend to

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.449
be more powerful in Congress which makes it
even easier for them to raise money and win.

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.620
The Constitution give incumbents one structural
advantage too. Each elected congressman is

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.699
allowed $100,000 and free postage to send
out election materials. This is called the

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.579
franking privilege. It's not so clear how great an
advantage this is in the age of the internet, but

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.820
at least according to the book The Victory Lab, direct
mail from candidates can be surprisingly effective.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.300
How real is this incumbency advantage? Well
if you look at the numbers, it seems pretty

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.620
darn real. Over the past 60 years, almost 90%
of members of The House of Representatives

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.660
got re-elected. The Senate has been even more
volatile, but even at the low point in 1980

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.360
more than 50% of sitting senators got to keep
their jobs.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.110
Thanks, Thought Bubble. You're so great. So
those are some of the features of congressional

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.060
elections. Now, if you'll permit me to get
a little politically sciencey, I'd like to

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.040
try to explain why elections are so important to the
way that Congressmen and Senators do their jobs.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.040
In 1974, political scientist David Mayhew
published a book in which he described something

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.379
he called "The Electoral Connection." This was
the idea that Congressmen were primarily motivated

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.069
by the desire to get re-elected, which intuitively
makes a lot of sense, even though I'm not

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.270
sure what evidence he had for this conclusion.
Used to be able to get away with that kind

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:34.700
of thing I guess, clearly David may-not-hew to the
rules of evidence, pun [rim shot], high five, nope.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.639
Anyway Mayhew's research methodology
isn't as important as his idea itself because

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.799
The Electoral Connection provides a frame
work for understanding congressman's activities.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.300
Mayhew divided representatives' behaviors
and activities into three categories.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.150
The first is advertising; congressmen work
to develop their personal brand so that they

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.770
are recognizable to voters. Al D'Amato used
to be know in New York as Senator Pothole,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.470
because he was able to bring home so much
pork that he could actually fix New York's

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.979
streets. Not by filling them with pork, money,
its money, remember pork barrel spending?

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.360
The second activity is credit claiming; Congressmen
get things done so that they can say they got them done.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.980
A lot of case work and especially pork barrel
spending are done in the name of credit claiming.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.039
Related to credit claiming, but
slightly different, is position taking.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.180
This means making a public judgmental statement
on something likely to be of interest to voters.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.660
Senators can do this through filibusters.
Representatives can't filibuster, but they

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:25.830
can hold hearings, publicly supporting a hearing
is a way of associating yourself with an idea

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.770
without having to actually try to pass legislation.
And of course they can go on the TV, especially

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.790
on Sunday talk shows. What's a TV, who even
watches TV?

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.820
Now the idea of The Electoral Connection doesn't
explain every action a member of Congress takes; sometimes

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.600
they actually make laws to benefit the public
good or maybe solve problems. Huh, what an idea!

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.100
But Mayhew's idea gives us a way of thinking
about Congressional activity, an analytical lens that

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.460
connects what Congressmen actually do with how most
of us understand Congressmen, through elections.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.020
So the next time you see a Congressmen call
for a hearing on a supposed horrible scandal

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.080
or read about a Senator threatening to filibuster
a policy that may have significant popular

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.520
support, ask yourself, "Is this Representative
claiming credit or taking a position, and

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.830
how will this build their brand?" In other
words: what's the electoral connection and

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.770
how will whatever they're doing help them get
elected? This might feel a little cynical,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.860
but the reality is Mayhew's thesis often seems
to fit with today's politics.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:22.490
