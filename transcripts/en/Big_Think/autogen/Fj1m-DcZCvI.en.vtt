incredible observer he was he was he was
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.299
incredible observer he was he was he was
very very good observer and he could and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
very very good observer and he could and
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130
very very good observer and he could and
what he wrote about what the clinical

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
what he wrote about what the clinical
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.640
what he wrote about what the clinical
phenomenon were very insightful and and

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650
phenomenon were very insightful and and
 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.160
phenomenon were very insightful and and
also you know things like his ideas

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
also you know things like his ideas
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.310
also you know things like his ideas
about the concept of transference how

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
about the concept of transference how
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.810
about the concept of transference how
people basically think you know bring to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
people basically think you know bring to
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.639
people basically think you know bring to
a new relationship the expectations and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
a new relationship the expectations and
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.700
a new relationship the expectations and
predictions they have from other gleaned

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
predictions they have from other gleaned
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.740
predictions they have from other gleaned
from other earlier relationships

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
from other earlier relationships
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.650
from other earlier relationships
especially attachment relationships you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
especially attachment relationships you
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.110
especially attachment relationships you
know I that's my background and I'm sure

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
know I that's my background and I'm sure
 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.330
know I that's my background and I'm sure
it still informs what I do

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
 
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.790
 
okay yes

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800
okay yes
 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.060
okay yes
think I absolutely think and very much

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070
think I absolutely think and very much
 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.610
think I absolutely think and very much
hope but I mean I think it's an

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620
hope but I mean I think it's an
 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.490
hope but I mean I think it's an
essential part of of healing people and

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500
essential part of of healing people and
 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.100
essential part of of healing people and
when we know this regardless of what

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110
when we know this regardless of what
 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.160
when we know this regardless of what
other ways we develop and you know

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170
other ways we develop and you know
 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.670
other ways we develop and you know
whether they be neurobiological methods

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680
whether they be neurobiological methods
 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.490
whether they be neurobiological methods
and now we're talking not only about

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500
and now we're talking not only about
 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.120
and now we're talking not only about
psychopharmacology but a lot of other

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130
psychopharmacology but a lot of other
 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.510
psychopharmacology but a lot of other
kinds of brain stimulation for example

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
kinds of brain stimulation for example
 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.330
kinds of brain stimulation for example
and and even some kinds of very focused

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340
and and even some kinds of very focused
 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.880
and and even some kinds of very focused
neuro surgery seem to be you know things

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890
neuro surgery seem to be you know things
 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.250
neuro surgery seem to be you know things
that have promised for certain people in

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260
that have promised for certain people in
 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.470
that have promised for certain people in
certain situations so I do very much see

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480
certain situations so I do very much see
 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.270
certain situations so I do very much see
psychiatry developing in the direction

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280
psychiatry developing in the direction
 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.670
psychiatry developing in the direction
of neuroscience and neurobiology I think

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680
of neuroscience and neurobiology I think
 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.590
of neuroscience and neurobiology I think
we've we've made some great leaps in

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600
we've we've made some great leaps in
 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.260
we've we've made some great leaps in
that direction and and I think we will

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270
that direction and and I think we will
 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.540
that direction and and I think we will
and we should continue to work in that

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550
and we should continue to work in that
 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.750
and we should continue to work in that
in that area at the same time you know

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760
in that area at the same time you know
 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.160
in that area at the same time you know
one of the things about psychotherapy

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170
one of the things about psychotherapy
 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.139
one of the things about psychotherapy
zs-- is that the more you know the more

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149
zs-- is that the more you know the more
 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.540
zs-- is that the more you know the more
focused psycho therapies actually are

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550
focused psycho therapies actually are
 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.390
focused psycho therapies actually are
better able to target specific

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400
better able to target specific
 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.910
better able to target specific
behavioral syndromes than any kind of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920
behavioral syndromes than any kind of
 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.640
behavioral syndromes than any kind of
somatic treatment that we have so far so

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650
somatic treatment that we have so far so
 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.280
somatic treatment that we have so far so
I definitely think that there's a role

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290
I definitely think that there's a role
 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.640
I definitely think that there's a role
for you know for very focused kind of

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650
for you know for very focused kind of
 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.400
for you know for very focused kind of
technical interpersonal interventions

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410
technical interpersonal interventions
 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.380
technical interpersonal interventions
that are you know so to say

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390
that are you know so to say
 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.360
that are you know so to say
psychological interventions I don't

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370
psychological interventions I don't
 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.340
psychological interventions I don't
think that will ever go away but I I

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350
think that will ever go away but I I
 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.830
think that will ever go away but I I
think we we're learning more and more

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840
think we we're learning more and more
 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.640
think we we're learning more and more
about those kinds of interventions and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650
about those kinds of interventions and
 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.800
about those kinds of interventions and
again specific techniques like there's a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810
again specific techniques like there's a
 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.860
again specific techniques like there's a
very interesting there's a very

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870
very interesting there's a very
 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.140
very interesting there's a very
interesting recent report of using

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150
interesting recent report of using
 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.090
interesting recent report of using
training and attention in attentional

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100
training and attention in attentional
 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.780
training and attention in attentional
processes in in some anxiety disorders

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790
processes in in some anxiety disorders
 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.120
processes in in some anxiety disorders
in social phobia in generalized anxiety

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130
in social phobia in generalized anxiety
 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.400
in social phobia in generalized anxiety
probably for any of the anxieties and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410
probably for any of the anxieties and
 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.900
probably for any of the anxieties and
anxiety disorders because one of the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910
anxiety disorders because one of the
 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.130
anxiety disorders because one of the
things that you do when you have an

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140
things that you do when you have an
 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.290
things that you do when you have an
anxiety disorder is you over focus on

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300
anxiety disorder is you over focus on
 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.210
anxiety disorder is you over focus on
certain kinds of cues like we were

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220
certain kinds of cues like we were
 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.160
certain kinds of cues like we were
talking about with panic you know if

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170
talking about with panic you know if
 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.740
talking about with panic you know if
you're a social ly anxious person you're

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750
you're a social ly anxious person you're
 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.330
you're a social ly anxious person you're
going to do that with social cues you're

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340
going to do that with social cues you're
 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.580
going to do that with social cues you're
going to be overly sensitive to social

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590
going to be overly sensitive to social
 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.310
going to be overly sensitive to social
cues and you can train people apparently

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320
cues and you can train people apparently
 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.510
cues and you can train people apparently
away from that by training their

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520
away from that by training their
 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.940
away from that by training their
attention

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950
attention
 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.580
attention
and so that's one kind of thing I see

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590
and so that's one kind of thing I see
 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.869
and so that's one kind of thing I see
happening in the future but you know but

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879
happening in the future but you know but
 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.110
happening in the future but you know but
for many of I would say virtually all of

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120
for many of I would say virtually all of
 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.290
for many of I would say virtually all of
the conditions we treat there's always

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300
the conditions we treat there's always
 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.509
the conditions we treat there's always
going to be some way in which the person

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519
going to be some way in which the person
 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.300
going to be some way in which the person
who has the problem will need to to kind

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310
who has the problem will need to to kind
 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.100
who has the problem will need to to kind
of get close to really close to very

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110
of get close to really close to very
 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.800
of get close to really close to very
distressing emotions and thoughts and to

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810
distressing emotions and thoughts and to
 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.949
distressing emotions and thoughts and to
do that I think you really need to feel

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959
do that I think you really need to feel
 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.120
do that I think you really need to feel
safe and to feel safe in any treatment

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130
safe and to feel safe in any treatment
 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.890
safe and to feel safe in any treatment
you need another person you know you

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900
you need another person you know you
 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.800
you need another person you know you
need a person who can can be there for

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810
need a person who can can be there for
 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.500
need a person who can can be there for
you so you know I think that will always

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510
you so you know I think that will always
 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.989
you so you know I think that will always
be there
