that you know that these stereotypes

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
that you know that these stereotypes
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.590
that you know that these stereotypes
come from somewhere but it's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
come from somewhere but it's
 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.690
come from somewhere but it's
nevertheless a stereotype but at the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
nevertheless a stereotype but at the
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.910
nevertheless a stereotype but at the
same time that are people who use those

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
same time that are people who use those
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219
same time that are people who use those
stereotypes to their advantage and they

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
stereotypes to their advantage and they
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400
abuse and so because of that people see
 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.190
