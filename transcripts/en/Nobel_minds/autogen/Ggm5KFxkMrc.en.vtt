in the macroeconomy can you just provide

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470
in the macroeconomy can you just provide
 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.310
in the macroeconomy can you just provide
us with the main lines of motivation

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320
us with the main lines of motivation
 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.859
us with the main lines of motivation
from the committee as to why the prize

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869
from the committee as to why the prize
 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.489
from the committee as to why the prize
has been awarded to these two originals

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:32.499
has been awarded to these two originals
 

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.509
has been awarded to these two originals
there is a great interest in

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519
there is a great interest in
 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.369
there is a great interest in
understanding what's happening in to the

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379
understanding what's happening in to the
 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.229
understanding what's happening in to the
economy well when economic policy

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239
economy well when economic policy
 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.709
economy well when economic policy
changes but if we want to observe from

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719
changes but if we want to observe from
 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.610
changes but if we want to observe from
data try to estimate from data this

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620
data try to estimate from data this
 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.009
data try to estimate from data this
effects is of course of key importance

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019
effects is of course of key importance
 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.410
effects is of course of key importance
to understand what cost works and this

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420
to understand what cost works and this
 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.509
to understand what cost works and this
is this is difficult when you observe

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519
is this is difficult when you observe
 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.689
is this is difficult when you observe
only data and the main complication is

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699
only data and the main complication is
 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.199
only data and the main complication is
that an important driver of human

00:00:59.199 --> 00:00:59.209
that an important driver of human
 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.090
that an important driver of human
behavior is expectations about the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100
behavior is expectations about the
 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.660
behavior is expectations about the
future right and we can't really observe

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670
future right and we can't really observe
 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.800
future right and we can't really observe
expectations what expectations did

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810
expectations what expectations did
 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.109
expectations what expectations did
people have what went on in their minds

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119
people have what went on in their minds
 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.569
people have what went on in their minds
when they when they made their decisions

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579
when they when they made their decisions
 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.850
when they when they made their decisions
right and when when the when the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860
right and when when the when the
 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.380
right and when when the when the
laureates made their seminal

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390
laureates made their seminal
 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.940
laureates made their seminal
contributions this was of course well

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950
contributions this was of course well
 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.959
contributions this was of course well
understood but it was not really

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969
understood but it was not really
 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.490
understood but it was not really
understood how we could incorporate that

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500
understood how we could incorporate that
 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.319
understood how we could incorporate that
in macroeconomic models so what they

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329
in macroeconomic models so what they
 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.599
in macroeconomic models so what they
have done is to develop methods that

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609
have done is to develop methods that
 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.179
have done is to develop methods that
make it possible to distinguish cause

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189
make it possible to distinguish cause
 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:28.929
make it possible to distinguish cause
and effect

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939
and effect
 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.469
and effect
in macroeconomic data and then we can

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479
in macroeconomic data and then we can
 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.109
in macroeconomic data and then we can
answer questions like what happens to

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119
answer questions like what happens to
 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.469
answer questions like what happens to
unemployment what happens to GDP if when

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479
unemployment what happens to GDP if when
 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.270
unemployment what happens to GDP if when
interest rate is changed or if you

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280
interest rate is changed or if you
 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.060
interest rate is changed or if you
change the inflation toria's so what

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070
change the inflation toria's so what
 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.830
change the inflation toria's so what
would you say the main practical

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840
would you say the main practical
 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.840
would you say the main practical
benefits and applications are of their

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850
benefits and applications are of their
 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.739
benefits and applications are of their
findings so if you measure that in terms

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749
findings so if you measure that in terms
 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.370
findings so if you measure that in terms
of who actually uses the methods the in

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380
of who actually uses the methods the in
 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.980
of who actually uses the methods the in
daily basis I would say that it's

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
daily basis I would say that it's
 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.420
daily basis I would say that it's
central banks

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430
central banks
 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.100
central banks
yeah but certainly also other agencies

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110
yeah but certainly also other agencies
 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.340
yeah but certainly also other agencies
at ministries and agencies responsible

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350
at ministries and agencies responsible
 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.290
at ministries and agencies responsible
for making business cycle forecasts and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300
for making business cycle forecasts and
 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.230
for making business cycle forecasts and
things like that and not to forget

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240
things like that and not to forget
 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:19.600
things like that and not to forget
researchers say that basically all

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610
researchers say that basically all
 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.530
researchers say that basically all
modern empirical macroeconomic research

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540
modern empirical macroeconomic research
 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.860
modern empirical macroeconomic research
builds on the methods that that the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870
builds on the methods that that the
 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.220
builds on the methods that that the
laureates have laid the foundation for

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230
laureates have laid the foundation for
 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.199
laureates have laid the foundation for
so these two laureates they have

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209
so these two laureates they have
 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.920
so these two laureates they have
developed tools for interpreting

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
developed tools for interpreting
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.100
developed tools for interpreting
historical macroeconomic data would you

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110
historical macroeconomic data would you
 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.040
historical macroeconomic data would you
say that the findings or their work

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050
say that the findings or their work
 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.440
say that the findings or their work
actually enables us to predict or

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450
actually enables us to predict or
 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.699
actually enables us to predict or
control the future I certainly think

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709
control the future I certainly think
 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.680
control the future I certainly think
that it has been very helpful for

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690
that it has been very helpful for
 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.990
that it has been very helpful for
central bank's in improving their

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000
central bank's in improving their
 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.660
central bank's in improving their
policies and making making monetary

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
policies and making making monetary
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.680
policies and making making monetary
policy better and and it's I mean they

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690
policy better and and it's I mean they
 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.560
policy better and and it's I mean they
have their methods have implied that

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570
have their methods have implied that
 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.780
have their methods have implied that
central banks know more or less what

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790
central banks know more or less what
 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.310
central banks know more or less what
happens when they change the interest

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320
happens when they change the interest
 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.220
happens when they change the interest
rate what happens to unemployment output

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230
rate what happens to unemployment output
 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.630
rate what happens to unemployment output
and inflation and without such a

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640
and inflation and without such a
 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.320
and inflation and without such a
knowledge the monetary policy cannot be

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330
knowledge the monetary policy cannot be
 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.600
knowledge the monetary policy cannot be
executed in in a good way so certainly

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610
executed in in a good way so certainly
 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.910
executed in in a good way so certainly
it has been very helpful for them but

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920
it has been very helpful for them but
 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.350
it has been very helpful for them but
also

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360
also
 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.080
also
and also for fiscal policy what what

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090
and also for fiscal policy what what
 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.780
and also for fiscal policy what what
happens if you you know propose a new if

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790
happens if you you know propose a new if
 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.450
happens if you you know propose a new if
you introduce a new stimulus package or

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460
you introduce a new stimulus package or
 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.330
you introduce a new stimulus package or
things like that the effects of those

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340
things like that the effects of those
 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.150
things like that the effects of those
measures can be analyzed with the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160
measures can be analyzed with the
 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.950
measures can be analyzed with the
methods the laureates have developed but

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960
methods the laureates have developed but
 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.080
methods the laureates have developed but
one should realize that what they have

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090
one should realize that what they have
 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.300
one should realize that what they have
devised is is is a method of

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310
devised is is is a method of
 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.700
devised is is is a method of
constructing the models the tools that

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710
constructing the models the tools that
 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.930
constructing the models the tools that
we can use to answer these questions

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940
we can use to answer these questions
 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.620
we can use to answer these questions
they have not provided the complete

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630
they have not provided the complete
 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.540
they have not provided the complete
finished model that never is going to be

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550
finished model that never is going to be
 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.460
finished model that never is going to be
improved or on the contrary there is an

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470
improved or on the contrary there is an
 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.970
improved or on the contrary there is an
enormous amount of improvement going on

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980
enormous amount of improvement going on
 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.600
enormous amount of improvement going on
in various directions and and certainly

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610
in various directions and and certainly
 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.210
in various directions and and certainly
the the recent financial crisis has

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220
the the recent financial crisis has
 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.010
the the recent financial crisis has
pointed to development and in in kind of

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020
pointed to development and in in kind of
 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.410
pointed to development and in in kind of
new directions of introducing financial

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420
new directions of introducing financial
 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.050
new directions of introducing financial
markets in the system trying to

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060
markets in the system trying to
 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.270
markets in the system trying to
understand what happens with monetary

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280
understand what happens with monetary
 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.909
understand what happens with monetary
and fiscal policy when interest rates is

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919
and fiscal policy when interest rates is
 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.100
and fiscal policy when interest rates is
at the lower bound at zero so you can't

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110
at the lower bound at zero so you can't
 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.880
at the lower bound at zero so you can't
do anything more and these these

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890
do anything more and these these
 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.770
do anything more and these these
features of the models were not much

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780
features of the models were not much
 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.800
features of the models were not much
developed in the calmer times of the 90s

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810
developed in the calmer times of the 90s
 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.110
developed in the calmer times of the 90s
for example or in the beginning of this

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120
for example or in the beginning of this
 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.080
for example or in the beginning of this
decade but they will be now and/or being

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090
decade but they will be now and/or being
 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.570
decade but they will be now and/or being
developed now yeah because the models

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580
developed now yeah because the models
 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.370
developed now yeah because the models
that been in practical use of quite some

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380
that been in practical use of quite some
 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.120
that been in practical use of quite some
time I would say that they have kind of

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130
time I would say that they have kind of
 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.380
time I would say that they have kind of
become the main tool for example central

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390
become the main tool for example central
 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.720
become the main tool for example central
banks during the last 10 to 15 years

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730
banks during the last 10 to 15 years
 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.120
banks during the last 10 to 15 years
and so it's Thomas J sergeant and

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130
and so it's Thomas J sergeant and
 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.850
and so it's Thomas J sergeant and
Christopher Simmons and they've been

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860
Christopher Simmons and they've been
 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.490
Christopher Simmons and they've been
they are they've been awarded the prize

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500
they are they've been awarded the prize
 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.650
they are they've been awarded the prize
now what distinguishes their work from

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660
now what distinguishes their work from
 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.670
now what distinguishes their work from
each other so it's the methods are

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680
each other so it's the methods are
 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.520
each other so it's the methods are
slightly different and they are

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530
slightly different and they are
 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.520
slightly different and they are
applicable put two slightly different

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530
applicable put two slightly different
 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.740
applicable put two slightly different
aspects of economic policy so Sims has

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750
aspects of economic policy so Sims has
 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.040
aspects of economic policy so Sims has
largely focused on on what happens to

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050
largely focused on on what happens to
 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.000
largely focused on on what happens to
the economy if unexpected short-lived

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010
the economy if unexpected short-lived
 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.850
the economy if unexpected short-lived
events occur so that would be to talk

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860
events occur so that would be to talk
 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.770
events occur so that would be to talk
about policy it would be like a change

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780
about policy it would be like a change
 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.440
about policy it would be like a change
in the interest rate the change in the

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450
in the interest rate the change in the
 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.909
in the interest rate the change in the
interest rate set by the central bank of

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919
interest rate set by the central bank of
 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.830
interest rate set by the central bank of
the Federal Reserve or a change in the

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840
the Federal Reserve or a change in the
 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.129
the Federal Reserve or a change in the
tax rate that occur unexpected today

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139
tax rate that occur unexpected today
 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.409
tax rate that occur unexpected today
that will be the focus of Sims while

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419
that will be the focus of Sims while
 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.800
that will be the focus of Sims while
sergeant has focused more on on more

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810
sergeant has focused more on on more
 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.860
sergeant has focused more on on more
permanent structural changes in the

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870
permanent structural changes in the
 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.230
permanent structural changes in the
economy including in economic policies

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240
economy including in economic policies
 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.469
economy including in economic policies
so so what happens if you delegate

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479
so so what happens if you delegate
 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.210
so so what happens if you delegate
monetary policy to an independent

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220
monetary policy to an independent
 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.719
monetary policy to an independent
central bank that is asked to target the

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729
central bank that is asked to target the
 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.360
central bank that is asked to target the
particular goal of inflation for example

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370
particular goal of inflation for example
 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.960
particular goal of inflation for example
or if you introduce stringent budget

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970
or if you introduce stringent budget
 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.740
or if you introduce stringent budget
rules or for example that says that you

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750
rules or for example that says that you
 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.409
rules or for example that says that you
can't like in Sweden we have a target of

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419
can't like in Sweden we have a target of
 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.930
can't like in Sweden we have a target of
the budget surplus of 2% per year what

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940
the budget surplus of 2% per year what
 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.580
the budget surplus of 2% per year what
happens if you change that to introduce

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590
happens if you change that to introduce
 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.190
happens if you change that to introduce
another rule like that so subtract

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200
another rule like that so subtract
 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.760
another rule like that so subtract
changes in those kind of structural or

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770
changes in those kind of structural or
 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.800
changes in those kind of structural or
systemic aspects of economic policy the

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810
systemic aspects of economic policy the
 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.240
systemic aspects of economic policy the
effects of those on the economy that's

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250
effects of those on the economy that's
 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.110
effects of those on the economy that's
the focus of Sargent

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120
the focus of Sargent
 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.439
the focus of Sargent
very well yes there is a continuous

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449
very well yes there is a continuous
 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.210
very well yes there is a continuous
discussion between them which is kind of

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220
discussion between them which is kind of
 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.330
discussion between them which is kind of
interesting that what's in in between

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340
interesting that what's in in between
 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.650
interesting that what's in in between
what can be done with the different

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660
what can be done with the different
 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.540
what can be done with the different
methods and how in what way do they

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550
methods and how in what way do they
 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.290
methods and how in what way do they
complement each other so so the

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300
complement each other so so the
 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.379
complement each other so so the
discussion between the Lord did their

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389
discussion between the Lord did their
 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.090
discussion between the Lord did their
work has been very complementary and not

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100
work has been very complementary and not
 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.920
work has been very complementary and not
the least the discussion between them

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930
the least the discussion between them
 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.820
the least the discussion between them
has been very fruitful I think and in

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830
has been very fruitful I think and in
 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.490
has been very fruitful I think and in
the current climate of financial

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500
the current climate of financial
 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.320
the current climate of financial
instability how important is their work

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330
instability how important is their work
 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.200
instability how important is their work
well without the the knowledge that

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210
well without the the knowledge that
 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.029
well without the the knowledge that
their methods have given to central

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039
their methods have given to central
 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.129
their methods have given to central
banks I think it would have been much

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139
banks I think it would have been much
 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.420
banks I think it would have been much
much worse situation and but it's also

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430
much worse situation and but it's also
 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.270
much worse situation and but it's also
as I earlier note that it's it's it's

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280
as I earlier note that it's it's it's
 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.920
as I earlier note that it's it's it's
important to note that their methods are

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930
important to note that their methods are
 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.689
important to note that their methods are
continuously improved upon and and we

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:26.699
continuously improved upon and and we
 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:29.390
continuously improved upon and and we
don't really have a good answer to what

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400
don't really have a good answer to what
 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.909
don't really have a good answer to what
happened during the financial crisis nor

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919
happened during the financial crisis nor
 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:37.490
happened during the financial crisis nor
what we should do in order to to reduce

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500
what we should do in order to to reduce
 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.839
what we should do in order to to reduce
the risk of something like this

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:38.849
the risk of something like this
 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:40.969
the risk of something like this
happening again but we are pretty sure

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979
happening again but we are pretty sure
 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.500
happening again but we are pretty sure
that the methods that they have

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:42.510
that the methods that they have
 

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.330
that the methods that they have
developed will help us in finding the

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340
developed will help us in finding the
 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.710

closer and learn but social science it's

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:55.710
closer and learn but social science it's
 

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.010
closer and learn but social science it's
like that but there is never actually
