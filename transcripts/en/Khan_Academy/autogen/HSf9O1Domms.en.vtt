00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
 We want to know how much 1/4 is 

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.585
 plus 3/5 minus 3/10. 

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:06.960
 I recommend that you stop the video 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.555
 and see if you can calculate it. 

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:11.760
 Okay, I guess I tried it. 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.460
 Now let's make the example together. 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.455
 The first you may think, 

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:16.760
 is that you have these fractions, 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.760
 which you have to collect and draw, 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.665
 but they have different denominators. 

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:21.855
 To get them out and collect them in the right way, 

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.630
 we have to record them 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.220
 with the same denominator. 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.260
 What we have to find is a number that is multiple 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.380
 at 4, 5 and 10. 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.020
 As I always say, we can use every single multiple, 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.120
 but to simplify things, we use it 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.555
 at least in total. 

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:42.240
 One way to find the least common multiple 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.550
 is to take the largest of these numbers 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.490
 and check his multiples by increasing 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.990
 numbers until we find a suitable number, 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.115
 which is shared by the other two. 

00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:53.755
 For example, I can start with 10. 

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:57.460
 10 is divided into 5, but not divided by 4. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.185
 We continue with 20. 

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:02.285
 20 is divided into 5, and 4, 

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:07.285
 therefore the smallest total of 4, 5 and 10 is 20. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.720
 Let's write down all these fractions 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.060
 like something on 20. 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.055
 Let's start with 1/4. 

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:16.620
 How much on 20 is 1/4? 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.320
 To get 20 out of 4, we need to multiply by 5, 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.720
 then you must do the same with the numerator. 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.055
 You have to multiply it by 5. 

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:26.750
 1 in 5 is 5. 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.495
 1 on 4 is equal to 5/20. 

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:35.210
 4 is 4 by 1, 20 is 4 by 5. 

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:39.760
 Then we want to find out what happens with 3/5, 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.720
 if I write them as something on 20. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.425
 To get 20 out of 5 in the denominator, 

00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:48.090
 you have to multiply it by 4, 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.430
 you must multiply by 4 and the numerator. 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.375
 3 in 4 is 12. 

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:58.020
 Then we will draw 3/10, 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.050
 but how do we record them as something on 20? 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.730
 To get 20 out of 10, 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.620
 you need to multiply the denominator by 2, 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.985
 and if we want to get the same fraction, 

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:08.580
 we must multiply the numerator by 2. 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.155
 3 in 2 is 6. 

00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:13.885
 What will that be equal to? 

00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:15.460
 Now I have 5/20 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.810
 plus 12/20 minus 6/20. 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.745
 What will that be equal to? 

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:23.995
 There are several ways to think about it. 

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.020
 You can say that this will be equal 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.540
 on 5/20 

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:36.230
 plus 12/20 plus 12/20 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.460
 minus 6/20, minus 6/20. 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.690
 Another way to think about it is 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.950
 the way I just wrote here, 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.955
 5 plus 12 minus 6, all on 20. 

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:50.885
 That is how many twenties we will get as a result. 

00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:52.950
 How equal is this? 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.660
 This will be equal to all this, 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.460
 counting the twenties is one way to think about it. 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.250
 5 plus 12 is 17 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.195
 minus 6 is 11. 

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:06.645
 We get 11/20. 

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:10.320
 I have 5/20, I add 12/20 and I take 6/20, 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.660
 I will stay 11/20. 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.645
 Let's figure out another example to practice. 

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:22.520
 I have 4/9 minus 1/6 plus 1/3. 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.350
 As before, I recommend stopping the video 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.200
 and try to solve the problem yourself. 

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.485
 What I want to do first is to write 

00:03:28.485 --> 00:03:29.860
 all these fractions 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.155
 with the same denominator. 

00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:33.795
 To find a common denominator you must find 

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:38.310
 a total of 9, 6 and 3. 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.275
 As I did before, I can 

00:03:40.275 --> 00:03:42.385
 started with 9 and say "Okay, 

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:44.830
 9 is not divisible at 6. 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.125
 It's 3, but it's not enough. " 

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:50.525
 I want to find a total of 9, 6 and 3 

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:52.790
 and be as small as possible. 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.745
 Let's see the next number, a multiple of 9, we get 18. 

00:03:55.745 --> 00:04:00.160
 A 18 is divided into 9, of course, 6 and 3. 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.505
 Take 18. 

00:04:01.505 --> 00:04:04.210
 Let's write everything like something on 18. 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.120
 How much on 18 is 4/9? 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.230
 9 in 2 is 18, 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.655
 I did this with the denominator 

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:12.755
 and I must multiply the numerator by 2. 

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:15.720
 This will be equal to 8/18. 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.530
 How many on 18 is 1/6? 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.920
 To get 18 out of 6 in the denominator, 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.420
 we must multiply by 3, 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.895
 but I have to multiply the numerator by 3. 

00:04:25.895 --> 00:04:28.490
 1 in 3 is 3. 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.960
 And finally, 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.820
 how much on 18 is 1/3? 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.055
 18 is equal to 3 by 6, 

00:04:36.055 --> 00:04:39.220
 1 in 6 would be 6. 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.790
 You can do it otherwise, you can say 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.220
 how much is 1/3 of 18? That's 6. 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.695
 How old is 1/6 out of 18? This is 3. 

00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:48.725
 4/9 of 18? It's a little harder, 

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:50.295
 but will be equal to 8/18. 

00:04:50.295 --> 00:04:52.995
 In both ways I recorded these fractions 

00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:55.695
 and put them in the appropriate color. 

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.820
 This is exactly the same here 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.820
 like 8/18 minus 3/18 plus 6/18. 

00:05:03.285 --> 00:05:05.525
 How much will be equal? 

00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:07.925
 This will be some eighteen, 

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:11.190
 and if I have 8/18 minus 3/18, 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.395
 this will be 5/18, 

00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:18.360
 plus 6/18, which will be equal to 11/18. 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.525
 And we're ready.
