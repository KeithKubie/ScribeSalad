00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.040
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Mythology and today ... we behold our

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040
own apocalypse.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.170
Yes, it’s the end of our time together,
on this here earthly plane.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.710
Our journey together has surely been epic.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.130
And we could go on for months with more exciting
and uncomfortable stories of floods and incest,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.860
but alas - Thoth and I must retire to the
spiritual realm atop Mount Crashcourse.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.300
Throughout this series, we’ve examined myths
from around the world and across the centuries.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.920
We’ve met vomiting gods and responding dragons.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.640
We met Loki, who was the worst, and Freya!

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.269
Who in my mind, is the best.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.370
Cat chariot!

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.370
Battle swine!

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.370
What a lady...

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.319
Anyway... what ties all the stories we discussed
together is that they’re powerful.

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:46.039
They’re meaningful enough to be preserved
and passed down through generations.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.980
And so, they can help us understand the world.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.280
They provide insight into how previous civilizations
made sense of their circumstances.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.179
Myths can hint at some of the deep structures
of our collective psyches and can even offer

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.920
a glimpse into our own minds.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.990
And they’re the best place to go for good
reliable information about unicorns.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.990
ELEPHANTS FEET!

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.600
I still can’t get over it.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.950
INTRO
Today, in our final episode, we examine another

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.430
legacy of the most impactful myths: the way
they’ve seeped into the very language I’m

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.430
speaking.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.189
We’re going to focus on Greek myths, because
those have had a profound effect on the English

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.189
language.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.850
Though it is true we got a lot of good words
from Egyptian– behemoth, chemistry, PHARMACY!

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.369
[[[Thoth acknowledges.]]]

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.049
You’re welcome - credit where credits due.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.299
I mean, you did INVENT WRITING.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.390
Anyway - Listing every example of mythical
influence on English would be a ... Herculean

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.179
task ... a phrase we know from our episode
on Herakles, which implies great difficulty

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.580
and a requirement of great strength.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.149
And remember, Herakles took nine years to
complete his labors, so a Herculean task can

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.790
also be one that requires incredible patience,
dedication, and effort.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.950
Speaking of tasks, maybe you’ve heard of
a Sisyphean one?

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.910
This one’s named after Sisyphus, who we’ve
never discussed.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.580
So this is a perfect Thoughtbubble opportunity.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.270
Sisyphus is king of Ephyra, and he’s known
as the craftiest of all men.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.050
Crafty as in sneaky, though, not like... scrapbooking.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.000
And Sisyphus isn’t just crafty, he’s also
ruthless.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.640
He invites visitors to his kingdom and then
murders them.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.950
He even plans to kill his own brother, Salmoneus,
by marrying Salmoneus’s daughter Tyro and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.450
making her bear a son who will kill his grandad.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.890
Talk about a long con!

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.890
Jeez.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.890
So - in some versions of Sisyphus’ story,
he angers Zeus by claiming to be craftier

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.030
than the Father of Gods himself.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.620
In another version, Sisyphus tells the river
Asopus that Zeus is having an affair with

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.110
his daughter, the nymph Aegina[a].

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.890
Every version of Sisyphus’ story has the
doomed king angering one god or another.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.070
In some stories he chains up Thanatos, the
god of death, so that no one can die.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.560
In other stories he tricks Persephone into
letting him escape the underworld by convincing

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.720
her that he wasn’t buried properly.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.720
This guy does not know when to quit.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.360
Once he’s finally in Hades for keepsies,
Sisyphus’ punishment is that he’s forced

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.540
to roll a huge boulder up a hill in the underworld.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.280
Just as he’s about to get it to the top
of the hill, it rolls back down and he has

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.140
to start all over again.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.540
Up the hill.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.740
Down the hill.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.740
Forever.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:45.520
And that’s why today we use the term “Sisyphean
task” to mean anything both pointless AND

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.520
endless.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.940
We can also find a whole trove of linguistic
references by turning to the Iliad and the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.140
Odyssey, two of Greek mythology’s all-time
greats.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.120
In fact, the word “odyssey” is one itself!

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.310
You might know that AN odyssey can mean any
long, meandering journey.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.830
You have the protagonist of THE Odyssey - Odysseus
- to thank for that particular turn of phrase,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.870
although in Greek his name means trouble,
not travel.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.000
Though, given how often my flights are delayed:
I BUY IT.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.670
Because Odysseus’ Odyssey is such a difficult
journey with so many elements, it gives us

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.060
a bunch of great ways to describe overcoming
obstacles.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.251
Something’s siren song, for instance, describes
its hard-to-resist temptation -- the siren

00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:31.770
song of that fifth brownie with lunch.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.410
But in the Odyssey this comes from Sirens,
beautiful women who are actually scary half-bird

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.430
monsters.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.660
Living out at sea, the Sirens have an irresistible
song that lures sailors to their death.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.010
Odysseus is warned about this whole situation
by the beautiful witch Circe.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.900
But he decides he just has to hear this song.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.070
I get it - no one wants to be out of the loop
on the hot summer jam.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:04.170
So while his men plug up their ears with wax
and steer the ship, he gets tied to the mast.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.760
They sail past the Sirens, and Odysseus can’t
do anything but struggle in vain as his head

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.660
is filled with the magical song.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.590
And so today, if you tell someone you’re
tying yourself to the mast - it means you

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.510
see trouble on the horizon, and you’re taking
steps to protect yourself from doing something

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.900
you’re gonna regret.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.720
Like having a sixth brownie for lunch.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.530
There’s one more phrase from the Odyssey
that’s worth mentioning, and that’s being

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.680
caught between Scylla[b] and Charybdis[c],
which is, I promise, a thing that people say.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.420
It’s a much less common version of saying
you’re stuck, “between a rock and a hard

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.450
place,” except in this situation, it’s
a weird octopus thing and a whirlpool.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.250
This is another close shave for Odysseus - because
his route goes directly between these two

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.250
beasties.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.889
Scylla is a sea monster that began her life
as a beautiful girl, but was transformed into

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:01.590
a hideous monster with six heads on long necks,
lots of tentacles, and a waist ringed with

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.080
dog’s heads.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.900
And just across the narrow strait, less than
an arrow’s shot away?

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.900
Is Charybdis.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.270
Charybdis, didn’t start life out as a young
girl.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.520
Charybdis is pretty much just a giant whirlpool-mouth-monster
thing.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.180
And all Charybdis does is deliver entire ships
to their doom.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.620
So Odysseus gets the heads up from Circe,
who says just sail closer to Scylla.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.650
NO BIG DEAL.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.830
She’s gonna lean over and she’s gonna
gobble up six of your men -- one for each

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.380
head -- but c’mon isn’t that better than
losing the whole ship?

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.770
Odysseus follows her advice, loses six men,
but lives to finish his journey.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.830
And so a Scylla and Charybdis isn’t just
about having to make a tough decision -- it’s

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.150
knowing that one decision might be right,
even if it costs ya.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.240
The Iliad, which is primarily the story of
The Trojan War, also gives us a few turns

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.240
of phrase.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.040
At the very start of the Iliad, Paris, the
younger son of Trojan king Priam[d], is asked

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.130
to choose which goddess is the most beautiful:
Athena, Hera, or Aphrodite.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:07.370
He chooses Aphrodite because she promises
him the most beautiful woman in the world:

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.380
Helen of Troy.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.420
But Helen is already married to the Greek
king Menelaus[e].

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.570
Epicly long story short: Paris steals Helen,
or Helen runs away with Paris (depending on

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.570
your version).

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:24.680
To get Helen back, the Greeks launch some
ships–a thousand, let say–and invade Troy.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.980
Boom: Trojan war.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:32.490
Helen becomes a symbol for unsurpassed beauty
– a face that launched a thousand ships

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.070
– the type that makes men stupid, although
I suppose it’s possible Paris wasn’t so

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.231
bright from the get-go.

00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:43.639
The Trojan War to get Helen back goes on for
ten years, nine of which are pretty boring

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:46.550
but eventually we get to The Trojan Horse.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.880
For years the Greeks have been unable to break
the walls of Troy, so one day they roll a

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.419
huge wooden horse up to the gates, and leave
it as a “gift”.

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:00.360
Eventually, the Trojans wheel the big horse
inside.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.590
When night falls the super secret hidden Greek
soldiers INSIDE the horse burst out, do some

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.240
stabbing and open the gates.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.540
A Trojan horse is now shorthand for a backstab
in the form of a gift.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.320
Fun fact: As of recently it was proposed the
Trojan Horse may have been…

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.320
REAL!

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.070
Except it was a SHIP, left in front of A SEA
GATE!

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.199
And speaking of great downfalls!

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:26.610
We also get a phrase from Achilles – one
of the great heroes of the Trojan war.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.110
When he was a baby, his mother, Thetis[f],
took him to the river Styx, held him by the

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.000
heel, and dipped him in the magical waters.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.430
The contact with the Styx water made Achilles
practically invincible.

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.439
No one could hurt him in combat.

00:08:41.439 --> 00:08:45.579
That is, except for the one place on his heel,
where his mother held him.

00:08:45.579 --> 00:08:49.959
It’s precisely this weak point that Paris
takes advantage of, with a single shot of

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:54.360
an arrow at Achilles’ heel, killing the
stalwart Greek hero.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.540
This is why “Achilles heel” can refer
to anyone’s area of vulnerability, often

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.819
one that’s SECRET, despite their seeming
resilience.

00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:07.749
Let’s be honest though, you’re more likely
to reference the timeless myth of Kal-el,

00:09:07.749 --> 00:09:09.059
and call this your Kryptonite.

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:13.360
When you start looking, there’re almost
too many myth-inspired phrases to mention.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.839
Take “the Midas touch.”

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:19.959
This, of course is from the tale of king Midas,
who wishes for everything he touches to turn

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:20.959
to gold.

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:25.499
He gets his wish only to to discover that
gold food isn’t all it’s cracked up to

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:26.499
be.

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:29.079
And this is kind of ironic, because we tend
to use the phrase “the Midas touch” to

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:32.149
refer to people who have success in every
endeavor.

00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:36.600
Apparently most people only remember the first
part of the story and forget the part about

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.720
accidentally turning your daughter into precious
metal and then almost starving to death.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.709
An even more common term is narcissism.

00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:46.850
This comes from the story of Narcissus, who
was so beautiful that he fell in love with

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.990
his own reflection in the water and drowned.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.430
Now, we use narcissism to mean pathological
self-involvement.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.850
Oh, also!

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.339
Before he drowns, he’s so busy loving himself
that he spurns the affection of the nymph

00:10:00.339 --> 00:10:05.420
... Echo, who is cursed by Juno to speak only
by repeating the words of others.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.350
We could go for days with mythological metaphor,
idiom and turns of phrase that’ve found

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.569
their way into English!

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:16.850
Adonises, gordian knots, leaving no stone
unturned, being MERCURIAL, having a NEMESIS,

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.970
or even… a phobia… and tons more.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.660
These stories have impacted the very language
we use, and the ways we understand each other,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.100
and much of our culture.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.050
At the beginning of the series we established
a definition of myths, saying that they’re

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:35.990
meaningful stories with staying power, stories
told for generations.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:40.370
Explaining the mythological origins of common
words and phrases shines a light on how deeply

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.530
ingrained they’ve become in our culture.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:48.560
They’re a reminder of how myths, even ones
from millennia ago, remain with us.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.430
You, me, Thoth, we’ve been through a lot
together.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.990
We’ve watched sky dad and earth mom fight,
we’ve seen worlds begin and end, we’ve

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:02.050
seen Loki be the worst, and witnessed just…
an UNBELIEVABLE amount of weeding.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.329
Tigers were ridden, gorgons were defeated,
coyote had some diarrhea.

00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:06.600
Hey, it happens.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.389
We hope you had a good time, learned a thing
or two–about how and why we tell stories,

00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:16.279
where we find meaning in the world, and why
we seek to create it.

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:21.170
Thoth and I are more than proud to have be
your guides on such an awesome journey –

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.790
Now, before we make our way to that bit of
the Elysian Fields reserved for Crash Course

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.050
hosts, we want to leave you with a question.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:34.500
What stories of today will become myths tomorrow?

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.660
We often think of myths as ancient, but … a
story told over a dozen generations… has

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.830
to start somewhere.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:47.199
In a hundred or a thousand years some tales
we’re telling right now may provide our

00:11:47.199 --> 00:11:52.300
descendents with heroes, tricksters, maybe
even a few monsters.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:58.759
Let’s just hope whatever they are - they
inspire more beauty than battle, more camaraderie

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.249
than conflict.

00:12:00.249 --> 00:12:05.899
From me, Thoth and the rest of the Crash Course
Myth team: See you soon.

00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:08.610
So long, and thanks for all the myths.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.920
Crash Course Mythology is filmed in the Chad
and Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianapolis,

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.810
IN, and is produced with the help of all these
nice people.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.259
Our animation team is Thought Café.

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:24.069
Crash Course exists thanks to the generous
support of our patrons at Patreon.

00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:27.809
Patreon is a voluntary subscription service
where you can support the content you love

00:12:27.809 --> 00:12:31.810
through a monthly donation, and help keep
Crash Course free, for everyone, forever.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.189
Thanks for watching, and now that shows over,
time to throw a bacchanal!

00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:35.189
Abrosia for all!

00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:37.029
Except ambrosia is tater tot pizza.

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:40.529
|| JUST KIDDING I’M NOT SPENDING ETERITY
IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS - I’m returning soon

00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:41.910
