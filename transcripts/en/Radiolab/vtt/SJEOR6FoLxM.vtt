00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.230
<v 1>Hey, it's Molly Webster from radio lab. Before we get into the show today,</v>

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.850
I wanted to tell you something and that's it. Radiolab has a newsletter. We do.

10
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.920
It's awesome. You should sign up for it.

11
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.470
You'd be the first to know about new episodes.

12
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:45.650
You'd get updates on old ones and lots more to sign up.

13
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.190
Go to radiolab.org/newsletter see ya.

14
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.900
This is Radiolab.

15
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:54.800
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich and this hour on radio lab,

16
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:59.000
we're looking at space more specifically our place in it,

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.890
our place in the cosmos. It's big. We're liberal, yes, but since,

18
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:05.060
as you mentioned before the break,

19
00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:09.350
sometimes artists have their own particular ways of tilting things back in our

20
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:10.184
favor.

21
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.170
<v 2>Let me introduce you to someone. Introduce yourself. He's an artist. Oh,</v>

22
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.390
I'm Daria. Roberto. Dario Rigoletto artists live in San Antonio, Texas.

23
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.910
I ran into Darrio actually in New York at the Whitney Museum.

24
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.980
He was 27 and this was his first solo show. My first show here in New York,

25
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.580
first solo show at the Whitney sculpture. Mostly that's his main thing,

26
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.520
but on a sidewall he was displaying some photographs. So tell,

27
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.410
tell me what we're looking at, which I asked him to show me. Oh,

28
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.780
it's a series of seven digital photographs framed on the wall side by side,

29
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.410
seven photos all showing the same thing. Tomato seeds,

30
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.000
seeds that are at different stages of a blossoming. Um,

31
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.630
think back to kindergarten. That's what these remind you of. Your Day.

32
00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:58.990
Your teacher came in and said, okay, class, we're going to grow some seats.

33
00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:00.880
These pictures are of that day.

34
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.590
But more specifically the day the seats actually grew because each photo,

35
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.720
and there are seven shows, one seat,

36
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.430
tiny little seed poking its head out of a massive cup. So what I did was,

37
00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:14.470
these are custom made porcelain cups.

38
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.270
If you can imagine the size of a Styrofoam Cup Darrio made the cops put some

39
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:23.050
dirt and a seed inside and then cram the top full of cotton cotton,

40
00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:27.940
which is also another school room element. Final step. When the seeds grew,

41
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.450
like right at the moment that they grew, he snapped photos there.

42
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.960
Each one's had a slightly different stage of development, but basically it's,

43
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.350
it's that moment when the leaves are pushing it. Like, you know,

44
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.910
waking up from a long sleep,

45
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.130
which that one kind of looks like yawning and your arms go up in the air. Uh,

46
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.060
also I should point out that there's text printed right on the cups, just as if,

47
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.751
you know,

48
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:53.490
a kid had written their name or something loopy cursive when you read me with

49
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.420
the names of the people on there. Yeah. So we have, uh, MJ Smith, F, r Scobey,

50
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.490
s c Jay Resnick missions. Maybe you recognize those names. Maybe not. Um,

51
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.980
but here's the backstory. Stereo tells it.

52
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.750
It's 1984 everyone's excited about space and NASA,

53
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.010
NASA built this probe.

54
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:17.011
It's called the LDF stands for the long duration environmental facility.

55
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.500
This was a probe that was basically meant to store things for long periods of

56
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:24.550
time. So it had all these compartments, 52 compartments I believe.

57
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.620
And NASA for the first time opened it to the public. It was brilliant PR.

58
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.590
They said, okay America, we've got this probe with all these compartments.

59
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.190
What would you like descend into space? They kind of said,

60
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.210
you send in a proposal for what you'd like to put on board and we'll consider

61
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:45.010
it. People of all stripes sent in ideas and farms, paint samples,

62
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.750
pond water all the way to a group of school. Kids got together and said, hey,

63
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:51.370
can we put some seeds on board?

64
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.480
So a NASA is,

65
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.510
I think seeing the great potential in what these children proposed further

66
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.300
experiments of it and put a board,

67
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:08.920
a lot of seeds for the sole purpose that when they returned they would be

68
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.580
redistributed to the classrooms as a cool, you know,

69
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:16.390
space seed artifacts. April six, 1984,

70
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.560
the probe filled with seeds and all kinds of things goes aboard the space shot.

71
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.510
It goes a board on, uh,

72
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.500
the space shuttle Challenger launches successfully probe is deployed from the

73
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:31.501
Challenger and it was scheduled to be picked up on the next shuttle mission by

74
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:35.200
the Challenger. Well,

75
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.590
the day on that pickup mission was the day the Challenger exploded

76
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.180
<v 3>coming up on the 32nd point in a countdown.</v>

77
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.790
[inaudible] go for auto sequence start

78
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.910
four three, two, one

79
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.830
<v 4>don stopped the 25th space shuttle mission and it is cleared the tower,</v>

80
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.610
the major malfunction. The vehicle has exploded.

81
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.140
<v 3>When you say procedures are in effect</v>

82
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.010
<v 1>in a flash seven people were gone</v>

83
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.650
<v 2>and America changed its mind about space and the whole space program got put on</v>

84
00:05:21.651 --> 00:05:26.270
hiatus for I think it was almost two years. And meanwhile that little probe,

85
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.090
the challenger had been on its way to get in,

86
00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:33.020
which was only supposed to be up there for about nine months. Well,

87
00:05:33.021 --> 00:05:33.854
it stayed up there.

88
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.420
This is a case where something literally got lost in space because this is

89
00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:42.080
floating out there. This probe designed for nine months,

90
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.840
ends up sitting in orbit from seven years.

91
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.710
<v 1>January 19th, 1990.</v>

92
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.210
The probe is finally brought back after seven years by another space shuttle

93
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:56.580
mission. This time without fanfare,

94
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.440
because all the kids that would've wanted those seeds were grown up.

95
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.720
They didn't know or care anymore. And the only people that did were collectors,

96
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.540
<v 2>NASA geeks and, and Darrio.</v>

97
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.580
I was able to obtain some of those seeds that were on a board that day through

98
00:06:13.861 --> 00:06:17.450
an online auction. Luckily, they were vacuum sealed the whole time, uh,

99
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.110
but they were incredibly moody little seeds. Uh, they did not want to cooperate.

100
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.100
He planted the seeds in the cotton field cups and the seeds did break through

101
00:06:26.101 --> 00:06:30.270
the cotton, like spaceships bursting through clouds. And right as they did,

102
00:06:30.271 --> 00:06:34.470
he snapped photos, but then days later,

103
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.770
and suddenly they all died. All of them.

104
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.830
So none of these seeds are alive anymore now. And, and I,

105
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.850
I wanted them to, and like I said, they just,

106
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.110
something just wasn't right anymore. I had originally, you know,

107
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.730
wanting to take them to full bloom. It just, it wasn't meant to be,

108
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.670
but getting it here, it was quite a miracle.

109
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.090
So I'll take this the stage

110
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.200
<v 1>and if you willfully invest in the illusion of a photograph, as Daria does,</v>

111
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.870
this stage means that the seeds and everything,

112
00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:11.220
they represent the lives of the crew, the hope of a class of school kids.

113
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.180
<v 2>It's frozen alive again</v>

114
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.010
<v 5>forever, forever.</v>

115
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.673
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

116
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.820
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

117
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.190
<v 1>again, this is just an art project.</v>

118
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.180
Sometimes reality doesn't cooperate because here's the sad coda to the story.

119
00:07:34.181 --> 00:07:38.320
It turns out the shuttle that picked up the probe in 1990 and brought it back

120
00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:43.321
was the Colombia and just before Darya was preparing to show his [inaudible]

121
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.140
<v 2>pictures.</v>

122
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.830
Just by coincidence I had the photographs laid out in front of me going over

123
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:51.820
some framing issues. When the tragedy was first reported

124
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.710
<v 5>that morning we were breaking in with the sad news this morning.</v>

125
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:58.700
The space shuttle Columbia has been seen apparently breaking up in the skies

126
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:00.620
over Texas as it returned to Earth.

127
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.410
Shortly after 9:00 AM eastern time this morning,

128
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.880
search and rescue teams are reporting those. Suddenly the only two shuttles

129
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.650
<v 2>the seeds ever had anything to do with where the two that we lost.</v>

130
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.140
It really hit me hard.

131
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.833
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

132
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.190
<v 2>Daria over blood was an artist, lives in San Antonio, Texas.</v>

133
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.610
<v 5>Nobody promised space travel would be safe or pleasant or easy reason.</v>

134
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Rewarding holder was promised was that it would be an adventure and sometimes we

135
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.620
were in the mood and sometimes

136
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.440
<v 1>we worked well and [inaudible] Carl sagans widow who began the show,</v>

137
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.740
she remembers what it was like the very beginning.

138
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.640
President Kennedy 1962 makes a speech,

139
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.160
which if you read about it in Hurghada tests,

140
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.490
you know that some Persian decreed

141
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.950
<v 7>that we would walk on the moon,</v>

142
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.280
<v 8>wait [inaudible] that go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon.</v>

143
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.340
<v 7>It was the stuff of, uh,</v>

144
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.970
<v 8>do we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other thing?</v>

145
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.660
Not because they are easy, but because they are hard.

146
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.380
They call that goal well serve to organize and measure the best of our energies

147
00:09:20.441 --> 00:09:25.060
and skills because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept.

148
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.920
One we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win.

149
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.300
Yeah,

150
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.860
<v 7>of course. It was in reality,</v>

151
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.400
part of the worst part of the Cold War and the madness of the nuclear arms race.

152
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:43.840
But it brought out the very best in a whole bunch of people.

153
00:09:43.841 --> 00:09:48.841
And I remember feeling first walking on the moon when Americans first walked on

154
00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:53.710
the moon. You know, I was in raged at my government's conduct in the world.

155
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.000
Horrified by it. But I had to admit that it made me really proud.

156
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.170
And then as soon as NASA became involved with space shuttle,

157
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.170
we lost the grand purpose.

158
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.620
And it was very much to me as a mother of two children remembering when they

159
00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:11.681
were young,

160
00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:14.380
that when they would were toddlers and they were first learning to walk,

161
00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:19.381
they would run away from me and encounter some frightening reality 10 12 feet

162
00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:26.440
away, and then turn around and come running back to be around my ankles.

163
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.100
And that's what the last 25 years of the space program has been like a kind of

164
00:10:32.621 --> 00:10:35.170
retreat to our mother's skirts. Yep.

165
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.150
<v 5>According to Annie Draughon, somewhere around the space shuttle,</v>

166
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.060
we lost our nerve. Yeah.

167
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.120
Although there is now a new generation of people who would be space explorers

168
00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:48.930
and who say then the loudest possible way.

169
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.990
We don't want to be sissies in space anymore.

170
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.870
But of course we've thought about the government always as the person taking us

171
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.480
there. Okay, this guy, but I put forward here,

172
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:02.340
the government is not going to get us there.

173
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.880
The government is unable to take the risks required.

174
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.230
Open up this precious frontier. The shuttle is costing $1 billion a launch.

175
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.220
That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable. That was Peter Diamandis.

176
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:18.190
Remember him? [inaudible] guy who offered the x prize x prize,

177
00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:23.010
the x prize global contest to build the first commercially manned spaceship.

178
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.400
That space prize, right?

179
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.610
He was at a conference in Oxford in England called Ted Global.

180
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.790
It was an audience filled with entrepreneurs and technologists and he said to

181
00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:33.060
them, you know why I created this prize? You know,

182
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.430
it's really gonna get people interested in space, exploring space,

183
00:11:36.431 --> 00:11:40.200
taking risks in space. Again, as we go forward and here I um,

184
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.550
he's instinct is kind of different from any dreams.

185
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.650
What's gonna bring people back to space, he says, is wealth money? In fact,

186
00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:52.330
the greatest wealth you think about these other asteroids, wealth asteroids,

187
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.300
think how much you make. If you could own an asteroid,

188
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.010
there's a class of the nickel iron,

189
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.960
which in platinum group metal markets alone are worth something like $20

190
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.030
trillion.

191
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.560
If can go out and grab one of these rocks in my plan is actually by puts on the

192
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:08.890
precious metal market and then actually claim that and go out and get one that

193
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:11.260
will fund the actual mission to go and get one. Hold on. What a,

194
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.690
what a puts out of those, what you do to finance,

195
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.670
grab in one of those rocks as he puts it.

196
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.470
But the key here remember is that you got to create a business and to do that

197
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:24.170
you need a business plan. Some reason to invest and build and do for that,

198
00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:25.590
he has actually kind of a cool phrase.

199
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.490
You need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space,

200
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.700
which in ordinary English means that there's gotta be some way to get

201
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.440
entrepreneurs to spend money, their own money on some kind of space stuff.

202
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.120
And how exactly. Well,

203
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.660
his first notion was he would sell tickets to rich billionaire.

204
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.290
He sold a seat on the Russian space shuttle,

205
00:12:45.291 --> 00:12:49.460
the Soyuz for $20 million, $20 million.

206
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.170
What? It is expensive, but people are willing to pay that.

207
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.280
And then new people I know. Well, but yeah,

208
00:12:58.281 --> 00:13:00.700
I guess you're not going to get a whole lot of people at prices.

209
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.700
So then he came up with a bigger, bolder, broader plan,

210
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.990
which was a prize prize because remember when Charles Lindbergh flew across the

211
00:13:08.991 --> 00:13:10.940
Atlantic, now I don't remember. I wasn't born yet.

212
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.430
Lindbergh cross the Atlantic to win a prize. That's really why you crossed.

213
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.180
Seriously. Yeah. For a cash prize. Peter Thought,

214
00:13:20.181 --> 00:13:22.550
why don't I create a prize of my own?

215
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:26.450
And he came up with the number 10 million bucks. That would be the prize.

216
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:27.830
And why 10 million?

217
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.480
Cause it was just big enough to be really attractive to young scientific teams

218
00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:33.201
all over the world.

219
00:13:33.201 --> 00:13:38.201
$10 million and just small enough to be boring to conservative,

220
00:13:38.361 --> 00:13:41.360
clunky companies like Lockheed and Bonnie would never think of anything

221
00:13:41.361 --> 00:13:43.580
interesting. Anyway, he's trying to split the difference I guess. Yeah.

222
00:13:43.581 --> 00:13:46.910
But Peter doesn't have that kind of money. He's not a government. So we're,

223
00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:49.100
do you get a $10 million?

224
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.670
Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for

225
00:13:52.671 --> 00:13:57.290
this. I went to 102 hundred CEOs, cmos, no one believed it was done.

226
00:13:57.291 --> 00:13:59.720
Everyone said, what does NASA think? What people are going to die?

227
00:13:59.721 --> 00:14:01.340
How can you possibly put this forward?

228
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:06.020
And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry and buying a

229
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.490
hole in one insurance policy.

230
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.220
You know how rare it is to hit a hole in one on a golf course?

231
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.060
Well the insurance industry will make you a betting proposition.

232
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.890
If you go to the insurance companies, say,

233
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.670
I bet that I can go up and down in space twice in the same two week period.

234
00:14:19.671 --> 00:14:20.930
And they go, Nah, you can't. They said, well,

235
00:14:20.931 --> 00:14:25.850
I'll give you $1 million in premiums if you give me a $10 million insurance

236
00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:28.940
policy. He made the offer, insurance company said, well,

237
00:14:28.941 --> 00:14:30.230
this isn't going to happen. Right?

238
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.600
The insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed and said,

239
00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:34.760
are you gonna compete now you're going to compete. No,

240
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.050
no one's gonna win this thing.

241
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:41.180
So they took a bet that no one would win by January of Oh five and I took a bet

242
00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:42.014
that someone would win.

243
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.890
And Amazingly today,

244
00:14:48.891 --> 00:14:53.780
pilot Mike Melville made aviation history two months before the deadline,

245
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:59.020
privately funded rocket plane space ship one flew to the edge of space in a

246
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:02.890
privately funded vehicle. Cool. So and,

247
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:06.670
and the best thing is that they paid off and, and the check didn't bounce.

248
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.580
Plus he got tons of publicity.

249
00:15:09.581 --> 00:15:13.030
He incentivize young scientists all over the world who did it with other

250
00:15:13.031 --> 00:15:16.570
people's money. But then you just as he was finishing the presentation,

251
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.490
there was this guy in the room who got up and said,

252
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.670
I almost wasn't going to ask this cause I didn't want to end on a negative note.

253
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.420
You know, Peter Diamandis, maybe you're not that brilliant.

254
00:15:25.421 --> 00:15:28.480
Maybe all you are is lucky. Um,

255
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.140
by encouraging innovation. So, uh,

256
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.240
effectively you are encouraging risk-taking and it is inevitable that sooner or

257
00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:41.830
later there will be deaths. The results. Absolutely. And you are also,

258
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.220
it was a little too enthusiastic. Um, you've also made a very, um, uh,

259
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.850
coherent, uh, explanation of why, frankly in PR terms,

260
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.830
investing in prizes is very,

261
00:15:53.831 --> 00:15:57.580
very good value because you got the vast amount of publicity and you're assuming

262
00:15:57.581 --> 00:16:02.020
it's all good publicity. But I can just see the,

263
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.070
again,

264
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.900
the u s broadcast media and the British press media ripping you to shreds

265
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.220
because you've encouraged lots of innocent young 25 year olds from Romania and

266
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:15.240
Argentinian and whatever to kill themselves. All right, great. Quick onset.

267
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.170
Okay, well it's an important answer guys.

268
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.450
I mean I'm going to pick my hat on as American.

269
00:16:19.451 --> 00:16:21.700
I am thankful that 500 years ago,

270
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.720
thousands of people gave their lives to cross the Atlantic and explore the

271
00:16:25.721 --> 00:16:29.590
Americas and then thankful that that 200 years ago they crossed the great plans.

272
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.830
No one has the right to stay for my children and their children,

273
00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:36.280
that we shouldn't take the risk now to open these frontiers and if it's up to

274
00:16:36.281 --> 00:16:38.140
the individual to risk their life, so be it.

275
00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:46.580
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

276
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.090
<v 5>yeah, but that's, that's, that's the, that was a cop out answer, I have to say,</v>

277
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.210
because when those people,

278
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:56.240
he's referring to the people crossed the Atlantic crossed the plains when they

279
00:16:56.241 --> 00:17:00.350
did all those things and then when many of them died, I mean thousands of,

280
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.650
I don't know how many thousands. I'm sure now. Anyway, when they died,

281
00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:06.710
those early Americans, they died alone.

282
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.030
There were no TV crammers around. There's no Scott Simon on the radio.

283
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.540
They were by themselves. I think you're right. He's a completely different time.

284
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.660
When you make it sensational, people will die.

285
00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:22.070
Sensationally then what's going to happen to the money and the entrepreneurs and

286
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:23.960
the businessmen, right? That's exactly right.

287
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.980
Businessmen don't exactly have a sterling reputation for sticking by their guns.

288
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:31.370
If you have a small financial problem showing up in Brazil,

289
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:33.730
people all over the world pull their money out of Brazil.

290
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.590
You got a total rush for the exits. It's true.

291
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.450
They're always the first to leave, you know, money and wealth.

292
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:42.950
It's a good motivators to get us back to space, but once you get there,

293
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.500
it's gotta be about something more than that. Like what though?

294
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.040
Because I agree with you, it's, I don't even know what to call

295
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.260
<v 1>it exactly, but you certainly hear it.</v>

296
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.110
Take the last transmissions from the moon.

297
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.320
December of 1972 [inaudible] last time we were there. Yeah,

298
00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.910
the last time we were there at the voices.
