Speaker 1:          00:00          But it's not an ethereal thing like a thought, you know what I mean? Yeah. Like, so here's one of fiddy of phobia or rack neophobia, fear of snakes or spiders. Those that, have you ever seen anybody who has that? Oh, you were on fear factor with me. Oh my God. That was awesome. That was the word I should say. You were, you made it out bro. Boge laces. No. Do you remember I was on this in one episode one I was the pilot episode, the pilot episode. That's where I met you for the first six T. Can you believe 16 what? 2001 yeah. What does that, what are we, it's eight 18 years ago we met because that was, that was right after nine 11 yes. Yeah, right after it. And they flew us down and the first time I met you, it was that saddle ranch and you're like, welcome this dude.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Oh Man. Okay. This, this is later. This is later is way later when we did the new season of it in like 2011 yeah. You tried to get me to eat that spider. Yeah. That's when I was acting like a spad bro. Dude, dude, that's not a normal, and you just chomped it like a chance. So this whole scene, I'm acting like a little bit, how a little, little fearful you had eat sheeps, eyebrows, eyeballs to eat. Dude. Now those were disgusting. Have you ever, did you eat the sheep? He did because I felt bad for you guys. That was before I had hardened. I'd been hard into the world as you guys were episode one. Season One. It didn't seem right for me that you guys would have to eat these things and I didn't need it. So I said, all right, if you guys eat it, I'll eat it too.

Speaker 1:          01:25          But they didn't show it like they wouldn't show it on television that I ate it because they didn't like, they didn't want it to look too easy. Yeah. So weird shit. But yet, oh my God. I remember biting down into it and it kind of like burst. Yeah. Then that retina, the, he had to just chump change. Yeah. You had to chew on that rent and we had to eat three of them. Yeah, they weren't good. No, they were horrible. But you know, it was surprisingly mild. I ate a roach. Well, I'm not not bragging, it's a place like much just a Roche even though it doesn't taste like much. Like why don't you eat a roach? Is that part of the show?

Speaker 1:          02:02          It was a celebrity fear factor. And um, there was a young lady who was scared to eat a roach and uh, she was going to get eliminated from the show. And so I said, listen, I'll make you a deal. I'll, if you do it, I'll do it. And she's like, you will. I go, yeah, I will. And she wouldn't do it. So she made a deal like three worms. She decided I'll eat three warm, like we can go shoot up to three more times. And so then I ate a row. I remember when I was on that show, the question they would ask you in the survey is, what's your fear of dying? And I wrote down dying on the water because that would be my biggest fear is dying underwater. And so the, our last stunt was when they dumped us on the water and my friends still send me screenshots of that because that's when I had long hair and I'll put a bunch of gel in it and they dumped me under the tank and literally it looked like a squid shooting out.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Oh my God. If you could Google it, Google Michael, Yo uh, fear of fat and it's, my friends will just screenshot that and they still play that to this day. They still play that episode of your family. All of them. They play him on um, different like true TV or something like that. One of those, I remember those. I remember when we were talking I'll go cause you are, what show were you on at that time was radio. You were on news radio. That was a couple of years earlier. Hey, you are, look at that. What happened? Yeah. And okay, so that's the cheap, I bought Michael Yo cheap sai bowls. So at the Ed at the ed I go to Joe and I go, hey man, I can't do the last dot. Look at that. I can't. Okay. So this is you talking to me cause Joe goes, Joe goes, hey, I, I go Joe, I'm not going to be able to make it through this whole stunt.

Speaker 1:          03:42          I can't hold my breath for that long. And you go, oh, just make it look great for the camera. So what I, I was going to try to talk you into it, but I wasn't good enough at it. Then I did. I had to figure out how to talk people into it because I knew there's some people that were just psyching themselves out yet in the smoker one our episode, that guy that we thought that was going to lose no oxygen. Yeah, it's fucking system. He's used to having no oxygen and that's when they cast it fear factor Alpha personality. And then it just became a hot fest. Like if you're a sexy of it. It was also, um, you know, they kept ramping up the difficulty of stuff. Like the last season scared the shit out of me when they were launching a car through a moving train and an explosion happens when the car looks like what you can kill somebody.

Speaker 1:          04:32          Like, and when I came up to your, uh, I think it was the last season, y'all are doing something with a donkey. Dong Daci come that's got canceled. Yeah. Yes, because I remember showing up and Joe says, come here Yo, you're about to try talking. Like what was so crazy, everybody was going to quit when I showed up that day and they brought the paper into my trailer and they told me what it was going to be. I don't think I knew about that one before. Some of them I had known about, knew about before, but I don't think I knew about that one. I think when they brought that in, I had no idea and I was like, you can't do this. I'm like, no one's going to do it. First of all, they're all gonna quit. But what was hilarious is I'm sitting there next to you watching them drink this stuff. We're just laughing.

Speaker 1:          05:19          How about an intern had a drink it and intern had drinking. I think they only got like $100. What for what? Well there was like, part of the thing is that they would have to test it when, when they would like say here's some fear factor info. So like say if you had to eat like a kidneys, right? How many, how many kidneys can someone eat in a minute? You know, like how much, how much meat can you actually look consistent, gusting dried meat can you consume? And so what we had was certain interns, they would volunteer for it and they would get like an extra hundred and something dollars and I would always give him money too. I was getting a couple hundred bucks on top of it, but they would, they would eat whatever the fuck it was and then they would determine all right, well Mike usually can put it down like, like, like no one.

Speaker 1:          06:06          And if he could only get through three and then some other producers would come in and go, fuck this. We're being pussies. Making me for like for you guys are crazy. And this was like the debate, the bay debate on the set would be like how much blood did they drink? One Gallon, one gallon of blood, like they never drank but, but you know what I'm saying? Like how many horse Dicks, they never had a horse deck, but they did eat like what? What's six and elk? Dick's and deer. Dicks. But the donkey come was the worst. Oh yeah. And I even remember at the shit you were like, yeah, I think the show's over after this. I like, they didn't air it. I think they didn't, they couldn't even other countries though of did it. Really? Yeah. So he could get it like in, I think it's like Dutch and so it's like you hear, you hear us talk in English but then they have Dutch subtitles.

Speaker 1:          06:51          Yeah, that, that was, that was such so stupid. It's so, Doug, are you surprised how stupid people are to go? No, because I think people are like, look, it's an experience. I'm here for the experience. I'm going to have some fun. This is crazy. But when you get to donkey come yet you're kind of being rude. Yes folks. You know you got donkey, this donkey, then the donkey come is like an advantage of their need for fame in a weird way. No you are. But Hey, they want to give it, that's the game. And I remember you showing it to me first and it was in this large glass container and they, and it wasn't a little, they had to drink. No, no, no. It was like to drink a lot. Yeah. It was like the aforementioned rhino horn beer mode. Fuck large chunk. Yeah. You know what's even more offensive on donkeys are they're not fertile.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Look at it. There it is. Oh that's him. Yes. So that come is useless. It's not just come. But imagine it's like it's, it's come that can never even be babies. Okay. To Mail Shit. But I remember when y'all used to do stuff, this is disgusting. I remember I used to do stunts. It was actually a delicate, like people in other countries that actually ate it sometimes. Both. Sometimes. Yeah. Like balloon. So that's not, that's just being done. It's just being me. Okay. That's no other country is doing that just for fun. Keep up on that whole, uh, this in other countries, this is considered a delicacy. He gave up on that in a long time ago. Yeah. You had to push the envelope on that. Now one of the things that made things gross smell wise, it was actually really expensive cheese. They would go to this, uh, expensive was if a full monitoring, what do they call them?

Speaker 1:          08:34          What are they call one of those cheese places like Italian for cheese for my Tomas formality is for my shirt. Isn't it French too? Something like that is my, that's my translation. They both come from that. I'm dumb. I'm dumb. So there you go. But anyway, this cheese that we would use was disgusting. It smelled so bad, but apparently it tastes really good if you're into that kind of cheese. Like Bordain was really into stinky cheese. Like would talk to me about it. Like with passion like that, just the, the fucking stinkier the better like disgusting smelling cheese and the taste is fantastic. I'd be like, wow. I would think that the smell which we're turning you off taste buds. Absolutely. I don't know. It's like one of those things where I guess you catch like the right vibe, like you going in with the right attitude.

Speaker 1:          09:24          There is no attitude. If it stinks, fuck that dude is anything that smells cheese. And they would squeegee it off into a blender and then they blend it up with the other stuff, like worms and shit. It would make the worms taste horrific or smell horrific. Oh, so you were just messing with the smell sense. So it can make it seem like it was worse than the way can get worse because it smelled worse. So it was making more like smell it, but people would just start retching more. It was, it's a ridiculous fucking thing. It's a ridiculous thing to the show is really silly. No, but I, I love that these people wanted to be famous or you know, and that too, bro. But I wasn't, but no, no, no, no. But I was different to me too. That is different too, because how it happened, I was in Austin, Texas and there was an ad in a paper that goes, hey, have you ever done anything adventurous?

Speaker 1:          10:21          And I was like, no, let me go in for this Cathy. I was a radio DJ out there and um, at this radio station. So I go in and then Mikey, uh, they called them the chimp. He was the casting person. And literally two weeks later, three weeks later, I'm in Hollywood shooting this thing and then I meet you. And then I remember going up to you, cause I was in all, it was the first time in a Hollywood, I'll go and I knew you from news, right? And I was like, how do you do it? And you're gonna just fucking be yourself. You can be successful. And that's what you're doing right now. Just fucking being yourself. That's what you're doing to where, where we're trying, we're trying this. And I did listen, let ridiculous piece of advice. Just be yourself. No. Do whatever you do.

Speaker 1:          11:01          Don't improve right now forever. Good luck. Just be yourself. That's all you need, Bro. That's it. Just tell you wrong. Just believe in your dreams and make a vision board. Joe was just trying to get me on his face. Oh, just be you. All right? But it that is the right advice if, especially if you want to be an entertainer, if you can figure out how to be yourself as long as yourself is actually something interesting and if it's not working yourself. Yeah. And then you even said that about acting and he's like, I remember specifically saying, aw, act is not hard. It's just you yourself and you play that emotion. And I was like, oh that sounds easy. You like if they can comparison to stand up in some ways but does not like a disrespect, like the kind of shit that like Daniel late Daniel Day Lewis and Leonardo Dicaprio.

Speaker 1:          11:46          Well yeah, when they, when they get into a fucking roll and you're like, God damn that guy just own that shit. Like they get into what I'm talking about like sitcoms, acting. Yeah. Sitcom Act. And they were hiring you to be easy at that time. 100% yeah. So it was a, a slightly dumbed down version of me who is into slightly more conspiracy theories than me when I was on news radio. That's how it was. Yeah. It was basically me, like they wrote a lot of that conspiracy shit in after I'd talked to them about like JFK and fucking no Ufos and stuff.
