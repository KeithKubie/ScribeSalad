00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:01.165
- [Instructor] It might not be obvious

00:00:01.165 --> 00:00:02.784
when you look at these three equations

00:00:02.784 --> 00:00:04.850
but they're the exact same equation.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.925
They've just been
algebraically manipulated.

00:00:06.925 --> 00:00:08.633
They are in different forms.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:09.858
This is the equation

00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:13.400
and sometimes called standard
form for a quadratic.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.000
This is the quadratic in factored form.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.567
Notice this has been
factored right over here.

00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:20.192
And this last form

00:00:20.192 --> 00:00:22.150
is what we're going to
focus on in this video.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.025
This is sometimes known as vertex form

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:25.958
and we're not gonna focus

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.334
on how do you get from
one of these other forms

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:29.683
to a vertex form in this video,

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:32.250
we'll do that in future videos,
but what we're going to do

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.000
is appreciate why this
is called vertex form.

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:43.025
Now to start, let's just remind
ourselves what a vertex is.

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.667
As you might remember from other videos,

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:49.758
if we have a quadratic,
if we're graphing y

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:54.533
is equal to some quadratic
expression in terms of x,

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.649
the graph of that will be a parabola,

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.467
and it might be an upward opening parabola

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:02.300
or a downward opening parabola.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.683
This one in particular

00:01:03.683 --> 00:01:06.417
is going to be an upward opening parabola,

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:10.141
and so it might look something like this.

00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:12.058
It might look something

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.900
like this right over here.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.550
And for an upward opening
parabola like this,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.025
the vertex is this point right over here.

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:27.000
You could view it as this minimum point.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.200
You have your x-coordinate of
the vertex right over there

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.750
and you have your y-coordinate

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.842
of the vertex right over here.

00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:36.717
Now the reason why this
is called vertex form

00:01:36.717 --> 00:01:40.292
is it's fairly straightforward
to pick out the coordinates

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:42.817
of this vertex from this form.

00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:44.383
How do we do that?

00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:46.400
Well, to do that, we just have
to appreciate the structure

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.783
that's in this expression.

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:48.933
Let me just rewrite it again.

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:53.100
We have y is equal to three
times x plus two squared

00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:54.791
minus 27.

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.150
The important thing to realize

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.149
is that this part of the expression

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.308
is never going to be negative.

00:02:03.308 --> 00:02:05.808
No matter what you have
here, if you square it,

00:02:05.808 --> 00:02:08.667
you're never going to
get a negative value.

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:10.267
And so this is never going to be negative

00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:13.125
and we're multiplying it by
a positive right over here.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:14.758
This whole thing right over here

00:02:14.758 --> 00:02:18.508
is going to be greater
than or equal to zero.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.741
So another way to think about it,

00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:24.458
it's only going to be
additive to negative 27.

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:28.117
So your minimum point for
this curve right over here,

00:02:28.117 --> 00:02:30.275
for your parabola, is going to happen

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.425
when this expression is equal to zero,

00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:35.267
when you're not adding
anything to negative 27.

00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:37.583
And so, when will this equal zero?

00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:39.742
Well, it's going to be equal to zero

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:42.492
when x plus two is going
to be equal to zero.

00:02:42.492 --> 00:02:43.325
So you could just say,

00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:45.800
if you wanna find the
x-coordinate of the vertex,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.583
well, for what x value
does x plus two equal zero?

00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:51.542
And of course we can
subtract two from both sides

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:54.692
and you get x is equal to
negative two, so we know

00:02:54.692 --> 00:02:57.200
that this x-coordinate right
over here is negative two.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.508
And then what's the
y-coordinate of the vertex?

00:02:59.508 --> 00:03:01.933
You could just say, "Hey,
what is the minimum y

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:03.875
"that this curve takes on?"

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.417
Well, when x is equal to negative two,

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:10.375
this whole thing is zero and
y is equal to negative 27.

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.933
Y is equal to negative 27,

00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:15.875
so this right over here is negative 27.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:17.600
And so the coordinates of the vertex here

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.417
are negative two comma negative 27.

00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:22.183
And you are able to pick that out

00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:26.109
just by looking at the
quadratic in vertex form.

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.633
Now let's get a few more
examples under our belt

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:30.842
so that we can really get
good at picking out the vertex

00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:34.350
when a quadratic is
written in vertex form.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.534
So let's say let's pick a scenario

00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:39.100
where we have a downward opening parabola,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.925
where y is equal to, let's
just say negative two

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:44.675
times x plus five,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.417
actually, let me make it x minus five.

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:51.167
X minus five squared,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.400
and then let's say plus 10.

00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:00.108
Well here, this is gonna
be downward opening

00:04:00.108 --> 00:04:02.675
and let's appreciate why that is.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:06.842
So here, this part is still
always going to be non-negative

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:09.934
but it's being multiplied
by a negative two,

00:04:09.934 --> 00:04:12.833
so it's actually always
gonna be non-positive.

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:14.742
So this whole thing right over here

00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:18.909
is going to be less than or
equal to zero for all x's,

00:04:19.817 --> 00:04:22.592
so it could only take away from the 10.

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:24.275
So, where do we hit a maximum point?

00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:25.517
Well, we hit a maximum point

00:04:25.517 --> 00:04:27.275
when x minus five is equal to zero,

00:04:27.275 --> 00:04:29.783
when we're not taking
anything away from the 10.

00:04:29.783 --> 00:04:33.151
And so, x minus five is equal to zero.

00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:34.400
Well, that of course is going to happen

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.925
when x is equal to five,

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:38.875
and that indeed is the
x-coordinate for the vertex.

00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:41.249
And what's the y-coordinate
for the vertex?

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.508
Well, if x is equal to five
and this thing is zero,

00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:45.783
you're not gonna be taking
anything away from the 10

00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:48.208
and so y is going to be equal to 10.

00:04:48.208 --> 00:04:52.483
And so the vertex here is x equals five,

00:04:52.483 --> 00:04:53.721
and I'm just gonna eyeball it,

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:56.492
maybe it's right over here, x equals five.

00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:58.125
And y is equal to 10.

00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:00.491
If this is negative 27,
this would be positive 27,

00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:01.792
10 would be something like this.

00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:05.325
I'm not using the same
scales for the x and y-axis,

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:06.683
but there you have it.

00:05:06.683 --> 00:05:09.183
So it's five comma 10

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:13.508
and our curve is gonna
look something like this.

00:05:13.508 --> 00:05:17.333
I don't know exactly where
it intersects the x-axis

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:21.275
but it's going to be a
downward opening parabola.

00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:23.109
Let's do one more example

00:05:23.109 --> 00:05:24.842
just so that we get really fluent

00:05:24.842 --> 00:05:28.634
at identifying the
vertex from vertex form.

00:05:28.634 --> 00:05:31.158
So let's say, I'm just gonna make this up,

00:05:31.158 --> 00:05:33.908
we have y is equal to negative pi

00:05:35.575 --> 00:05:37.908
times x minus 2.8 squared

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:43.075
plus 7.1.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.950
What is the vertex of the parabola here?

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.017
Well, the x-coordinate is
going to be the x value

00:05:52.017 --> 00:05:55.592
that makes this equal
to zero, which is 2.8.

00:05:55.592 --> 00:05:56.925
And then if this is equal to zero,

00:05:56.925 --> 00:05:58.867
then this whole thing is
going to be equal to zero

00:05:58.867 --> 00:06:01.342
and y is going to be 7.1.

00:06:01.342 --> 00:06:03.029
So now, you hopefully appreciate

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.450
why this is called vertex form.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.808
It's quite straightforward
to pick out the vertex

00:06:08.808 --> 00:06:12.142
when you have something
written in this way.
