00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.600
We're continually being bombarded with suggestions about what we might do:

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.880
go jet skiing, study in Colorado, visit the Maldives, or set up a tech company out west.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.640
The modern world makes sure we know at all times just how much is going on out there.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:23.300
It's a culture in which intense and painful doses of FOMO, or fear of missing out, are going to be inevitable.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.740
There are two ways of looking at this: romantic or classical.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.820
To the romantic temperament, missing out causes immense agony.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.680
Somewhere else noble, and interesting, and attractive people are living exactly the life that should be yours.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.300
You'd be so happy if only you could be over there at that party with those people

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.960
working in that agency off Washington Square, or holidaying in that shack in Jutland.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.040
Sometimes it just makes you want to burst into tears.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.580
The romantic believes in the idea of a defined center, where the most exciting things are happening.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.860
At one time it was New York, for a few years it was Berlin, then London, now it's probably San Francisco

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.600
and in five years it may be Auckland or perhaps Rio.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.740
For the romantic, humanity is divided into a large group of the mediocre, and a tribe of the elect:

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.340
artists, entrepreneurs, the edgy part to the fashion world, and the people doing creative things with tech.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.300
As a romantic it's exhausting inside your soul.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.400
Your mother sometimes drives you nuts; her life is utterly dull. How can she accept it?

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.160
Why isn't she itching to move to the Bay Area?

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.220
She's always suggesting you take a job in Birmingham or inviting you on a walking holiday in the Lake District.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.040
Sometimes you're quite rude to her.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.460
You avoid certain people like the plague: that shy friend from school who struggles with their weight,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.640
the flat mate who's a telecoms engineer, who wants to go into local politics.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.080
Being around individuals who are so unglamorous and lacking in ambition can feel pretty fatal.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.360
For their part, classically minded people acknowledge that there are, of course, some genuinely marvelous things going on in the world

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.380
but they doubt that the obvious signs of glamour are a good guide to finding them.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.860
The best novel in the world, they like to think

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.680
is probably not currently winning prizes or storming up the best seller lists,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:18.060
It may be being written at this moment by an arthritic woman living in, the otherwise, unremarkable Latvian town of Liepāja.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.720
Classical people are intensely aware that good qualities coexist with some extremely ordinary ones.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.720
Everything is rather jumbled up: lamentable taste in jumpers is compatible with extraordinary insight.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.900
Academic qualifications can give no indication of true intelligence.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.980
Famous people can be dull.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.020
Obscure ones can be remarkable.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.880
At a perfect launch party drinking sandalwood cocktails at the coolest bar in the world

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.240
you could be feeling sad and anxious.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.080
You might have the deepest conversations of your life with your aunt,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.960
even though she likes watching snooker on television and has stopped dying her hair.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.100
The classical temperament also fears missing out,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.660
but it has a rather different list of things that they're afraid of not enjoying:

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.400
getting to truly know one's parents, learning to cope well with being alone,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.740
appreciating the consoling power of trees and clouds,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.360
discovering what their favorite pieces music really mean to them, chatting to a 7 year old child.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.760
As these wise souls know: one can indeed miss out on such extremely important things

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.540
if one's always rushing out a little too intently to find excitement elsewhere

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:34.880
heading off in haste to that stylish bar with a see-through elevator packed with some of the city's top creatives.
