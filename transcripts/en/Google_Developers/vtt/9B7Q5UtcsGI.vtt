00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.610
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's time to
talk about Android Things.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.550
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.400
And I'm standing here
with Vince, a product

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.560
manager on Android Things.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.280
VINCE WU: Hi.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.430
How you doing?

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
How you doing, man?

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.805
VINCE WU: Good.

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:22.530
Very good.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.117
It's a big moment for us today.

00:00:24.117 --> 00:00:25.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
let's talk about that.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.250
There was an announcement.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.230
What was it?

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.760
VINCE WU: Android Things 1.0.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.510
So we're ready.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.820
We're ready for business.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.650
We've been working on
this for quite a while,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.860
and now we're
available for people

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.027
to make commercial products.

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.068
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Is that
what it means to come out

00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:42.390
of developer preview?

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.470
VINCE WU: Oh, yes.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.800
So we have a full solution
for going from prototype

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.280
all the way to production.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.150
So if you take one of our
supported hardware modules,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.070
you can build very
interesting stuff.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.960
And in fact, we've
actually put it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.180
through its paces,
tried it out for real

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.810
with a couple of
large and small OEMs.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.257
And we have built
really cool products.

00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:04.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's
talk about that.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.320
This whole prototype
to production thing,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.950
that full spectrum is relatively
unique in the field of IoT,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.610
right?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.390
VINCE WU: Oh, yes.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.320
If we're talking about
prototyping on microcontroller,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.470
microprocessor SoCs, you've
got tons of solutions

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.520
out there to do that.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.340
But those solutions don't take
you to production, let alone

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.610
commercial launch.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.610
So that's what's different
with our solution.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.690
The other thing is long-term
guaranteed support.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.630
So we offer security
patches and stability fixes

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.911
for the long-term.

00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:35.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.940
Now, behind us is actually
a demonstration, really,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.360
of prototype to production.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.720
Can you tell me a little bit
about what's right there?

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.470
VINCE WU: Oh, yes.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.620
Oh, wow, this was a really,
really fun project for us.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.440
So at the time,
a lot of partners

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.210
were interested in
building a new product

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.490
category called smart displays.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.320
And they want to do
this really quickly.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.249
And they thought that
we could help them out.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.040
This was really fun,
because we started out

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.540
with literally a Lego demo.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.110
And this is exactly what
we showed the partners.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.850
What's in there is
our system module,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.090
the solution with
Android Things running.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.496
And we got this up and running
in just a couple of weeks.

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:12.620
It was really, really fast.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.940
It shows the power of
Android and the flexibility

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.786
of the platform.

00:02:15.786 --> 00:02:17.160
What they were
really interested,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.140
also, was they were
expecting that this

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.130
would be a product that
would be updated a lot.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.730
Because it's a new
product category,

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.300
they weren't sure how the
users would react to it.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.050
So there's a lot of A/B
testing, putting people

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.280
into different groups.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.377
And the app for Android Things
solution helped them do that.

00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:37.835
And as you can see
through here, it

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:41.160
went from literally Lego
prototypes all the way

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.930
to the real product.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.060
And we made this a little
bit hard on ourselves.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.120
We didn't want to just
build one product,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.170
but we wanted to build
multiple of them.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.601
So we have products from
JPL, LG, and Lenovo.

00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:55.350
And if you look inside,
what's really cool

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.890
is that they all use the
same system module, which

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.140
allows us to scale quickly
and go to production really,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.790
really fast.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And you've
got some other cool stuff

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.633
in the sandbox that you can play
with built on Android Things.

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:09.180
And I think one of my
favorites is these flowers that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.410
are using TensorFlow Lite.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.460
Can you tell me how they work?

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.251
VINCE WU: Oh, yeah.

00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.690
So this is, of
course, serious stuff

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.200
with real stuff on shelves.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.720
But we also wanted to inspire
the developer community,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.080
and so we built
a bunch of demos,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.070
just maybe a little
bit whimsical,

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.200
but it does showcase
the technology.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.090
So for example, we
have ML flowers.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.680
It's running machine
learning on-device,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.150
so it's totally offline.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.890
None of it goes to the cloud.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.960
It does detection of the facial
expressions-- so happy, sad.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.240
It also detects your face,
so it follows you around.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.967
We also have ones detecting
handwriting, et cetera.

00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:47.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.402
VINCE WU: It's a cool time.

00:03:48.402 --> 00:03:50.610
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And can you
tell me a little bit more

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.443
about the technology
behind that, TensorFlow

00:03:52.443 --> 00:03:53.490
running on the device?

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.780
VINCE WU: Oh, yes.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.670
So all of it is
running on-device.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.360
So you must have heard
the earlier announcement

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.530
around Firebase ML Kit.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.220
So all of that stuff
works on Android Things,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.510
as it does on
Android, of course.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.100
For the demos that we built,
we took some of the existing

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.500
models that we had
in Google Research,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.030
and we put them
onto the devices.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.850
And it basically just works.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.410
There's quite a few models
to play around with.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.520
The most obvious one, of
course, is photo detection.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.660
We showed that last year.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.110
What's different this year
is that it's not just photos,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.630
but it's actually live video.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.170
So it's all in real time,
taking a video of you,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.780
and detecting the
facial expressions,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.940
tracking your
face, and all that.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.630
Vince, if you want to get
started with Android Things,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.670
where do you go?

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.144
VINCE WU: Go to
androidthings.withgoogle.com.

00:04:43.144 --> 00:04:44.310
You'll get everything there.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.660
And if you're at I/O,
go pick yourself a kit,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.642
and let's go build
some hardware.

00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:51.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thank you, so much.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.608
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is "I/O Live."
