00:00:00.785 --> 00:00:03.577
Italy was an interesting
actor in World War I

00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:05.495
because it was one of the original members

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:07.802
of the Triple Alliance. In 1882,

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:11.875
Italy becomes a member
of the Triple Alliance.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:13.406
The whole reason why it was called a

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:14.803
Triple Alliance is because it was between

00:00:14.803 --> 00:00:18.489
Italy, Austria-Hungary and Germany.

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:21.572
Despite being part of that defensive pact,

00:00:21.572 --> 00:00:23.737
that they would defend
each other if any of

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:26.491
these other parties like
Russia were to attack them,

00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:27.566
or France were to attack them,

00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.575
it was an awkward alliance because Italy

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.267
was a historical enemy of Austria-Hungary.

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:34.535
Austria-Hungary had some
territory, especially

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.904
some territory where some
Italian speakers were.

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:40.003
Some Italian nationalists
were interested in recapturing

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:42.671
or having claims on
some of that territory.

00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:44.485
I've circled some of that right over here.

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:47.981
Right from the get-go it
was an awkward alliance.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.111
Even in that first Triple
Alliance, Italy got

00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:52.037
an exception for this defensive alliance.

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:54.675
It says we don't want to be
at war with Great Britain.

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:59.403
Then in 1902, Italy gets
into another secret ...

00:00:59.403 --> 00:01:01.817
or I guess this is the first
of many secret deals ...

00:01:01.817 --> 00:01:04.209
with France. If you've
ever played Diplomacy,

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.670
this is what Diplomacy's all about.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.667
You make a deal with one
person, but maybe in secret

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.271
you're making exceptions
with other people.

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:14.075
They get into a secret pact with France

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:16.199
where Italy's essentially
saying, "Look, you know,

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:17.741
even though we're a member
of this Triple Alliance

00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:20.336
and we've already said
we're not going to be at war

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.571
with Great Britain, we're also going to

00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:23.841
say that for France as
well. We're really not

00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:26.498
in a mood to be at war with you."

00:01:26.498 --> 00:01:29.833
Then when you fast forward to 1914,

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:32.804
and we're now at the
beginning of World War I,

00:01:32.804 --> 00:01:34.206
August, Germany declares,

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:37.066
July, Austria-Hungary
declares war on Serbia,

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.872
Russia begins to mobilize,

00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:42.706
Germany declares war on
Russia and on France,

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:45.372
Italy, because of this kind of awkwardness

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:46.878
in this Triple Alliance, actually decides

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:51.801
to stay neutral. Italy stays neutral.

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:53.801
Their justification for staying neutral

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.408
is that the Triple Alliance
is a defensive pact.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:57.932
It says, "Hey, we're
going to defend each other

00:01:57.932 --> 00:01:59.867
if anyone attacks us," but they're saying

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:02.616
that in 1914 at the
beginning of World War I

00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:05.801
it was Austria-Hungary that
decided to take the offensive.

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:07.637
It was Germany that took
the offensive, just based

00:02:07.637 --> 00:02:09.803
on mobilization in Russia, that took the

00:02:09.803 --> 00:02:13.293
offensive against France and in terms of

00:02:13.293 --> 00:02:15.122
declaring war on Russia. So Italy says,

00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:17.872
"Hey, look, this is a
defensive pact. The other

00:02:17.872 --> 00:02:22.139
two members of the Triple
Alliance, they're being offensive.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.875
We don't want ... That
means that we aren't

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.069
bound to it. We're only bound

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.936
to it in the event of defense.

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:29.870
As you can imagine, a lot of it was them

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.619
just trying to figure out
who's likely to win this,

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:35.391
in which scenario are they
likely to gain the most.

00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:41.749
So you fast forward to 1915,
in particular April 26.

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:45.286
The Italians are
negotiating with the allies

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:47.543
thinking about what type of
territory they could capture

00:02:47.543 --> 00:02:49.071
especially from Austria-Hungary.

00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:52.208
On April 26 they sign
the Treaty of London,

00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:54.168
which at this point is a secret.

00:02:54.168 --> 00:02:57.468
Treaty of London. It's
not broadcast to the other

00:02:57.468 --> 00:02:59.440
members of the Triple
Alliance, but it's an

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.399
agreement with the triple
entente that hey, look,

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.092
we are on your side.
We are going to declare

00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:07.332
war on the central powers imminently.

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:11.823
They do so in May 1915, on May 3.

00:03:11.823 --> 00:03:14.734
They back out of the Triple Alliance ...

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:21.708
out of Triple Alliance ...
out of Triple Alliance.

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:26.468
Then on May 23 they declare war

00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:28.370
on their historical enemy, but one of the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.335
co-signers of the Triple
Alliance declare war

00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:34.285
on the Austro-Hungarian empire.

00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:40.338
On the Austro-Hungarian empire.

00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:42.871
As we'll see, this was actually, Italy's

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:45.624
entering into the war on
the side of the allies

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:47.790
against Austria-Hungary, actually played

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.111
a major role in the eventual downfall of

00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:53.536
the Austro-Hungarians
and I'll go into that

00:03:53.536 --> 00:03:56.483
into more detail in the next video.
