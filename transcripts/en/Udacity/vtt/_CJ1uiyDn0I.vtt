00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.553
Here's the equation we want to solve. Great work if you found this one. I know

00:00:04.553 --> 00:00:08.949
this one was tough. The key idea to get started is to assign the variable. I

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:13.842
think it's best to let x equal the time it takes for the slower person. If we

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:17.181
let x equal the number of hours it takes the slower person to carpet the room,

00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:21.999
then we can use 1 over x for the first fraction. This would be one job

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:28.918
completed in x hours. The faster person works in 6 hours less time. So this

00:00:28.918 --> 00:00:33.598
means the second person could complete that same job, one job in x minus 6

00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:38.774
hours. Now we don't know who's faster Jamal or Danielle, we just know that the

00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:42.196
faster person does in in x minus 6 hours and the slower person does it in x

00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:48.574
hours. If we add the slower person's rate to the faster person's rate, we'll

00:00:48.574 --> 00:00:54.080
get 1 4th. One job completed in 4 hours. This is the amount it takes Jamal and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.710
Danielle to carpet the room together.
