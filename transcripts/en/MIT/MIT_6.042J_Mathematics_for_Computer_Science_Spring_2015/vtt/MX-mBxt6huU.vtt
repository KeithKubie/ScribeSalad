00:00:01.496 --> 00:00:02.870
PROFESSOR: In this
video lecture,

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.720
we're going to introduce
the idea of directed graphs,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.940
or digraphs for short.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.580
So normally and
before this class,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.170
you might have thought of graphs
as being something like this.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.530
Y is a function of x and
graphed on the xy plane.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.810
But that's not what we
want to be thinking about.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.710
Instead, we want to think
about something like this.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.870
This is a graph to a
computer scientist.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.800
Show a bunch of vertices, which
are those point that you see,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.210
and edges, which
connect vertices.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.550
Being more specific
and direct about this,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.530
it's composed of a
set V of vertices

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.750
and a set E of edges, which
are composed of 2V each.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.540
The way you write that
out, an edge is v comma w,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.590
and that specifies an
edge going from v to w.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.360
And in the graph, it would
look something like this.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.560
Note that they are directed.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.290
That an edge from v to
w is not the same thing

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.440
as an edge from w to
v in a directed graph.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.220
For example, here we
have one directed graph,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.936
and you write out vertices as
the set of all the vertices

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:04.519
you see there.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.342
And edges are pairs of vertices.

00:01:08.342 --> 00:01:11.060
You can also
realize that digraph

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.737
is the same thing as a binary
relation on the vertices,

00:01:14.737 --> 00:01:16.695
because each edge just
defines the relationship

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:18.480
from one vertice to another.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.900
So, every binary relation
can be drawn out as a graph.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.960
You just put each of the things
in each of the sets as vertices

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.450
and edges being the
things that relate

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.995
from one set to the other.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.400
So, now we're going to
define walks and paths.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.640
Now, a walk follows
successive edges

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.710
but it can repeat
vertices or edges.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.930
For example, I can start
at the black vertice there,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.720
and we can go to red,
blue, yellow, red.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.500
And w can go back to blue again.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.836
There's nothing stopping us.

00:01:53.836 --> 00:01:56.220
And the length of
these paths is not

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.200
how many vertices
we've gone through,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.150
but the number of edges
that we've gone through.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.480
So here, the length
would be five

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.230
because we went from white
to black, black to blue,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.949
blue to yellow,
yellow red, red blue.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.686
It's not the six vertices
that we went through.

00:02:12.686 --> 00:02:14.370
And you have to be
careful about that,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.550
because that difference
of one kind of gets you.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.190
A path, on the other hand,
walk through vertices with that

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.380
repeating a single vertex.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.810
So, for example, start at
blue, you can go to yellow,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.480
you can go red, you can
go pink, you can go green,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.160
but then we're stuck.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.610
We can't go back to red.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.910
We've already been there.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.750
So, that's it.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.280
That would be the
end of our path.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.615
If we went to red again, then
it wouldn't be a path anymore.

00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:42.110
Not be a valid path.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.380
And here, the [INAUDIBLE]
length is four edges, not

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.970
five vertices.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.890
And every graph
can be represented

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.190
as a matrix representation.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.680
You draw it out like this.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.180
And what we're going
to do is if there's

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.110
a edge that goes from one of the
things on the right over to one

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.360
of things on the top, we'll
put a one at that position.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.110
For example, there's an edge
that goes from the black

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.050
to the red.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.390
So, on the black row
in the red column,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.381
we're going to put in a one.

00:03:15.381 --> 00:03:17.630
Same thing, there's one that
goes from black to green.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.530
We'll put black row, green
column, put in another one.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.940
And so on for all the edges
that we have in our graph.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.610
And the rest we just
filled with zeroes.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.120
And this is called
an adjacency matrix.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.340
And as you can see, it
uniquely defines a graph.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.260
Every edge is represented here,
and every one of the vertices

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.290
is represented here.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.460
So, any graph can be
drawn up this way.
