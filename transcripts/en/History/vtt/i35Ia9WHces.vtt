<i>- Hi, I'm Chase.
I'm in Alachua, Florida.</i>

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.210
Let me show you my shop.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.620
<i>[rock music]</i>

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.170
My grinders.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.960
This was a custom-made grinder.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.750
<i>My dad and I
put this together.</i>

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.420
It's running off
of an old air compressor motor,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.080
so it turns really fast,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.460
<i>takes off a lot of meat.</i>

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.040
And then I have
my bench-top grinder.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.290
Pretty heavy-duty stone wheels.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.920
Really good for taking off
lots of material.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.380
A drill press,
which was my grandfathers.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.710
Actually, both of these
were my grandfathers.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.750
These came out of his shop
after he passed away.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.250
So using these
is a pretty cool--

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.830
pretty cool thing
to be able to do.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.330
I have a piece of him
in my shop,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.920
and it kinda feels
like he's here with me.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.170
<i>- Hi there, I'm Brandon
from Blackfoot, Idaho.</i>

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.080
We're at my shop and I just
wanna give you a quick tour,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.330
show you my cool stuff
I've got.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.420
So, come on in.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.170
I've got
this horizontal grinder.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.580
It's been key

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.920
in the construction
of many blades now.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.210
<i>It's one of my favorite tools.
We built it from scratch.</i>

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.380
I turn this switch on...
[metallic whirring]

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.380
The belt comes on and I can do
all kinds of fancy grooves,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.580
I can replace these wheels
with smaller or bigger wheels.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.620
It works really well.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.000
<i>My main belt grinder,</i>

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.790
this here is one
I put together

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.120
after getting the frame.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.500
<i>Put the motor on it
and everything.</i>

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.830
<i>It's a Coody brand.</i>

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.290
I've had it
for a couple years now,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.790
and I really like it.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.830
<i>- I have a turtle hammer.</i>

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.420
This is a really,
really cool piece.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.170
Let me show you
how an older school,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.120
non-power hammer works.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.540
It's pretty loud,
but pull this out

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.460
to keep the tension
on the springs,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.790
and then you just...

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.920
[clangs loudly]

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.210
Smack down...

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.380
[clangs loudly]

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.710
<i>♪ ♪</i>

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.460
Really heavy,
but once you get going,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.790
the momentum works really well.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.120
- Right here is
my favorite part of my shop.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.710
It's my favorite tool.
I love it.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.250
<i>It's my 50-pound
little giant power hammer.</i>

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.670
<i>It works like a charm.</i>

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.250
<i>I mean, everybody knows
how they work,</i>

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.330
so I won't fire it up
'cause it's loud as hell.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.710
But it's amazing.
It's--it's my favorite tool.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.620
<i>I love it. I was able to pick
this up last fall.</i>

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.000
So that's my shop.
Thanks for checking it out.
