00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.350
Andre Gardes was an unemployed nuclear physicist
from France.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.110
Mr. Gardes believed himself the rightful heir
and “Seigneur” of the small formerly feudal

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.750
state of Sark.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:30.800
In August of 1990, Gardes decided to stage
an invasion to forcefully set himself up as

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.970
the ruler of Sark’s 610 inhabitants.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.330
Apparently unable to get anyone to follow
him, he decided only a one man force was necessary.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.730
Gardes, being a civilized man, arrived the
night before the invasion and posted notices

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.610
of his impending takeover the following day
at noon.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.640
As the actual Seigneur of the island, John
Michael Beaumont, stated, “He was such an

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640
odd chap.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.850
He turned up one night and started putting
up signs saying he was going to take over

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.670
the island next day at noon.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.010
They read very like German wartime notices
(the island had previously been taken over

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.440
by Germans in WWII, who also announced their
intention to take over the island via notices

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.180
before arriving with soldiers the next day).

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.990
Most people thought it was a joke, but he
was serious.”

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.100
The local volunteer Constable, the only law
enforcement on the island, being informed

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.590
of the invasion thanks to the notices, decided
to take the threat seriously.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.680
On the morning of the invasion, Constable
Perrée began to plan the island’s defense,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560
which was a two stage scheme.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.490
First, he went looking for Mr. Gardes.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.290
He found him sitting on a park bench in army
fatigues preparing for the massacre that was

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.060
about to befall this island.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.079
As the Constable approached the invading army
(a.k.a. Gardes), he saw Gardes loading his

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.580
automatic weapon.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.900
The first “showing up” stage now complete,
Mr. Perrée executed the second stage of the

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.900
plan.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.790
He complimented Mr. Gardes on his choice of
gun and convinced Gardes to remove the magazine

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.990
and let him see the instrument of the island’s
assured defeat, so the constable could better

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.990
admire it.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.450
When Gardes acquiesced, the Constable took
the gun and punched him in the nose.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.799
The invasion was over.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.610
The gun used in the attempted coup now sits
in the Sark Museum next to old ships and a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.899
dedicated exhibit to one of the island’s
two original telephone calls.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.452
Sark itself is a “Crown Dependency”.

00:02:11.452 --> 00:02:16.810
Crown Dependencies are possessions of the
British “Crown” or the Monarch of England.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.840
However, they govern themselves independently
from any nation with the approval from the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.540
“Privy Council” (the council that advises
the crown).

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.160
At the time Mr. Gardes attempted to invade
the state, it was the last Feudal nation left

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.160
in Europe.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.330
The right to rule and govern the state rested
in the hands of a “Seigneur” and, as long

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.310
as he had permission from the Privy Council,
he was empowered to make the laws as he saw

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.310
fit.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.200
In the 16th century, Sark was granted “in
fief” by Queen Elizabeth I to Heliere de

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.330
Carteret, giving him the right to govern all
those on the island so long as he kept at

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.709
least 40 armed men to keep the island free
of pirates, as Sark island at the time was

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.020
a haven for pirates.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.160
Heliere did this, bringing in 40 families
to establish a community on the island.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.300
From there, the Seigneurship was passed down
in his family until 1844.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.610
In 1844, the island was mortgaged to John
Allaire so that the Seigneur could continue

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.069
to fund his silver mine.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.239
When this mine failed, the Seigneurship was
sold to Marie Collings for £6,000.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.780
Again the title was passed down through inheritance
through today.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.360
The privileges of the title included some
amazing benefits.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.930
For instance, a Seigneur is the only one allowed
to own and keep pigeons on the island… or

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.310
posses an unspayed dog….

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.569
If that doesn’t do it for you, the Seigneur
also is the only one who has the right to

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.459
keep “the flotsam and jetsam” that washes
up on the island.

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.250
Just because his/her Excellency gets all the
privileges, doesn’t mean they aren’t held

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.470
accountable by the people.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.080
The late Dame Sybil Hathaway once tried to
get battery-powered buggies to be permitted

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.720
on the island, as she was getting older and
having trouble getting around.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.540
This caused a major uprising and there was
almost a revolution over the matter.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.580
The feeling was that this might one day lead
to cars being permitted on the island!

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.190
If you’re wondering, while the island doesn’t
have cars, it does have an ambulance that

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.659
gets towed by a tractor.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.550
They also have a taxi, which is just a trailer
that is pulled by the same tractor that pulls

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.810
the ambulance.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.400
While these tenants may seem to have restricted
rights, to those of us accustomed to a more

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.350
democratic form of governance (I’ll keep
my own flotsam, thank you very much), they

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.400
do have it pretty nice on the island.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.859
For instance, they have virtually no taxes.

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.739
The only taxes on the island are: when property
is sold, there is a 7.7% tax on the sale;

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.360
a tax on alcohol; and a tax and tobacco.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.570
Finally, anyone owning a bicycle, tractor,
or horse, must pay a small annual fee.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.240
The revenue generated from this primarily
goes to helping the elderly in Sark (need

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.449
based), with the exception of the property
sale tax, which goes to the Seigneur.

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.270
The island is also nearly crime free with
the exception of the occasional crime committed

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.229
by a tourist who are then promptly kicked
off the island.

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.479
If one is wronged, even if by the Seigneur,
the islanders do have a simple means of handling

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.479
that.

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.620
All the victim needs to do is enact “Clamuer
de Haro”.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.009
In front of witnesses, the victim raises their
voice and recites The Lord’s Prayer.

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.220
They then must cry out, “Haro, Haro, Haro!

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.290
To my aid, my Prince!

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.080
I am being wronged!”

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.080
The offender is then required by law to stop
their offense until the matter can be decided

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.610
in court, which typically happens within the
next 24 hours.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.210
The island’s inhabitants must all get along
very well, and enjoy the system, as the last

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.310
“Clameur” was recorded in June of 1970.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.680
It was used to prevent the construction of
a garden wall.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.650
Alas this empire of worlds lost could not
last forever.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.830
In 2007, at the urging mostly of outsiders
buying land in Sark and being unhappy with

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.960
the feudal system, particularly the billionaire
Barclay brothers, Sir David Barclay and Sir

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.770
Frederick Barclay, who bought a nearby island,
Brecqhou, which is technically part of the

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.560
Sark nation, the Privy Council approved a
motion to usher in “universal suffrage”

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.840
for its 610 residents.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.420
This motion changes Sark’s governing body
of 40 landowners, or “tenants”, to a more

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.010
democratic system, using a 28 member “Chief
Pleas” body of elected officials to govern.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.810
This 2007 enactment also revoked the rule
of the Seigneur, though he does still serve

00:05:57.810 --> 00:08:21.370
many of the functions he did before, except
now anyone can 

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:36.740
own pigeons!
