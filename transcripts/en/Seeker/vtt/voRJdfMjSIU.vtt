00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:05.939
You know that old saying, "Put your money
where your mouth is?"

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.109
Turns out - not such a great idea!

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.630
I was just as surprised as you.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.009
Hey guys Tara here for Dnews - and it turns
out, everything is disgusting.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.169
You may have seen Anthony's video a while
back talking about all the gross, weird things

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.340
that were discovered on British bank notes
- but it turns out American dollars may be

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.439
even worse.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.820
A team of researchers at NYU have conducted
the first comprehensive DNA study on $1 bills

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.980
in Manhattan, and found 3,000 different types
of bacteria - which is way more than any previous

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.980
study.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.839
By far the most common bacteria they discovered,
is one known to cause acne.

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.989
And if that's not enough to convince you to
wash your hands after touching money, then

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.280
wait til you hear this.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.289
In addition to both mouth and vaginal microbes,
researchers also found genes linked to staph

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.190
infections, pneumonia, gastric ulcers, food
poisoning, and antibiotic resistance.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.160
They even found trace amounts of anthrax,
which is a common bacteria found in soil - but

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.720
isn't harmful enough to cause a reaction in
doses this small.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.140
Still creepy.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.120
And even creepier than that - less than half
the DNA they found was actually human.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.410
They discovered everything from horse DNA,
to dog DNA - even a snippet of white rhino

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.410
DNA.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.070
Because that makes total makes sense in Manhattan.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.070
Of course there's white rhino DNA.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.070
Why wouldn't there be?

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.680
Seriously though, most of this we shouldn't
be too surprised to hear.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.760
After all, money is one of the most frequently
exchanged items in the world.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.750
But American money is especially prone to
bacteria, because it's printed on cotton-based

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.510
paper - which is way absorbent than the plastic
polymer notes that countries like India and

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.940
Canada use.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.310
It also makes our money less durable.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.740
The average lifetime of a $1 bill, is only
21 months.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.411
And because of that, the Federal Reserve spends
almost a billion dollars every year just on

00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:57.411
printing new money.

00:01:57.411 --> 00:01:58.411
What do you guys think of this?

00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.720
Should America switch to a polymer-based currency?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.210
Imagine how great our skin would look!

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.280
It'll be like those awkward teenage years
never even happened.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.720
