00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.140
"Why You Should Be Grateful Everyday" by
Lazolia Buzuzi

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.410
For centuries cultures around the world
have linked the mind-body connection

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.910
with mental well-being and spiritual
insight. It's often associated with

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.140
religious practices and emotional
healing. Eastern societies have dominated

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.800
a holistic approach to maintaining
internal balance and psychological

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.230
health.
However we seem to have lost these

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.890
aspects of earlier human tradition in
our fast-paced modern Western

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.780
civilization. Mental disorders in the
United States and Canada are treated by

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.059
quick fixes. Be it prescription SSRIs
labels that excuse irrational behavior

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.129
or passive therapies. These aren't
necessarily bad without a doubt. Millions

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.280
of people have benefited from scientific
research and breakthroughs.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.899
Psychological study however focusing
solely on the technical aspects of

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.500
mental illness has ended up ignoring
important details of the human being

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.990
that lies within the self simple
practices like mindfulness, positive

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.470
affirmations, and meditative thought are
believed to promote resilience and

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.450
reduce negative mentality. Lately there's
been an increase in empirical scientific

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.819
evidence to back this up. Take gratitude,
for example. Expressing and feeling

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.239
gratitude towards someone or something
external has been shown to have

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:34.729
interpersonal benefits. In 2003 Emmons
and Mccullough were the first to study

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.200
the effects of counting blessings on
mental health. Adult participants were

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.099
randomly assigned tasks where they had
to record on a daily or weekly basis

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:47.929
their hassles, expressions of gratitude
or neutral affairs. At the end of the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.050
study period, there was a correlation
between the group that expressed

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.590
gratitude and the heightened sense of
mental and physical well-being

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.310
that recorded their blessings on a
regular basis reported a more positive

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.060
outlook on their livelihoods as well as
decreased physical symptoms and coping

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.200
behaviors unlike the hassle listing and
neutral groups.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.640
A few years later the same experiment
was done by Fro at all on school-aged

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.640
children.
The results were parallel to their adult

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.450
counterparts the group of young
adolescent children that recorded their

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.019
blessings on a regular basis were more
optimistic and satisfied with their

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.709
lives in comparison to the students who
reflected on their day to day hassles or

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.060
neutral events. The results of the study
were particularly exciting not only

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.780
because they warded off mental ailment
symptoms, but because they showed a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.560
relation between students gratitude and
improved satisfaction with their school

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.549
experience. A possible link between
gratitude and increased academic

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.410
performance. Although the results of
these studies are favorable showing the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.799
profound advantages of routinely
expressing gratitude even over the

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.630
period of a few weeks, gratitude is a
rather difficult term to define.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.950
Especially when it comes to identifying
how it benefits mental health gratitude

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.329
has been identified as an emotion
habitual act and a virtue of morality.

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.970
Among other things one must remember too
that simply talking or writing about

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.000
gratitude is not necessarily the same as
feeling it or actively practicing it.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.840
Even so when one reflects on the
positive aspects of their lives, they

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.430
experience an improved mood pro-social
behavior and a heightened status of

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.299
their mental well-being
to illustrate this think of the fact

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.380
that for over 2,500 years Buddhist
teachings have concentrated on treating

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.549
mental instability among Eastern culture
and have helped to find states of mental

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.540
well-being to optimal functioning using
strategies like regularly expressing

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.920
gratitude and mindfulness mental
disorders although complex conditions

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.970
involving factors that contribute to the
development of symptoms can be addressed

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.560
effectively by changing small daily
habits that tackle one's mind brain body

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.630
and spirit by working on these aspects
of one's being an individual seeking

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.370
assistance may improve the quality of
his life psychological disorders can be

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.030
effectively treated if knowledge from
generations of Eastern based traditions

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.030
are incorporated into Western scientific
study. So what are you waiting for it.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.849
Counting your blessings today and every
other day is sure to benefit your

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.319
overall health.

you've done so and what benefits you've
