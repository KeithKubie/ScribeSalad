00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.740
Well, we sort of used the same tricks
that we've been talking about so far.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.460
If you are executing user code,
you are in user mode.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.180
You're not in system mode.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.510
And we know that protected resources
are implemented by the operating system.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.990
And so that data structures,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.290
the information that is necessary for
us to access those protected resources

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.170
lives in the operating system
part of the address base.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.700
And we know that while you're executing
the user code, you can't access that.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.720
You have to switch to the system
mode through a system call.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.400
And since you can't directly access it,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.810
you don't have the information
that is necessary for

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.510
you to access a resource without
going through the operating system.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.200
Which helps us with this complete
mediation property we have.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.840
In addition, the user code can not
access physical resources because

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.960
often times they require execution
of privileged instructions.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.590
We're talking about service
interrupts and things like that.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.140
There's no way for
you to get to a disk lock.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.394
Or change the register that
points to a page table,

00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:08.190
because those are instructions
that are privileged.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.270
And if you tried executing
them in the user mode,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.270
your execution would be aborted.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.160
You won't be able to continue that.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.500
So complete mediation, again relies on
the same hardware mechanisms we've been

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.690
talking about where the isolation
mechanism we discussed the idea of

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.570
privileged instructions
that we discussed.
