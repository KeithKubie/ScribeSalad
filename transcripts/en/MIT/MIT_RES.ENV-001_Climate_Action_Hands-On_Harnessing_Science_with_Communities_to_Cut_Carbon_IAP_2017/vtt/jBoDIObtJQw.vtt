00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.790
RAJESH: My name is Rajesh.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.430
I am one of the
co-founders of ClimateX,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.670
which is some of the groups
who are sponsoring this event.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.650
We are really, really happy
to have a wonderful cast

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.510
of speakers, who will be talking
to us about how to turn some

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.820
of the work that we have
all done in the field

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.850
into advocacy, especially
three kinds of advocacy.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.040
One is a citizen advocacy,
which Nathan and Audrey

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.390
will be talking about.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.540
Then there is legal
advocacy, which is Chris.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.660
And advocacy by creating market
solutions, which will be Ory.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.030
So I'm going to get out--

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.100
to prove that I'm not Donald
Trump, I'll stop talking now

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.830
and give it over
to Chris, who is

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.270
going to talk a little bit
about how he, as an MIT chemical

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.799
engineer, became a lawyer and
is now going after the bad guys.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.840
CHRIS NIDEL: So as Rajesh
said, my name is Chris.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.460
I'm an attorney in DC.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.220
I do mostly environmental work.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.097
I do some other
pharmaceutical work,

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.930
but my background's in
chemical engineering.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.160
So I got a master's degree from
MIT in chemical engineering,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.500
and I use that background to
evaluate chemical exposures,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.830
to evaluate pharmaceutical
exposures, to review--

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.920
and review of epidemiology,
and toxicology,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.050
and related scientific subjects
to the cases that I bring.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.520
And as part of that, I
use the whole spectrum

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.890
of scientific data.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.590
Some of that is very high
tech, lab-based, mathematical

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.060
modeling, obviously, you
know, EPA type sampling.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.114
But then I also use--

00:02:19.114 --> 00:02:20.780
at sort of the other
end of the spectrum

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.074
is more citizen
science type data.

00:02:24.074 --> 00:02:26.240
We'll start by talking about
a few examples starting

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.840
with photography, but people
don't think of photography

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.680
as being data.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.320
But the same standards
apply in court,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.120
whether it's a sample taken by
an expert with multiple degrees

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.900
to a picture taken by
someone on the street corner.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.390
And so, I think photography
is a good starting point

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.330
to talk about how to get
things admitted into court,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.630
and how you can use these
types of information, data,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.620
to advocate for your cause--
to prove a case whether it's

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.030
to oppose a permit, or to oppose
an expansion of a facility,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.200
or to generate some
finding of liability

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.880
on behalf of your client.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.710
So we're going to see if I
can do this with my phone,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.512
and it seems like it's working.

00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:16.970
The important thing,
when you start

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.530
talking about
scientific evidence,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.250
I get all kinds
of questions where

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.080
someone will say,
you know, we're

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.760
looking to fight this issue.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.130
We want to go to court,
and we want our data

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.400
to be good in court.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.940
So we want data that's the best.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.670
We want it to be good in court.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.370
And the reality
there's no golden rule

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.460
for what's admissible in court.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.950
You can have-- I had a case in
Massachusetts outside Boston,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.050
a PCB case where the EPA had
done hundreds and thousands

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.960
of sampling testing--

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.110
where they had sampled
the ground for PCBs,

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.600
and it was all EPA sampling.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.645
It was not part of litigation.

00:04:01.645 --> 00:04:04.160
It wasn't done by
me or my experts,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.710
and despite the fact
that it was EPA sampling

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.410
done by EPA methods
and protocols,

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.270
the defendant still
challenged the data.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.200
I mean, they say, well, it's
not reliable because it was EPA.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.269
So there's no answer
that says, well,

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.940
if you do a, b, and c, and
dot all the I's in there,

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.440
that it will be admitted.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.230
And I think, to
the other point is,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.020
if you haven't done
a, b, and c, you still

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.900
may get your data
in front of the jury

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.030
or in front of the
judge, depending

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.020
on the assessment of
essentially these factors, which

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.270
the first thing is
whether the data is

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.400
reliable and repeatable.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.670
So for example, I
had a case, that I'll

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.060
give you a couple examples
from, that involved

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.910
sampling for bacteria.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.480
It was a chicken house
that had discharges

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.820
going to the waters of the US.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.450
It was a Clean Water Act case,
and there was a question about

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.250
whether there was bacteria
as well as some nutrients

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.730
in the water-- so
phosphorous and nitrogen--

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.590
that were polluting
the waterways.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.270
And questions that
become relevant are

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.520
is a person wearing
gloves, is there

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.969
sterile procedures
used, are the containers

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.260
that they're going to take
a sample of the water from--

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.850
are they sterile to begin with?

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.790
Obviously, if there's any
question about those things,

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.570
it calls into question the
reliability and repeatability

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.660
of the data.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.320
So that's the first real prong.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.070
The second prong, and
this is pretty loaded,

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.720
is whether it's fit for
the intended purpose.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.710
So if you're trying
to prove, for example,

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.630
the presence of benzene in
somebody's drinking water,

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.080
and you have a certain
test that detects benzene,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.705
and maybe it gives it a number.

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:54.580
If the question for the
jury is whether there

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.050
was benzene in the water, there
may be a different standard

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.120
than if the question
is was there

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.240
enough benzene in the
water for the last 15 years

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.970
to give my client leukemia?

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.400
And so, there
becomes this question

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.500
about what is the
purpose that you're

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.130
offering the evidence
for, which then

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.820
relates this third point,
which is given your purpose,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.100
is it going to assist the jury?

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.180
So if that information,
to whatever degree

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.920
it falls in that
scientific rigor spectrum,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.270
how is that going to
help the jury understand?

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.880
So maybe we have a test that
shows the presence of benzene,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.360
but we don't trust the number.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.710
But we have an expert that
does groundwater modeling that

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.210
can say, well, we
have a number that

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.800
shows the presence of benzene.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.210
On top of that,
we have an expert

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.192
that modeled out the groundwater
for the last 15 years

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:51.400
and can show the fluctuations
in those concentrations

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.900
over the last 15 years--

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.900
the combination
of which gives you

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.690
the juror or the judge
confidence that there

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.400
was, in fact,
benzene in the water,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.550
and it was within a certain
range that, I might argue,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.820
caused a person to get sick.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.700
So with that being
said, let's see.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.180
Oh, do I have--

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.640
is it going to be?

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.180
Do I not know what I'm doing?

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.930
OK.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.520
So here's a simple example.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.120
So I represent-- there's
a lot of people in DC.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.360
There's probably a lot of people
in a lot of different cities.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.070
It's not glamorous
by any stretch,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.170
but there are a
lot of people that

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.570
live in subsidized housing
in this country that

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.210
is sub, sub, sub standard.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.090
So there are people
that, whether it's

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.670
the state or its HUD,
the federal government,

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.620
are paying for them.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.560
In a city like DC,
they're paying,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.930
you know, $1,500 a month
for a mother and her child

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:55.030
to live in conditions that are
unhealthy for both the mother

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.330
and for the child, and that
the government's paying

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.700
the bill for, and
somebody is profiting

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.504
from at the expense
of these people living

00:08:02.504 --> 00:08:04.420
in there and at the
expense of the government.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.730
And so, this is an easy example,
where someone takes a picture.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.740
I picked a picture
of this as, you know,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.580
water coming through the
ceiling of this apartment

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.480
where you have mold.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.670
We are currently--

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.530
I don't know why we're
losing our picture.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.620
Oh, there we go.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.830
So we represent-- in some cases,
we represent the government

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.310
on what's called the whistle
blower lawsuit, where we're

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.120
representing the government
against these landlords

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.280
for collecting money
from the government,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.539
representing that these are
habitable healthy places

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.830
that they're getting paid a
significant amount of money

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.500
for-- for people to come,
and get sick, and end up

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.642
at the emergency room
with asthma attacks

00:08:46.642 --> 00:08:48.850
when they can't breathe
anymore, because they've been

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.530
living in these conditions.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.150
I could have-- there was
a horrible situation.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.190
And again, it's sort of a
simplified approach to data,

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:01.780
but in one of these
apartments, you go in there,

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.150
and there were so many bugs.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.700
I mean, you couldn't--

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.440
it was the craziest thing.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.870
But the picture is
worth a thousand words,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.790
and there becomes a
question, like there

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.915
would be with any data, as
to who took the picture?

00:09:14.915 --> 00:09:15.700
When was it?

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.100
Can they certify that
it was in the apartment?

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.910
That's at issue.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.670
And at the time-- and, you
know, that they didn't--

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.250
it wasn't a bunch of plastic
cockroaches that they put,

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.580
but it was in fact a bunch
of bugs crawling around.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.270
Oh, and this, the farmer
trenched the ditch.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.430
So the purpose here would be to
show visible evidence of mold

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.960
as opposed to the
farmer trenching

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.620
the ditch, which we'll get to.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.020
So you're going to have a
witness that comes in and says,

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.103
yeah, I took that picture.

00:09:42.103 --> 00:09:44.230
I took it three months ago.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.890
I remember because
it was two weeks

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.990
after the water was
dripping from the ceiling,

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.300
and here's the mold.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.360
Again, if we were trying to
prove a housing code violation,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.927
the picture is
probably sufficient.

00:09:56.927 --> 00:09:59.260
If we're trying to prove that
somebody has asthma attack

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.310
two weeks later was caused
by this mold, that's

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.560
where you get into some
more sophisticated sampling

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.390
and having an
industrial hygienist

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.010
come in and do some testing.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:13.950
So this is another
type of litigation

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.290
that I've been involved in.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.230
For those people
that aren't aware,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:26.677
a good bit of our sewage sludge,
human waste, that we generate

00:10:26.677 --> 00:10:28.260
goes from the sewage
treatment plants,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.120
gets collected as solids,
and then gets sent to farms.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.850
In this case, it was a
quote unquote, tree farm,

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.060
but it's sent to
farms that grow crops.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.810
And they put human
waste on crops--

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.510
the argument being
that it's treated.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.030
The treating is
relatively minimal,

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:53.640
and they essentially put lime
in with the fecal material.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.100
And they then use
it as fertilizer.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.420
So as you can imagine it's
full of pharmaceuticals--

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.860
it's full of
industrial chemicals,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.602
because the local industries all
contribute to the sewer system.

00:11:05.602 --> 00:11:07.310
There's hospital waste
in there, so there

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.360
is viruses, pathogens,
all these things

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.700
that you would expect
in human feces--

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.560
exist in there.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.170
And in this case, this was a
1,300-acre forest that they

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.500
spread this stuff in, and my
client lived in the middle

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.870
of the forest.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.260
She ended up with pulmonary
fibrosis with her lungs

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.680
that were getting
scarred from repeated

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.610
inflammation from breathing
in these proteins and stuff.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.640
And so, this was one of her
pictures of what was going on.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.740
Again, like, not
what we necessarily

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.420
think of with respect
to data, but it

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.030
creates a compelling
picture, and you still

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.790
have that same
standard of getting

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.580
it admitted for the court.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.320
This is a picture from the case
that I referenced a little bit

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:56.820
ago.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.670
This is a poultry operation
that we have there

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.790
that we had access
on public property.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.000
The water keeper, or
the local river keeper,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.970
had access on public property
to this drainage ditch,

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.030
and this is where we get
into sort of a combined

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:19.534
use of different media or data.

00:12:19.534 --> 00:12:21.450
The water keeper is able
to come to this ditch

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.490
on public property and take
water samples, which she did,

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.030
I think, 12 or 14 times.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.080
So she took water
samples, which showed

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.910
high levels of bacteria--

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.460
fecal coliform, and
E. coli, as well as

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.336
high levels of nutrients
going through the ditch,

00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:39.960
across the highway,
and then eventually

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.860
out into the waters of the US.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.870
And what this photo
actually is is this

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.150
is a photo from Google Earth.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.760
It's just a Google
Earth satellite photo.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.170
Another point of issue was,
at the top corner there,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.630
there was a pile of
some unknown material.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.240
And we'll see a close
up in a later picture

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.090
that sort of shows some of
what was going on on the farm.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.810
And then you have the pictures
of the chicken houses.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.350
And then you have what's also a
cattle operation in the bottom

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.950
right there that I'm going to
show you another picture of it.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.720
So again, this is Google Earth.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.850
We went to trial in this case.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.290
We got these pictures
admitted from Google Earth.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.850
And one of the
things that we saw--

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:31.050
and I was deposing
the defendants--

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.430
is that the property had poultry
operation that was run by--

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.100
well, that was owned by Purdue--

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.660
run by their quote,
unquote, family farmer.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.640
And we believe that
that was discharging

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.330
into that drainage ditch
and out to where we sampled.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:53.070
There was also the cattle
operation, which had probably

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.590
some impact on the water.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.175
But what was interesting was--

00:13:57.175 --> 00:13:58.800
as part of the Clean
Water Act lawsuit,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.140
we had to notify them that
we were planning to sue them.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.510
And at some point, what you
see on the aerial photo--

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.700
as you can see, you
know, tiny there,

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.110
but basically the cattle were
then moved from the cattle

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.300
grazing area down
in the far right--

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.250
if we the looked on
the previous photo,

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.670
where you see all the cattle
markings from them in the two

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.470
lower right fields--

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.080
to a feeder that's
up in the top there.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.650
So you can see the cows
parked around some hay

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.520
bales or a feeder with
a bunch of hay on there

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.760
to create the impression
that the cows weren't just

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.810
over to the far right.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.739
They were more by this
ditch even though--

00:14:39.739 --> 00:14:41.280
and that's just
something we randomly

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.770
picked up on Google Earth.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.270
So when I'm in
deposition with them,

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.220
and I ask them, well, where
do the cows hang out--

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.511
and they tell me, oh, they
hang out all over the place.

00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:52.530
And you can see, and
there was a whole series

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.020
of photos, as you can imagine,
from Google Earth that

00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:00.180
show that, consistent with
the markings in these areas,

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.620
that the cows and
their feeders mostly

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:08.000
are in here, some in here,
and pretty rarely up in there.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.220
And so, this is the
aerial photograph.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.860
So this is the pile that was at
the top of that drainage ditch.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.290
This is the ditch
that was in question.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.900
And so, we had the
Google Earth photos,

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.850
and then we also
had aerial photos

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.560
that the water keeper
was able to get a flight

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.260
and take some of
their own photos.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.900
And here you had
a pile which was

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.210
sort of unknown, what it
was, but it was pretty

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.690
clear from these photos that
the farmer had dug trenches

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.540
to drain what was
in those piles--

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.210
the runoff, the water that
was accumulating there,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.620
into the farm runoff--

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.560
into the ditches that
then, ultimately,

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.360
went out to where we sampled.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.190
Then it ultimately went out
to the waters of the US.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.790
So again, what's the
purpose of this photo?

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.750
What's the purpose of
the previous photo?

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.710
If the purpose is to show where
the cows are, if the purpose is

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.930
to show where they
are in a given date

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.950
given the image date
from Google Earth,

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.670
if the purpose here is to show
that the farmer had indeed--

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.460
that there was drainage
coming from this pile, which

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.490
turned out to be--

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.420
it was actually sewage sludge.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.870
Unrelated case, but
the farmer was also

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.490
stockpiling sewage sludge.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:29.590
So it's material that's rich in
nutrients as well as probably

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.630
bacteria and pathogens.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.890
And he had trenched this,
so is their drainage?

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.140
What's the material?

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.590
Did he intend to drain this
material into the ditch?

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.300
Those questions, I
think, it's certainly

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.140
is relevant, and fit
for that purpose,

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.580
and would be
helpful to the jury.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.660
So this is the sampling point,
and this became an issue

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.660
for a couple of reasons.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.130
One is whether she
was trespassing.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.600
Two is how she took
the samples, as far

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.430
as her sterile technique.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.580
Getting to the lab data
that we use, we had,

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.770
I think, it was
14 or 12 samples.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.099
And she went through,
she wore gloves,

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.480
she used sealed
containers from the lab.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.349
She kept them cold.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:14.328
She had a chain of custody from
the sampling point to the lab.

00:17:14.328 --> 00:17:16.369
And so, all of the questions
where you say, well,

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.420
do we need to hire a consultant?

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.128
Do we need to pay
somebody a lot of money

00:17:19.128 --> 00:17:23.170
to come in from another
state and take a sample,

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.119
or is it sufficient to
have somebody that's

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:30.340
got sort of the requisite
training that would otherwise

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.424
disqualify the sample?

00:17:31.424 --> 00:17:33.340
So if she didn't know
about sterile technique,

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.890
or if she hadn't
worn sterile gloves,

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.195
or protected the integrity
of the sampling containers,

00:17:39.195 --> 00:17:41.320
those would be things that
would call into question

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.270
the reliability of the results.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.720
But the court ended up
admitting the sample results--

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.250
didn't question the results--

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.860
because she was able to answer
questions on her cross-exam

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.080
that she had done
all of the things

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.920
that would otherwise
disqualify those results.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.190
And so, there was some question
about whether there was flow

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.130
that the defendant said that
there wasn't ever flow--

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.765
that there was barely
ever water here.

00:18:06.765 --> 00:18:08.140
And so, these
pictures, obviously

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.960
came into play for that.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.810
This is at that
public access point,

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:17.750
and obviously that was
helpful for that purpose.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.540
I just put this picture in here.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.380
I think Nathan--

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.740
I don't know if Nathan
has an interest.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.320
Some of the work that
I do on fracking--

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.850
and I do a lot of work with
the folks down in Texas

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.920
and the people in Pennsylvania.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.920
And so, it's difficult
to see in this example.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:38.980
I just quickly pulled it off
YouTube, but with FLIR camera,

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.730
it's not unlike, in some sense,
a standard photograph, which

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.550
we've seen some
examples of, but it's

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:49.160
an $80,000 piece of equipment.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.350
But with such a camera,
you can see emissions

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.260
from this equipment that you
can't see with the naked eye.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.030
And so, there's a piece
of equipment here,

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.310
and you can see all
this billowing out

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.250
of there, which is primarily
volatile organic chemicals--

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.100
things like benzene,
and toluene,

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.710
and you name it from
these storage tanks.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.684
And so, when you look
at-- whether you're

00:19:10.684 --> 00:19:12.100
looking at climate
change impacts,

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.690
or whether you're
looking at health

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:19.540
and environmental impacts, or
all of the above, you know,

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.827
you have these tanks.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:21.910
You walk up close to them.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.470
You can smell them.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.780
But they are vented
to the atmosphere.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.240
They're not being regulated.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.692
And you have people--

00:19:29.692 --> 00:19:31.150
typically with
respect to fracking,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:35.830
you have people that are
living in conjunction with them

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.420
in close proximity.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.170
You might have a swimming
pool or a playground

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.810
in somebody's side yard
that's within a few hundred

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.920
feet of some of these tanks.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.580
And so, again,
what's the purpose?

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.510
Is the purpose to show that,
in fact, there are emissions?

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.230
Is the purpose to show
that the four-year-old is

00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:00.570
having breathing problems as
a result of these emissions?

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.320
From my perspective, if the
purpose is to show emissions,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.410
you have someone testify.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.490
Five minutes?

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:13.560
That's perfect-- you know,
what the FLIR camera does,

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.540
how it does it,
and what it shows--

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.189
which I think would validate
that there are admissions.

00:20:18.189 --> 00:20:20.730
If the purpose was to show that
somebody was having breathing

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.480
problems or was getting cancer
from that, you would probably

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.810
also have, for example, some
other grab samples, some air

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.180
testing, that actually
qualified or quantified

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.200
the amounts of benzene, and
toluene, and other things that

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.410
are in the air that would
then be corroborated

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.360
with this visual evidence
that says, in fact,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.220
there is something
coming from the tank.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.220
And we're picking it
up in the front yard

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.550
of my client or the
person that's complaining.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.710
So I think that
this is an example.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.454
Unfortunately, it's
out of the hands--

00:20:52.454 --> 00:20:54.870
financially out of the hands
of most people at this point,

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.450
but it's a really
powerful tool with respect

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.180
to not just health but
also climate change

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.200
issues with methane
leaks and other things.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.930
This is an example
outside Pittsburgh

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.750
that I'm looking at right now.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.150
This is from modeling
that was done--

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.910
and this is cancer risk
based on Coke emissions.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.420
And so, I'm looking at a
case around a Coke plant

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.580
outside Pittsburgh,
where you have

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.660
people that are living in
the shadows of this huge Coke

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.240
plant, one of the few
remaining in Pittsburgh.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.180
And this is sort of the
rigorous data that's

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.700
looked at based on air
emission data and modeling

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.780
of those emissions, where you
can see these huge cancer risks

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.030
as a result of the emissions.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.120
This is another
thing that's going

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.820
on in that same community,
which is this is--

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.960
I think this is called--

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.040
I forget the name
of this device,

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.960
but it's one of these internet
of things connected devices

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.760
that looks at air quality.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.610
So is it is it
lab-certified data?

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.950
I mean, this example
it said 200 high.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.200
The air quality is bad.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.710
Again, am I trying to show
that half the neighborhood has

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.420
asthma because of
this, or am I trying

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.030
to show that they have
decreased the property values

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.860
because their air
quality is bad,

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.600
or am I just trying to show that
the Coke ovens are impacting

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.100
the air quality locally?

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.260
And then I have the other
data, the previous data,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.260
where I have modeling
to show the real nature

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.070
and extent of risk and injury.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.240
This is another similar device.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.330
These are guys that I've
talked to about trying

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.520
to use in some of
my cases, where

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.580
you could take for a couple
hundred, $200 or $300.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.440
This one's called a uHoo, and
you could distribute these

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.130
throughout a neighborhood
and show that, for example,

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.330
the pattern of emissions.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.331
You could show that the
emissions, or the air

00:22:51.331 --> 00:22:53.580
pollutants, are at the highest
level near the facility

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.120
and decay as you get farther
out from the facility.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.470
What you might also
try to show are things

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:00.720
like the pattern of emissions.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.850
So a lot of times,
industries will--

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.710
you know, smart on their part--

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.050
will wait until
between 2:00 and 5:00

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:13.500
in the morning to
let things fly.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.570
And so, I have a
case in Michigan

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:20.670
where the refinery
there is alleged,

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.380
by the people living near it--

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.106
between 2:00 and
5:00 in the morning,

00:23:24.106 --> 00:23:25.230
they smell the rotten eggs.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.720
They smell the chemicals,
and they wake up

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.310
with difficulty breathing.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:35.130
And so, again, you put something
like this inside your house

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.660
or just outside your house.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.160
It's capturing data.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.570
And is the data being used to
prove that you got lymphoma

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.850
or leukemia from
that, or is it being

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:49.470
used to show that every night,
at between 2:00 and 4:00,

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.710
you get a spike?

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.690
Whatever that number is, it may
not be scientifically credible

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:59.370
to the 0.00, but does it show
that there is some pattern

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.240
that--

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.400
or when the weather changes,
that you get a shift,

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.800
and that weather is
consistent with winds

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.010
blowing from the facility
to your point of testing.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.610
So again, it really gets
back to this question

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.150
about what is it that you're
intending to use the data for?

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.240
This is-- what do I
have, like, two minutes?

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.570
This is another example, when
I gave a talk with Public Lab,

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.880
that someone was doing
in New York City, which

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.920
I thought was really great--

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.660
was that they were using--

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.640
they were giving
low-income people

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.632
that were in subsidized housing
these connected thermometers.

00:24:33.632 --> 00:24:35.590
And they were collecting
data from their homes,

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.070
so that in the winter
they could see where

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:39.780
people were living in sub--

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.140
you know, in freezing--
or maybe not freezing

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.840
but uninhabitable conditions
in their homes that were not

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.280
being properly--
so they're living

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.320
in public housing or
subsidized housing,

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.870
and they're not being
treated properly.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.030
And so, it's really
a simple-- you know,

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:57.960
it's just a temperature test
with a GPS tag that could show

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.820
these homes--

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.560
and I guess a time tag as
well, so time and temperature

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.860
are essentially
that we could do,

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.200
for the most part, with our
smartphones these days--

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.200
that set up legal
arguments for these people

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.660
to say that they're not
being treated properly

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.140
and that they need
adequate housing.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.640
So to sort of bring this
a little bit to a head,

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:26.814
better doesn't always mean
more, and sometimes more data,

00:25:26.814 --> 00:25:28.230
even if it's
qualitative data, can

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:31.420
be better to prove
a certain point,

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.962
depending on what that point is.

00:25:33.962 --> 00:25:35.670
And so, there's this
balance, or tension,

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.000
between quality and quantity of
data that largely relates back

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.920
to money.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.380
So sort of to give
you an example,

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.880
this is that Coke
facility in the top right.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.530
You can see part of it.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.670
And if we were to
go and take samples

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.790
throughout the neighborhood,
they all cost money.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.500
If we were to take
them with a PhD

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.120
from the University
of Pittsburgh,

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.095
it would cost even more money.

00:25:59.095 --> 00:26:00.720
And so, the question
becomes what is it

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.000
that we are trying to prove?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.690
And if we're trying to
prove that the levels of air

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.330
pollutants are highest
near the facility,

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.430
and they decay as
you get farther away,

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.919
and that they spike at
night, that that may be--

00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:17.460
a certain level of
data quality might

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.350
be suitable for
that versus trying

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.050
to prove that someone's lung
cancer or some other health

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:27.100
issues were a result
of that exposure.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.800
And I guess the converse
is it may, in times--

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.750
and I think this
is a good example--

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:39.360
be better to have more data
of an arguable lesser quality

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.430
than to have rigorous
sampling done on three houses

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.590
but not to have that
full spectrum that

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.980
shows what's happening as you
get farther and farther away,

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.680
because you focused your
time, effort, and ultimately

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.870
your money on sampling
those things that

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:59.500
were located where you had
one sick person and that's it.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.750
Then you get into a question--

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.840
OK, I've got a great number
outside this person's house,

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.180
but I'm not sure how it
relates back to the facility,

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.513
and I'm not sure how the
facility is impacting everybody

00:27:08.513 --> 00:27:10.300
else in the neighborhood.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:15.750
And I think that is-- so I
think this is my last slide.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.900
Obviously, more money
you pay for people

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.990
with degrees, and consultants,
and for lab testing--

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.520
you can save money with some
of these techniques, citizen

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.730
science, some of these
taking your own samples

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.310
with the appropriate
training and technique--

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.050
using some of these
connected devices,

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.875
using some photography
and FLIR cameras.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.740
More money doesn't
always mean better,

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.660
but it tends to
mean that you've got

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.690
better numbers, more
precise numbers, that

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.950
are more reliable.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.190
But again, the question
is what is your purpose?

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.606
If your purpose is
to show you know

00:27:55.606 --> 00:27:57.480
that the source of the
pollution is impacting

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.550
the neighborhood
in a broad sense,

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:04.950
you can probably get by with
some data of lesser rigor

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.360
and that's lesser expense.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.120
If you're trying
to prove someone's

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.250
been exposed for how
long at what level

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.540
precisely to show
that they got sick,

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.810
obviously the standards
are increased,

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.530
and the level of scientific
rigor is heightened as well.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:24.900
So I think that's it
for me, and I'll pass--

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.160
I'll answer any questions.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.125
I'll receive applause.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.610
The question was to
what extent trespassing

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.100
on people's land and drones--

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.630
it's a good question.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.900
Drones are, you know,
for some people, maybe

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.045
not so new, but as far as
people like me, a newer thing.

00:28:48.045 --> 00:28:49.420
But, I mean, drones
are a great--

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.470
I mean, huge.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:54.020
Like, the aerial photos that
were taken with a full flight--

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.020
like, having to rent a
plane and all that stuff,

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.300
it could be done with
drones very easily--

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.250
get even better
quality pictures.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:04.360
Drones are a huge, huge
benefit to the citizen science

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.219
operation.

00:29:05.219 --> 00:29:07.510
I mean, they have drones that
can also take air samples

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:11.980
and things like that, so
the ability to get data

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.740
cheaply, and efficiently, and
effectively is a big thing.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:19.090
As far as trespassing
goes, in my opinion,

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.522
you never want to trespass.

00:29:20.522 --> 00:29:21.980
You never want to
represent someone

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.370
who's going to have
somebody else saying, well,

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:25.690
you trespassed.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:29.092
By the same token,
I have had cases

00:29:29.092 --> 00:29:31.300
where people trespass on
the land, and took a sample,

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:31.990
and went home.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.124
And as a lawyer, I
have an obligation

00:29:34.124 --> 00:29:36.040
to disclose the fact
that they took a sample--

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.930
the result of that sampling.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:43.870
And aside from any allegations
or claims of criminal trespass,

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.790
if the data is
reliable-- if they

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:51.220
can't impugn what the person
did-- that they somehow

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.030
adulterated the
sample, then the sample

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.250
should be admissible for
the purpose of showing

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.750
what the sample shows, right?

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.840
So there could be a dispute
about whether there's

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.090
some criminal trespass,
which I think largely there's

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:08.320
no impact from, but in general,
the answer is if you can do it

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.600
with a drone, and you
can take pictures,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.250
if you can get a
court order to get

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.770
a sample on the property,
that's a much better way

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.730
to do it than trespassing.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.730
A lot of people don't
understand the first thing

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.500
you have to do is make a
good case to the judge.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.270
So judges stand between
you and the jury

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.120
as far as scientific evidence--
as far as any evidence, right.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.840
And so, you first have to make
a good argument to the judge

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.140
that the data is reliable,
fit for its intended purpose,

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.790
and that it will
assist the jury.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.650
What a jury will
believe is oftentimes

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.380
different than what
a judge will believe,

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.830
so something like a FLIR
camera that shows visually

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.440
the stream of
pollution coming off

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.590
may be very compelling
to a jury even

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.290
if I'm talking about leukemia.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.030
It may not be very
compelling to a judge

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.220
if I'm talking about leukemia,
because it doesn't give you

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:57.790
a number.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.830
It just tells you that
there's stuff coming off,

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.830
and I have an expert that says
that stuff is this stuff that

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.090
may cause leukemia.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.540
But it's still not 20 parts
per billion of benzene,

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.570
and that's ultimately what
I need to show according

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.520
to most judges, right.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.890
So I think, again, it's
a very wide spectrum.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:23.710
It would vary hugely from
hugely from judge to judge,

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.110
and there's not any one answer.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.980
I can tell you, that as far as
epidemiology goes, generally,

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.240
what courts require-- if I want
to show that an exposure caused

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.640
my client's leukemia,
for example,

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.580
I would need to have a
study that showed a greater

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.040
than two-fold increased risk.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.110
So I have more than a
doubling of the risk

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.630
to a 95% confidence interval.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:51.790
So to eliminate the no risk
and to be at least a doubling

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.940
at that confidence interval,
and that essentially

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.220
goes to this argument that
it's more probably than not

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.100
caused by the exposure.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.810
Does that makes sense?

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.360
OK.
