think about but I've been thinking about

think about but I've been thinking about
 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:51.500
think about but I've been thinking about
it a great deal because of this chapter

was kind of glossed over I recall

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130
was kind of glossed over I recall
 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.430

food was just kind of a found thing they
just dug in the ground and there was

indicators of seasonal change and so

indicators of seasonal change and so
forth and this was at a time when the

forth and this was at a time when the
 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.780
forth and this was at a time when the
notion that agriculture should be

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790
notion that agriculture should be
 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.460
notion that agriculture should be
distinguished very strongly from veggie

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470
distinguished very strongly from veggie
 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:20.510
distinguished very strongly from veggie
culture that agriculture came from Latin

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520
culture that agriculture came from Latin
 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.110
culture that agriculture came from Latin
Agoura meaning a field whereas veggie

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120
Agoura meaning a field whereas veggie
 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.380
Agoura meaning a field whereas veggie
culture implied that you were having

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390
culture implied that you were having
 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.720
culture implied that you were having
roots or rhizomes or other sorts of

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730
roots or rhizomes or other sorts of
 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.080
roots or rhizomes or other sorts of
crops that did not have plowing or did

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090
crops that did not have plowing or did
 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.290
crops that did not have plowing or did
not have field agriculture in the same

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300
not have field agriculture in the same

sense of a field corn was always a

sense of a field corn was always a
 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.790
sense of a field corn was always a
problematic item here because it's a

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800
problematic item here because it's a
 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.920
problematic item here because it's a
grain but it wasn't planted in plowed

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930
grain but it wasn't planted in plowed
 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:59.480
grain but it wasn't planted in plowed
fields so in any case the the notion

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490
fields so in any case the the notion
 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.469
fields so in any case the the notion
that there's some sort of equation

that there's some sort of equation
 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.380
that there's some sort of equation
between agriculture and civilization

between agriculture and civilization

that agriculture makes it possible to

that agriculture makes it possible to
 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.040
that agriculture makes it possible to
have a denser population are certainly

hand agriculture I would say the

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720
hand agriculture I would say the
 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.909
hand agriculture I would say the
artificial planting and harvesting of

artificial planting and harvesting of
 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.120
artificial planting and harvesting of
domestic strains of plants it doesn't

know the sort of population stress that

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660
know the sort of population stress that
 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.130
know the sort of population stress that
is associated with in this sort of

formulation of things with wheat and
 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.840
formulation of things with wheat and
barley this is surprising because wheat

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850
barley this is surprising because wheat
 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.170
barley this is surprising because wheat
and barley on a calories per acre basis

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180
and barley on a calories per acre basis
 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.719

are nowhere near as nutritional as

are nowhere near as nutritional as
 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.709
are nowhere near as nutritional as
potatoes or

the work and it's pulling pulling your

the work and it's pulling pulling your
sharp stick through the soil and you get

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:24.169
sharp stick through the soil and you get
 

00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:27.100
sharp stick through the soil and you get
more production for the amount of labour

beginning of this week I was talking
 

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:52.390
beginning of this week I was talking
about how I knew a economic historian

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400
about how I knew a economic historian
 

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.060
about how I knew a economic historian

the last generation who believed that

the last generation who believed that
was worthwhile to draw up a balance

01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.600
was worthwhile to draw up a balance
 

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.190
was worthwhile to draw up a balance

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:12.350
drawbacks and you've come up with some
 

01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:13.660

sort of balance sheet which he found

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:13.670
sort of balance sheet which he found
 

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:16.150
sort of balance sheet which he found
basically positive now what I'm

01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:16.160
basically positive now what I'm
 

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.040
basically positive now what I'm
suggesting here is that there's another

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:18.050
suggesting here is that there's another
 

01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:20.020
suggesting here is that there's another
kind of balance sheet that you can you

01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:20.030
kind of balance sheet that you can you
 

01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:22.540
kind of balance sheet that you can you
can look at which has to do more with

can look at which has to do more with

can look at which has to do more with
the impact upon the the imagination and

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:26.630
the impact upon the the imagination and

the impact upon the the imagination and

the psyche of of regions and that's what
 

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:36.900
the psyche of of regions and that's what
I say you know it's if it possibly

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:36.910
I say you know it's if it possibly
 

01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:39.790
I say you know it's if it possibly
