1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.320
I want to talk about,
um,
some interesting observations because Gary,

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.300
you like to talk about,
um,
you know,

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:09.990
what's going on in different dietary trends in different cultures.

4
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:11.640
And I find that pretty interesting too.

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.300
I want to talk about the fact that sugar intake in the United States has been

6
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:20.100
declining for the last 20 years.

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.300
So it peaked in 1999 and it is currently,

8
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:26.520
depending on which source of evidence you believe,

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.960
15 to 23% lower than it was in 1999.

10
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.050
This has been corroborated by a number of different sources of evidence is

11
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.960
number 17 on my blog.

12
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.830
And of course we know that obesity has increased.

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.480
Diabetes has increased substantially over the last 20 years in the percentage of

14
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:49.300
the population are actually correct percentage.
Yeah.
And uh,

15
00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:54.060
and UK sugar intake has been declining for 50 years.
I don't believe that.

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.710
Okay,
well,
you can argue with the data there.
A number 17 on my blog,

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.540
there are about 22% lower and this is what we see across a number of different,

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.550
uh,
industrialized countries.

19
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:10.551
You see a stagnation or decline in sugar intake in recent decades as obesity

20
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.550
rates are continuing to increase.
Um,

21
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:18.960
and of course that 50 year period that covers the decline in the UK covers the

22
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:22.920
entire UK obesity and diabetes epidemics.
Um,

23
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.100
but there's another one I want to talk about that and I respond to that.
Yeah,

24
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:28.500
we should probably respond to that.
Stefan,
actually,

25
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:32.250
I'll let you respond for me because we had this debate with the Keto Foundation.

26
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.420
So you know,
my art counterargument.
Do you want to give it?
Yeah,
sure.
Absolutely.

27
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.710
I mean,
are you sure you want to let me give it though?
Am I correct that?
Okay.

28
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.693
All right.

29
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.330
So your counterargument is that the amount of sugar that we consumed 20 years

30
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:52.560
ago,
or even maybe 50 years ago,

31
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.680
maybe continuing to fatten us today,

32
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.870
and it's about the sugar that we used to eat 20 or 50 years ago and not

33
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:04.830
necessarily about the sugar we eat today.
Well,
it's not exactly right.
Okay.

34
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:05.150
I get it.

35
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.810
So the argument I made was because he brought this up when we've had to do a

36
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:12.240
written debate on the Keto Foundation website,

37
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.540
and it's interesting if you think about use tobaccos and example.

38
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:20.541
So tobacco smoking per capita smoking in America peaked in 1965 right up to the

39
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:26.340
surgeon general's report and it took 30 years before lung cancer rates turned

40
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:27.390
over.
Okay.

41
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:30.750
And I think we both agree that cigarettes are a major cause of lung cancer

42
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.890
smoking.
So what you basically have as a system in which,

43
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:35.820
if there are any,

44
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.240
there's the assumption that Stephanie is making when he quotes it was kind of

45
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:43.980
data,
is that the relationship between sugar and obesity is linear.

46
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.840
So it's sugar goes up,

47
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:48.900
obesity and diabetes goes up and if sugar turns over they don't.

48
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:52.320
So here's the thought experiment I used in Keto,
which is

49
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.510
1965 were smoking per capita about 20 cigarettes a day.

50
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.010
As it starts to come down,

51
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.010
<v 1>imagine we only cut that to 17 cigarettes or 16 cigarettes,</v>

52
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.420
a 20% reduction in smoking.

53
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.950
Would you expect to see a reduction in the lung cancer rates?
Again,

54
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:15.310
this is the point I made about what you would expect to see rather than new

55
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:20.170
things.
Simplistic a metaphor.
So the question is,
would you like Joe,

56
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.030
we go from 20 to 16.
Do you expect to see the lung cancer rates turnover?

57
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.860
No.
No.
And in sugar we went from drop a know you might,

58
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the derivative might drop.
You might expect it to slow a tiny bit.

59
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.800
Still use it's,

60
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.310
there was a bunch of weird comparison because one of them has poisoned the other

61
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.710
one's food.
Right?
Well,
but then this case,
the food,

62
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:46.360
the question is to how toxic is the food?
So in sugar we have a variety in sugar.

63
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:50.680
What happens is the equivalent of going from 20 cigarettes to 16 beginning in

64
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:53.290
1999 and Stephanie is saying,

65
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:57.490
I would expect to see an immediate change in obese.
And in fact,

66
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.700
if you actually look at the rates,
the,

67
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.360
the rate of increase in the prevalence appeared to plateau around six or seven

68
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:06.130
years later.
Uh,

69
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.190
who knows whether that's relevant to get days small decrease in sugar,

70
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:16.870
20 pay,
even if it's 20%,
that's 20 to 16 cigarettes.

71
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.340
And I'm Sandi,
the other factor that I talk about my book and stuff in those,

72
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:26.341
this is very clearly have maternal transmission of the propensity to obesity and

73
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:30.220
diabetes.
So there's a generational effect.
This,

74
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:34.620
and this is studies that were done in the same,
on the same Pima,

75
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.640
the same native American tribe or each generation if gets more and more,

76
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.650
uh,
susceptible to whatever it is in the Diet that's triggering and obesity and

77
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:48.820
diabetes.
So that's been happening in the United States and around the world.

78
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.540
You've got a generational effect that could last far longer,

79
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:56.230
might even keep going indefinitely,
even if it's sugar levels drop.

80
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.070
So you have the sugar quit kicking off the obesity epidemic.

81
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.670
And yet Stephen's about to say this as a story and it is a story,

82
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.270
but it's clearly the case that mothers who are obese during pregnancy or

83
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:11.680
diabetic or gestationally diabetic,

84
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:15.910
they become diabetic during pregnancy or they have metabolic syndrome,

85
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:20.050
they're just uh,
insulin resistant or they gain a lot of weight in pregnancy,

86
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.710
will give birth to children who are at higher risk of becoming an obese and

87
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:28.150
diabetic when they get older and in younger ages and those children will pass it

88
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:31.570
on.
So again,
we have,
you know,
I would be nice,

89
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:35.620
I would love it if sugar consumption came down and with it,
um,

90
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.280
obesity and diabetes plummeted,
but it's not a,

91
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:41.950
in any way a refutation of this hypothesis,

92
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:46.300
which I just want to state what it is because people get confused about and we

93
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:47.134
never got to it.

94
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.550
There's sugar hypothesis is a little different than what we've been talking

95
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:55.780
about and it's pretty simple.
We have obesity and diabetes epidemics worldwide,

96
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.150
as we talked with,
doesn't matter the genetics of the population,

97
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.980
you add something about a western diet to those populations,

98
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.060
western Diet and lifestyle,
you get these explosions,

99
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.760
epidemics of obesity and diabetes.

100
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.650
And what I'm hypothesizing in this book is that sugar is a,

101
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:19.610
something that has to be added.
Maybe it's sugary beverages for all I know,

102
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.690
maybe or it could be,
you know,
a more complex hypothesis,

103
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:24.800
succinct as possible.

104
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:29.600
One is you add sugar to any population to tie it in sufficient,

105
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:33.940
whether it's southeast Asians living on Rice or the annual living on reindeer

106
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.540
and whatever,

107
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:38.990
or the native Americans to the great plains or you know,

108
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.140
Caucasians living in the upper east side,
Manhattan,

109
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.440
add enough sugar and eventually through the metabolic effects of the sugar and

110
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:49.910
the generational effects,

111
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:54.500
you will get explosions of obesity and diabetes and metabolic seven.

112
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:55.460
You want to respond to that?

113
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.230
<v 0>Sure.
I mean,
Gary,
you called it man.
Um,</v>

114
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.880
it's always possible to tell a story to salvage your hypothesis would,

115
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:06.520
that doesn't necessarily make the story correct.
I mean,

116
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.260
I can come up with a story that cosmic rays cause obesity by hitting my fat

117
00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:14.560
cells and making them fat.
You can't disprove that.

118
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.420
Nobody here can disprove that.
But there's no evidence,

119
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.530
an experiment to protect you from my,
but we don't,

120
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.470
we don't have the data right now.
You don't have data supporting your hypothesis.

121
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.540
You're just dismissing on an on.

122
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:31.630
And can I get back to the and Elstein responding right now?

123
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.160
Let's let them respond to them on a Kevin Hall later.
Yeah.
So,
um,

124
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.770
what do you think about what he's saying about sugar and increased rates of

125
00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:42.670
diabetes and that this is the cross?
Yeah,
I mean,

126
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.200
so let me put it this way.

127
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.320
We don't have any evidence supporting what he just said.

128
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.130
So that is a story that is not supported by evidence.

129
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.750
Now does it,
does that mean that it's definitely incorrect?
No,
I cannot say that.

130
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:57.700
That's definitely incorrect.
Same Way.

131
00:07:57.701 --> 00:08:01.390
I can't say it's definitely incorrect that cosmic rays cause obesity.

132
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.910
But you know,
I,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna use it.

133
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:08.830
Christopher Hitchens quote here that which is asserted without evidence does not

134
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:10.360
require evidence to refute.

135
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.770
And that's the way I feel about this particular story.
Um,
but you know,

136
00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:19.771
there are cultures that consume large amounts of sugar and do not develop

137
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:21.971
obesity.

138
00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:25.750
We've we've talked about yet and we're going to talk about it again right now.

139
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.490
Um,
so this is referenced number 21.

140
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.360
I'm on my blog.
I'm going to talk about three different cultures,

141
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:39.190
one of which we have not talked about Gary.
The first one is the uh,

142
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.620
the Hadza hunter gatherers of Tanzania.

143
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.410
This is a really interesting non industrial culture.

144
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.880
They as part of their hunter gatherer diet,
eat a lot of honey.

145
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.960
Honey is a very common food among hunter gatherers living similarly to how our

146
00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:57.690
ancestors used to live.
And if you measured there year round honey intake,

147
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.340
it's about 15% of their calories.
So this is a major calorie source for them.

148
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.040
That's about as much sugar as the average American eats.

149
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.360
And they eat fruit sugar on top of this.
They use a lot of fruit on top of that.

150
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.420
And so they're even quite a bit of sugar.

151
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:17.450
And the Hadza men have about 12% body fat women have about 18.

152
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:21.420
So they correspond pretty closely to our western ideals.

153
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.780
What isn't that high for hunter gatherers?
No,
not really.

154
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.220
I mean that's higher than me.
Uh,
hang around blaming,
ask you this.

155
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.940
How have you had your body fatness measured?
Measured a bunch of ways.

156
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.860
Electricity of this machine where you hold onto these things,

157
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.960
stand on this platform and then most of it's done in physician's office of,

158
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.770
okay.
So,
um,
I've done it with calipers.
The Mo.
Okay.

159
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:50.190
So all the methods that you measure that you mentioned are not gold standard

160
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:51.024
methods.

161
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:55.170
So the gold standard methods are underwater weighing and the underwater weighing

162
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:58.830
these people on this island.
Ah,
actually I'm not sure.

163
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.760
I'm not sure how that they bring that equipment to this island.
Correct.
But okay,

164
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.290
look,
um,
I can tell you that you can look up photos.
I don't remember how they,

165
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.790
how they measured their body fat,
but you can look,
I am 12% as measured by Dexa.

166
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.470
So I'll just tell you that.
So you can get a sense of what 12% is by Dexa.

167
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.900
Um,
which is a gold standard method.
Um,
so you can look at photos of these people.

168
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:24.600
They're very fit.
They're lean,
they're not like ripped,
you know,

169
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.540
they're not Arnold Schwarzenegger and peak form,
but they are,
no,

170
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:28.111
I understand that.

171
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:33.111
But it seems to correlate with a higher consumption of sugar that they seem to

172
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:36.060
have a higher percentage of body fat than the average hunter gather.

173
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.670
Now if you look at a lot of the average hunter gatherers,

174
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.860
like a friend of mine does a lot of work with the pygmies in the Congo and

175
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:45.210
they've very lean.
Okay.

176
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:49.020
So see these packs and that's the second culture I was going to cite.

177
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:51.560
That eats a ton of honey.
Do they?
Yeah.

178
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.430
If they're the same ones than the booty pygmies in the Congo,
um,

179
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.570
they eat up to 80% of their calories can come from honey during the rainy
season.

180
00:11:01.571 --> 00:11:06.570
So they also eat a lot of honey and Arlene not just leave the year.
Uh,
correct.

181
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.100
Yeah.
For them.
It's part of the year,

182
00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:12.720
the Hadza that eat it more consistently and the Hadza have low levels of body

183
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:15.990
fat.
Their cardiovascular risk markers are excellent.

184
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.230
They don't have diabetes.
Same for,

185
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.230
but this is absolutely not like a controlled study in the consumption of food.

186
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.480
Not,
I absolutely agree with you.

187
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.720
That's exactly the point I'm trying to make is that when you have a culture that

188
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:33.360
is eating a lot of sugar,
but everything else is in place.

189
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:37.020
So doing everything else right,
the sugar is not enough to make them fat.

190
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:40.980
It's not single handedly enough.
I'm not saying it doesn't contribute.

191
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.190
I think sugar does contribute.
Just to be very clear.

192
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.960
I think sugar does contribute to obesity and diabetes and cardiovascular
disease,

193
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.920
but it's not single handedly responsible as Gary has argued.

194
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.070
So the third culture is pretty interesting.
The Kuna of Panama.

195
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.290
And the reason they're interesting is that they actually aren't eating honey.

196
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.320
They're actually eating white sugar.
So there are culture that um,

197
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.400
they live primarily a nonindustrial lifestyle.

198
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:13.470
They're farmers and hunter gatherers and um,

199
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.390
they,
but they do a little bit of trade.

200
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.580
And one of the things they trade for us sugar and they eat sugar sweetened foods

201
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:25.690
as well.
So like donuts and pastries and they drink soda and Koolaid.

202
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.680
What is their lifestyle in terms of like what do they have a natural lifestyle.

203
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:34.090
They are hunter gatherers and subsistence farmers.
So they're,
you know,

204
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:36.670
living a physically active natural lifestyle.

205
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.500
<v 2>So this is the problem in comparison with any westernized civilization that you</v>

206
00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:44.830
burn off soul.
Many more cowers

207
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.660
<v 0>100% agree with you.</v>

208
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:50.860
And I think that is exactly the point I'm trying to make is that it's more

209
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:52.360
complicated than just sugar

210
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.360
<v 2>and is more complicated than that than just sugar.
But with a normal lifestyle,</v>

211
00:12:57.361 --> 00:13:00.960
it may not be.
This is,
you know,
I the consumption,

212
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.450
the thing about burning of the calories is also the,
the,

213
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:08.040
the glucose demands of glycogen demands on the muscle.
You're,
you're,

214
00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:10.720
you're not just existing like the,

215
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:15.150
one of the problems with Western lifestyle is that many people are just
existing.

216
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.120
They're sitting in a chair,
they're walking to a desk,

217
00:13:18.121 --> 00:13:19.290
they're sitting in their car,

218
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.790
they're not doing anything to burn any of this shit off.
So even if you have,

219
00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:26.910
like if you get a baseline of a minimal amount of cowers that you require for

220
00:13:26.911 --> 00:13:31.530
the day,
I think what Gary's getting at is that if you,

221
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.150
if you have this lifestyle,
the lifestyle that many of us have,

222
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:41.400
and then with that lifestyle consume sugar that you're going to get fat.

223
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.960
I don't think you can compare that to athletes.
And in that respect,

224
00:13:45.961 --> 00:13:48.780
I don't think you can compare that to a hunter gatherers because you're

225
00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:53.280
requiring is a much more significant load on your body.

226
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.600
You like when I,
uh,

227
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.400
I did this sober October fitness challenge with my friends during October and
we,

228
00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:00.960
I was working out four hours a day,

229
00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:05.190
five and I was fucking eating everything that moved.
I was drinking soda.

230
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.950
I never drink soda.
I was eating cookies.

231
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.510
I didn't gain any weight other than muscle.
I didn't get any fat at all.
Yeah.

232
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.500
And I was eating a terrible fucking die,
but I was going crazy.

233
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.830
When you're trying to stay alive and you're running around plowing and growing

234
00:14:23.131 --> 00:14:26.670
foods and hunting and gathering and fishing,

235
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.750
you're burning off insane amounts of calories.
Just the hiking that's required,

236
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.940
the amount of exercise it's required,

237
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:36.480
it's off the charts in comparison to standard Brett Western life.

238
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.740
<v 0>We are on the same wavelength here.
I mean,</v>

239
00:14:38.741 --> 00:14:43.360
I completely agree with you that it is more complicated than just sugar and,

240
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.770
but if you read what Gary is written,
and please correct me if I'm wrong here,

241
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.430
Gary argues that sugar is the primary cause of obesity

242
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.250
<v 1>and that physical activity does not matter.</v>

243
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.490
Calorie intake does not matter if you think that physical activity doesn't

244
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:01.570
matter.
Uh,
I think it's a,
uh,

245
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:02.791
<v 2>no,</v>

246
00:15:02.791 --> 00:15:05.670
I don't think it makes a hell of a lot of difference for fat occurred when we're

247
00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.110
talking about the cause of obesity.

248
00:15:07.111 --> 00:15:09.700
I don't believe obese people get obese because they're suddenly,

249
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:10.830
let me put it this way.

250
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.040
So if you take someone who's an elite athlete and they start consuming a lot of

251
00:15:16.741 --> 00:15:20.940
sugar,
but they,
they ramp up their exercise accordingly.

252
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.210
Like say if someone does what I did during the sober October,

253
00:15:24.211 --> 00:15:26.550
they're working out three,
four hours a day every day.

254
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.440
You don't think that they have higher sugar demands that their body would just

255
00:15:31.441 --> 00:15:34.680
burn that off?
Absolutely.
I think that if there's a real benefit to exercise,

256
00:15:34.681 --> 00:15:37.610
it's burning off the carbohydrates you consume

257
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:42.130
<v 1>then and you need less insulin to do it.
Can I respond to the Cuna?</v>

258
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.190
Get back to them for a second.
Okay.

259
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:49.290
I mean one of the issues I have was Stephan is he writes off my stories,

260
00:15:49.961 --> 00:15:50.651
his stories,

261
00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:55.651
which they are all science begins his stories on hypotheses and then what you do

262
00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:59.770
is go look for the evidence and then he quotes studies and refers to it as

263
00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:04.390
evidence is out.
This is somehow by calling it evidence that may end.

264
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.020
We had this discussion a year and a half ago and you didn't disagree with me at

265
00:16:08.021 --> 00:16:09.880
the time and it had no influence,

266
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.900
so I'm just going to read from the email I wrote to second

267
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.380
reading emails.
It's gotten to that point in the conversation,
did it well,

268
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.940
because it's,
I'm not only going to read from an email five time,

269
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.480
I'm going to read from your book,
read the Cuna.

270
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.520
The study you cited is interesting.
Okay.

271
00:16:27.521 --> 00:16:32.230
So this was a study that profess to measure sugar intake of this population on

272
00:16:32.231 --> 00:16:37.231
an island on the Gandy and compare it to the population in Vera Cruz where they,

273
00:16:38.351 --> 00:16:43.060
uh,
they had emigrated and I say,
but they're added sugar intake on,

274
00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:46.480
on the Gandhi,
according to figure one is 25 teaspoons per week,

275
00:16:46.481 --> 00:16:50.170
plus the equivalent of 24 ounces of Sodas at 78 grams.

276
00:16:50.171 --> 00:16:53.800
If it's coke 32 ounces of Koolaid,
that's 96 grams.

277
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.520
I said I'm leaving out the cup of a sugar cane because I don't know what that

278
00:16:57.521 --> 00:17:01.470
has meant or how they assess it one way or the other.
It's not processed sugar.

279
00:17:01.471 --> 00:17:06.471
So it's roughly 274 grams of sugar per week or about 32 pounds per year.

280
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.201
Now,

281
00:17:08.201 --> 00:17:11.340
that alone is very low intake and we don't know how it changed over the years.

282
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.230
We have no idea if it's increasing recently or been low for years.

283
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.040
So you just use the coon as an example of a population that needs a lot of sugar

284
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.480
and stated at dogmatically,
but that lot of sugars,
32 pounds a year.

285
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:27.870
And then I said,
wait,
hold on.
I thought you did.
That's what I heard.
Uh,

286
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.110
if we believe this study,

287
00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:32.650
the coon in Vera Cruz are consuming roughly the same amount,
but I'm not sure.

288
00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:35.650
I believe this study,
when it comes to the Vera Cruz population,

289
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.910
do you really think these urbanized coon are consuming only three,
eight ounce?

290
00:17:39.911 --> 00:17:40.960
So this per week.

291
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:46.170
So the implication was as population of Caribbean islanders immigrates to Vera

292
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:51.150
Cruz,
they move into the city and they consume sugar back where they used to live

293
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:54.900
because they trade for it.
Then when they get into the city,
um,

294
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.710
so five glasses of Koolaid,
no candy,
no ice cream,
nothing.

295
00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:02.370
I'd like to know more about the urban CUNA before I accept such an analysis is

296
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:04.230
valid on top of this.
As they say,

297
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:08.610
the analysis is done mostly of women because the women were available to study

298
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:10.800
because they were at home during the day on quote.

299
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.220
So what were the men consuming and what were the children consuming when they

300
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:14.941
weren't at home?

301
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:18.840
And was there something magical about this freak food frequency questionnaire

302
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:21.180
and these researchers that they captured it accurately.

303
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.200
So this is what science is.
You have studies,
you have evidence in.

304
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:27.870
The question always is you've got competing hypothesis.

305
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.840
Does this evidence really speak to the hypothesis?

306
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.740
And I'm one of my issues with Steven,

307
00:18:32.741 --> 00:18:37.741
it's what provoked are our initial discord is that he's constantly citing

308
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:42.690
studies that don't actually either they only speak to one hypothesis like the

309
00:18:42.691 --> 00:18:46.950
overfeeding study or they're poorly constructed in poorly done.

310
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:51.951
So even this hazed example with the honey is something we discussed in email

311
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:54.090
very kindly and we went back and forth and I said,

312
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:58.410
I don't actually think it's a reputation because the hypothesis I'm defending

313
00:18:58.411 --> 00:18:58.741
here,

314
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:03.540
the case against sugar is you add sugar to any populations,

315
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:07.470
native diet,
and you get epidemics of obesity and diabetes.

316
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.120
So here's a population that's been eating honey for maybe thousands of years.

317
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.380
In fact,
when they emigrated to this area they made,

318
00:19:15.381 --> 00:19:20.350
I've added honey to their diet and had obesity and diabetes then and Steven

319
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:24.750
points out in the book obesity and diabetes in a hunter gatherer populations,

320
00:19:24.751 --> 00:19:28.050
a death sentence for the child and for the mother who gives birth.

321
00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:31.110
So you're going to very quickly weed out anyone.
So again,

322
00:19:31.111 --> 00:19:34.020
it just comes back to this question of does this actually does,

323
00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:39.021
is it a refutation of the hypothesis that I found a hunter gatherer population

324
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:43.650
that eats a lot of honey and is in fat?
And the answer is,
I don't think so.

325
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.140
Stephen thinks it does.
You could flip a coin.

326
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.540
All of this can be settled with experiments.

327
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.190
One of the experiments we did at Noci,
uh,

328
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:58.220
so one of the metabolic problems that goes along with obesity and diabetes and

329
00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:00.870
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,

330
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:05.040
it's endemic to used to be 20 years ago,
if he had alcoholic fatty,

331
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:07.290
if he had fatty liver disease at Dr. Wood,

332
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.560
and you told the doctor he didn't smoke,
they would assume you were allying.

333
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.570
Now it's so common and so common in children and particularly common in Hispanic

334
00:20:15.571 --> 00:20:20.190
children.
The uh,
that it's clear it's not caused by alcohol.

335
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:21.660
And the question is what causes it?

336
00:20:21.661 --> 00:20:25.570
Cause if you could create a fatty liver with the macronutrient,

337
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.740
you could probably create insulin resistance as well.

338
00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:32.490
And then this whole slew of disorders including obesity and diabetes.

339
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.760
So my non for profit funded a pilot study where we just took 40 kid by the

340
00:20:38.191 --> 00:20:42.990
researchers at the UC San Diego and at Emory university in Atlanta,

341
00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:47.991
took 40 kids who had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and randomized them into

342
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:51.790
two groups in one group.
We gave them the entire family,

343
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:55.240
all the food they need it so they could overeat to their heart's extent,

344
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.830
but no added sugars in their diet.
No sugary beverages.

345
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.670
And this study was published in Jama four months ago and it's just,
it

346
00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.690
get rid of the sugar in the Diet.
The fatty liver disease resolves,
you know,

347
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.150
it was pretty simple.
I could there tells you nothing about mechanism.

348
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.750
The kids lost a little bit of weight.
Maybe it was a weight loss.

349
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:19.960
The conventional wisdom would be they just ate less,

350
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.990
which I wouldn't be at all surprised because they probably didn't like the food

351
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:24.340
as much without sugar in it.

352
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:30.060
But these are the kinds of ways you could test these hypotheses and problems I

353
00:21:30.761 --> 00:21:34.000
have with like the met analysis,
getting back to Kevin and hall,

354
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.460
there's two ways you could do science.
You could say,

355
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:40.900
let's look at all the junk that was done for 30 40 50 years.

356
00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:42.370
Let's find everything we can.

357
00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:47.371
That even vaguely speaks to the experiment and ignore any quality of the study.

358
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:49.990
So if it may be asked,

359
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.740
it asks this question like we want to know what happens when people do this,

360
00:21:53.741 --> 00:21:56.980
but in doing this we switched there,
you know,

361
00:21:56.981 --> 00:22:01.981
a fat intake around fat and carbon take around and then we can throw all that

362
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:05.980
garbage into a Meta analysis.
And the one thing,

363
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:09.940
I'm pretty competent if they did a poor job because the one study I looked up,

364
00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:14.500
the one with the biggest effect,
they mistook kilojoules for kilocalories.

365
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:19.860
So they reported that 400 kilocalories decrease in energy expenditure on the low

366
00:22:20.991 --> 00:22:25.090
fat diet.
One was a 400 kilo joule,
which is,
what's that factor?
You know,

367
00:22:25.091 --> 00:22:29.410
these numbers,
uh,
0.8 0.18 or so.

368
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.280
Several of the other studies where Jim Hill Studies,
we've talked about Jim,

369
00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:36.450
how the biggest studies who Jim Hill and the way we approach it,

370
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.720
the not for profit and say,

371
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.170
you've got to understand what the question is and you've got to design an

372
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:42.910
experiment to get the right answer.
