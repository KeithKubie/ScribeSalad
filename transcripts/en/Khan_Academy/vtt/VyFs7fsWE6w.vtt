00:00:00.473 --> 00:00:01.867
- [Instructor] We're
told Della wants to make

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:05.675
a one-sample z interval to
estimate what proportion

00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:08.809
of her community members
favor a tax increase

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.062
for more local school funding.

00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:14.266
She wants her margin
of error to be no more

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.820
than plus or minus 2%

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.978
at the 95% confidence level.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.486
What is the smallest sample size required

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:25.481
to obtain the desired margin of error?

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:27.571
So let's just remind
ourselves what the confidence

00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:29.568
interval will look like
and what part of it

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:30.868
is the margin of error,

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:33.515
and then we can think about
what is her sample size

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:35.094
that she would need.

00:00:35.094 --> 00:00:38.949
So she wants to estimate the
true population proportion

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.783
that favor a tax increase.

00:00:40.783 --> 00:00:42.200
She doesn't know what this is,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.265
so she's going to take
a sample size of size n,

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:46.797
and in fact this question is all about

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:48.933
what n does she need in order to have

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.418
the desired margin of error.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.461
Well whatever sample she takes there,

00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:56.689
she's going to calculate
a sample proportion.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.686
And then the confidence
interval that she's going

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:01.147
to construct is going to
be that sample proportion

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:04.189
plus or minus critical value,

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.695
and this critical value is
based on the confidence level.

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:09.321
We'll talk about that in a second.

00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:12.153
What z star, what critical
value would correspond

00:01:12.153 --> 00:01:14.429
to a 95% confidence level,

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.725
times and then you would
have times the standard error

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:20.698
of her statistic.

00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:22.904
And so in this case it
would be the square root,

00:01:22.904 --> 00:01:26.201
it would be the standard error
of her sample proportion,

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:28.779
which is the sample
proportion times one minus

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:33.493
the sample proportion, all
of that over her sample size.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:38.137
Now she wants the margin of
error to be no more than 2%.

00:01:38.137 --> 00:01:41.480
So the margin of error is
this part right over here.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.780
So this part right over there,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.335
she wants to be no more than 2%,

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:47.657
has to be less than or equal to 2%,

00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:50.768
that green color is kind of too shocking.

00:01:50.768 --> 00:01:52.719
It's unpleasant, all right. (laughing)

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.644
Less than or equal to 2% right over here.

00:01:55.644 --> 00:01:58.013
So how do we figure that out?

00:01:58.013 --> 00:01:59.870
Well the first thing let's
just make sure we incorporate

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.750
the 95% confidence level.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.677
So we could look at a z-table.

00:02:04.677 --> 00:02:06.604
Remember 95% confidence level,

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:09.785
that means if we have a
normal distribution here,

00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:12.966
if we have a normal distribution here,

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.799
95% confidence level means

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.168
the number of standard
deviations we need to go

00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:22.162
above and beyond this
in order to capture 95%

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:24.460
of the area right over here.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.641
So this would be 2.5% that
is unshaded at the top

00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:30.776
right over there, and
then this would be 2.5%

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:31.728
right over here.

00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:33.400
And we could look up in a z-table,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.700
and if you were to look up in a z-table,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.535
you would not look up 95%.

00:02:36.535 --> 00:02:39.530
You would look up the
percentage that would leave 2.5%

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.086
unshaded at the top.

00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:44.383
So you would actually look up 97.5%.

00:02:44.383 --> 00:02:47.100
But it's good to know
in general that at a 95%

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.632
confidence level,

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:51.883
you're looking at a
critical value of 1.96.

00:02:51.883 --> 00:02:53.091
And that's just something good to know.

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:55.482
We could of course look
it up on a z-table.

00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:56.815
So this is 1.96.

00:02:58.152 --> 00:03:01.914
And so this is going to
be 1.96 right over here.

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:03.191
But what about p hat?

00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:05.304
We don't know what p
hat is until we actually

00:03:05.304 --> 00:03:07.115
take the sample, but
this whole question is,

00:03:07.115 --> 00:03:09.600
how large of a sample should we take.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.642
Well remember we want
this stuff right over here

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:15.985
that I'm now circling or
squaring in this less,

00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:20.002
less bright color,
(laughing) this blue color.

00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.673
We want this thing to be
less than or equal to 2%.

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:24.066
This is our margin of error.

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:25.668
And so what we could do is we could pick

00:03:25.668 --> 00:03:27.688
a sample proportion,

00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:29.290
we don't know if that's
what it's going to be,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.170
that maximizes this right over here.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.143
Because if we maximize this,

00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:36.605
we know that we're
essentially figuring out

00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:39.229
the largest thing that
this could end up being,

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.458
and then we'll be safe.

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:43.756
So the p hat, the maximum p hat,

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:47.923
and so if you wanna maximize
p hat times one minus p hat,

00:03:48.818 --> 00:03:50.792
you could do some trial and error here.

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:53.021
This is a fairly simple quadratic.

00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:55.506
It's actually going to be p hat

00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:58.826
is 0.5, and I wanna be, I
wanna emphasize we don't know.

00:03:58.826 --> 00:04:01.659
She didn't even perform the sample yet.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:02.983
She didn't even take the random sample

00:04:02.983 --> 00:04:04.585
and calculate the sample proportion,

00:04:04.585 --> 00:04:06.419
but we wanna figure out what n to take,

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.045
and so to be safe she says okay,

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:11.644
well what sample proportion would maximize

00:04:11.644 --> 00:04:13.315
my margin of error?

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:15.150
And so let me just
assume that and then let

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.520
me calculate n.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.702
So let me set up an inequality here.

00:04:18.702 --> 00:04:21.559
We want 1.96, that's our critical value,

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:23.857
times the square root of,

00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:27.503
we're just going to assume
0.5 for our sample proportion,

00:04:27.503 --> 00:04:29.802
although of course we
don't know what it is yet

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:32.193
until we actually take the sample.

00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:33.517
So that's our sample proportion.

00:04:33.517 --> 00:04:35.583
That's one minus our sample proportion.

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:40.158
All of that over n needs to
be less than or equal to 2%.

00:04:40.158 --> 00:04:44.105
We don't want our margin of
error to be any larger than 2%.

00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:48.238
Let me just write this as a decimal, 0.02.

00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:50.142
And now we just have to
do a little bit of algebra

00:04:50.142 --> 00:04:52.023
to calculate this.

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:54.275
So let's see how we could do this.

00:04:54.275 --> 00:04:56.876
So this could be rewritten as,

00:04:56.876 --> 00:05:00.293
we could divide both sides by 1.96, 1.96.

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:03.500
One over 1.96.

00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:08.300
And so this would be equal to,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.344
on the left-hand side
we'd have the square root

00:05:10.344 --> 00:05:11.574
of all of this,

00:05:11.574 --> 00:05:13.153
but that's the same thing
as the square root of

00:05:13.153 --> 00:05:16.729
0.5 times 0.5 so that would just be 0.5

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.819
over the square root of n

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.582
needs to be less than or equal to,

00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:22.720
actually let me write it this way.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.437
This is the same thing as two over 100.

00:05:25.437 --> 00:05:28.362
So two over 100 times one over 1.96

00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:32.279
needs to be less than or
equal to two over 196.

00:05:33.982 --> 00:05:35.212
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:05:35.212 --> 00:05:36.884
This is fancier algebra than we typically

00:05:36.884 --> 00:05:38.138
do in statistics,

00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:40.808
or at least in introductory
statistics class.

00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:43.084
All right so let's see we
could take the reciprocal

00:05:43.084 --> 00:05:44.129
of both sides.

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.588
We could say the square
root of n over 0.5,

00:05:47.588 --> 00:05:49.005
and 196 over two.

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.533
Now let's see what's 196 divided by two?

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:55.450
That is going to be 98.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.986
So this would be 98.

00:05:59.291 --> 00:06:01.706
And so if we take the
reciprocal of both sides,

00:06:01.706 --> 00:06:03.123
then you're gonna swap the inequality.

00:06:03.123 --> 00:06:05.003
So it's gonna be greater than or equal to.

00:06:05.003 --> 00:06:08.486
Let's see I could multiply
both sides of this by 0.5.

00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:09.319
So 0.5,

00:06:11.087 --> 00:06:15.708
that's why I said 0.5 but
my fingers wrote down 0.4.

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:16.875
Let's see 0.5.

00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:20.329
And so there we get

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:22.465
the square root of n needs to be

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.798
greater than or equal to 49,

00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:30.661
or n needs to be greater
than or equal to 49 squared.

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:33.239
And what's 49 squared?

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:35.236
Well you know 50 squared is 2,500,

00:06:35.236 --> 00:06:36.536
so you know it's going
to be close to that,

00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:38.324
so you can already make
a pretty good estimate

00:06:38.324 --> 00:06:39.717
that it's going to be D.

00:06:39.717 --> 00:06:41.621
But if you wanna multiply it out we can.

00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:44.501
49 times 49, nine times nine is 81.

00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:47.751
Nine times four is 36 plus eight is 44.

00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:51.258
Four times nine, 36.

00:06:51.258 --> 00:06:54.601
Four times four is 16 plus three,

00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:55.518
we have 19.

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:58.177
And then you add all of that together,

00:06:58.177 --> 00:07:00.522
and you indeed do get,

00:07:00.522 --> 00:07:03.355
so that's 10, and so this is a 14.

00:07:05.933 --> 00:07:07.933
You do indeed get 2,401.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.527
So that's the minimum sample
size that Della should take

00:07:12.527 --> 00:07:16.080
if she genuinely wanted
her margin of error

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.448
to be no more than 2%.

00:07:18.448 --> 00:07:20.190
Now it might turn out
that her margin of error

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.416
when she actually takes
the sample of size 2,401,

00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:28.201
if her sample proportion is less than 0.5

00:07:28.201 --> 00:07:30.314
or greater than 0.5,

00:07:30.314 --> 00:07:32.891
well then she's going to
be in a situation where

00:07:32.891 --> 00:07:35.097
her margin of error
might be less than this.

00:07:35.097 --> 00:07:37.280
But she just wanted to
be no more than that.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.555
Another important thing to appreciate is,

00:07:39.555 --> 00:07:42.086
it just the math all worked
out very nicely just now,

00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:45.848
where I got our n to be
actually a whole number.

00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:47.598
But if I got 2,401.5,

00:07:49.888 --> 00:07:52.140
then you would have to round
up to the nearest whole number

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.787
because you can't have a your sample size

00:07:54.787 --> 00:07:57.365
is always going to be
a whole number value.

00:07:57.365 --> 00:07:59.532
So I will leave you there.
