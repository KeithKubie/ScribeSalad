00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.289
it's been said that every kid has a bug
period, you know when you're

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.759
nine or ten, you bring home spiders

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.539
and all sorts of creepy crawlies in jars and so on,

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.929
and I had a bug and period but I never grew
out of it.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:26.009
And I was just delighted to find as I
got older that

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.619
there're careers in science working on bugs

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.140
and one thing led to another.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.140
I've been at Harvard for fifty one years, 
I came as a graduate student,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.390
and during that period of time I've worked
on a wide variety of subjects

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.080
many of them pivoted on the study of ants.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.260
First of all from ants we've learned an
awful lot about basic biology

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.560
for example, how they communicate

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.640
almost exclusively with chemicals

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.580
this is such a different world, it's almost

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.529
the kind of world you would imagine

00:00:58.529 --> 00:01:00.320
on another planet

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.730
how these social creatures communicate, not through
words, sounds,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.159
not by the vision,

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.150
but by letting out different

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.990
odors

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.180
to communicate messages.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.600
they've taught us that. We've learned a lot about
the origin of altruism and cooperation

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.870
in evolution.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.710
That's one level.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.840
The second level would be

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.360
what can they teach us

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.410
about our, the proper conduct of 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.860
our own societies,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.820
and the answer has got to be

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.860
nada

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.380
zilch

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.100
nothing. We don't want to live like ants.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.960
First of all they are the most war like of all animals,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.370
colonies are always fighting.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.140
And second of course as everyone knows they're
highly subordinated

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.929
to the communal

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.000
activities

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.729
there are no three freedoms, or no

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.780
bill of rights, there's nothing.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.370
Because they are programmed

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.750
you know, to act so closely together

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.649
and I like to say just to tweak

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.890
my Marxist friends that

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.780
Karl Marx

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.520
Karl Marx was right

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.370
he just had the wrong species.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.529
My most recent work,

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:13.529
and the great deal of my time and energy have
gone into

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.479
the exploration of the world's biological diversity

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:22.219
which we now understand is mostly unknown,
particularly in the small creatures like 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.200
insects and bacteria.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.729
 I would say more than ninety percent

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.359
of the species haven't even been discovered

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.439
but we're also learning and beginning to put
a measure on

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.589
a very

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.019
fats and accelerating rate

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.379
of extinction

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.419
of those species. We're wiping out a large part
of biodiversity/

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:42.109
I'm on the board of directors

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.389
or advisory boards of 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.329
most of the large contributing organizations
the ones that deal with

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.239
the global environment

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.939
So I've been very much involved in

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.669
laying plans to

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.989
to save as much

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.409
of the world's ecosystems as possible

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.899
and most particularly

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.829
in the developing countries

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.549
that have tropical forest, coral reefs, and other

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.419
biologically rich environments

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:10.930
and I'm optimistic that

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.939
before too long we can develop were world wide
strategies

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.519
that will save a large part of the world's
remaining biological diversity
