You are listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,290
from [inaudible], W.N.Y.S. T. E

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,470
n NPR Three two one. Hey, I'm Jad
Abumrad. I remember quill week.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,220
This is radio lab podcast
and today on the podcast, um,

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,430
well first we've got a story from
our, uh, old producer of Lula Miller.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,350
She's not old. She's just has been
with us and now is it in school right?

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,840
Is that she's actually kind of young
chronologically. She's not old.

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,560
She's old to us. Yeah, it's
an old soul. Uh, any case,

9
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:39,561
this is a story about some of the sticky
issues that result when you try and

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,030
empathize with another being. Yeah,

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,370
it's a very different story
than one we've ever told a,

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,070
it started for Lulu when
she spoke with them. We'll,

13
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:49,650
she'll handle the introductions.
Can you introduce yourself?

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,000
A award winning author, fantastic husband.

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,720
Any nine out of the year or the
year? No, I'm Jeff Lockwood.

16
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:02,370
I'm a professor at the University
of Wyoming is an entomologist.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,170
You mean like a bug guy? The bug guy.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,990
And mostly he studies
crickets and grasshoppers.

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,960
And this story involves a kind of
crickets. That's well different,

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,850
the gorillas. Yeah. The grill accrediteds
yeah. And are they related to Katy?

21
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,480
Did you think of a griller?
Credit is like a cricket

22
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,270
on steroids. Okay.

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,120
Sort of like the whole Cogan
of crickets. First of all,

24
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:31,430
he says they're a little bulkier
than your average cricket.

25
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,740
And they tend to have very strong jaws,

26
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,410
very strong jaws and mandibles
that are really sharp,

27
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,750
sort of like a serrated knife.
And most of all, they're vicious.

28
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,060
They all had to be caged separately.
If you put them together, they would,

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,090
they would fight to the death. Yeah. Wow.

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,840
And so when I would go in in the mornings
and reach into one of their cages,

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,410
as soon as they saw him coming,
they'd fly into this rage.

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240
It's really sort of a show stopper.

33
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,820
They'll sort of rear up on their hind
leg, feet, their abdomens on the ground,

34
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,140
layer out their wings, and then

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,600
clamp onto his fingers. They would draw
blood. Whoa. Wow. So I use this, uh,

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,120
this glass probe on,
on, on the big boy, uh,

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,410
at least until the point at which he
snapped off the end of the glass rod.

38
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,140
Holy Moly. So I ended up with, with the,

39
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,450
actually there are two
that were very large. Um,

40
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,860
I would just take their cage when I,

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,850
when I went in and pop it
in the refrigerator and
go get a cup of coffee and

42
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,490
within 15 minutes, because
in sex or cold blooded,

43
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,520
they would be anesthetized by the
cold and I could lift them out.

44
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,080
That's cheating. That was my solution
for them. The little guys I could manage,

45
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:46,620
the big ones, I'm a little bit of
chill in the morning is all it took

46
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,080
to the point is these creatures
were completely alien to him.

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,110
There's like nothing about
them he can relate to,

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,800
but over time, the more he studied them,

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,010
the more he started noticing things
that made them seem way less foreign.

50
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,290
See, I kept these in these, for example,

51
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,280
as soon as he'd put one into a new cage,
it would make itself a little nest.

52
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,310
And once it has that little nest built
that's home in a very real way because by

53
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,780
moving them around to different cages,

54
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,470
he soon realized that they could
differentiate their, their nests.

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,160
They can actually tell the difference
between their nest and another.

56
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,293
And how do they do that?

57
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,300
They secrete a pheromone chemical and
each cricket is able to self identify its

58
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:37,150
own odor. Whoa. It gave me the sense,

59
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:42,151
and I think there's something to this
that they had a kind of capacity to

60
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:46,360
recognize self. Oh interesting.
We don't see that much in insects,

61
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:50,770
but they had a what appears to be
a capacity to say this is mine.

62
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,920
And then he began to think
differently about that crazy rage too.

63
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,310
Cause if, if you think about
it, here's this creature,

64
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,560
it's completely vulnerable to attack.

65
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,420
They really don't have a very
good defense for themselves.

66
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,600
They don't excrete nasty chemicals,
they don't stain, they can't fly.

67
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,100
So it's not going to
go flying away either.

68
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,730
So maybe that rage is their only strategy,

69
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,970
which again drew me into
thinking that I understood them.

70
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,570
Perhaps these little guys were more like
me than than many other insects that I

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,300
had worked with. So he
grew to really like them.

72
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,460
But then one day I'd been working
with this particular griller,

73
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,040
accredited China, move him
from one cage to another,

74
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,420
and he was agitated and had
decided to go on the offensive,

75
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:39,580
which involved trying
to come out of the cage.

76
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,300
So he was scrambling up the side of the
cage and to keep him from getting out,

77
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,960
Jeff slammed the lid down as he was just
at the edge and caught him between the

78
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,620
lid and the edge of the cage.

79
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,673
And I, you know,

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,680
quickly lifted the lid up and he fell
back into the cage and I looked down at

81
00:04:57,201 --> 00:05:01,430
him and, uh, what had happened
was I had ruptured his abdomen,

82
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,350
a split right down his
belly shapes and [inaudible]

83
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,500
some of the, um, the Viscera, um, and,

84
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:14,800
and kind of Glob you have of
yellow fat was leaking out.

85
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,193
Yeah.

86
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,670
Who was he and out of his
body? I, I felt guilt.

87
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:23,910
And then of course, I
felt sorry for an animal,

88
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,510
but what really struck
me was what he did next,

89
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:31,680
which was curl his head
downward, uh, toward his abdomen,

90
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,790
pause for a moment,

91
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,020
and then began consuming his own innards,

92
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,830
consuming the viscera that, that
had, that was oozing out of his body.

93
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,060
Um, and so he was, he was
literally cannibalizing himself.

94
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,700
Wow. That is disgusting.
It was horrifying. Mine.

95
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,070
Um, I had sort of like, I'd come to, I had

96
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,680
come to know them. Yeah. And then this,

97
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,440
this was just so out of the
imaginable, but the instant,

98
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,770
that word popped into
his mind. Unimaginable.

99
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,000
He had this sort of Pavlovian
reflex and he thought of this guy,

100
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,620
an old professor of
his, Dr Lefarge lefarge.

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,080
He was one of my mentors at
Louisiana State University.

102
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,750
You said this is a teacher
of his, Yep. Insect behavior.

103
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,400
He was one of the younger faculty
members when I was there, mid thirties,

104
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,940
slight of build, but incredibly intense.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,070
He's kind of an expert in animal violence.

106
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,680
And the thing he harped on over and over,

107
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:41,540
the thing he was trying to pound
into their brains was objectivity.

108
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,913
Two separate ones,

109
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,980
the emotions and interests from
the object of study and uh, yeah,

110
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:52,550
these wire rim glasses. And I,
and I remember if, uh, if, uh,

111
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:55,460
if you would ask you a question
like why does the gorilla created,

112
00:06:55,461 --> 00:07:00,320
do it's crazy war dance and you tried
sort of reading in will intention mental

113
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:03,620
states maybe cause it's angry or scared,

114
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,370
you would just drop his Chin and
look over the top and tear you apart.

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,400
His job in the classroom was to make
us good objective observers and Jeff,

116
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,750
Jeff stayed in touch
with him over the years.

117
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,150
I wanted to be good at this as
he set up his own lab. You know,

118
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,410
I had a stake in, in,
in earning his respect.

119
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,180
And so that day as he's watching the
gorilla created consume its own guts

120
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,750
thinking, okay, what would
lefarge see in this? So Mike,

121
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,050
my sense in my research is that what this
gorilla credit had done was perhaps to

122
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:37,400
have detected the odor of its own fats.

123
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,700
It sort of drew the conclusion that this
must be something good to eat without

124
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,450
sort of grasping that it
was, it's its own self,

125
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,110
the smell of its own fat triggered a
feeding behavior that that's highly

126
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:52,640
adaptive. Um, you know,

127
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,370
to feed on fat fats are very hard
to get hold of out in the world.

128
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,980
And so when you smell fats,
it's, you know, it's, you know,

129
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:02,600
it's like us and donuts, right? Um,
yeah. Go for it. Triggers feeding. Yeah.

130
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,650
It triggers feeding. So clearly these
things don't quite have a sense of self.

131
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,060
Right. So, so maybe they're not just like
me, which is always lefarge is point.

132
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,600
Don't put the creature in your
box. It doesn't want to be there.

133
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,130
It's sort of a moral danger almost to
sort of not allow the organism to be what

134
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:19,964
it is.

135
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,420
It's almost a sort of possess it or to
own it and to really treat the insects

136
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,460
sort of with a, with a, with,
with a deep respect, right.

137
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,210
Is oddly enough to treat them objectively.

138
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,080
[inaudible],

139
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,400
you know, he, he was one of the,

140
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,430
one of the professors who actually
engendered a kind of a good fear

141
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:44,920
[inaudible]

142
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,100
and he was the kind of person who
you, um, who you wanted to please

143
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,710
[inaudible].

144
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,680
Is that better? A little louder.
Yeah, a tiny bit. Is that okay?

145
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,010
Oh, that's great. Great,
great. But then years later,

146
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:05,040
something happened that challenged
Jeff's ability to do this,

147
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,370
to be the kind of scientist
that lefarge wanted him to be.

148
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,570
We're recording over here and there's
really only one person who can tell us

149
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,900
this part of the story. Will you,
um, introduce yourself? Okay.

150
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,190
My name is Tamara Carboni. Tamra
is actually not a scientist.

151
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,150
She worked for the Louisiana
State Museum and back in 1989,

152
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:27,360
she and Dr Lafarge, whose
first name is also Jeff,

153
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,700
we're working together
on this termite problem.

154
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,410
The termites were getting really bad in
the French quarter and it was her job to

155
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,940
preserve the historic homes. And
Jeff was studying the termites.

156
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:42,330
I never imagined that I would
be fascinated by termites,

157
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:47,010
but I was so, he made it fascinating.

158
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,540
Yeah. Fascinating. But then
one night in July, July 25th,

159
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,650
they met for dinner to talk about
how the project was going. And, um,

160
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,490
we were walking home, well,

161
00:09:58,491 --> 00:10:01,430
he was walking me to my house around 10,

162
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:06,431
10 30 at night and I think it must have
been raining or there was a threat of

163
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:11,981
rain because Jeff was carrying an umbrella
and I could hear footsteps behind us,

164
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,220
very determined sounding
footsteps. And, um,

165
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,540
we got to a corner across from my house.

166
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,610
And at that point,

167
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,760
this person came around us
in front of us and he said,

168
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,340
close your eyes. And in the process
of closing my eyes, I saw the gun.

169
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:39,960
[inaudible]

170
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,990
so she closed her eyes in a second later,

171
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,180
she felt a tug on her purse.

172
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,300
I could feel him take hold of the
straps and I was not going to resist.

173
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,430
And as I felt him do that,
I could hear Jeff say,

174
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,630
don't do that. At that instant,

175
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,500
I don't remember the
shot at all. You know, I,

176
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,400
I felt Jeff move and I guess
at that point I opened my eyes.

177
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,920
This guy had already
run, never took my purse.

178
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,550
I saw Jeff running toward my
house and I just ran after him.

179
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:24,690
I had no idea he was shot,

180
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,250
but he got onto the porch and he collapsed

181
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,763
on his back.

182
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,510
And at that point he was gushing blood

183
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,930
[inaudible]

184
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,250
and I was trying to get Jeff to
understand that help was coming and I kept

185
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:48,660
saying, um, you're going to
be okay. They're on their way.

186
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,170
And did he say anything? He couldn't talk.

187
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,440
He just, he had this kind of stare

188
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,140
and I just watched him die.

189
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,210
Mm.

190
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,790
The news came, I a phone call
and it just seemed, you know,

191
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,240
it was just kind of one of those,
those classic, unreal moments.

192
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,030
Something about this,
you know, must be wrong.

193
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,640
It wasn't Dr Loofah or
she wasn't really killed.

194
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,720
It seemed particularly hard to grasp.

195
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,050
On one minute I'm with this vital
person and the next minute he's dead.

196
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:31,760
Sadness, anguish, confusion,
hysterical, crying.

197
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,800
I was in shock. They never
found his killer. Never
found out anything about him,

198
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,840
who he was, why he would do this,

199
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,380
just this seemingly senseless act.

200
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,670
And that's how Jeff understood it
for years, that it was senseless.

201
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,110
But over time, something
odd started to happen.

202
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,130
The fudge started appearing in his brain

203
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,990
telling him that that word wasn't good
enough and he began to ask himself again,

204
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,320
how would Dr Lefarge want
me to think about this?

205
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,420
How would he think about his own death?

206
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,170
Okay, so I wonder if, if you
do have the essay with you. Um,

207
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,430
so he writes an essay, we read
the last four paragraphs of,

208
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,150
of the essay will one, two, three, four.

209
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,000
The year after I left Louisiana and
came to Wyoming as a freshly minted phd.

210
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,660
The first thing he does is he takes
lefarge his attitude on violence.

211
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,160
Violence is the baseline strategy
for most encounters between,

212
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,720
and indeed within species. It's
not some evil outlying thing,

213
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:43,500
but instead a baseline
strategy for all animals.

214
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,963
And in that light,

215
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,650
he looks at the actions of that night
sort of dispassionately. For most humans.

216
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,310
First he figures this kid was probably
mugging them because he was poor,

217
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,890
hopeless, poor, angry in her scared.

218
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,890
The woman became tangled
in the strap doctor,

219
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,580
the fudge having his own instinctual
reaction stepped between them.

220
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:06,540
So don't hurt her. You can have the
purse. I can picture him doing this,

221
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,810
but perhaps that action
itself scared the kid.

222
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,230
The young man drew a gun
and fired point blank.

223
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,920
I showed the essay to Tamra. Yeah,
well, no, that's not, I mean,

224
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,620
I don't think, and I don't know if he
stepped forward or not. You know, again,

225
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:25,050
my eyes were closed. I could
feel some kind of movement.

226
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,660
I certainly don't think
he stepped between eight.

227
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,000
There wasn't much space
to step between us.

228
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,010
For Tamra has been over the
event a million times in
her head and doesn't add up

229
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:38,850
so easily. First of all, when
Dr Lefarge spoke to the kid,

230
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,050
it wasn't exactly a command. It was
more like tunc to that and he was like,

231
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:46,200
don't be an idiot. Don't do that.
It wasn't really threatening.

232
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,640
It was more like, look,
logically, let's not do this.

233
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,980
And while she gets that,

234
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:55,340
the kid might've been scared
and not been intending to shoot.

235
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:00,650
If he never ever could imagine
himself shooting somebody,

236
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,990
he wouldn't have had a loaded gun.
I can't relate to this person.

237
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,760
I can't imagine doing violence to
another human being or killing them.

238
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,110
Um, I can't relate to that
at all. And over the years,

239
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,640
her friends and family coworkers tried
all different kinds of ways to help her

240
00:15:21,641 --> 00:15:24,130
make sense of it. Nothing really helped.

241
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,170
But there was someone that I
worked with, my boss actually,

242
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,320
who had been in Vietnam and
he took me aside and he said,

243
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,050
you know, you'll never understand this.

244
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,800
You're not going to understand
it. Yeah. Like don't even try.

245
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,780
I don't think there's any sense to be
made out of it. If we just stopped there,

246
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,590
then it's to say that,
that it's somehow um,

247
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,000
unnatural or inhuman and in
fact in a weird kind of way,

248
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:03,510
it's profoundly human. There's
no way I can understand it. Yeah.

249
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,521
In the end,

250
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:09,521
the essay itself kind of falls short
and Jeff admits that it just isn't

251
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,550
sufficient. But he says there is
a way of understanding this event.

252
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,570
He just hasn't gotten there
yet. But it is out there. Yeah.

253
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,220
It has to be. And Dr Lefarge would
have, I think said this as well.

254
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,800
[inaudible]

255
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,650
but for the moment, yeah.

256
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,750
I think I can say that
I, I understand, uh,

257
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,470
another beans eating its own
leaking and trials, um, at a,

258
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,210
at a level that I can't
understand. One of my fellow beans,

259
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,910
um, you know, pulling the trigger and, uh,

260
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,660
[inaudible] him killing
the man that I love. Yeah.

261
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,100
[inaudible] [inaudible] I am

262
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:16,610
[inaudible] [inaudible]

263
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,530
thanks to Lulu Miller
and to Jeff Lockwood,

264
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,670
his original essay first
appeared in Orion magazine.

265
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:25,850
It's called the nature of violence.
Definitely worth the read. Yes. See,

266
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:30,800
I am of the school that says that you
can't really make sense of violence like

267
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,340
that.

268
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,310
This is just a hint of
the danger of living in,

269
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,300
in a profoundly disordered
world, which looks,

270
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,370
I think I'm moved to school though,
that you have to try to make sense,

271
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,530
even if there's no sense to be made. Yeah.
