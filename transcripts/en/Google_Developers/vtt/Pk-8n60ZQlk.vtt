00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.800
Hello.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.730
I'm Timothy Jordan and
this is your update

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.190
about all the cool
developer news

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.350
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.990
Speaking of weeks, it's
just over five weeks

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.380
until Google I/O. That's
not really an update.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.840
I'm just excited.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.340
OK.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.851
Now for something really cool.

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:19.350
Have you wanted to implement
machine learning into your app,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.430
but didn't want to take
the time to get the PhD?

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.160
Well, Josh Gordon has a
new video series for you.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.470

Click the link for the first
episode and your introduction

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.820
to machine learning.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.170
Cardboard is it again.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.670
And now there is
an easy way for you

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.610
to embed immersive content
on Android iOS and the web

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.370
with a VR view from
the Cardboard SDK.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.100
And, yes, you heard me right.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.820
A native Cardboard SDK
is now available for iOS.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.160
Click through to the blog
post for all the links.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.240
Learn how to use flexibility to
your advantage with these tips

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.570
from the Director of
Business Development at MOBI

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.130
systems, the company
behind Office Suite,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.510
a successful mobile office
solution for Android

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.560
with a user base of
over 200 million.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.470
This is the latest post
from the inside AdMob blog

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.970
series featuring
monetization tips straight

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.360
from successful app developers.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.030
The 2016 Android
experiments I/O challenge

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.870
is now ready for your code.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.490
The top three winners
of this contest

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.150
will receive a trip to
this year's Google I/O

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.780
and the five runner-ups
will get the new Nexus 6p.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.670
From now through
April 13th, you can

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.970
enter by submitting your
experiments to the gallery.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.290
The Google Cloud data
store is simplifying

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.630
pricing which will
cut costs dramatically

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.240
for most use cases.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.690
Cloud Datastore is a highly
scalable, no SQL database,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.940
for Web and mobile applications.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.700
Along with a simpler
pricing model,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.080
it will be a more transparent
method of calculating

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.250
stored data in Cloud Datastore.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.350
See the blog post
for all the details.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.690
Also new from the
Google Cloud platform,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.700
you can now resize Google
Cloud persistent disks

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.550
without downtime.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.760
With this feature, persistent
disk capacity planning

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.500
becomes much simpler.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.590
It's as easy as a button
click or a single API call,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.430
doesn't cause any downtime
to Google Compute Engine

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.120
instances, doesn't
require snapshotting,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.850
and it applies to all persistent
disks including the recently

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.340
announced 64 terabyte volumes.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.590
One last thing.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.410

Google April fools jokes,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.320
