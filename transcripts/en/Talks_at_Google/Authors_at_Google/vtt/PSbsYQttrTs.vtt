00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.850
presenter: Thank you all for coming. Just
wanted to introduce Jeff a bit. He is a professor

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.350
of history at the University of California
Irvine. He is a specialist in Chinese history

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.740
and has written several previous titles on
the topic including "Global Shanghai", "China's

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.789
Brave New World and 20th-Century China". His
latest title "China in the 21st Century" has

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.740
been described as a guide through the thickets
of China's history and the turbo driven landscape

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.230
of its current affairs. Please join me in
welcoming Jeff Wasserstrom to Google.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.230
[applause]

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:44.351
Jeff: Thanks a lot for having me. Thanks for
coming out. It's very fitting I think to speak

00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:49.700
here because it's the center of the first
big news story that hit after I sent my drafts

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.850
off for this book. So um, there'll be something
on Google in China in the second edition if

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.670
I'm lucky enough to have one. We always say
you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.110
I'm so happy with the cover that I don't mind
if people judge it a little by this. And also

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.590
it's a striking cover that has meant something
different to me as I've been giving talks

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.990
about the book around. The basic meaning of
the cover, the top picture pulls you into

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.710
thinking about China as having changed in
many ways, that many things are going on there

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.399
that would have been unimaginable in Mao's
time, that you just don't associate with places

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.929
that are under Communist Party rule. Whereas
the bottom picture encourages you to think

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.299
about things that have been continuities,
though not complete continuities from Mao's

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.009
time because after all they are wearing western
suits rather than what we think of as the

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.840
Mao suits.
But one of the things that came out when I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.740
gave a book talk in Irvine, and one of my
colleagues who had grown up in China said,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.030
but you're not talking about what the men
at the top and the men at the bottom have

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.499
in common. So as the first audience participation
part of this talk, can anyone tell me what

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:08.259
these guys and these guys have in common?
Besides the fact that they're wearing black

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.370
and red, well their wearing western style
clothes, those are two things, but there's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.340
something about them else that they have in
common. Nobody, almost nobody gets this right,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.049
so don't be afraid. Yeah.

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.870
They're urban. That's a good point, yeah that
in one of the, and that I think is something

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.500
that for a long time the covers of books about
China would show you the countryside, so that's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.640
a good thing; it reflects the fact that one
of the big stories about China is how rapidly

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.760
its urbanizing. That's a good answer. There's
a later question I'll give you where there's

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.230
a right answer and a wrong answer, this one
doesn't have it. But the answer that I, that

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.140
made, took me by surprise and then of course
I thought, of course. All of them have dyed

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.080
hair. [Laughter] The Communist Party is trying
to convince people that it's changing, and

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.180
it is changing, but it's trying to convince
them that it's got a youthification thing

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.319
going on. But the youthification often means
that a 70 year olds leadership set is giving

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.920
way to a 65 year old one. So they're actually
required to dye their hair black, or at least

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.939
that's the expectation.
The book has questions and answers, a lot

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.140
of commonly asked questions that are then
answered in various ways, often trying to

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.010
flip expectations or tell you surprising things.
In a talk about the book I can't tell you

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.600
everything you need to know but that's why
I pick out five things that everyone needs

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.760
to know. A couple of which I thought would
be particularly relevant for this setting.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.340
Some of which I've been talking about in many
places. The first thing, and some of these

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:50.159
are self explanatory, some will need explanation
as I go along. China is incredibly diverse;

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.980
that's number one. When you think about China,
think about brave new world as much as you

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.181
think about 1984, even though 1984 is talked
about more often in China. And China is more

00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:03.510
often described as Orwellian than Huxleyan,
but I think there's this as much at least

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.950
to be said for the brave new world vision.
This I probably don't need to really explain

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.370
the importance at this particular setting
but the role of the Internet in China is complicated.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.220
The fourth, modernization is not the issue
it was. The fifth, the U.S. and the PRC are

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.080
alike in some ways. And that's important I
think because there's a tendency in the U.S.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.169
and in China to treat our two countries as
opposites, as totally unlike. So I'm not saying

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.440
they're exactly the same, but I'm saying their
more alike than either side often realizes.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.960
So that's the last time I'm gonna read text.
Maybe the, one of the last times I'll read

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.759
text that's on a PowerPoint. So the first
thing is that China is very incredibly diverse

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:53.020
and I think often the media, and by that I
don't mean what all Journalists write from

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.390
China, there's some wonderful journalists
working in China. But if you just have a sort

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.340
of passing interest in China and you're just
getting news about it from sound bites you

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.780
could easily come away with an idea that China
is an essentially homogenous place or largely

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.810
homogenous place. What I try to say in the
book is that while it may be more homogenous

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.819
in some specific ways than other places for
example, unlike the United States there aren't

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.599
a lot of people who trace their descent back
to totally different parts of the world; unlike

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.789
Indonesia there isn't quite the linguistic
variety there, it may not have as much religious

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.190
variety as India. It may be less heterogeneous
in some ways than those places, but that's

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.949
a far cry from saying it's largely homogenous.
It's in fact a very diverse place. And even

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.690
some of the things that are thought of as
representing the largely homogeneousness of

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.509
it when you push on it, start to collapse.
For example it is commonly said that 90% of

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:52.060
Chinese belong to one ethnic group; the Han
Chinese. And that their 55, 50 some odd other

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.050
ethnic minorities, but they only comprise
10% of the population. But if you push harder

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.261
on that and you look at the 90% Han figure,
you actually find that there are differences

00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:08.190
among the Han that in another setting we would
describe as ethnic differences. The way in

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:14.000
which urban Chinese often talk about people
from the countryside, who like them are Han,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.220
involves all the stereotyping and notions
of being of a lesser quality, is a term that

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.889
is sometimes use, that we would think, that
we would associate with ethnic or racial prejudice.

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.520
There's also a group called the Hakka which
literally means guest people, which are Han

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.690
Chinese who moved from northern China to Southern
China quite a long time ago and are scattered

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:39.289
out, they speak a completely different dialect
than the people living right near them. Ah,

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:44.479
in the 19th century when a lot of Han Chinese
women bound their feet, or at least in some

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.259
settings a lot did; the Hakka women never
bound their feet. So they had this kind of

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.940
cultural difference that in another setting
might be thought of as ethnic. There were

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.389
feuds sometimes, violence between Hakka and
non-Hakka living near each other. In another

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:01.380
setting that would be thought of as inter-ethnic
violence, so that's just the kind of diversity

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.520
within there. There's also religious diversity,
diversity based on region and locale. Local

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.930
identities become very important in China.
Gender, how people are experienced changes

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.139
in China. It's very different when people
ask me how Chinese feel about 'X'. These are

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:20.550
the kinds of things I break down. You know,
do you mean male Chinese or female? Do you

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.490
mean living near the sea coast where the cities
have been booming, or in the more hinterland

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.310
areas where the cities are hoping to boom
soon? Do you mean, what are you talking about?

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.159
But often what I come down to most, and this
is one section that I'll read a short passage

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:42.099
about, is age differences that I think I really
want to know how old are these Chinese that

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:47.080
you want me to say what's their attitude toward
America or something like that. And these

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.949
are just some images that go along with this
talk. So one of the questions that I ask in

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:58.789
the book and then answer is how important
are age divides in China? Generation gaps

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:02.710
are present in every part of the world, but
the speed with which China has changed in

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.910
the past several decades makes the one in
the PRC a chasm of unusual size. Here are

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:14.960
some basic facts worth noting. In 2007 more
than 40% of the citizen of PRC were under

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.319
30 years old. More than 20% were 15 or younger.
Meaning that for close to half the people

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:27.659
alive in China today, Mao has always been
dead. And for roughly a quarter of them the

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:32.729
Berlin Wall has always been rubble.
Switching from political to social issues

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:38.229
more than half of all Chinese were never alive
in a China that did not have a large divide

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:42.050
separating those who have benefitted most
from the reforms and those that have been

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:47.970
left behind by them. While those between 30
and 65 have a memory of more egalitarian times

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:53.480
that have disappeared. And those older than
that may have a, may see the current disparities

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.339
between the haves and have not's as a return
to a socially divided, economically divided

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:03.589
landscape that they knew in their youth that
then had disappeared and has now come back.

00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:08.100
In cultural terms, most middle aged urban
parents are people who until they were in

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.370
their 30's never made a private phone call
or rode in a car. For the main phones were

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.589
still shared neighborhood ones and the main
urban vehicle; still bicycles and buses, as

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:24.430
recently as the mid 1980's which was the first
time I lived in China. And yet these people

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.200
have children who have always had mobile phones
and think nothing of hailing cabs, at least

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.140
those living in cities. This generation gap
influences an enormous number of things, from

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.720
attitudes toward the pace of modern life,
this can seem unsettling to some and bracing

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.700
to others; to views of China's place in the
world. And it affects phenomena that are presented,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:50.360
often in the sound bite driven commentary,
and even in Chinese media as well, as transcending

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.880
generations. Consider for example the supposedly
timeless Chinese attachment to quote unquote

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:02.120
Confucian values; such as social harmony.
The oldest residents of the PRC can remember

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.550
a time when China was governed by a
non-communist regime, that of Chiang Kai-Shek

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.430
that venerated Confucius and made much of
the need to follow his moral dictates. For

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:16.160
Chinese born between the mid to late 1940's
and early 1960's by contrast, the current

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.680
celebration of Confucius and his ideas may
seem a bit odd, since they may remember mass

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:27.060
campaigns to criticize all vestiges of Confucianthought.
But for Chinese born recently who are unfamiliar

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.390
with this history, it is often ignored or
glossed over in school books and their parents

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.620
sometimes prefer not to talk about it. There's
nothing remarkable at all about President

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:43.970
Hu Jintao's claim that communism and Confucianism
are compatible rather than opposite ideas.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:50.329
So these are some images that would seem ordinary
to some Chinese of a certain age and extraordinary

00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:54.149
for others, things people they thought they
would never see, things that they've simply

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:59.040
always seen. These are fashion magazines and
modern lifestyle magazines that in Mao's day

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.490
would be considered a kind of banned literature
because they promoted bourgeois materialist

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:08.900
values. But now Chinese who are in their 20's
have just grown up always seeing style and

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.079
fashion magazines and don't think of it as
something that at any point would be viewed

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:20.260
as dangerous. And so forth.
All right. This is the Orwell vs. Huxley side

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:26.041
of things that I treated in my last book,
my book before last, "China's Brave New World

00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:31.440
and Other Tales for Global Times". But I revisit
in this one in part, in part because I got

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.790
something wrong, or I didn't go far enough
in one part of it and so I get to correct

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:43.110
this with a new book. Um, the basic idea is
that if you think about these two books that

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:47.510
are often taught together or talked about
together as providing two different dystopian

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:52.890
views of the future, is that there are two
different views of authoritarian rule. Ah,

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.232
Huxley's, in Orwell's' view which has become
the most famous or most talked about in the

00:11:57.232 --> 00:12:01.380
United States, certainly the one talked about
most to China, in regard to China, is a Big

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.160
Brother state where the government is watching
you, where the people are kept in line through

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.361
fear, and where the government forces you
to believe whatever it says, so they can force

00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:17.199
you to believe that 2+2=5. It's a hard form
of authoritarianism that governs by fear.

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:23.029
In Huxley's "Brave New World" which was written
earlier, that actually Huxley was a teacher

00:12:23.029 --> 00:12:30.029
of Orwell's' at Eden which is an interesting
little side fact. Um in Huxley's "Brave New

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:35.370
World", people are kept in line in a different
way, by the government playing to their pleasures

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:41.411
and their desires. So in Huxley's vision of
the future, people are kept docile through

00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:47.459
Soma, this bliss inducing drug that's readily
available, through the feelies which are these

00:12:47.459 --> 00:12:54.810
sort of high level immersive pornographic
forms of entertainment. So there's sort of

00:12:54.810 --> 00:13:01.620
this way in which people don't rise up because
their blissed out and kept very busy and also

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:07.029
divided from one other based on lifestyles.
Whereas in the 1984 world, everybody's in

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:12.579
the same boat but they don't rise up because
of fear, what will happen to them. So I think

00:13:12.579 --> 00:13:16.990
these are useful to think about these two
visions of the future. And Orwell and Huxley

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:23.269
when they were alive argued about which of
them they thought were the better prediction.

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:29.230
So with China, it's often thought of in Orwellian
terms. And when Huxley was talking, when he

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.670
was criticized in 1984, he said I don't think
the style of boot on the face rule that you

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:39.149
describe is really what the dictators of the
future will use. So in China there clearly

00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:44.610
are moments and places in which the boot on
the face is exactly um, the way that control

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:50.423
is exercised. But I think a lot of control
or what keeps people from taking to the streets,

00:13:50.423 --> 00:13:54.221
and it's not just in China, but throughout
the 21st Century, a lot of what's going on

00:13:54.221 --> 00:14:01.449
is much more what Huxley was describing; a
society of the spectacle and of hedonism in

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:08.589
which people are too busy in various ways
to take political action and are kind of dulled

00:14:08.589 --> 00:14:14.410
or satisfied, so the manipulation of pleasure
rather than fear can often keep people. One

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:19.019
of the things to think about with Huxley vs.
Orwell, is that Orwell encourages you to think

00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:23.720
about who's watching you, and Huxley encourages
you to think about what you're watching and

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.759
what keeps you busy, and if you think about
the internet story, we can get back to that

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:32.070
as well. There's a side of censorship and
control by the Government, there's also a

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:37.730
side of the Internet in China, as the Internet
in other places, if you go to an Internet

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.980
Cafe in China, you don't find a lot of um,
young people trying to get around the great

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:47.670
firewall and read off limit sites. There may
be some, but you find a lot of people playing

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:53.399
first person shooter games, which could arguably
be one of the forms of Soma of the present

00:14:53.399 --> 00:15:00.051
day. Now in, in my book, what I talked about
in the earlier book, I talked about China

00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:06.930
going through 1984 periods and Brave New World
periods, which in Chinese someone is talking

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.250
about tightening and loosening of political
controls, so I said 1989, when there was a

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:16.991
massacre that put an end to protests in Beijing,
and scores of other cities, and then the government

00:15:16.991 --> 00:15:22.920
came out and said there was no massacre. There
was just, there were just rioters that were

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.570
quelled by very restrained kinds of troups
and you'd better believe this. That was an

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:33.149
Orwellian moment, the government were saying,
with its big lie 2+2=5 and you better believe

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:40.069
it. Fairly soon after that there was this
loosening up of political controls and I think

00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:45.220
there was more of a Brave New World moment.
And there was a lot of focus on consumerism,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:49.649
what was keeping people from going back on
the street maybe partly fear, but partly that

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:56.100
they were busy indulging in new pleasures.
So I talked about this temporal side of this,

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.779
these two paradigms, but what I didn't talk
about is that there's also this geographical

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:02.759
side, and I wanted to read a brief part on
that.

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:07.390
So there's an ebbing and flowing of hard and
soft forms of authoritarianism over time in

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:13.130
China, but there's also a geographical dimension.
In areas with significantly large and periodically

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:19.530
restive non-Han populations such as Xinjiang
and Tibet, the modes of control tend to remain

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:25.790
much more 1984, even when the country as a
whole is in a Brave New World mode. Conversely

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.790
in booming East Coast cities such as Shanghai
with their cultures of distraction, epitomize

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:36.040
by public spaces dominated by massive video
screens and their glittering department stores,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.480
Huxley tends to be a better guide. It's no
surprise these pictures were taken by me in

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:48.500
Shanghai. And so far while Brave New World
and 1984 have some relevance in a place like

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:54.050
Shanghai though it's more Brave New World,
in the former colonies of Hong Kong and Macau,

00:16:54.050 --> 00:17:00.250
they have never, since becoming part of the
PRC in 1997, been subjected fully to 1984

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.670
like suppression. And that's another thing
is that to think about the degree of regional

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.210
variation and of course that's something I
don't need to say here, because with the internet

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:14.050
what goes on in Hong Kong is totally different
from what goes on in the mainland. But publishing

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:18.830
is very different, there'll be no problem
at all for this book to be sold in the bookstores

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:22.890
in Hong Kong, where lots of things that are
banned in the rest of the Mainland are sold,

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:31.230
there'd be different issues if it gets through
into the Mainland. The internet being complicated,

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.550
this is something I'd like to get any questions
from you, but Um, one of the complications

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.780
what I would say is one of the things that's
always important to remind ourselves is that

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.430
we think abut in many parts of the world there's
a digital divide, that's is a common term

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:50.330
for either people who go online or people
who don't go online. With China it's crucial

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:55.570
to think of multiple digital divides that
separate out people geographic area, you're

00:17:55.570 --> 00:18:00.140
going online in Hong Kong, or the Mainland.
But beyond that are you going online and using

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:05.180
VPN servers that allow you to surf the web
by fooling your computer into thinking it's

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:10.930
going on from someplace else. In which case,
the fact that, what's happened with Google

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:17.510
is much, much less relevant than if you aren't
using a VPN server. If you used a VPN server

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.890
you could still be going on, on Google and
searching through the American version or

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.501
whatever. So there's a divide between people
who go online, people who don't go online,

00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:32.560
people who go online and don't go around the
firewalls, people who go online and are somewhat

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.090
creative going around and trying to get to
sites that are off limits, people who simply

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:42.950
go on always using a VPN that is allowing
them to use the Net much more like the way

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.940
people in the United States are using the
Net than the people down the street might

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:52.850
be using the Net who don't have the technological
savvy or the interest to do that. Another

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.390
thing is the term that has taken off for talking
about control for the Chinese Internet is

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:04.800
the Great Firewall which I think is a clever
term. It invokes a famous symbol of China.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:12.300
It encourages us to think, its lead to some
clever new language by Chinese bloggers who

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:18.220
talk about climbing the Great Firewall. It's
talked about once upon a time Reagan said

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.560
Gorbachev tear down that wall and now that
there should be America say tear down that

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.690
Great Firewall, you know, so there's a lot
of word play and interesting things with that.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:33.490
But I think it encouraged us to view China
too exotically if we don't interrogate it.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:40.020
And a term I like is what Jeremy Goldkorn
who's one of the most astute analysts of the

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:45.540
Chinese internet and runs a great website
in Beijing called danwei.org. He refers to

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:50.710
the Net Nanny. He refers to the Chinese state
as not so much, don't think of it as trying

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:56.700
to wall off access of information, think of
it as trying to steer users of the Chinese

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.530
Internet toward the healthy sites and away
from the unhealthy ones, much like a nanny

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:06.311
would. And think of China as doing things
that aren't uniquely Chinese but have a lot

00:20:06.311 --> 00:20:12.370
in common with the Internet in other settings
where certain things that are deemed dangerous

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:19.430
or not fit for children or others might be
kept off limits. I mean there are limits on

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:24.360
pornography in many places, there are limits
on certain kinds of speech in smaller areas,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.380
and there are places where there's limits
on a lot that goes on in the Internet, places

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.330
like Iran obviously but also places like Saudi
Arabia and Singapore where we can think about

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.460
the nanny as being a useful way to proceed.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.680
So anyway, we can return to the Internet in
question when there are questions but I want

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:48.000
to get through to the two more things, that
are worth paying attention to, and there will

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.390
be a free book give away trivia question,
this time with a correct answer. That I will

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.980
use, and probably my last time I'll get to
use this. I've been using to audiences, but

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.950
once this up on YouTube I think that's shot.
I'll have to come up with a new one.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:09.060
Alright, the big China question in 1978, in
China, and I think also very much around the

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:17.250
world was, will China be able to modernize?
After the destruction of the great leap forward

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:22.870
that lead to a massive famine. After the chaos
of the Cultural Revolution. Deng Xiaoping

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:29.020
was in charge, and he was saying his watch
word was the four modernizations. A lot of

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.370
the outside world thought finally there was
a leader of the Chinese Communist Party that

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:36.480
we can deal with, that seems pragmatic. So
the question was would China be able to go

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:42.770
from being a fairly poor country, to being
a developed country? Now though, I think the

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:48.530
big question outside in the world, but also
to some extent in China is how will China's

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:53.850
ability to have modernized and to be on the
road toward further modernization affect its

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:59.030
citizens and the world? It's not will China
go from being a poor country to a less poor

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:05.830
country which was what I think was expected
then. But as the titles of the competition,

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:10.580
"When China Rules the World" and books like,
that are saying. Look at what a future will

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:16.450
look like with a fully modern China, and often
playing to the fears of the possibilities

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:25.100
of that. I try to argue for a less obvious
argument to it, though I think it's what's

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.540
most interesting to me about it, is simply
that those questions are even being asked.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:34.421
Nobody was saying in the late 1970's, what
will we deal with a China, or very few people,

00:22:34.421 --> 00:22:40.010
what will we deal with a China that is hyper
modern. The question was will China be able

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:44.530
to feed itself, not will it become a colonial
power.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.460
So what is interesting to me is that there
was a lot of rooting for Deng Xiaoping in

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:53.040
the west to succeed in this modernization.
The view of Deng Xiaoping changed, when he

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.830
was a backer of the massacre of 1989, but
from the late 1970s to the late 1980s he was

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:04.230
quite celebrated. Time magazine made him man
of the year twice, which they rarely do. And

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:09.110
he was calling these four modernizations,
agriculture, industry, science and defense.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:14.140
There were protests against Deng Xiaoping.
The earliest was the democracy wall movement

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:20.700
of the late 1970s, which initially Deng Xiaoping
thought this was a healthy expression of differences

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:26.600
of opinion. Then when the people started talking
about Deng being a new dictator, he cracked

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:32.410
down on it. But what interests me about it
here is one of the most famous wall posters

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:40.160
that's well known, Wei Jingsheng who's now
one of the most famous dissidents in exile

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.510
from China, was a political prisoner and then
left. He called for a fifth modernization.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:50.890
He said that China needed those four modernizations
that Deng was talking about, but it also needed

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:58.170
a fifth, Democracy. Now that part's well known,
but what's sometimes forgotten, is that why

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:03.790
he said, the argument he made for why China
needed democracy. He said because without

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:10.220
it, the modernization drive and economic growth
will confront insurmountable obstacles. So

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.200
he wasn't just saying a democracy an abstract
good. He's saying that without that China

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.050
will not be able to have the economic growth
it needs. And now our conundrum is China has

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:23.620
had this enormous economic growth without
having democracy. So it's a different setting

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.580
than saying that China needs democracy to
become modern.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:33.130
Ok and here is the question where you get
the free book. I know that many of you have

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:37.310
it, but I'll send you another copy to give
away to a friend if you answer it right. This

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:43.610
is what a famous American said in 1979 when
Deng Xiaoping came to America and he was speaking

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:47.490
to him. "Mr. Vice-Premier, it is with great
joy that we welcome you to our country, and

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.300
it is with true love that we extend our very
best wishes to you and your people, on your

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:57.230
new long march toward modernization in this
century." Anybody want to guess, and I don't

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:02.010
know if we can get people from the places
being video-conferenced. What famous American

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.790
in the late 1970's would say that?

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.510
male #1: Jimmy Carter

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.950
Jeff: Jimmy Carter. I get that answer a lot,
it's a really good answer, but it's not right.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.380
female #1: Nixon.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.250
Jeff: Nixon. Another popular one, but also
wrong.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.541
female #2: Reagan.

00:25:16.541 --> 00:25:20.180
Jeff: Reagan. Reagan. Really good answers
that again are wrong.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.180
[pause]

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:27.390
Do you want a hint? Ok, one state he is associated
with is West Virginia.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.050
male #2: Bird.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:38.260
Jeff: Bird. Good, good, good again, but not
right. Do you needanother hint? There is another

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:49.370
state he is associated with. Colorado. Famous
American. Not necessarily a politician. West

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.820
Virginia and Colorado. Ok, I get to keep the
book.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.891
male #3: John Denver.

00:25:53.891 --> 00:26:01.430
Jeff: John Denver. Give that man a book. Hey,
way to go. John Denver, who performed for

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:08.680
Dan Xiaoping when he came on a visit, and
anybody who lived in China in the 1980s as

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.301
a westerner who would have a better chance
of getting that right because John Denver

00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:18.290
was some of the only music we heard when popular
music was played. John Denver and the Carpenters

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:24.571
came through. That just shows you how wide
spread the rooting for Deng Xiaoping was,

00:26:24.571 --> 00:26:29.070
and now you flash forward to the 21st century.
Instead of the question of what will it take

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:34.130
for China to modernize, and there parts of
China of course which haven't experienced

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.840
this kind of development or modernization,
but we are now in a period where we can imagine

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.560
a fully modernized China, in this kind of
visions of infrastructure. Shanghai has more

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.280
skyscrapers than New York. Not just New York,
but the entire West Coast of the United States.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:52.350
More skyscrapers. It has the fastest train
on earth, and its landscape is being used.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:57.610
Shanghai, it's not just that people go there
like Merchant Ivory did to film a period epic.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:02.830
Michael Winterbottom went there to film "Code
46", a cloning story set in the future, in

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.650
which he wanted to build special sets. He
thought it would cost too much money. He also

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.820
thought that the future would look more like
the present, than when you create it from

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.430
scratch. So he looked around the world for
places he could shoot, that would fool the

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:19.500
audience into thinking, that can't possibly
exist now. So he shot in Pudong, East Shanghai,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.460
and Dubai. And then rolled them together and
that worked.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:29.220
So China's now having engineering feats that
have impressed the world. They got a space

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.140
program; this is a very different kind of
country than the one that was asking about

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:37.720
the modernization. I think this is reflected
in protests. As I said the Democracy Wall

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:44.170
protest were saying we need a change in leadership
in order to become modern, which is what we

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:50.710
desire. Now a lot of times the protests have
some edge to them of the way modernity is

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:56.010
coming to us is effecting our lives in negative
as well as positives ways, or we should have

00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:01.210
a say in how we are brought into the modern
world. So even things that people desire,

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:08.610
they want some control over, and this is something
we know from the United States and other places.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:13.480
2008 was a year that really changed the vision
of China from being thought of as a backward,

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.750
to being thought of as a modern country, with
the technological displays in the stadiums

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:23.780
in Beijing wowing the world. The first protests
of that year, took place in Shanghai, or one

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.870
of the first protests. And it was against
the extension of the magnetic levitation train

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:34.720
line, this super-fast train, through a neighborhood
in Shanghai, which the local residents, who

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.520
are largely people who admired or liked the
fact that Shanghai had become this modern

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.550
city again, said we don't want it running
through our neighborhood. It's going to bring

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:46.520
down our housing prices, we're worried about
noise pollution, were worried about radiation

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:51.920
effects that would harm our children. It was
described as one of the first not in my backyard

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:57.400
or NIMBY protests in China. So the people
who were protesting were largely middleclass

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.100
people, or new middleclass. They organized
via cell phone and instant messaging. These

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:08.720
were not people who were against China modernizing,
but they wanted more control of how exactly

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.251
it was modernized. They thought that with
this type of thing we should have some say,

00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:15.670
whether the government listens to us more.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:19.160
And they actually succeeded, at least for
a time, in stopping the extension of the train

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.790
line. The year before there had been similar
kinds of protests in the city of Xiamen complaining

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:29.350
of a chemical plant being brought nearby.
And this is the bigger protests of 2008 were

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:34.600
in Tibet. There were big protests, and this
were often interpreted in the U.S. media as

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:39.211
being all about religious freedom. And to
some extent, of course that's part of it.

00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:44.770
But there were also about economic grievances,
and they were also about a complaint about

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:49.400
having a particular version of modernization
shoved down people's throat. Which people

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:55.200
around the world never like to have happen.
So in Beijing, what is said about Tibet is

00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:02.970
often that Tibetans should be grateful, because
we've brought them modern schools and modern

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:08.460
railways and we're linking them to the world.
What some Tibetans say, it's not that we're

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.770
against those things, but we only want those
things in a process that is benefiting us

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:19.300
as well as other groups that are living locally.
And we should have some say in how exactly

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:24.630
these things are playing out. We want a more
responsive government. So the protests in

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.600
Shanghai, the protests were radically different,
they were very different stories, but there

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:37.140
was a connecting thread I think, in this kind
of concern with the impact on lives of a form

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:44.031
of development that didn't have input from
the people being most affected. And so these

00:30:44.031 --> 00:30:50.200
are shots of the anti-maglev protests, most
of the photographs I took. These were pulled

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.400
from the websites.
The final point, and I'll be moving to wrapping

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.001
up, is China and the U.S. have things in common,
and one of the things that I talk about in

00:30:59.001 --> 00:31:02.570
the book in trying to bring this point home,
is talking about things that we have in common

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:08.070
today, which are often misunderstood. One
of the things, to the rest of the world, the

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:12.870
U.S. and China stand out in a special category
as the two countries. We might argue with

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:17.760
each other. We might say that China is the
biggest producer of greenhouse gases. They

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.150
should do something about that. And China
may respond; you are still the biggest per

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:26.870
capita user of greenhouse gases. You should
do something about it first. To a lot of the

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.350
rest of the world, we're the two countries
that are going to have to figure out some

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:36.050
way to rein in our enviromental to do something
about the environment. Together along with

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:40.081
some other big countries. So first of all
with a lot of issues, what we have in common

00:31:40.081 --> 00:31:45.210
seems more striking than what sets us apart
today. I first started thinking about this

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:50.800
when I went to Sweden to give a talk about
10 years ago on U.S., China human rights issues.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:56.351
And I had a whole talk prepared about the
contrasts between our particular focus on

00:31:56.351 --> 00:32:01.720
some rights, and the UN's universal human
rights package, like religious freedom loom

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.340
very large for us. In China at that time,
social and economic rights looms very large,

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:11.220
and I was going to talk how these fit in to
our histories and traditions. But I was interviewed

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:16.880
by a Swedish student radio station. And they
said, so when you talk about U.S.-China human

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.650
rights, you're going to talk about the human
rights issue that we in Sweden often think

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:26.580
of China and the U.S. being in the same category.
I said I don't know, what exactly do you have

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:33.160
in mind. Well, you both have legalized executions.
So the death penalty was thought of there

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.930
as having--. This was just something that
was eye opening, as a lot of times when you

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:42.920
have discussions outside of China and the
U.S. and you see that we are thought of as

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.850
two continent-sized countries that have always
talked about how much we hate imperialism.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:52.310
That seem to have managed to have, over time,
extend our territorial control. There is a

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:56.580
lot of ways in which we are put in the same
category. But what I talk about more in the

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:03.100
book, is how China today has a lot in common
with the United States, at the period when

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:09.990
we were a rapidly industrializing, rapidly
urbanizing, rising economic power, that was

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:15.930
being seen as a really challenge to the previous
existing powers. So the United States from

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:23.820
the 1870s to the 1930s. Prior to that the
empires, the British Empire and the French

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:29.230
Empire these were the major powers in the
world. London and Paris were the leading cities

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:33.290
in the world. The United States cities were
rising up and one of the ways they were rising

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:39.870
up and challenging those cities place in the
world was by hosting world's fairs. The descendents

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:43.350
of which are World's Expo, Shanghai is just
hosting one.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:48.460
Our railways were impressing the world, much
like the railways of China are now. So one

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:53.950
of the last questions I bring up is what kinds
of things do China and the United States have

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:58.980
in common. What other things. This comes after
the comment on Sweden. There are many other

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:03.360
parallels, some of which concern precisely
the things that Americans are fond of criticizing

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:09.159
about the PRC. For example, as Peter Hessler,
one of my favorite writers on China has noted

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:13.770
in an article about the instant cities of
China, where many factories use machines which

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:18.400
are pirated versions of U.S. ones. The United
States' industrial take-off was fueled in

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.270
part by just this sort of reverse engineering
that allowed businessmen in early U.S. boom

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:28.950
towns to make use, for free, of patented British
technologies. And as the US historian Stephen

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:33.700
Mihm has pointed out, in the late 1800's,
it was the United States, that was often seen

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:39.010
by Europeans as China is often seen now by
Americans. As a place that produced inferior

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:45.330
and sometimes downright dangerous goods, and
issues pirated editions of best sellers. Dickens

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:49.650
complained bitterly about how many unauthorized
versions of his books were sold across the

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:54.540
Atlantic when he came here. Something else
the countries have in common is that between

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:59.480
the late 1800s and mid 1900s the United States
built railways and highway systems on a grand

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.510
scale, which connected parts of the country
that were previously cut off from one another

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:08.540
and were sometimes hailed as engineering marvels.
That was also the era when the United States

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:14.730
hosted its first World's Fairs and it's first
Olympics. And as Susan Brownell, sports anthropologist

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:20.130
reminds us, when the United States first got
to hold the games in 1904, and previously

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:25.980
the event had only been held in Europe, some
foreign commentators assumed as they did again

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:31.040
during the lead up to 2008 that the IOC had
made a terrible mistake in letting the Olympics

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:36.100
be hosted by a country that might have a booming
economy but was clearly not ready for prime

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:44.030
time. And I have a few slides of the coming
of the Expo, and the excitement, the generation

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:49.840
and destruction and construction on a massive
scale that's going on for it. And I'd been

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:56.280
taking these, most of them I've taken, but
some of them are from others, but this was

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:01.171
us, a plan for it, it isn't exactly the same,
but you see the different nations of the world

00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:05.870
being represented by different pavilions.
And then I recently went to Philadelphia to

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:09.480
look at the sole remaining major building
from the Philadelphia World's Fair Memorial

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.760
Hall, that's been turned into in part a museum
about, a children's museum, but it also has

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.950
displays about the history of World's Fairs,
and you see the same kind of layout of, nations

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:24.190
of the world being represented there in 1876.
And one of the things to note is the kind

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:28.760
of cockiness of the United States then and
China now, this world's fair wasn't just the

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.990
first one, the Philadelphia wasn't just the
first one held outside of Europe, it was the

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:39.180
biggest ever held. Shanghai's Expo isn't just
the first Expo held in China, it's the biggest

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.620
ever held. There's also that kind of thing.
Trains were an important symbol at the Philadelphia

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.200
World's Fair, people could get there with
amazing speed, thanks to the new railways

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.321
and from wide distances. One symbol in Shanghai
of it's readiness to host the World's Fair

00:36:53.321 --> 00:37:01.950
was the Maglev super fast train being put
on display there before the World's Fair.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:07.870
This is also just describing this being a
time when the United States was bragging about

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:16.570
its ability to extend its reach further across
the nation. And there's an image I end with

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:22.210
here, which I've used in talks ever since
I took the picture several years ago but it

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:27.870
has different meanings at different times.
I first did it simply, just to display the

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.690
fact that in Shanghai there was a big Hype,
World's Fairs have always been hyped. Chinese

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:36.610
are not new at doing this thing, it's going
to be the biggest and best ever. The U.S.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:43.250
said the same thing for theirs. But lately,
as American fears about China have been growing

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:49.490
and a lot of American concern, in part because
of the hacking issue and in part because of

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.360
the economic issues, and part because of all
sorts of things I've noticed there's this

00:37:52.360 --> 00:38:00.070
nervousness in America about China's arrival,
China being the new potential power, much

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:05.790
like there's a nervousness though, there's
an added thing to it now because of China's,

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:12.510
thinking of China being so radically different.
Whereas when Europeans saw America rise, there

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:19.170
was a fear but there was also some sense of
cultural similarity. But this picture started

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.810
to take on a new meaning and it actually I
can see through a certain American eyes, the

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:28.240
size of this giant baby coming towards you
might be a little creepy. At this point in

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.330
my talk, you know I'm an academic and I've
tried to do this in a fairly light accessible

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:38.400
way, I've brought in the John Denver thing,
this is, you know how pop has this guy gone?

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:44.860
So I like to end by showing, I'll read one
final bit from the book, before that when

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:51.460
I show this picture now, I like to reattach
with my academic side, and this makes me think

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.910
of a quote by Homer...Simpson.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:56.230
[Audience laughter]

00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:01.850
He said, "Children are our future, unless
we stop them now." And I think the American

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:06.410
attitude toward China has gone from saying
there's like sort of, if only they could learn

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:11.740
from us, and they could become more like us,
and they could grow to be kind of this adult

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.750
nation among nations, that would be great.
To now worrying about what's gonna happen

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:24.201
to us once they are this full-fledged power.
But I need to end with the last question in

00:39:24.201 --> 00:39:28.820
the book. So I think this is important especially
after I talk about similarities. Is talking

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.550
about similarities between China and the U.S.,
does this, is this an argument for Americans

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:38.990
to refrain from all criticism of China, and
I say No. I want to emphasize this. Increased

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:43.650
awareness of similarities such as those just
noted need not prevent or even discourage

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:47.830
Americans from criticizing things that occur
in China. And when I get a chance to be interviewed

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:52.020
on radio I'll try to, whatever the topic is,
to slip in something about something that

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.760
concerns me in China like the sentencing of
Liu Xiaobo for an internet petition to 11

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:05.630
years in prison, which I think is something
we should criticize. But while acknowledging

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:09.260
similarities shouldn't stop us from criticizing
things that occur in China, or necessarily

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:15.040
stop Chinese from criticizing things in America.
It could change how we go about doing this.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.830
It suggests that, as Stephen Mihm, the American
extraordinaire, I quoted before puts it, "if

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:23.530
we want to understand how to deal with China
we could do worse than look at our own history

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:29.610
as a guide." And he says when Americans take
the PRC to task for certain things, "a bit

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:35.060
of empathy might even be in order." If the
residents of each super power thought as much

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.680
about how much they have in common as what
makes them different it could even help increase

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:44.160
the odds that whichever way criticisms fly
across the Pacific, they will be delivered

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.710
in a less arrogant and patronizing fashion
than has sometimes been the case in the past.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:53.420
Another thing that could help ease U.S.-China
misunderstandings would simply be for people

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:58.040
in each country to know more about the people
living in the other. I hope that U.S. readers

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:02.390
who have made it to the end of this book feel
that they now know a few more things about

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:06.740
the people of the PRC than they did when they
read its first pages. And I look forward to

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.920
the day when I can point my Chinese friends
toward a comparable work that tries to tell

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:16.450
them in a similar spirit of seeking to normalize
the experiences of a large and exotic seeming

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:20.970
anti-imperialist empire that stands by the
Pacific, everything they need to know about

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:25.410
the United States. Thanks for your attention.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:26.870
[audience applause]

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:33.550
Jeff: And I'm happy to take any questions,
comments, criticisms, any subject.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:45.160
male #4: Thanks very much. That was a great
introduction.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.610
Jeff: Thanks.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:53.380
male #4: I can't help thinking, sort of, what
is going to happen to things like Hong Kong,

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:59.750
which as you said is so different? What is
going to happen to Taiwan? And then if you

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:03.810
have some more thoughts, what is going to
happen in the Chinese countryside which is,

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:08.400
they're all so different from the part of
China that you've been focusing on.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:13.060
Jeff: Yeah. That's a great question. Um, and
in a way I think, I mean they're inter-related

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:20.240
in differing ways. Certainly during the lead
up to the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 there

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:27.190
were a lot of predictions including one that
I made that expected much quicker, tighter

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:32.700
controls to come in, sort of, of media for
example. I try not to make specific predictions

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:38.030
about the future even though I'm writing about
the present. But I did go on record making

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:43.580
one prediction before 1997, before July 1st,
I said that, I'd been in Hong Kong to talk

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:48.230
about a film about the Tiananmen protests,
at a Hong Kong University, and the students

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:52.370
in the audience, it had been a very moving
thing because the students were sort of saying

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:58.590
will we have to face this kind of brutality
next year? And I said I'm not gonna make any

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:05.600
predictions about Hong Kong's future except
I will predict that after July 1st this film

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.870
won't be able to be shown here. After July
1st it was shown for a month in a local theatre,

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:15.120
in part because the government was trying
to convince investors not to pull out their

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:20.850
money, in part because there were a lot of
Chinese officials who wanted to see the film,

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:25.920
and Hong Kong becomes a place that you can
go to get a sense of how China's being discussed

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.660
in ways that aren't allowed to be discussed
in the country. So the predictions of Hong

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:36.340
Kong being totally swallowed up and becoming
kind of a controlled thing have not materialized,

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:42.620
in part though because the Hong Kong people
have stood up quite bravely to moments when

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:49.660
it seemed like tighter control was being brought.
Hong Kong is very related to what's the future,

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:55.780
possible future of Taiwan, because one reason,
along with investment that the Chinese government

00:43:55.780 --> 00:44:01.370
has at some times pulled its punches with
Hong Kong, is it wants to convince people

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:05.800
in Taiwan over the long term that there could
be a way in which they would be integrated

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:11.630
into the territory of China, the state of
China while still maintaining the ability

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:16.681
to live very differently which is what Hong
Kong is then, the potential model for that.

00:44:16.681 --> 00:44:23.240
Um, but the future of it, I mean how long
this can continue with the, but I think there's,

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:29.470
at the moment there's a value to China, to
Beijing, to have Hong Kong operate separately

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:34.140
in a variety of ways. Certainly they rely
on a lot of the boom in Shanghai as largely

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:38.080
been investment. Sometimes called foreign
investment, but foreign direct-investment,

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:43.361
but sometimes coming from Hong Kong, which
is part of China, but it's still, you have

00:44:43.361 --> 00:44:48.690
to get a separate, it's almost treated like
crossing a border, an international border

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:53.310
when you go there. So it's a very anomalous,
unusual situation that's lasted longer than

00:44:53.310 --> 00:45:00.410
a lot of us expected. The Chinese countryside,
the changes there have been just enormous.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:06.700
And I think the question for the future is
in part that a lot of the, a lot of rural

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:13.810
areas have been left behind by the economic
booms and they've gotten some benefits from

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:19.800
it in part by workers from the countryside
going to the cities, working to, the workers

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:25.300
of this economic boom have largely been migrant
workers going to factory towns and sending

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:32.290
their money back to the countryside. Uh, one
thing that's happened I think, the most important,

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:38.900
two of the most important things to keep in
mind, one is the Chinese government has set

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:44.900
itself up in promising that over the long
run life will get significantly better materially

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:51.700
for all Chinese, but that some people will
get rich first. So there are people who haven't

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.560
benefited as much from the economic reforms,
have maybe gotten just some small bits of

00:45:55.560 --> 00:46:01.190
improvement who are thinking their turn will
come eventually. This has made the Chinese

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:06.500
government addicted to growth, high growth
rates. If economic growth, slowed, tapered

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.780
off, or came to a stop, you'd have a lot of
very angry people, who are already maybe angry

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:17.990
at, are angry at corruption and the unevenness
of the spread of wealth, of new wealth. But

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:22.050
then would be furious. Because it wouldn't
be that they were waiting their turn, it would

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:26.420
be that their turn would never come. So that's
I think something that concerns the Chinese

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:33.020
government a great deal. It's why they've
begun to try to move toward meliorating the

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.350
growing difference between rural and urban
prosperity.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:41.380
The second thing though to think about, and
this is true for rural and urban Chinese and

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:45.490
I haven't talked about enough is just the
wide spread degradation of the environment

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:49.230
which is I think the single biggest issue
that we should all be worried about relating

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:55.590
to China. I think there are problems with
having too much fear about China owning so

00:46:55.590 --> 00:47:00.281
much American debt which is something that
Americans often focus on. It's an issue of

00:47:00.281 --> 00:47:05.731
concern but the Chinese and American economies
are really intertwined. The Chinese government

00:47:05.731 --> 00:47:11.610
depends a lot on us buying goods made in China.
And the Chinese government is more dependent

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:18.700
than we are on continued economic growth,
because if there's an economic crisis in China,

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.510
it won't just be like the economic crisis
in the United States where a lot of people

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:26.820
complain but very few people take to the streets.
In China there will be much more serious consequences,

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:33.530
so I think some of the economic worries are
overblown, but I think the worry about, simply

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:39.840
the fact that the impossibility of the worlds
being able to take the environmental impact

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:47.860
of China and then potentially other places,
developing very environmentally, degrading

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:53.840
lifestyles, which of course were partly inspired
by emulation of us. So it's a complicated

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.011
moral issue, but it's simply the major issue
out there in the country side. It's a big

00:47:59.011 --> 00:48:03.860
issue, as well as in the city. Did I get part
of it? Ok. Good.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:10.720
male #5: Thanks again for coming. Um, my questions
on the valuation of currency. Ah it's been

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.840
a really hot button issue and it's, I think
become kind of a proxy for so many of the

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:21.460
points that you've touched on today. So, I
guess I'm wondering what are your impressions

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:28.530
on how this back and forth is harkening to
potential future U.S.-China relations, and

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:34.440
do you think we'll see a revaluation in the
RMB any time soon?

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:40.480
Jeff: Um, predictive question. And I'm going
to a seminar in a couple of weeks. Just because

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.470
I wrote a book saying it's everything you'd
need to know about China, doesn't mean I don't

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:47.700
think I keep needing to learn. And I'm hoping
to learn things about the Internet in China

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:55.200
story in conversations here. Ah, this isn't
an area which is my main expertise, but I

00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:00.210
think you've put your finger on it very well
about it being a kind of proxy for other concerns.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:06.450
And I think this is yet another way in which,
sometimes China and the US are seen in a similar

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:09.900
way by some other parts of the world as countries
that like to do things in their own way and

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:17.700
at their own pace. I think one of the things
to expect is certainly that any revaluation

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:24.040
will come slowly and gradually because the
Chinese government, along with being concerned

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:29.830
about its international reputation, along
with being concerned about the economy, is

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:35.370
very concerned with just stability at all
costs. So nothing that will, that nothing

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:42.240
that will move things quickly is likely. I
think it's, I think it's likely to remain

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.130
a thorny issue, and there're a bunch of thorny
issues between China and the U.S. So I think

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:53.930
in general the challenge is to figure out
there is no option between the two countries,

00:49:53.930 --> 00:50:01.460
working together on a lot of things, and so
that, we can expect it to be a time, we can

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:05.560
expect to see a lot of small tensions clearly
between the two countries as they're adjusting

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:10.450
to different places in the world. And this
is gonna be one of the things that I think

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:16.410
is gonna keep being a source of tension, in
part because of our desire for things, for

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:21.250
quick solutions and the Chinese government
likely to want to go very slow at all costs.

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:22.960
Thanks for that question.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:29.170
male #6: When we're talking about Hong Kong,
we're usually asking what the people of Hong

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:35.810
Kong think. I'm wondering what the perception
is from the mainland urban Chinese about Hong

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:40.980
Kong. Do they understand the special deal
that Hong Kong citizens have? And also particularly

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:46.930
in the context of Google Search having moved
to be served from Hong Kong, what is the perception

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:51.780
of that for people in Beijing and Shanghai?
Do they look at it as no longer Chinese?

00:50:51.780 --> 00:51:01.369
Jeff: That's' a very good question. And there
are a couple of parts to the answer. One is

00:51:01.369 --> 00:51:07.290
that I think if you moved to Google Shanghai
you'd have a certain number of Chinese saying

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:11.120
that's, you know, there's a saying that, "Shanghai
isn't really China". And I think it's been

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:20.510
harder to get a complete backing for the Expo
because while in some cases, it's seen as

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:24.760
Shanghai isn't seen that always as representing
the country. There's a lot of Anti-Shanghainese

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:29.480
sentiment which I'm quite comfortable with
having grown up in L.A. and knowing how the

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.420
rest of the country views California

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:37.700
Ok, so there you have it. So that's one part
of the question. Another part I would say

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:45.100
is that when I lived in Shanghai in the mid
1980s and I told some of my friends that I

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:51.430
was going to be going to Hong Kong for some
R and R and a break from Shang' they were

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:56.600
like you know, when you come back you've gotta
tell us what that, you know, is it really

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:01.380
as different and special as we always, as
we hear about, and you know, what are the

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:08.280
stores like, what are the roads like? And
when I, and it was dramatic then to go from

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:12.750
Shanghai to Hong Kong, it was utter culture
shock, much more from going from, yeah from

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:17.590
Shanghai to another part of China. But now
if I'm going to Shanghai and I tell people

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:22.060
I'm going to Hong Kong in a day or two, they
just shrug like you know, so what? We can,

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:25.140
you know, we can do all those things that
we want to and people go from Hong Kong to

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:30.010
Shanghai to have fun, which was unthinkable
in the mid 80's which I can't convey to you

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:36.110
how boring it was to live in Shanghai in those
days. I mean it's fascinating but in terms

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:42.320
of entertainment, in terms of options of things
to do it just didn't hold a candle to Hong

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:47.740
Kong and now it does, so that's another thing.
I mean the view of Hong Kong while it's viewed

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:53.820
as different I mean now I would say it also
is that there, you know people outside of,

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:58.450
I mean it would be a really good question
to ask people to categorize because I think

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:06.180
in some ways people in say a rustbelt city
of the North East, that is declining, they

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:12.940
might think of Shanghai and Hong Kong and
Shenzhen and to some extent even Beijing as

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:20.230
you know having a radically different kind
of life to what they have. So I think in terms

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:26.600
of the, so there are a lot of things with
that. So it plays into a kind of notion that

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:31.750
the leads are more the places that have prospered
vs. those that haven't as well as the differentiation

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:35.900
of setting. But I think there's also a lot
of, there's also a lot of curiosity, there's

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:41.730
not a lot of absolute understanding of again
it would be people who have moved between

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:46.750
those places, people who've spent time in
Hong Kong, you know, may realize, they may

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:50.640
see a kind of fit. Well sure, because in Hong
Kong they know that the bookstores are totally

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:56.250
different so they'd understand why something
else related to media, they know that the

00:53:56.250 --> 00:54:03.820
newspapers are very different there. To others,
so I think there'd be a lot of range of variation

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:09.460
on that. But I do think it's important to
realize how foreign to some extent some of

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:14.820
the cities within the mainland are even if
when we focus on control of information there's

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:20.120
a world of difference between a Shanghai bookstore
and a Hong Kong bookstore that people are

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:27.360
focusing on other things may be putting these
much richer and more developed and more linked

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.740
to the West places in one category. Thanks

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:43.530
female #3: You've mentioned the internet a
couple of times, and I just thought it'd be

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:47.580
interesting to hear, you know with your background
a little bit more about your reaction of some

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.530
of the events between Google and China's government.

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:58.370
Jeff: Yeah, Yeah. Well I'd love to learn more
about that because, um, it's a story I've

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:05.380
certainly been following very closely, but
I think there, it's been, and I can tell you

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:10.300
who I read that I think is particularly good
on following this; I read Rebecca McKinnon

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:14.580
who blogs about the Internet in China and
is working on a book about the Internet and

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:19.670
I think will be really important. There's
a guy named Yang Guobin who wrote a book called

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:24.360
"The power of the Internet in China," who
has a more upbeat, in some ways, view of the

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:29.010
possibility of the Internet for civil society
and new things going on. Um, I guess one of

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:37.410
my takes is that to me at least the Google
in China story is probably more significant

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:44.650
as a business story than an information story
because in part, I mean for a variety of reasons,

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:49.740
some of which I've mentioned, the fact that
for some people they go, they'll, some people

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:54.270
were never using Google in the first place
to cruise the net, were not interested, thought

00:55:54.270 --> 00:56:01.130
Baidu did everything they needed, why bother.
And maybe even had some preference for an

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:07.140
indigenous based company anyway. Some were
going through VPN's and now if they were using

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:11.560
Google will still be using Google and so forth.
But I think it's a tremendously significant

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:18.300
business story and I think that's a reason
to watch it because it is an effort to alter

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:25.000
the playing field in the kinds of negotiations
that go on between China and foreign countries.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:30.830
And as somebody, ah Zachary Karabell who wrote
a book "Superfusion", he was on a panel with

00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:38.140
me and he said, you know you have to take
into account what a company can do if it's

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:43.660
not making giant profits or not centrally
concerned for its profits, so his line was

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:49.660
to borrow it with attribution, was Google
can stay or leave with China. Dell computers,

00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:53.650
it's not an option. So I think you know, that
is important to keep in mind that they're

00:56:53.650 --> 00:57:00.270
both moral decisions. The other thing that's
been striking to me is how quickly the story

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:04.980
that I think a lot of Americans that just
have a casual following of China, might think

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:11.360
that the decision is all about censorship,
whereas the, you know, the spur was largely

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.619
about security and hacking. So I think that's,
that would be the crucial thing, I think,

00:57:15.619 --> 00:57:22.260
to bring back into the picture to disentangle
those two things which are, I think quite

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:23.260
different.

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.430
