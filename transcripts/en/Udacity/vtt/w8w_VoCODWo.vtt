00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.510
In the case of the ABO gene. The DNA

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.750
sequence will be transcribed into an RNA copy or

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.980
intermediate that will leave the nucleus, and go to

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.220
the cytoplasm. Where it will be translated by ribosomes

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.500
into protein. Now, we're about to dive deep into

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.800
these processes called transcription and translation. But first, we

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.730
should learn a bit more about this RNA copy,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.200
that's so critical to the transfer of genetic information.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.340
So if we follow the central dogma in

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.960
our example of blood type, our ABO gene, made

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.630
of DNA, is going to be turned into an ABO

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.260
RNA copy that can be trafficed to the cytoplasm.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.370
And here, it will be turned into the ABO

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.060
protein by ribosomes. Now these two arrows here that

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.050
connect DNA to RNA and RNA to protein are

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.830
what we're about to dive deep into. These processes

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.820
are called transcription and translation, and by the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.320
end of this lesson you'll see exactly how a

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.180
DNA code is turned into protein. But, for

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.640
us to dive deep into these processes, we really

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.210
need to understand a bit more about this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.470
critical intermediate copy RNA. You'll remember from lesson two

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.220
that DNA is made of deoxynucleotides, and that's

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.080
what I'm showing you here. This is the chemistry,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.110
the chemical structure we looked at when

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.210
we studied deoxynucleotides. And in this case, there's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090
an adenine, or an A as the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.660
nitrogenous base that's attached. Now, RNA is, chemically

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.420
speaking, incredibly similar to DNA. In fact,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.690
you should only be able to notice one

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.630
difference about the chemical structure of RNA compared

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.180
to DNA. RNA is made of nucleotides instead

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.430
of deoxynucleotides. And what I want you to try to do, select the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.890
region that distinguishes DNA from RNA. Focus down here on the RNA

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.090
nucleotide and there are four regions to choose from. I want you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.680
to pick the one that you think distinguishes it from the DNA deoxynucleotide.
