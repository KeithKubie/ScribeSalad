00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:09.109
How and when did our universe begin?

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.215
How did it get to look like this?

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:12.890
How will it end?

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.691
Humans have been discussing these questions

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:18.225
for as long as they've been around
without ever reaching much agreement.

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:22.228
Today, cosmologists are working hard
to find the answers.

00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:27.209
But how can anyone hope to find
concrete answers to such profound questions?

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:31.533
And how is it possible to explore and study
something as huge as the universe,

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.194
most of which we'll never be able to reach?

00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:35.974
The answer is light.

00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:38.118
And although light from
distant parts of the universe

00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:40.483
can take billions of years to reach us,

00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:43.689
it carries six unique messages
that, when put together,

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:47.019
can disclose an amazing amount
of information to astronomers

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.302
who know how to look for it.

00:00:49.302 --> 00:00:52.437
Just as sunlight can be split up
into the familiar rainbow,

00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:56.210
splitting the light from distant objects
exposes different patterns of colors

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.311
depending on its source.

00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:02.186
This distinctive light barcode
can reveal not only an object's composition,

00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:06.040
but also the temperature and pressure
of its constituent parts.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.054
There's even more we can
discover from light.

00:01:09.054 --> 00:01:12.034
If you've ever stood on a train platform,
you might have noticed

00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:15.251
that the train sounds different 
depending on its direction

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:17.402
with the pitch ascending 
when it approaches you

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:19.674
and descending when it speeds away.

00:01:19.674 --> 00:01:23.237
But this isn't because the train conductor
is practicing for a second career.

00:01:23.237 --> 00:01:26.453
Rather, it's because of something
called the Doppler effect

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:29.985
where sound waves generated by
an approaching object are compressed,

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:33.260
while those from a receding
object are stretched.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.899
But what has this to do with astronomy?

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.865
Sound does not travel through a vacuum.
In space, no one can you hear you scream!

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:45.974
But the same Doppler effect applies to light
whose source is moving at exceptional speed.

00:01:45.974 --> 00:01:48.191
If it's moving towards us, 
the shorter wavelength

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.603
will make the light appear to be bluer.

00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:52.877
While light from a source
that's moving away

00:01:52.877 --> 00:01:55.655
will have a longer wavelength,
shifting towards red.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:59.068
So by analyzing the color pattern
in the Doppler shift of the light

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:02.761
from any object observed with a telescope,
we can learn what it's made of,

00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:06.138
how hot it is and 
how much pressure it's under,

00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:10.264
as well as whether it's moving, 
in what direction and how fast.

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:13.073
And these six measurements,
like six points of light,

00:02:13.073 --> 00:02:16.153
reveal the history of the universe.

00:02:16.153 --> 00:02:20.759
The first person to study the light 
from distant galaxies was Edwin Hubble,

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.586
and the light he observed was redshifted.

00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:26.273
The distant galaxies were 
all moving away from us,

00:02:26.273 --> 00:02:29.995
and the further away the were,
the faster they were receding.

00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:32.880
Hubble had discovered
our universe is expanding,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.203
providing the first evidence
for the Big Bang theory.

00:02:36.203 --> 00:02:40.235
Along with the idea that the visible universe
has been constantly expanding

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:42.774
from a densely packed single point,

00:02:42.774 --> 00:02:45.025
one of this theory's 
most important predictions

00:02:45.025 --> 00:02:50.443
is that the early universe consisted
of just two gases: hydrogen and helium,

00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:52.737
in a ratio of three to one.

00:02:52.737 --> 00:02:55.390
And this prediction can
also be tested with light.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.654
If we observe the light from a remote,
quiet region of the universe and split it,

00:02:59.654 --> 00:03:04.412
we do indeed find the signatures
of the two gases in just those proportions.

00:03:04.412 --> 00:03:06.613
Another triumph for the Big Bang.

00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:09.804
However, many puzzles remain.

00:03:09.804 --> 00:03:12.458
Although we know the
visible universe is expanding,

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:15.100
gravity should be applying the brakes.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.956
But recent measurements of light
from distant dying stars

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:20.701
show us that they're farther away
than predicted.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.399
So the expansion of the universe
is actually accelerating.

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.545
Something appears to be pushing it,

00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:30.103
and many scientists believe
that something is dark energy,

00:03:30.103 --> 00:03:34.275
making up over 2/3 of the universe
and slowly tearing it apart.

00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:38.555
Our knowledge of the behavior of matter
and the precision of our instruments

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:42.697
means that simply observing distant stars
can tell us more about the universe

00:03:42.697 --> 00:03:45.027
than we ever thought possible.

00:03:45.027 --> 00:03:47.986
But there are other mysteries,
like the nature of dark energy

00:03:47.986 --> 00:03:50.287
upon which we have yet to shed light.
