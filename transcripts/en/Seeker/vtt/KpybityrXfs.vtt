00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.730
We live in an age of mass surveillance.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.670
And big data, mixed with the ever increasing
power of artificial intelligence, means all

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.199
of our actions are being recorded and stored
like never before.This information is being

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.890
mined to identify social media trends for
targeted advertising, but it’s also being

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.580
used to predict riots, election outcomes,
disease epidemics and that’s not to mention

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.109
the vast networks of surveillance cameras
that could be used to track crowds and individuals

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.320
in real time.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.710
This is EMBERS.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.990
A computer forecasting system that sifts through
the data that you post on social media everyday.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.690
It mines platforms you’d expect like Twitter
and Facebook... and it tracks things that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.710
you might not expect - like restaurant apps,
traffic maps, currency rates and even food

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.180
prices.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.990
Data from tweets and social media is useful
for predicting both disease outbreaks, and

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.761
events like civil unrest, domestic political
crisis, elections, and so on.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:06.140
You can use these non traditional data sources,
like restaurant reservation information, hospital

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.189
imagery and so on to predict the flu.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.640
EMBERS mines big data for trends rather than
information on individuals.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.440
For example, if EMBERS detects a mass cancellation
of restaurant reservations and then hospital

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.229
parking lots fill up, the system can predict
that there is probably an outbreak of food

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.550
poisoning or flu.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.210
And it’s incredibly accurate.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.420
EMBERS correctly predicted Hantavirus outbreaks
in Argentina and Chile in 2013 and political

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.380
uprisings in Brazil and Venezuela in 2013
and 2014.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.810
In fact, EMBERS is correct in it’s predictions
about 90% of the time.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.440
But EMBERS does have its limits.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.160
While it can mine public data to forecast
major social events before they happen, it’s

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.520
can’t predict spontaneous events - like
crowd stampedes or terrorists.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.510
An increasing concern in an overcrowded and
unstable world.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.590
Which is what Dr Mubarak Shah and his team
are trying to do.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.280
They are using video surveillance, AI, and
complicated mathematical algorithms to track

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.490
and predict the movements of dense crowds
and the individuals in those crowds.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.860
Crowd analysis is a very interesting area
and very challenging, when you have thousands

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.880
of people, it becomes very, very complicated.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.790
This is where A.I. comes in.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.160
It can help spot abnormal patterns in a crowd
like bottlenecks.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.550
Take the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia for
example.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.340
In 2015, hundreds were crushed to death in
a stampede.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.370
In the future computers may be able to detect
bottlenecks in real time and pilgrims can

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:58.370
be diverted to uncrowded areas, thus avoiding
stampedes and ultimately, saving lives.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.660
Another application Shah’s team is working
on is to track individuals in crowds in real

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.390
time.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.890
We want to be able to track that person where
the person enters, where he's going and where

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.450
exact sitting and so on.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.640
This kind of surveillance is done manually,
but computers are beginning to be able to

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.720
detect individuals acting suspiciously as
they move through a crowd.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.860
We want to be able to analyze the video in
each camera.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.330
We detect people, we track, and we identify
and so on.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.629
Using video surveillance and the networks
of cameras available in major cities, Shah’s

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.160
team is working on using AI to track individuals
from place to place.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:49.780
This Boston bomber was seen in many different
locations, so you detect a person in one camera,

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.140
then it disappears because it's not visible.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.230
And after sometime it reappears in another
camera maybe at a distance.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.280
Re-identification in the crowd is much, much
harder because there are lots of people.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.940
Camera networks data mined for suspicious
behaviour could stop future bombings.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.950
But it isn’t easy and they aren’t there
yet.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.440
There is so much data that needs to be annotated
so that machines can understand human behavior.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.700
It can help law enforcement it can make them
more efficient and it can help solve crime.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.930
But there is a downside to this.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.940
How much privacy are we willing to give up
to be safe?

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.930
The implications of these technologies are
vast.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.750
Perhaps It depends on how much you trust the
people who are mining your data.
