TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome to The Developer Show.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.990
This week, we're backstage
at the Ubiquity Dev Summit.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.410
Now remember to use the
nav bar at the bottom

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.730
to skip to your favorite
topic at any point.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.450
Let's start with the TL;DR.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.570
Check out the new
Android Emulator.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.250
An early preview
is available today

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.970
to help you test your app on
more screen sizes and hardware

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.120
configurations than
you have at hand.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.400
This update contains a
bunch of speed, performance,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.540
and usability improvements.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.050
Twitter used Doze mode
to improve notification

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.510
performance, and you can too.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.540
Check out this blog
post for more details.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.520
Removing the friction
of sign-in with Smart

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.400
Lock For Passwords increases
user re-engagement,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.500
monetization
opportunities, and provides

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.160
cross-device analytics.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.030
Check out this blog
post for what's new

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.570
and how to implement today.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.120
Google Cloud Messaging
handles 150 billion messages

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.760
per day for over
750,000 applications,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.170
and it keeps getting better.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.420
Take a look at this post for
all the latest, including

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.290
unlimited free
topics for your app

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.569
and a new suite of server APIs.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.890
A new Google Play
Services SDK is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.520
available with custom email
app invites, Fused Location

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.120
Provider updates, and
maps API improvements,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.480
plus a whole lot more.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.230
Hit the link below to
learn all about it.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.260
Now in beta, Trial Run Ads
and Interactive Interstitials.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.278
All to help you get more
installs for you app.

00:01:24.278 --> 00:01:25.652
Take advantage of
January's surge

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.470
in user activity on mobile
with Double Click's most

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.400
actionable research
and best practices.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.110
Map your existing expertise
to the Google Cloud Platform

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.170
with this new White Paper.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.670
And if you want to learn all
about the Google Cloud Platform

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.550
directly from
those who built it,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.660
come to GCP Next 2016
in San Francisco.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.657
Registration is open now.

00:01:46.657 --> 00:01:48.240
Over the next couple
days, we're going

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.448
to interview some of the
coolest people speaking here

00:01:50.448 --> 00:01:54.049
at the Ubiquity Dev Summit, and
you have an all-access pass.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:54.840
So let's get to it.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.010
OK, so here I am with
Gayathri Rajan, Vice President

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.570
of Product at Brillo and Weave.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.285
Hi, Gayathri.

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:08.451
GAYATHRI RAJAN: Hi, Timothy.

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:10.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: She just
got offstage for the keynote

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.990
here at the Ubiquity Dev Summit.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.890
Now for all the detail, people
can go to the keynote video.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.122
It'll be linked below.

00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:19.330
However, if you could just
give us a quick highlight,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.272
what was the main takeaway
from your talk this morning?

00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:23.980
GAYATHRI RAJAN: What
we've done at Google

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.740
is we've launched two platforms
for IOT, Brillo and Weave.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.229
And we've done this
because we believe

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.770
that it's really important to
get a few of the basics, right?

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.540
Because these could
hinder adoption.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.630
The two important
concerns we have

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.860
are interoperability
and security.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.830
So what we've done is
built the elements directly

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.320
into the platform so it's
really easy for device makers

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.736
and developers out there to
build secure interoperable

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:53.235
devices.

00:02:58.227 --> 00:03:00.560
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now I'm
standing here with Chandu Thota,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.160
Director of Engineering for
Geo and Local here at Google.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.067
Hi, Chandu.

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:06.150
CHANDU THOTA: Hi, Timothy.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So this morning
you talked about Beacons

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.640
during the keynote.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.848
If you could give us one
key takeaway from your talk,

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:11.760
what would it be?

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.010
CHANDU THOTA: I think the
fundamental thing is Beacons

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.150
are these wonderful,
one-way transmitters that

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.190
are built to provide context
to your mobile apps, right?

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.980
And we have released
one as a platform

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.790
on top of this
hardware to provide you

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.470
this open specification of
frame formats, mobile SDKs that

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.210
work on both iOS and Android.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.940
And also the
proximity Beacons are

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.100
released as a cloud service that
provides you with any storage

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.210
and serving requirements
of your metadata.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.030
So all of this neatly comes
together with a single package

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.000
that developers need to
use to provide context

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.900
to their mobile apps.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thank you, Chandu.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.300
Now remember for
the whole story,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.924
check out the links
in the description.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.400
So I'm standing here with
Bret McGowen, a Developer

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.140
Advocate on the
Google Cloud Platform,

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.230
in the middle of Cloud Spin.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.580
Bret, what is Cloud Spin?

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.700
BRET MCGOWEN: What
it is in a nutshell

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.160
is it reproduces special
effects you might see in movies

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.400
like "The Matrix,"
where someone jumps up

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.070
or they're frozen in air, and
it looks like the camera is

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.257
spinning around them.

00:04:09.257 --> 00:04:11.340
We thought this would be
a fun and interactive way

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.180
to teach people about the cloud.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.190
We used all off-the-shelf
components like Android,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.089
we used Firebase to
synchronize everything,

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.680
we used App Engine to scale.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.589
And we hope that it's
an interesting project

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.520
to rather than just tell
developers about what

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.440
the cloud can do, to actually
show them and hopefully inspire

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.940
them.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.840
And show them a little bit that
no matter what crazy idea you

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.351
might have-- such as reproducing
this wacky special effect-- you

00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:37.600
can do it with the power of
the Google Cloud Platform.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.599
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.190
Well, should we give it a spin?

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.290
BRET MCGOWEN: All
right, let's do it.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.081
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.620
And now we're over to
Wayne at the after party.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.328
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Hi,
I'm Wayne Piekarski,

00:04:53.328 --> 00:04:55.810
and I'm here at the demos area
of the Ubiquity Conference.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.380
And so today, I've got
Caitlin Johnson with me,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.840
who's a Brillo Product Manager.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.050
And today, we're
going to go check out

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.930
some of the really cool
demos that are here.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.710
So let's go take a look.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.168
MIKE LEE: So we
made a holiday tree

00:05:05.168 --> 00:05:10.332
that has a LED star where
you can change the image.

00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:11.790
These are individually
addressable,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.748
so you could have any
kind of pattern you want.

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:17.090
But right now, it's just on
some random lights and colors.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.850
ELLY NATTINGER: So
right now, this is all

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.979
running on the Brillo platform.

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.020
But what we haven't done
yet is gotten the chance

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.080
to look it up to Weave.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.200
So next step is get that
internet connectivity,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.480
get it that you push a button
on your phone and the lights

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.470
change color.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.845
VENKAT PATNALA:
In this demo, I'm

00:05:33.845 --> 00:05:35.780
going to show you how
the blinds have learned

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.800
to open when there's light.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.280
So we have an app for the demo,
and it's in automatic mode

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.200
right now.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.930
So I'll show you if
I turn on the light,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.919
the blinds open slowly,
adjusting to your preferences.

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:50.835
GREGORY PRISAMENT: Hi.

00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:54.640
So this is our prototype
of a smart water flow meter

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.620
that we made using
Brillo and Weave.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.902
We went from idea to a working
prototype in 30 days using

00:06:02.902 --> 00:06:03.610
Brillo and Weave.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.370
It has an Edison board
running the Brillo OS,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.710
talking to Weave in the cloud.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.960
And we created this frontend
that actually shows you

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.850
how much water you're using
in a very intuitive way,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.700
showing you each shower event
and how many gallons you

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.860
used during that event.

00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:27.550
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm
standing with Dan Shapiro,

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.120
the CEO of Glowforge.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.314
Welcome to the show, Dan.

00:06:30.314 --> 00:06:31.730
DAN SHAPIRO: Thanks
for having me.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You just
did an amazing fireside chat

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.874
with Julia Ferraioli,
you've got to check out

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:37.340
this video for all the details.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.210
But just real quick,
can you give us

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.100
a description-- for
the handful of people

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.558
in the audience
that don't yet know

00:06:42.558 --> 00:06:44.100
what Glowforge is-- what is it?

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.891
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah, it's
a 3D laser printer.

00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:47.450
Basically, it uses
laser technology

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.430
to cut and engrave materials
like leather, wood, even paper

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.481
or chocolate.

00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:54.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And one of the
cool things about Glowforge--

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.188
and what we've been talking
about at the conference--

00:06:57.188 --> 00:06:59.737
is the backend is the
Google Cloud Platform.

00:06:59.737 --> 00:07:01.320
Can you tell us a
little why you chose

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.825
to use a cloud platform as a
backend for a desktop product?

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:06.450
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah,
this is a technology

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.215
that's been around since
the '80s, CNC laser cutting

00:07:09.215 --> 00:07:09.914
and engraving.

00:07:09.914 --> 00:07:11.330
And the question
for us was how we

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.235
could bring the cost way down,
make it really easy to use,

00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:16.860
and build it in a timeframe that
was reasonable for a start-up.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.100
Instead of building a
really complex firmware that

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.280
could manage all the
commands locally,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.830
or doing a local
client application that

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.390
would run on a computer and
would require constant updates

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.010
and compatibility
across multiple OSes,

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.360
we wanted to push as much
as possible into the cloud.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.032
So you get at it
through a browser,

00:07:34.032 --> 00:07:35.740
everything happens in
the cloud, and then

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.780
it pushes down to the
machine only the very barest

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.770
essentials, the actual
pulse files that

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.125
are fed out to the motors.

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:44.375
That means we can develop
and innovate really quickly,

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:47.060
it works across lots
of different platforms,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.040
we can actually deliver a
great experience no matter

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.911
what sort of hardware
the user's using,

00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:54.160
and it's much less expensive
for us to make the device

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.140
because we don't have to
build huge computing resources

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.141
into the local hardware.

00:07:58.141 --> 00:07:59.640
TIMOTHY JORDAN: For
those of us that

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.100
might have missed
the Kickstarter,

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.230
when can I buy one?

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.354
DAN SHAPIRO: So you can
order right now-- pre-order

00:08:04.354 --> 00:08:06.041
right now-- at Glowforge.com.

00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:08.810
And we'll be shipping-- well,
folks who've already ordered

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.380
are getting their shipments
the first half of this year.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.700
For new orders, coming out
second half of this year.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.900
Thanks so much, Dan.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.030
DAN SHAPIRO: Thanks
for having me.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.363
TIMOTHY JORDAN: The Ubiquity
Dev Summit is winding down,

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:19.590
and so is this episode
of The Developer Show.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.295
As always, check out the
links below for everything

00:08:22.295 --> 00:08:24.010
that we've talked
about, including

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.321
the playlist to all the
sessions that happened here.

00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:28.320
And of course, if you
have any questions for us,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.690
use the hashtag #AskDevShow.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.060
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next time.
