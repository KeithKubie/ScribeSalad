RICHARD EBERHARDT: My
name's Rick Eberhardt.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.370
I'm the studio manager
for the MIT Game Lab.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.160
I've been with the
lab since 2007, 2006,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.020
so since we formed a
long, long time ago.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.020
Before I worked at the
lab, most of my background

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.440
has been doing
information technology

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.370
for academics, institutes,
so colleges and universities.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.860
I always had an
interest in games.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.590
I actually had a cultural
studies degree in college

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.310
for my undergrad.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.270
So coming to the lab, working
at the lab for that first year

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.943
as a system administrator
really opened

00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:44.420
my eyes to all the different
things games can do

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.540
and the different potentials
games have, but also made me

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.920
realize I can actually start
making these kinds of things

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.320
on my own too.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.850
So since I've started
working at the lab,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.720
I've taken on more
duties related

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.950
to project management,
things I'd already

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.380
done a lot in IT-- managing
people managing projects.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.941
I teach this Creating
Video Games course,

00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:12.440
and for the most
part in the course,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.100
I'm interested in teaching the
product management techniques,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.070
but also the soft skills
and the social skills.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.230
I'm an introvert.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.240
I have a really hard time having
conversations with people.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.760
And I've had to, in my
years in my profession,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.220
figure out ways to not
let that be a restriction,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.040
and actually use
that to my advantage

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.340
when I'm talking with teams.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.070
And I find it really successful,
actually, in game development.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.380
I don't know if it could
be successful elsewhere,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.300
but there's a lot of other
like-minded people like me

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.133
in game development.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.550
So it's good to
have, for me, to be

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.550
able to use those
skills in that setting.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.300
The other advantage I
have at the Game Lab

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.570
is I get to do research.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.820
I get to help with research
on various different types

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.570
of projects.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.780
So my personal
research interests

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.060
tend to be towards
closer to what

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.500
this class is talking about--
this meaningful decision

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.580
making.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.840
I've done some research
in using board games

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.450
to teach decision making,
in particular, like economic

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.890
concepts, like opportunity cost.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.280
I'm interested in social
experiences in games,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.840
and cooperative gameplay.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.120
Past games I've worked on
have been about all sorts

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.953
of different things.

00:02:28.953 --> 00:02:34.280
So anything from tools to
help game developers make

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.440
3D characters animate
faster-- basically

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.670
to speed up the
workflow process--

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.510
to games about
depression and games

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.625
about other serious topics.

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:45.250
I really like working
with researchers.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.458
I like working with clients,
and I like making games.

00:02:50.644 --> 00:02:51.560
What am I playing now?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.120
So I am playing this
game called Gridland,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.380
made by the same developer who
made a previous game called

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.420
A Dark Room.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.336
It's kind of
difficult to describe.

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:05.710
It's basically a
match-three game

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.040
where you're like Bejeweled,
you're matching gems.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.186
But there is a small
supply chain mechanic

00:03:12.186 --> 00:03:13.310
going on in the background.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.760
Where as I have
the gems combined,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.610
I can upgrade my weapons,
and I can upgrade my armor.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.610
And then when night comes--
so I'm matching gems

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.120
in the daytime to upgrade
things-- and when night comes,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.110
I'm matching gems to summon
enemies and to kill enemies.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.390
So this Gridland game has a
daytime and a nighttime view

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.899
of the game.

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:36.690
And what I find really
interesting about it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.054
is that all my decisions
I make in the day

00:03:39.054 --> 00:03:40.720
are going to have
some kind of influence

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.420
in my nighttime decisions.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.720
So as I make my daytime
experience easier,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.845
I'm actually making my
nighttime experience harder.

00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:49.230
So it's just a really
interesting little challenge

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.250
that the designers put
for me to try to solve.

00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:58.270
So outside of the class, the
kinds of games I'm making

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.850
are non-digital
prototypes, so card games,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.160
in particular, that
are experimenting

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.470
with things like a tech
tree and a 4X-style game.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.040
So if you've played a
game like Civilization,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.860
or StarCraft even, they'll have
these tech expansion trees.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.240
So I'm playing around with
designing a game that's

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.630
largely just the tech tree.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.140
I'm doing that with a
coworker here, Drew.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.350
I've also got a game
I've been working on,

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.450
off and on for the
past couple years,

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.720
about managing cities--
about three players trying

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.840
to manage a city.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.930
They're counsel people.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.924
I'm trying to convince the mayor
about what decisions the mayor

00:04:40.924 --> 00:04:43.340
should make for the city, but,
unfortunately, the mayor is

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.460
just the role of
a six-sided die.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.790
So you can try to
convince him or her

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.290
what you want, but
it really doesn't

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.544
matter because the mayor's
got its own agenda.

00:04:52.544 --> 00:04:54.960
So then you're trying to solve
the problems with the city,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.480
while also trying to solve
your own personal-- trying

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.550
to basically get political
gain while solving the city's

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.050
problems.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.960
There's a lot of different
co-op experiences out there--

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.030
from anything from over the
table like cooperative board

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.415
games to couch style
co-op in front of the TV.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.510
I'm trying to think my favorite
co-op experience is definitely

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.402
not Pandemic,
which I think we're

00:05:24.402 --> 00:05:25.610
talking about in class today.

00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:31.660
I have a hard time deciding what
my favorite co-op experience is

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.480
because so often, one of the
challenges of co-op games

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.810
is somebody takes
control, and somebody

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.590
says what the whole everybody
on the team is going to do.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.060
And unfortunately, I'm
one of those people.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.010
If I know the game, I'll start
being bossy and I'll take over.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.610
And what I'd love to
see more co-op games

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.080
do is put in mechanics to
prevent me from being a jerk.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.775
Or enable other people to
override my jerkiness somehow.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.390
So the thing I look forward to
most in this class every year

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.890
is the playtest
sessions, especially when

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.110
it's the first time the team has
brought the game into the class

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.900
and they're putting it in front
of new users, which we only

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.650
have a couple opportunities
for each project for that

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.480
to happen in class.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.539
After that everyone
in the classroom

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:19.913
has seen the game
before, so they

00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:21.725
are not giving the
same kind of feedback.

00:06:21.725 --> 00:06:24.100
And what I really like about
it is when the games come in

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.200
and they just don't work.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.190
They're broken horribly.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.990
Not when it's the
technical problems--

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.465
not when it's the code crashing
or it's the broken build.

00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:34.590
That's actually really sad,
and I hate to see that.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.324
But when it's a
design issue, when

00:06:36.324 --> 00:06:38.240
they thought it was going
to do this one thing

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.906
and see the game doing
this other thing,

00:06:39.906 --> 00:06:42.470
or they see the players
doing this other thing,

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.710
it's at that point that the
students understand that OK,

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.550
people do people things.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.840
Humans are human, right?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.530
You can't always
predict everything

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.719
that they're going to do.

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:54.510
But also that the
systems that they created

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.070
are actually incredibly complex.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.870
So the things that they need
to do to fix the systems

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.647
are going to be reducing
mechanics, removing things

00:07:01.647 --> 00:07:03.730
from the game, making it
a little bit more simple,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.563
so that they can predict
a little bit better

00:07:05.563 --> 00:07:06.689
about what's going on.

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.105
But then on the
flip side of that,

00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:09.521
though, there's
sometimes when you

00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:11.576
see something
happen in the game,

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:13.200
and you just get this
emergent gameplay

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.720
that is better than what
they were going for.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.330
They didn't realize
they wanted it.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.788
When they see it
in action, they're

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:20.660
like, oh, this is
actually really great.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.620
What can we do when
we're finishing this game

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.229
to really capitalize on
this mechanic or this system

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:28.020
that we just didn't
even realize was there?

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.840
I really like systems.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.150
Outside of the
class, I think this

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.660
might be the thing
that I actually,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.190
I always had in some capacity.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.300
But really coming to
MIT, working at MIT,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.430
it's much more
part of my life is

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.770
seeing the systems that surround
us and the systems of history.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.050
I've always had an
interest in history,

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.310
and a little bit of
interest in anthropology.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:01.510
But reading Charles Mann's
books about 1491 and 1493,

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.490
what happened during
the Colombian Exchange,

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.730
when all of these
different ideas

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.650
and products and
agricultural things

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.910
swapped places
from East to West,

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.616
from China to the
Americas to Europe.

00:08:16.616 --> 00:08:18.490
There's just some really
interesting systems.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.400
And a lot of the problems
we're facing today

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.220
are the direct result
of that big expansion

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.630
of ideas and trading of ideas.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.357
So I've always been interested
in those kind of things.

00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:33.440
And I'm watching The Wire.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.760
I really like The Wire.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.120
And just seeing the systems that
are involved in city planning,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:45.650
in police work, in education,
in all these civic institutions

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.080
that we just take for
granted every day.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.610
Yes, The Wire is a very
critical and a very pessimistic

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.420
view of it.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:56.780
But it is a great expression of
just how all of these problems

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.430
are connected.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.680
And some of the problems
that we are facing right now,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.960
it's just we can't
see the connections.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.622
And I hope that, at least with
games, with playing games,

00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:09.580
with making games, people
can better understand

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.910
how those systems work.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:19.390
For the future of games, games
as expressions of systems,

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:24.990
games as ways of exploring
the world around us.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.620
We've always--
1,000 of years ago,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.160
we used games as ways to
communicate with each other,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.600
to have rituals with each
other to better connect

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.379
with each other.

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:36.670
And I think we can do that
with just games in general--

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.128
not just video
games, but all sorts

00:09:38.128 --> 00:09:40.590
of different kinds of games.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:45.470
So seeing that come
back to both what people

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.267
are talking about when they
talk about games in mainstream.

00:09:48.267 --> 00:09:50.225
Other than just this
thing that's done for fun,

00:09:50.225 --> 00:09:51.724
it's actually this
thing that's very

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.470
important to human daily life.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.070
And we've been
doing it for years.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.480
It's just it looks
different now,

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.720
but it's still based on
a lot of the same things.
