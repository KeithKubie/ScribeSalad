00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.922
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:08.590
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: David
Bayles, American writer,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.020
is the author of
Art and Fear book

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.890
says, "creativity
opens access to worlds

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.140
that can be dangerous,
unapproachable, forbidden,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.920
attractive, or all at once."

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.450
We live in an amazing time full
of unlimited possibilities.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.910
The time for freedom
of self-expression.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.250
That time when
experiments are conducted

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.840
not only on content, but also
on the form of submitting

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.560
this content.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.950
Creativity has become
inaccessible for many of us,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.190
not just for the
limited groups of people

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.900
who give this
process a lifetime.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.280
Now it's the best
time to create,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.960
because technologies
have become affordable.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.250
Almost every person now
has a smartphone equipped

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.530
with a high quality camera.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.440
With the usual gadget, you
can create amazing images

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.269
and video material.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.990
Every day I see a huge number
of very artistic pictures

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.140
that people upload to Instagram.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.060
And I shoot it too.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.800
The photos they create are
a reflection of their life.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.720
For example, a
sailor is sketching

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.100
an ocean, and life on his ship.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.860
The astronaut from ISS shooting
the earth through the porthole.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.790
A young mother taking a
photo of her sleeping child,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.710
or beautiful macro photograph
filmed through the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.720
Spending 10 or 20
minutes per day,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.450
you can create beautiful images.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.340
And you don't need a
professional studio,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.910
because all the world around
you is enough for shooting.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.160
And you don't need a
special light equipment,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.810
because ordinary window--

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.060
it's quite enough, too.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.600
This is the creativity which was
always with us, in our pockets.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.380
Talking about most serious
photographic equipment

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.820
and professional image
quality, these things

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.070
also became more
affordable for us,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.125
with mirrorless
cameras and advances

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:19.130
in compacts in the form
of point and shoot.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.979
Talking about the
analog photography,

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.520
it's now experiencing
another heyday.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.900
Great photo laboratories
with the possibility

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.070
of digitizing the film.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.130
The process has [INAUDIBLE]
to be inaccessible.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.370
In the world, if we want
to shoot on a camera,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.050
now it's much more
easier than 10 years ago.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.590
Digital technology
develops every day.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.340
More and more people
learn and invent

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.050
a wide range of different
professional techniques.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.320
Knowledge has also
become more affordable.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.190
Thanks to content
platforms such as YouTube,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.710
you can get an answer
to almost any question.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.280
My 75-year-old
father also uses it

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.460
when he needs to fix
something in the house.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.190
Probably you already
know, YouTube now

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.520
is the second largest
search engine in the world.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.790
You can find the visual manual
for any technique or visual

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.970
practice you use, and
those how-to videos are

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.700
in your pockets today,
and in mine, too--

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.260
24 hours, seven days per
week, just all the time,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.780
inside our smartphones.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.330
There is a huge
amount of resources

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.600
with useful articles about
photography, community sites,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.720
blogs, where people can share
their accumulated experience,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.870
and it's cool.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.250
Unlimited communication spreads
information with great speed.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.440
There are a lot of different
specialized training platforms,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.910
websites, where you can catch
and watch interesting video

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.490
courses created in a very
usable format for a low price,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.380
sometimes in format of monthly
or annual subscription.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.160
I hope you use it.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.850
We can watch interviews of
our favorite photographers,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.120
and backstage of their
shootings in a nonstop mode.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.779
Such communication is led by
creative individuals, as well

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:23.250
as monsters like a Vogue
magazine, for example.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.870
On their official
YouTube channel,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.990
you can watch the back
stage for shootings,

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.330
then you can go directly
to the digital version

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.290
of the shooting asset, and
clearly track the whole flow,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.604
starting from the
preparation, choosing

00:04:36.604 --> 00:04:38.520
the most relevant
technique, and then checking

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.890
out the final edit.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.230
As this still doesn't
engage the engagement

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.530
in higher education, of course,
if you have such motivation.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.610
But it certainly helps to
begin to engage in creativity

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.080
and gain answers to
many questions that

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.870
arise inside your head.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.340
Borders matter less and less.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.590
Modern technology's evolution
gives us the opportunity

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.810
to be invisibly
present even in those

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.210
places where we don't exist yet,
or in places we need to visit.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.640
With the sun-tracking
mobile apps,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.900
such as Sun Follower
or Sun Position,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.440
you can easily examine and
predict the position of sun

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.390
at anytime, on any day,
in any shooting locations.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.520
You can monitor the weather,
predicting the rain or fog.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.280
In a blink of an eye, we can
get any information we need--

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.980
and this doesn't require
physical presence

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.440
at the time and the place.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.100
We can always turn to the joint
experience of other people

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.360
who have already visited this
area and shared their advice.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.770
Thanks to lovely Google
View, we can spend hours

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.620
exploring different
areas of the cities,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.310
marking the interesting houses
and making up a filming route

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.610
for the future projects.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.940
I surely feel this--

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.800
a freedom of movement.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.310
Traveling has been never
so reasonable and easy.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.740
With low cost airlines,
you can find yourself

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.650
in few hours in any
geographical areas

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.470
and new visual conditions.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.450
Unlimited audience.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.210
For a long time, people
who create images

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.010
could reach their audience
only through magazines

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.660
and newspapers, or through
galleries and museums.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.170
We know many cases when a
creative person became known

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.290
only after his or her death.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.280
For example, legendary
Vivian Mayer.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.890
An American street
photographer, this woman

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.780
took genius pictures--

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.850
more than 150,000 photographs.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.055
But they were discovered
and appreciated only

00:06:47.055 --> 00:06:49.530
after her death.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.600
I am sure that nowadays, with
all of these online platforms

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.240
and social networks,
Vivian Mayer

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.130
would have been recognized
in her lifetime.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.740
She'd be seen, shared, and
exhibited around the world.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.620
Now everything we
do can be viral--

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.830
and saying "viral," I
say it in a good way.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.930
Here is a story about
one of my works--

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.050
probably about the
most famous one.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.300
[INAUDIBLE] it's called,
[INAUDIBLE] and Pandora--

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.430
her dog adopted from the street.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.430
I have no idea how many times
it was transferred as a tattoo

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.600
to somebody's skin.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.150
But I know for sure that
this work is replicated

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.610
by different street
artists from Europe,

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.580
and they depict it on streets
and houses again and again.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.240
It happened during an
absolutely ordinary shooting.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.840
After the shooting,
[INAUDIBLE] the model,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.710
edited the photo with
color, and changed the color

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.500
of the artist's
[INAUDIBLE] in that eye,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.730
and uploaded it to
her Tumblr for a joke.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.610
The next day brought
hundreds of posts.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.980
Since this image is experiencing
a snowball effect, still now.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.080
It was posted by [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.760
It was published
hundreds of times

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.830
in different
communities and blogs.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.795
It also was published as the
cover of German newspaper Die

00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:15.320
Zeit.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.030
And I super happy, and grateful.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.180
You know, guys, during the
preparation for this talk,

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.190
I was planning to show this
picture in a very nice way.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.610
But then I decided to show
it as we see it often--

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.500
on the screens of
our gadget, framed

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.600
with our social profiles.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.270
It is the way how we now
look at the picture, mostly.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.350
So back into the photo with
Pandora and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.419
This image begins to
live its own life,

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.750
and its very similar how
its my child, my son David,

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.160
making his own
steps in this world,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.480
and I'm just watching him.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.860
I'm absolutely sure
that such a story would

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.100
be impossible without the
internet, and the opportunities

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.880
that it gives to us.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.830
Collaborative creativity.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.800
There is one excellent
documentary I have seen.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.290
It's called "PressPausePlay."

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.460
It explores the unlimited
opportunities and challenges

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.740
behind the technology of
collaborative creativity.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.530
The collaborative creativity
can be very different.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.920
For example, I can
shoot video footage

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.340
and transfer it through
Google Disk or through Proxy

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.670
to my video edit room,
living in another city

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.620
or in another country.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.220
We can meet online, and discuss
our tasks without meeting off

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.280
line, of course.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.080
And then I'm just
going to shoot again,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.870
and he is starting to
work on his material.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.250
In such a way, I working
also with retired artists.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.230
It's absolutely easy
to communicate also

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.450
with the curator of
your gallery, now,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.620
and together, in a visual
format, using a shared desktop,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.060
try to shuffle and move
the places for photos

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.630
to find the optimal arrangement
for your future exhibition.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.830
Our times allows us to engage
in very interesting forms

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.300
of visual creativity, which
I would call a collage.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.960
Here you can see a few
of my favorite authors.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.030
And the ways they reinterpret
the classical painter art

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.020
works, integrating them
into modern format,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.300
and help us to look at
them in a totally new way.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.850
It's [INAUDIBLE],,
it's [INAUDIBLE],,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.390
and also, it's Fat Cat Art.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.550
A nice profile.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.760
Maybe you know this.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.240
Someone will say
that it's sacrilege.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.460
But I think that
it's a second life,

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.680
and a new win for the classics.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.090
David Bayles' quote--
"with your creativity

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.210
you show what is important
to you as a person."

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.250
It's quite important
to brand yourself

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.830
as an artist and creator.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.100
There are many options for this,
but too often, creative people

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.750
have a fear inside themselves.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.650
Fear of telling who we are.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.530
Fear of telling what we do.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.040
Many others continue working,
but never showing their art

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.410
for years, creating
amazing things

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.440
but still waiting for some
special moment to show.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.090
The moment that
you are waiting for

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.240
is actually happening right now.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.500
It's important to
understand someone, maybe

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.200
on the other part
of Earth, maybe

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.700
in the next house in Dublin,
is waiting on your creations--

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.230
waiting.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.140
He wants to see it.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.820
He wants to interact emotionally
with your creativity.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.180
I think it's crucial to show
your work and get feedback.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.160
Of course, the core
audience wouldn't

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.360
be created immediately.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.190
Sometimes, you need months or
years to grow it from scratch.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.440
That's OK.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.910
But here's the main thing--

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.960
your potential viewers,
fans, followers,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.650
are always here, near us--

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.150
here.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.540
You just need to define
who are these people, which

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.230
social networks they use,
which platforms they visit,

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.770
and how to start communication
with them and your art.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.290
Let's look at another
story about me.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.180
For a long time,
I tried to combine

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.570
photography, video directing
and shooting, and teaching

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:28.970
photography.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.120
And on this question,
"what are you doing, man?"

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.800
My answer was very long.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.100
This gave a rather scattered
perception of me as the author,

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.670
because each listener understood
it somehow in his way.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.800
My team and I created
a clear statement

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.340
to put everything on its place.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.670
I create human visuals.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.455
In this situation,
I act as an artist,

00:12:55.455 --> 00:13:02.470
as a visual storyteller, using
various visual practice to tell

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.970
the stories about the people.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.780
Sometimes, it's not so important
to have special skills,

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.720
because you can work
on it, develop it--

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.770
it will certainly grow.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.740
But it's important to
understand something else.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.540
What is really important
and interesting

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.700
for you, as a person?

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.720
The stories about other people
are important and interesting

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.780
for me.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.280
My focus area is the creative
person, the creative process--

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.600
ability of people to create.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.800
The heroes of my
projects are important.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.790
They are artists, directors,
actors, and musicians--

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.840
but also representatives of
completely different cultures.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:51.650
Shifts, bartenders, craftsmen,
fisherman, farmers, and so on.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.670
At the same time, families
and human relations as topics

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.040
are also very important for me.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.530
Because I know that
it's also a great work,

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.270
and a great creativity.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.240
By defining the most
important area for me,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.660
I can work and create, then,
more narrowly serious--

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.870
serious projects in this area.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.380
This is what I'm always telling
my students-- ask yourself

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.540
the right questions, and
adjust your activities

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.940
to the area of your interests.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.050
Tools I use to tell
about my works.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.840
First, my personal website.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.300
There is my portfolio,
so people can quickly

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.670
understand who am
I, what I am doing,

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:36.120
and what type of projects
I want to do in the future.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.470
A visual blog-- to
save and post images.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.200
It's on Instagram.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.400
It enables people to
follow my activity,

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.620
to see different content,
access streams, and stories too.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.410
Sure, I'm using a profile
resource for creative people,

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.150
such as Behance.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.700
Their open access to
the creative community

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.250
allows me to interact
with other artists

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.700
and follow their
working projects too.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.180
And of course, I use Facebook
as a means of communication

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.830
with my potential students,
customers, and viewers.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.870
There is a wonderful book.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.760
It's called "Art and
Fear," by David Bayles.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.280
And I highly recommend
it to everyone

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.740
who still believes that
the moment for publishing

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.560
their work has not yet come.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.790
Do not be afraid of criticism.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.710
Really.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:34.800
It's capable of injury, but
it's not capable of killing us.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.110
The most important
thing is the movement

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.220
and constant reflection of
the experience that we get.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.340
We have to get more experience--
more and more experience.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.070
It's moving us.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.380
Any failure gives us
much more information

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.780
for further progress
than success.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.840
The main thing is
just to comprehend it.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:01.860
Umberto Eco, the famous
writer, says, "postmodernism

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.960
is the answer to modernism--

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.140
since the past
can't be destroyed,

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.590
for its destruction
leads to dumbness,

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:14.950
its need to be rethought,
ironically, without naivety."

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.370
Now, the classic,
in its pure form,

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.270
no longer causes such
emotions as before.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.460
Many photographers
are completely

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.910
immersed in experiments
with the form,

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.560
and trying to find
something different.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.980
Frankly, not all of
these experiments

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.170
are completely
understandable to me,

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.960
and I don't like them, at all.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.260
New time we're living--

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.780
asking for us the new questions.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.810
How?

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.310
What for?

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:47.950
And who are you?

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.260
Who's shooting?

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.210
Answering the question, "how?"

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:56.880
I decided myself was the best
way, for me, is neoclassicism--

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.870
as in music.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:03.430
I will now not relate most
of the classical settings,

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.040
in the terms of visual
language of photography,

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.020
but I will mix them.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.390
For example, using
some modern shooting

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:14.349
techniques as a
Fuji or Polaroid.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:18.069
More modern lighting--
[INAUDIBLE],, not classic.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.589
And the heroes of
my work, I will

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:25.900
choose as iconic
characters of our era.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.380
With all of this, I will
make my visual language

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.870
accessible to the widest
possible audience.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.550
So it creates
something like Ikea--

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.880
something like Ikea in the
field of photographic language.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.030
Something simple,
understandable, in terms

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.210
of form and accessible
for perception.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.060
Perhaps it will be
incomprehensible

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:54.670
to some critics and viewers who
want to see a complex image.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.930
But as I said earlier, my task
is to tell the whole stories.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.760
Its my main task.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.880
So I don't need to surprise
somebody with the form

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.890
every time.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.190
If you try to think about
the question "what for?"

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.440
I believe that art can
ask certain questions

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.370
to the viewer, giving him the
opportunity to think about it.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.710
And also, I believe
that problems

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.540
can be told not only
from the site of problem.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.900
I believe that the
declaration of values

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.750
is an alternative way of
visualizing the problems.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.590
I believe that photography--
and art, in general--

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.390
are able to influence
the minds of people.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.900
And when you impress them
with your creativity,

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:45.760
you slowly change their
attitude to those topics

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.580
that you have raised.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.960
These two topics, I
will talk about two

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.720
of my personal projects.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.830
One of them is devoted to the
topic of family and couples

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:02.570
who have lived together
more than 30 years.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:07.790
The other is devoted to
the topic of fatherhood.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.320
We will see it later.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.070
These two topics are now
extremely important to me

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.300
as a man.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.930
These pictures have a
certain social connotation.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.750
These are stories where
everyone can read what

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:25.020
he is ready for, for this time.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.810
And the second answer to
the question, "what for?"

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.660
is a study, also.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.830
I love to learn.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:37.430
By doing a project on a
theme, you automatically

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.300
immerse yourself
and study the theme.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.570
Photography, in this
case, can be in our method

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.590
of cognition [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.990
The third, and the last answer
of the question of "what for?"

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.040
is a declaration of
a value of a person.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.850
Portrait photography always
expresses the author's attitude

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.500
to people, you know?

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.360
And just in this case,
with the help of portrait,

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.980
you can tell that a
person in this world

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.745
takes very little
space, but means a lot.

00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:15.590
You can tell that
there is nothing

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.590
more attractive, complex,
and contradictory

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.410
in this world than a human.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.280
The answer to the question,
"who are you?" is simple enough.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.980
I understand that
I am an artist.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:35.190
But I like when my works
speaks about me more than me.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.960
So I teach only because the
intensive practice and a lot

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.420
of experience is
accumulated, and I

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.960
want to share it with others.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.360
I teach because the ability of
people to share experience--

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.940
I think it's the
most and main driving

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.090
force of our civilization.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.530
You are now what you have
absorbed and learned.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.730
And therefore, the author living
in post-modern era is equally

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.090
influenced by classics
of world culture,

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:10.280
and unknown or known
contemporary authors--

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.040
whom we can meet
in the internet.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.060
At some point, the author
with 3K subscribers

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.940
living in Bangladesh can
mean exactly the same to you

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.610
as Sir [INAUDIBLE],, Lindbergh,
[INAUDIBLE],, Newton, Ansel

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:27.960
Adams, and other classics.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.000
And it's normal.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.620
The main task as
the author living

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.540
in this time it's to be
choosy, but at the same time,

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.010
to be opened to different
kinds of experience--

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.020
not to close yourself.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.390
Our study of other people's
experience, and interaction

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:49.530
with someone's art, gives
us birth to inspiration

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.635
and fullness that we
need to create something.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:01.680
Inspiration is an oxygen
for creative people, as us.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.520
It's almost impossible to
create anything without it.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.060
I have been teaching
for nine years.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.600
I have met several
global misconceptions

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.610
that photographers have.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.920
Now, we will shortly
go through the list,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.150
and perhaps someone will
find out himself there.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.470
First misconception.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.850
It seems to me that many of us
are waiting for inspiration,

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.480
like rain or sun.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.760
Mostly rain-- I don't know.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:39.600
[LAUGHS] Relying on some
internal weather forecast.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.270
But I believe that the
ability to be inspired

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.030
is like muscles--

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.720
it needs to be rocked.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.950
That is, if you want
to be productive,

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.570
creative unit, then you
must take certain efforts

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.680
to ensure that inspiration
doesn't leave you in any time.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.550
A creative person should strive
to be constantly charged.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.200
If you do not
consume what others

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.840
have created then
create, then there

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.590
will be no inspiration
from nowhere.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.380
That second misconception
is "the more

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.740
I look at the works
of others, the more I

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.180
lose my individuality."

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.120
In my experience,
individuality and style

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.460
begins to form after
first two or three

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:28.030
years of intensive study in
one or another visual practice.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.090
In all other cases,
in my opinion,

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.660
the outlook and
erudition comes out.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.810
And the more a person studies
classics of his contemporaries,

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.600
the more he will learn
anew about the methods

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.810
that he can use-- or
he or she can use.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.120
I believe that
erudition and knowledge

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.190
are the keys to everything.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.560
They are analogs for
fundamental creative education,

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.050
which is not received by
every photographer, now.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:58.090
The more saturated
your cultural layer

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:02.935
is, the most unusual product
as a result, you can create.

00:24:02.935 --> 00:24:06.840
The third misconception--
and most importantly--

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.920
is a fallacy of
many photographers.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.870
To grow yourself
as a photographer,

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.270
it's necessary to
look at the photos,

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.910
and think about photos only.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.510
So here, we will talk about
some kind of deviation

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.250
from that tunnel vision--

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:27.010
from the focus of attention
precisely only on photo image.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:31.430
Photography, for me, lies
between painting and cinema.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.510
And sources of inspiration, in
fact, can be very different.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.890
In my opinion, we can learn a
lot from classical paintings.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.610
I have a strong belief that each
photographer must have at least

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:50.920
five favorite artists, at least
five favorite cinema directors,

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.500
and at least a five
favorite cameraman.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.610
Many good ideas are born when
looking and famous paintings.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.450
Any picture can become a
reference for a fashion

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:09.050
editorial for magazines, or
a separate project you do.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.890
The same with the movies--

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.500
I think that movie
and TV series is worth

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.790
watching, carefully studying,
not only as a storyline,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.730
but the visual component.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.200
It's very important to
train yourself to take still

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.910
pictures from the movies.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:28.500
And after all, every screenshot
you've taken is a photo.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.480
So the paintings can teach us
a lot about the composition

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:38.070
and color, and then the
cinema can teach us the color

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.460
and light arrangement, as well.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.430
But we do not dwell on these.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:48.630
I want to develop
my idea further.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.550
I want to develop
my idea further.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.850
It seems for me that we can
learn photography not only

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.200
through painting and cinema.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.850
Let's go.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.450
I can mention the theater
as a very powerful source

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.360
of inspiration, because there
is also an acting world,

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.070
and the emotions.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.340
And very serious work
with mise en scene,

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:12.400
like composition, was very often
found in photography, you know.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.960
I can also mention the ballet,
and contemporary choreography,

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.560
because there we can understand
how the human body is arranged,

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.170
and also how it
moves, and how to work

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:27.290
with it in terms of plasticity
when shooting a portrait.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:31.340
The artist has very,
very important tasks--

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.510
to be in constant resonance
with the world around him.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.680
To feel it.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.510
We now have two worlds
interpenetrating each other--

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.320
the online world, and
the offline world.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.010
The artist stays somewhere in
the middle, looking in and out.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:51.410
And there it seems
to me very important

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.040
to study any derivatives
of these two worlds

00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.280
to analyze them, to try to
understand by all means.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.607
I hear the thought that creative
people are often infantile.

00:27:04.607 --> 00:27:05.440
Have you heard that?

00:27:08.062 --> 00:27:12.370
But what we put in the
concept of infantilism?

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:16.450
It seems to me that we are
talking about freshness

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:20.710
of sensation, comparable to what
the children are experiencing

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.850
in their life.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.210
Many people tend to
limit their world

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:29.230
to comfortable and
understandable forms,

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:33.520
almost canceling their ability
to be surprised by something

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.120
new, and lowering the details
of everything else that

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.000
surrounds them.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.860
In opposite, the child
absorbs the world as a sponge,

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.830
paying attention to those
details that seem to us

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.370
insignificant and unimportant.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.930
If we consider
infantilism in this way,

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:57.230
then I think that artists should
be infantile to some extent,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.630
really.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.690
I admit my own
infantilism, because I'm

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.990
trying to learn everything
new that appears

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.630
in offline and online worlds.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.100
Only studying all
this, I can hope

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.240
that I will have not lost
the sense of context,

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.480
and I maintain a dialogue
with different social types

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.290
of characters I shoot,
with different age groups,

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.135
and differing backgrounds
of my heroes--

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.280
from the scientists to rappers.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.400
Therefore, no matter how
strange it may sound--

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.990
sorry-- but Leonardo da Vinci
and the battle rap culture

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.840
is equally important for the
modern photographer working

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.610
with people.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.270
The modern world
changed the attitude

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.260
to the exhibition place, too.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.860
Now in addition to traditional
galleries and good museums,

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.430
in fact, we can enter an
exhibition space every time

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.530
we park pick up our phone.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:59.460
I'm talking about three main
sources of visual inspiration.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.570
Let's talk.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:04.110
The first is the Google
Arts and Culture Service,

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.900
which allows us to visit
a large number of museums

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.600
in a visual format
without leaving our homes.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.380
The second is Pinterest.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.980
It's a social network of
sharing your good taste.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.350
For artists, this
is a powerful tool.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:24.520
So if you're engaged in some
kind of visual practice,

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.610
it's active introduction
of Pinterest--

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:28.710
it's simple necessary to you.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.960
The third is Instagram.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.080
Instagram is considered to
be a great evil, you know--

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.159
and a great good,
at the same time.

00:29:37.159 --> 00:29:38.825
I can say that, over
the past two years,

00:29:38.825 --> 00:29:42.720
the Instagram community has
evolved very much, as I see it.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.200
People are no longer interested
in watching endless travel

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.310
photos with views of
Iceland, Kamchatka,

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.640
Yosemite Park, or Antarctica.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.220
But it's still interesting
to watch some travelers.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.420
In the end, in Q&amp;A,
I can say about some

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.510
of my buddies who are
still traveling and doing

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.030
great pictures.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.620
And in special format.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.990
I can say with confidence
that Instagram now

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.440
has a lot of accounts
devoted to art.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.520
This is a format of small
online galleries with curators,

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.780
and good taste is present.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.100
Therefore, from time to
time, do a rebuilding

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.260
of your friend's feed.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.660
It's a cruel thing,
but we have to do it.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.960
And scrap out all irrelevant
content, leaving only

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.660
what really inspires you.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.120
A few Instagram profiles which
I constantly look through--

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.980
it's a summer magazine.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.760
It's a nowness.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.360
It's a [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.620
And ignorant.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.810
But there are many
related profiles,

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:52.350
so you can just press
a button-- related--

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:56.020
and found something
else, like that.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.100
Another very important
thing for any artist

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.910
is constant self-actualisation.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:05.300
It's important,
not only legibility

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.010
in terms of what we
consume, but also constant

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:12.510
reflection and awareness on
your own visual priorities.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.120
In other words, if
you are photographing,

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.710
you should strive to understand
exactly how the picture you

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:23.590
want to make is to look like.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.850
What does the photo of
your dream look like?

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.730
Pinterest seems to me a
very convenient platform

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.980
for self-actualisation,
because there, you

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.590
can select references
to absolutely any topics

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.660
and projects, and
easily share them

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.030
with the members of your
crew, to get into work.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.980
In addition, I want to say,
again, about online education.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.960
There are some
educational portals,

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.160
which are very nice, high
quality video courses.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.550
I talk now about
Masterclass.com, Linda.com,

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.760
Skillshare, or
Russian [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.040
It happens in such
convenient format,

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.500
that you can learn
with your gadget.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.630
In a moment, you're going
to the urban transport

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.020
to work, or retire with
an interesting lesson

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.270
during a lunch break.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.070
On Masterclass.com,
for example, you

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.020
can find a course
from Annie Leibovitz.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.970
I hope you know her.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.040
I consider Annie to
be the embodiment

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.960
of colossal efficiency,
and was super

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.330
happy to have the opportunity
to observe her works,

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.860
and not only her output,
but all the process.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:30.240
And she going through-- she
is a life classic, you know.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.460
If earlier, you needed
to go somewhere,

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.300
and to stay physically
for a while,

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:40.020
for education, now
all education content

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.890
is just backed up to the
size of tablet or phone.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.350
It's very easy.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:50.460
You know, when I started
photography 14 years ago,

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.160
I dealt with dial-up
squeaking modem.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.420
I hope you remember this.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.540
And three-in-five
format floppy disks.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.300
We were bringing the
photos on the floppy disks

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.440
from internet cafes to house,
to watch it, to examine it,

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.990
to try to understand
how it's done.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:11.000
Now, we are getting
all for a moment.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.180
We were choking on the
lack of information.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.720
But now, we are choking
on it's overflow.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.540
Therefore, it is so important
to clearly understand

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.290
the real possibilities that
our time gives us, and isolate

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.810
the useful data sets
from the white noise.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:32.750
Finally, I want to
say one more thing.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.240
It's not necessary to surprise
the viewer with the form

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.410
every time.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.580
We don't need it.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.570
Very often, in the desire
to surprise everyone,

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.010
we depart from the essence--

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.860
and from the main task
that every photographer

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.360
has decided to himself.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.760
In my case, it's a story I told.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.960
A testimony about
somebody's life.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.170
Sometimes we go into false art.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.750
We want to be
unlike anybody else.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.720
We want to get respect
from the community.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.200
But in my opinion, this
is a slippery path.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.920
This is how exactly the
moment when "who" begins

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.280
to dominate over the "what for."

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.400
The photo is taken in
order to transmit something

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.000
to the people.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.929
And please, don't try to
complicate it too much.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:21.760
First of all,
proceed from the fact

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.489
that we need to
send some message.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.980
It should be understood,
also, that art as a form

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.260
is necessary for
the viewer, too.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.360
With the help of
art photography,

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.630
we give people the opportunity
to travel, here and now,

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.050
within their own imagination.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.750
Therefore, if you
have some tools

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:48.260
that you can use to make
a less ordinary photo,

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.290
in order to rethink
the reality, in order

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:55.620
to build new certain
reality, it must be done.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.160
But don't forget that
it's only a form--

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.860
there is also the
content, somewhere.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.970
Photography can fix something
ordinary and everyday,

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:10.260
or it can become something
sublime, something special.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.010
It's all about our
interest as a person.

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:17.010
In conclusion, I can say
that many artists seek

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:20.130
to disassociate themselves
from the mainstream and mass

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.240
culture.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.180
They are looking for
solitude, for galleries,

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.270
for dark, dark,
dark underground.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.690
I do not understand that,
because they automatically

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.390
refuse a large audience.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.670
For me, photography is
an opportunity to speak.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.990
It's a language.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.460
And I believe that,
to be in mainstream,

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.470
to be a part of mass
culture, does not

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.410
mean for me that I'm making
a deal with my conscience.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.660
What is good about
the mainstream?

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.830
First of all, it's
very flexible.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.920
You can create anything.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.190
Second, it likes
hard working authors.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:00.100
You can easily create
your own style,

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:06.470
and fill your works with themes
that seem important to you.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.280
Now it's five exercises to
develop your creativity.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:16.280
First, make notes of
your own thoughts.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.110
Second, give yourself 15
minutes of visual inspiration,

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.990
and do it every day.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:31.100
Third, develop a creative plan
to have one shooting per week,

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.310
to realize some
process of creation,

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:37.130
to learn something new.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:40.700
Number four, create
a group or chat

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.890
for those who will
criticize your work.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:46.455
Five, six people is
quite enough, this.

00:36:46.455 --> 00:36:49.440
It can be a part
of your community.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.610
It's very useful.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:55.530
And number five, try to
write a short mini-script

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.650
about what you see every
day, feel every day,

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.300
recognize every day.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.540
It will help to develop
your storytelling skill,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.270
and focus more on the
characters of your photos,

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.590
or your videos, or your stories.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:10.300
Doesn't matter.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.160
OK.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.290
Let's each of us have the
courage and inner strength

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.980
to choose their own
theme, and to work hard

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:24.500
on it until the surrounding
space begins to sag under us

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.690
and reflect our creativity.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.030
That's all from me, for today.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.582
Thank you, guys.

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:34.528
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:38.075 --> 00:37:39.700
SPEAKER: I wanted to
ask you as a fan--

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.530
so what did you tell to David--

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:44.720
there was a picture when he was
smoking a cigarette-- fantastic

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.220
picture.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.620
What exactly were
your words, you know,

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.544
right before this moment when
he was having the cigarette?

00:37:50.544 --> 00:37:52.460
What-- how do you work
with these celebrities?

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.826
Because you're a fan,
as well, I assume?

00:37:54.826 --> 00:37:56.200
SERGEI SARAKHANOV:
I was shooting

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.960
David Lynch in Kiev, when he
came with this foundation,

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.210
the David Lynch Foundation.

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:06.880
You know, this
foundation is working

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.940
on transcendental meditation.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.900
Last 20 years, David Lynch
working on not only cinema,

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.804
on meditation--

00:38:15.804 --> 00:38:16.720
and writing the books.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.500
Maybe somebody has read it.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.660
So David came with a visit
of his foundation openings--

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.140
opening the part
of it in Ukraine.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:33.100
And I got a booking for me to
make some portraits of him.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.190
For first time, it
sounds very good.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.810
I must have one
shooting for 15 minutes,

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.494
and the second shooting
for half an hour.

00:38:43.494 --> 00:38:45.160
And that just became
a little bit crazy,

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.400
because such a
legend, for me, is--

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.580
for such time.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:54.940
But as a result, I had two
shootings for four minutes,

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.680
every [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.030
It was a little bit crazy.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.110
For the first day, I
became really crazy.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.250
And after the shooting,
I just laid to the floor

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:08.030
and tried to breathe, because
I just became very nervous.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.690
But I get ready
for the shooting.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.090
It was in this cinema theater.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:15.550
I brought there,
with my assistants,

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:20.180
a small studio with a blue
background, and lighting,

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.060
and so on.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.900
And when I see him, I understood
that he's very tired, now.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.340
Because many people--
around 25 or 30 people

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.530
were running around him.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.500
The agents, the PR
directors, there

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.500
are some guys from
the foundation.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.230
And he had elections,
he had many meetings.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.890
So I just looked at him,
and he looked at me,

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:45.340
and I understood that this is
a legend, but for this moment,

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.810
it's a very tired legend.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:51.850
And I don't want to make
some violate shooting on him.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.770
So I know that he
loves to smoke.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:40:00.130
And I said, David, just
sit and smoke for a bit.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.650
Don't think about me, now.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.150
I will just shoot
you from the side.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:06.790
So I put the lighting.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.501
And I gave two minutes,
maybe, of my four minutes.

00:40:10.501 --> 00:40:11.000
You see?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.880
Half.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.630
I just gave it for this moment.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:17.720
Because I wanted him
to be more comfortable.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.550
And then I asked him to
come to the blue background.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:24.580
And he said, OK,
only for two shots.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.720
And I said, David, it
will be not for two--

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.400
it will be maybe 15
or 20 shots, but I

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.060
swear it will be
very quick, and I

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.020
won't be saying to do anything.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.350
You just can stay
and stare at me,

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.180
and also, you can
continue smoking.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.370
And this way, I feel some
sympathy going from him.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:52.660
Because he understood that I
rely on him, and I see a man.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.280
A man-- a human.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.430
Not the functional man from
cinema, not the celebrity--

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.350
just a human.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:02.380
And it was kind of humanity.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.740
So the second shooting
was quite [INAUDIBLE],,

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.430
because I had to do many shots.

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:11.530
As in the first day,
his PR guys just

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.560
cropped all of my shooting
for several minutes.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.010
So I get a big set-up
from several points,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.040
shooting and testing my
light on their systems.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.430
So I build some
kind of corridor.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.820
And when David came, I
told him about my idea

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.800
about shooting a poster
for the documentary

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.020
about him coming to Ukraine.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.910
And I showed him
the locations, and I

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:36.130
told him something
about ideas, because I

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.160
know that he is a
director, and he

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.500
likes when people
understand what I do now.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.300
And also, he knew me.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.770
He remembered me from
yesterday's shooting.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.300
So it was quite comfortable.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.800
And in the end, I
asked him to sit here--

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.600
it's too contrast,
here, on this screen.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.590
But you can find this image on
Instagram and on the internet.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.720
So for the last moment, I asked
him to think about something.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.342
He's thinking now to
look in the window.

00:42:06.342 --> 00:42:07.800
And then, in the
last shot, I asked

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.010
him to look in the camera.

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:12.160
And here is, now,
not a tired old man--

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.430
now, I think, that in this
photo, he's just quite legend.

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:16.060
As he is.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.290
Because for me--

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:21.844
I told you about interest,
about your thinking

00:42:21.844 --> 00:42:23.760
about the people who
you're shooting-- for me,

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.580
it's a legend.

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:28.415
For me, it's a giant part
of world cinema culture,

00:42:28.415 --> 00:42:29.620
Twin Peaks.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.390
For me, this person--
he was a friend

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:33.950
of Andy Warhol, and many
other legendary people.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:36.160
So I feel this
person is legendary.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.670
And I wanted, also,
to make this portrait

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:43.020
legendary-- with legendary, a
deep lighting, with big volume.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.020
SPEAKER: It's fantastic.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:44.520
Fantastic.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.290
SERGEI SARAKHANOV:
So, It's true story.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:48.750
SPEAKER: So you were doing a
workshop, if I'm not mistaken,

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:49.720
yesterday, here in Ireland.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:49.980
Right?

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:50.240
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: Yeah.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:50.390
Yeah.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:51.330
Here in Dublin.

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:53.621
SPEAKER: How do you like it,
working with Irish people?

00:42:53.621 --> 00:42:55.590
How do you feel,
yourself, here, in Dublin?

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.250
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: Oh--
it's quite a good question.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:02.640
I'm a big fan of Irish culture,
because I have listened

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.850
to Irish music for many years.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.320
I love Damien Rice.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.340
I love Glen Hansard.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.550
I like U2.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:18.030
I have shot [INAUDIBLE],, as
a great musician, Irish born.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:22.260
So-- and I watched
Dublin in movies, also.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.030
I have seen several movies--

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:25.680
maybe somebody has seen it--

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.390
"Greenwhich Mean Time."

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:32.130
It's a great movie about
Belfast, about Great Britain.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.230
And also some movies
about Dublin, too.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:39.030
So it was nice meeting,
like with some old friend,

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.600
when I came here.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.620
And also, I'm a
Norse-born person,

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:47.730
so for me, it's also kind
of a Northern country

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:49.020
with strong people.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:53.110
A little bit, maybe, sometimes
bully, and something like that,

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.276
but with very kind hearts.

00:43:55.276 --> 00:43:56.308
That's me, too.

00:43:56.308 --> 00:43:58.940
[LAUGHS]

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:02.330
SPEAKER: And now, we will take
questions from the audience.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.690
Do you guys have any questions?

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.773
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: Guys,
let's speak, if you want.

00:44:05.773 --> 00:44:07.635
I will be glad to
answer the questions.

00:44:07.635 --> 00:44:09.010
AUDIENCE: I just
have a question.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.400
So, with David Lynch,
you directed him.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.514
But I guess he's kind of used to
having the camera faced at him.

00:44:15.514 --> 00:44:17.310
How do you do with,
like, regular people

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:19.250
that you have on your projects.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.276
Where is the limit?

00:44:20.276 --> 00:44:23.630
So how do you direct them,
and where do you stop?

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.380
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: I'm
working with people

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.120
from creative sphere.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:31.560
And when I see a strong author,
or person with some kind--

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.880
you know-- some
tyrannic character,

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.970
which some of famous
people are in such way.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.340
First of all, I'm
doing with respect.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.790
With great respect.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:47.130
But I'm standing myself equal.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.480
I don't go down.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.800
I don't try to dominate.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.620
I am doing with respect,
because I think that respect is

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.170
a base of good relationships.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.540
And then, I'm also doing with
respect, if a person says,

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.310
"sorry, but I don't want you
shoot me from the right side.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.140
My left side is better."

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.700
I'm trusting people.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.290
Sometimes, I can do experiment,
and shoot from another side,

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:08.790
too.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.840
But I want person who
I'm shooting to see

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:17.310
and understands that I am
doing it with patience,

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.680
and I am listening
to him or her.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.545
I am watching him or her.

00:45:22.545 --> 00:45:27.480
Because it's human photography,
and the main value, for me,

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.880
is the comfort of the
person, and feeling good

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.951
on the shooting.

00:45:30.951 --> 00:45:32.604
AUDIENCE: My
question is, can you

00:45:32.604 --> 00:45:34.210
talk a bit about your process?

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.447
Not maybe when you
worked for a commercial--

00:45:36.447 --> 00:45:38.530
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: That's
also a creative process.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:38.740
Yeah.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:39.240
OK.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.930
AUDIENCE: --because from, like,
dealing with different artists

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:46.120
[INAUDIBLE] and creative people,
I've found that people tend

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.070
to have--

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:47.900
maybe there's more.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:51.230
But I meant two-- one,
is very structured.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.980
You have a beginning,
and you have a plan,

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.760
and [INAUDIBLE]
project management.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.490
And the other one is
very, like, flow-y,

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:00.720
where you're guided by your
intuition, and you begin,

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.170
but you don't know
where it's going to end.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.760
[INAUDIBLE] know
what's going to happen.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.885
Which one is this?

00:46:06.885 --> 00:46:08.760
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: It's
a very good question.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.990
Thank you.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:15.840
First of all, I'm trying to find
the balance between these two

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.220
polar meanings.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.000
And on the first
shooting, because I

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.670
love to work with people
constantly, for years--

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.650
we're building
friends, relationships.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.075
And sometimes we can--

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:33.540
don't make some
big shooting, just

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.180
make as a friendly
shooting, in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.390
But the first shooting is also--

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:41.850
it's always planned
good, with references,

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.110
with great location scouting.

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.140
With examining the
lighting conditions,

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.790
with the app I show--

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.330
it's really very nice app you
should try, if you're shooting.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.300
It's good for landscape
photographers, portrait

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:57.000
photographers, and also
street photographers, too.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.330
So first of all,
we are planning.

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:03.210
I am doing big research, and
a big pre-production process.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:06.900
Because on the shooting, I
want only to shoot and speak.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.220
We speaking many, many
times-- more than shooting.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.460
The shooting coming for
two, three, or four hours.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.630
But seriously, we shoot,
I think, 20 or 25 minutes

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:19.680
from this time.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.260
All of this time
left, we are speaking.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.120
And I speaking a lot of--

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.070
I'm trying to
examine the person,

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:28.620
and trying to
interview the person.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.400
And also, the main task for me--
not only to know the person,

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.080
but to let the person know me.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.930
Because it's also
very important.

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.030
And on the next
shootings, we can do it

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:44.150
as you tell-- going with flow,
going with creative process.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:47.190
Many of my friends are
choreographers, dancers,

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:51.270
painters, and such
other guys from art.

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:52.980
So sometimes, we're doing just--

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.850
we don't know what we're doing.

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.850
But we-- in this
moment, we are friends.

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:58.620
And also, we have
shooting with them when

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.980
they need something special.

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.670
I have to say that I'm
doing, I think, 55%

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:08.450
of my shooting as art.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:13.440
I don't do it all for the money,
because I want it to be an art.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.670
And I want to take
this process--

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:19.610
because it's all moving me.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:21.260
It's letting me to grow up.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.260
It lets me to know something
new, and interesting.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.840
And also, I can
speak with the person

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.050
and communicate with the person
more time before shooting.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.880
I can speak one time,
but if we have time,

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:37.310
we can just going, speaking,
shooting little bit of 35

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:40.940
millimeter film camera, and
only after two or three weeks,

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:44.210
start to make serious shootings.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:46.155
So, in this way.

00:48:46.155 --> 00:48:46.890
OK?

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.858
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
in the beginning,

00:48:48.858 --> 00:48:50.830
you comment that
you would prefer

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:53.970
five tops-- like, five top
photographers, artists,

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.922
painters, movie directors,
cameraman-- like that.

00:48:56.922 --> 00:48:58.797
What are your top fives?

00:48:58.797 --> 00:48:59.630
Who is on your list?

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:02.480
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: I will
try to tell about it.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:07.150
I love-- I really appreciate
the work of painters, first.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.090
Yeah?

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.460
It's one of Russian painters--

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.480
Mikhail Vrubel.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.270
Maybe somebody know him.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:18.090
Also I loved the [INAUDIBLE],,
the brighter star, for me,

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.540
is John Collier.

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.440
It's fantastic.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.570
Sometimes, I put his
works on my desktop.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:26.270
I want to see it more
and more and more.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:29.740
Also, I like the works
of Franz Winterhalter.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:35.060
He is making a realistic,
great artistic portraits.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.640
They look like photos.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.080
Also, I like Rembrandt.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.890
Also, I like some classics,
like Leonardo da Vinci,

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:43.550
Michelangelo.

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:46.710
But I want to mention,
also, El Greco.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:49.940
He's making a little
bit sick paintings,

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.730
but they're also
very attractive.

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:55.700
About the cinema
directors, I would want

00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:00.080
to mention Martin McDonagh.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.450
I love him very much.

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:04.040
Christopher Nolan.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.770
Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu.

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.780
Gus van Sant.

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:12.530
And Alfonso Cuarron,
also-- one of my favorites.

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:16.970
About cameramen, maybe I will
not just now remember all five.

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:21.000
But I am really impressed
by works of Chivo--

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.506
Emmanuel Lubezki.

00:50:22.506 --> 00:50:24.380
And we're speaking a
little bit on Instagram.

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.730
It's also about
great possibilities

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.500
of communication--
that I can, sometimes,

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.880
communicate with I think
the most amazing cameraman

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.950
in the world.

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:35.300
He has sometimes
left in the comments.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.230
And I am just filled--

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.600
[LAUGHS] What's going on?

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.340
And also, I love Wally Pfister.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.460
And many other guys.

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.820
Rodrigo Prieto.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.720
I love, you know-- this
South American school,

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.040
with a very live camera.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.560
And also, when I was
working as a cameraman

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.470
on the other projects, I
also like to do live camera.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:03.280
Because it's giving out a
great presence as viewers.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.305
So-- that's the answer.

00:51:05.305 --> 00:51:07.180
SPEAKER: And one more
question, because we're

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.824
running out of time.

00:51:09.824 --> 00:51:10.700
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.316
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: Hey.

00:51:12.316 --> 00:51:15.035
AUDIENCE: So, if you
had to choose one lens

00:51:15.035 --> 00:51:16.826
and one camera that's
the most fun for you,

00:51:16.826 --> 00:51:17.742
what would you choose?

00:51:17.742 --> 00:51:19.710
And the reason I'm
asking is because it's

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:21.130
become, like you said, easier
to take pictures today.

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:22.510
And sometimes I leave
my camera at home.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.850
And the camera that's given
me the most joy, by far,

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:26.990
in many years, is
the Fuji Instant.

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.949
Because you only have--

00:51:27.949 --> 00:51:28.948
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: Nice.

00:51:28.948 --> 00:51:29.560
Nice, nice.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.732
AUDIENCE: Because you only
have one try, and it's--

00:51:31.732 --> 00:51:32.232
[GROANS]

00:51:32.232 --> 00:51:36.430
SERGEI SARAKHANOV: You know, I
wanted to say about Hasselblad.

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:39.070
But you know, I will
say about the phone--

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:44.890
it's a good end of our lecture,
because the phone gives us

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:46.150
great possibilities.

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:50.480
And I can shoot nice portraits,
nice landscapes, nice streets.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.510
And I don't need
to take anything.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.750
Sometimes I'm going to trip,
I'm taking only a film camera

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:58.210
for some serious
shootings for my projects,

00:51:58.210 --> 00:51:59.950
and only an iPhone--

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.510
or some kind of
Google phone, also.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:03.220
Pixel, Pixel 2.

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.410
So-- guys, thank you a lot.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.520
It's a very big honor
for me to be here, today.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:13.190
I want to say, great things
to my friends who helped me

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:14.950
to [INAUDIBLE] this text.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:16.520
So I have you--

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:20.515
I want to wish you great
and good luck, and more,

00:52:20.515 --> 00:52:22.110
more photos.

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:23.250
Thank you.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:26.300
[APPLAUSE]
