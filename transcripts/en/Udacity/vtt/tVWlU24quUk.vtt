[D. Evans] Now it's time for a quiz.

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to make sure that everyone understands what a programming language is.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.078
The possible answers:

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:09.078
a language designed to be executed by computers;

00:00:09.078 --> 00:00:12.000
a language designed for describing programs;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.064
a language designed to be written by humans and executed by computers;

00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:20.072
a language designed to be read by humans and written by computers;

00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:26.000
or a language designed to be read and written by humans and executed by computers.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is kind of a tricky question.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
More than one of these is definitely correct.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Try to answer with the best possible answer, though.
