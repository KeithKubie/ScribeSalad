00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.970
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry for
the delays, everyone.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.860
Assif, the very good
boyfriend that he was,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.960
was not willing to leave
his girlfriend stranded

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.820
on Google campus.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.520
AASIF MANDVI:
Apparently, you guys

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.450
have figured out
everything except parking.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.210
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.730
AASIF MANDVI: Which I think
is the next great Google

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.780
enterprise, how to get
parking on this campus.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.200
How are you guys?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.450
Everybody good?

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.950
Great.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.550
Well, thank you for coming out.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.190
MALE SPEAKER: Definitely.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.180
AASIF MANDVI:
Thank you for this.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.520
And my book's on sale over
there, for some reason,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.390
incredibly cheap.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.250
I don't know why.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.351
Much cheaper than it is in
real life, so get it now.

00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:38.850
MALE SPEAKER:
Subsidized for Google.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.205
AASIF MANDVI: Yes, exactly.

00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:42.830
MALE SPEAKER: So here we are in
conversation with Assif Mandvi.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.652
I take it, many of you are
familiar with his work.

00:00:45.652 --> 00:00:48.110
We're going to talk a little
bit about your book, "No Man's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.670
Land" today.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.920
AASIF MANDVI: "No Land's Man."

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.360
MALE SPEAKER: "No Land's Man."

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.984
AASIF MANDVI: Starting
off really well.

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.810
Thank you very much, with
the wrong name of the book.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.240
MALE SPEAKER: These notes are
not even worth their weight.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.656
AASIF MANDVI: No,
"No Land's Man."

00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:01.110
It's a play on no man's land.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.890
It's called, "No Land's Man."

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.580
So you flip it, and that's
how I came up with this title.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.940
And now everyone gets it wrong.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.700
MALE SPEAKER: And now, none
of you will ever forget.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.170
AASIF MANDVI: "No Land's Man."

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.730
MALE SPEAKER: Land's man.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.510
AASIF MANDVI: Yes.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.550
MALE SPEAKER: And well, what
did you mean by that title?

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.700
AASIF MANDVI: I meant
that I've grown up

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.960
in many different places.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.210
I was born in India,
grew up in the UK,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.210
and then spent my high
school and college years

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.320
in Florida and then New York.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.100
And so for me, it encapsulated
that immigrant journey,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.040
that immigrant experience of
living in different places,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.150
having to be a constant.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.140
I think a lot of what
I've done is involve shape

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.640
shifting and adapting
to environments,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.360
different environments.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.430
It's probably why I became
an actor, on some level.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.680
But that's what
the title is about.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.430
MALE SPEAKER: Mhm.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.240
AASIF MANDVI: Should
I be looking at you,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.810
or should I be
looking at the camera?

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.060
Because this is going live
streaming right now, right?

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.840
MALE SPEAKER: This is
going live streaming.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.810
AASIF MANDVI: I can do either?

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.640
I can go back and forth?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.775
MALE SPEAKER: You want to
deliver something, just

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:07.420
deadpan.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.740
AASIF MANDVI: Great.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.729
I can just do that.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.240
OK, so it's like
"The Daily Show."

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.190
I'm talking to you, but then I'm
talking to the people at home.

00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:17.240
MALE SPEAKER: We
break the third wall.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.864
I appreciate that.

00:02:18.864 --> 00:02:20.950
No, it's an interesting title.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.870
What were you
hoping to accomplish

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.154
by writing this book?

00:02:24.154 --> 00:02:25.820
AASIF MANDVI: I was
hoping to accomplish

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.540
getting a really large amount
of money to write the book.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.230
No, I wrote it because
Chronicle Books

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.590
approached me to write a book.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.965
And they said, would you be
interested in writing a book?

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:46.910
And I had already been
writing monologues, essays,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.440
short pieces.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.000
And everything I write pretty
much has to do with my life,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.690
because I'm incredibly
interesting.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.180
And so I just decided, oh,
this would be a great venue.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.920
I haven't actually ever
written a book before.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.070
I've written plays,
I've written movies.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.980
But to write a book
felt like a challenge

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.950
that I hadn't taken on.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.740
And it was an incredibly
fulfilling, hard, lonely

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.520
experience.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.680
But I'm very proud of it.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.050
And I feel like I got
to tell a lot of stories

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.080
about things that happened not
just about me, but on a larger,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.800
cultural context,
hopefully saying something

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.260
about the immigrant experience.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.550
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.990
No, it's interesting
that you got

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.950
asked to write the book in that
I think most authors don't have

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.482
that liberty of
just saying, hey,

00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:40.940
I'm sure you have
something to say.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.160
AASIF MANDVI: Right.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.370
Well, I think it had
to do with the fact

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.290
that I was in a little show
called, "The Daily Show."

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.330
MALE SPEAKER: Probably helped.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.060
AASIF MANDVI: And
I think they were

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.470
like-- everybody on "The
Daily Show" writes a book,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.420
and so you should
also write a book.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.760
No, clearly there
was a public platform

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.520
there that I think
they felt like maybe I

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.657
had something to say,
which I hope I did.

00:04:04.657 --> 00:04:06.740
MALE SPEAKER: But it wasn't
really like a treatise

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.820
that you would expect some
"Daily Show" author to come off

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.350
their political
pedestal and tell you

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.090
how politics should be done.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.717
It was a series of
vignettes about your life

00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:18.050
and these kind of short stories.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.559
Almost Sedaris-like,
in some sense.

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.100
I hope you take that
as a compliment.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.891
AASIF MANDVI: I do.

00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:26.460
I'm a huge David Sedaris fan,
and to be compared to him

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.780
in any way at all is
a huge compliment.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.390
But that's what I
wanted to write.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.060
I came from a
theatrical background

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.620
doing theater, and going
to drama school, and all

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.140
that stuff.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:46.140
So for me, the personal
is the political.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.010
And all stories-- the
best stories are personal.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.680
And the greatest plays
and the greatest movies

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.830
all have to do with
some form of family.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.360
And so that is what I attempted
to do in this book, which

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.300
is really talk about my
journey, talk about my family,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.950
talk about that, and hopefully,
resonate on a larger level.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.810
MALE SPEAKER: Mhm.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.430
Was there a style
you were trying

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.020
to emulate with the
structure you went after?

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.460
Or is this just how it came out?

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.240
AASIF MANDVI: Maybe
Peter Benchley's "Jaws."

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.010
But I think I failed
miserably in that.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.510
MALE SPEAKER: I
think I sensed that.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.170
AASIF MANDVI: It
was a whole story

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.740
about how I got
attacked by a shark

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.770
that I took out because
it was completely made up.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.590
No, I guess people
like Sedaris--

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.190
I really just wanted-- I had
written a play years ago,

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.440
a one-man-show called,
"Sakina's Restaurant," which

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.420
was a series of also vignettes,
but done in a monologue

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.190
performance style.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.610
And I wanted to take that
and turn it into a narrative,

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.540
into a book form,
into a prose thing.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.580
But it's dealing
with the same subject

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.360
matter and the
same general world,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.780
but just different stories.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.420
So I really was writing
the way I write.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.317
And so hopefully, people
will like it and enjoy it.

00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:10.900
MALE SPEAKER: I
thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.050
I promise we'll get to the
content in just a moment.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.841
AASIF MANDVI: You don't
have to, it's fine.

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.020
I'm totally happy
to sit here and talk

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.790
about other people's books.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.200
MALE SPEAKER: Just the structure
of the book, if we could

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.370
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.494
AASIF MANDVI: "Great Gatsby,"
it's a terrific book,

00:06:22.494 --> 00:06:23.712
if you haven't read it.

00:06:23.712 --> 00:06:25.530
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.028
MALE SPEAKER: No, actually,
it was interesting.

00:06:28.028 --> 00:06:29.620
It doesn't read like
an autobiography.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.328
AASIF MANDVI: No.

00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:32.490
MALE SPEAKER: It really
has a sense of sequence,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.114
but also a sense of
just trains of thought.

00:06:35.114 --> 00:06:36.530
I just found it
wonderful to read.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.750
It was an absolute pleasure.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.916
AASIF MANDVI: Oh, thank you.

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:40.700
Thank you.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.580
I cringe at the
word, "biography"

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.210
or "memoir," or
whatever, because I

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.890
don't think of it that way.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.350
I also don't feel like
I'm at a place in life

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.760
where I'm like, (OLD, CROAKY
VOICE) I'm writing my memoir.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.600
I just feel like they are
stories inspired by my life.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.470
And they're entertaining,
and humorous, and sometimes

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.690
a little bit sad.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:10.460
So I think they're just
vignettes and little snapshots

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.770
of things in a person's
life that hopefully we

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.140
can relate to.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.480
And I deal with some real
issues of race, and religion,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.510
and stuff like that as
seen through the eyes

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.030
of a little brown kid
living in a white world.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.420
So you can relate, right pal?

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.532
Yes.

00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:34.990
Indians in the
front are like, yes,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.560
brown people in the white world.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.907
Yes, we know.

00:07:38.907 --> 00:07:40.740
MALE SPEAKER: Brown
people in a white world.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.824
But also, one that doesn't
necessarily relate to--

00:07:42.824 --> 00:07:44.406
AASIF MANDVI: Although
here, it's sort

00:07:44.406 --> 00:07:46.260
of white people in a
brown world, isn't it?

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.010
I mean in Google, kind
of a reverse thing there.

00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:54.400
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.010
Race, religion, identity--
these are all definitely

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.440
very prevalent
topics in the book.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.190
AASIF MANDVI: Yes.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.776
MALE SPEAKER: So
were these things

00:08:00.776 --> 00:08:02.900
that you were working out
as you were writing them?

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.450
Or did you have something
to say about them,

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.700
and you wanted to find the
right stories that captured it?

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.040
AASIF MANDVI: It was a
combination of things.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.740
I started off wanting
to say something,

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.130
and then realized I
actually had something else

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.290
that I was saying, and
then went down that.

00:08:17.015 --> 00:08:20.390
It sounds really,
(OLD, CROAKY VOICE)

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.300
I discovered a great deal about
myself as I wrote this book.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.811
But that's what happens
when you write stories

00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:28.310
about yourself, and your life,
and things that have happened

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.750
to you that you hopefully
gain a level of insight.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.080
Otherwise, why the fuck
are you writing it?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.250
Because then, you can share
that insight with others,

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.510
and hopefully they gain a level
of insight into their life.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.780
And that's how art works.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.590
MALE SPEAKER: Mm.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.100
AASIF MANDVI: That's
how art works.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.856
And that is one to grow on.

00:08:49.856 --> 00:08:52.230
MALE SPEAKER: Do you have any
specific examples of things

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.560
that you learned?

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.420
Things where you wrote it, and
you were like, oh, yeah, that

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.955
was profound.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.530
In those words.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.030
AASIF MANDVI: I
think it's dangerous

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.020
whenever a writer is sitting in
front of his computer writing

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.910
and then stops and goes, yes.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.520
Now, that is profound.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.910
Most of my experience of
writing was more like,

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.300
what the hell am I doing?

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.850
Why am I sitting here
writing this thing?

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.740
No one cares, that
kind of stuff.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.540
But yes, there were
definitely specific things

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.390
where in talking about my
immigrant journey from the UK,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.670
to the US, and the transitions
that happened there,

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.090
and coming to New York
as a young actor trying

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.930
to get work and then even
on "The Daily Show," talking

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.780
about the experience of being
on "The Daily Show," as,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.720
at the time when I
started, which was in 2006,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.240
and W was still president.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.430
And we were very much
entrenched in this war.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.580
And oh, wait-- it
sounds like today.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.390
But you know what I mean?

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.960
So definitely,
there were insights

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.800
that came out as I wrote that.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.369
Hopefully, that is what
happens when you write.

00:10:08.369 --> 00:10:09.410
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.910
It was interesting to hear
first person perspective.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.900
You struggle with
so many concepts

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.890
about, especially
religion, feeling

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.900
like your skin is
labeled like a Muslim.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.290
But you don't really have that.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.340
But your parents are that,
and yet you connect with it.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:23.765
AASIF MANDVI: Right.

00:10:23.765 --> 00:10:24.660
MALE SPEAKER: A lot
of back and forth.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.451
AASIF MANDVI: Yeah.

00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:29.810
I definitely tried to be honest
about my personal relationship

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.420
with my struggles with Islam.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.900
I say in the book that
I've been in more bars

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.960
than mosques over the
course of my life,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:41.090
and I'm no representation
of a Muslim, by any means.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.020
But yet, I somehow got hired as
the senior Muslim correspondent

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.151
on "The Daily Show," to which
my parents were completely

00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:48.650
flummoxed.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.629
They were like, why
would he hire you?

00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:54.170
You don't even know
how to do salaam.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.360
But that is the outside versus
the inside, and who you end up

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.850
being, and sort of the
shapes that you end up

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:13.490
taking in order to be
accepted, especially as a kid.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.570
I grew up in
England in the '70s,

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.575
and there was a lot of racism.

00:11:17.575 --> 00:11:21.352
And I went to a boarding school.

00:11:21.352 --> 00:11:23.960
And I dealt with
the racial stuff

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.120
that was going on there, and the
class stuff, and all of that.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:34.986
And then I talk about the
different-- like in the UK,

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:36.860
it doesn't matter how
long you've been there.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.376
As a kid growing up in the UK,
as an immigrant, Indian parents

00:11:41.376 --> 00:11:43.750
in England, it doesn't matter
how long you've been there.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.520
I felt like you always
were a foreigner.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.870
You would always feel that
sense of being a foreigner.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.369
And in America, it was the
opposite which is true,

00:11:50.369 --> 00:11:51.910
which was that you
arrive in America.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.517
And people are just
like, ah, we're

00:11:54.517 --> 00:11:56.850
the thousand years of culture
and history and religions.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.987
But forget that,
you're an American now.

00:11:58.987 --> 00:12:01.195
Pledge of Allegiance to the
flag, you're an American.

00:12:01.195 --> 00:12:02.694
In fact, we're going
to put American

00:12:02.694 --> 00:12:04.240
before we say who you are.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.330
So you are now an
American, Indian America.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.220
But the thing here,
I found, was that

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.780
because-- whoa, what's going on?

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.131
Yeah, we're doing an
interview here, pal.

00:12:17.131 --> 00:12:19.095
MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHING]

00:12:24.005 --> 00:12:27.332
AASIF MANDVI: Of
course they're Indian.

00:12:27.332 --> 00:12:28.915
(INDIAN ACCENT) What
is going on here?

00:12:31.861 --> 00:12:32.885
Is there free food?

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.260
Oh, there's free
food everywhere!

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:34.760
It's OK.

00:12:37.074 --> 00:12:38.740
That's why there's
so many Indians here,

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.189
because you have free food.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.929
What was I saying?

00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:46.512
MALE SPEAKER: I think
about struggles,

00:12:46.512 --> 00:12:48.130
and religion, and so forth.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.510
AASIF MANDVI: Anyway, yes.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.470
When you come to America,
there's that sense of,

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.822
you just get absorbed
into this Americana.

00:12:57.822 --> 00:12:59.280
There's a line in
my book actually,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.863
when I say Americans think about
the rest of the world the way

00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:03.771
New Yorkers think about
the rest of America.

00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:04.645
Which is, they don't.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.740
MALE SPEAKER: You talk a lot
about your acting influences

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.799
going back to childhood.

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:15.590
AASIF MANDVI: Yeah.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.120
MALE SPEAKER: You talk about
being inspired by Omar Sharif.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.405
AASIF MANDVI: Yes.

00:13:18.405 --> 00:13:20.290
MALE SPEAKER: Can you talk
about why he inspires you,

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.665
and what that did
to your career?

00:13:21.665 --> 00:13:24.660
AASIF MANDVI: Well, Omar
Sharif was, at that time,

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.930
before we had Aziz Ansari,
we had Omar Sharif.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:33.510
And Omar Sharif was
the first brown face

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.900
that I saw in a Hollywood movie.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.310
And so for me, as a
little kid, watching that,

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:45.520
my heroes were the
Fonz, or whatever.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.280
And I would watch
American television shows,

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.460
and I would want
to try to be that.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.930
And I liked the Fonz, because
his real name was Fonzarelli,

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.720
and my name was
Mandviwala and I figured,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.350
we both had really dorky names.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.322
And yet, he seemed to
have transcended that,

00:14:02.322 --> 00:14:03.280
and become really cool.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.738
So I thought there
was hope for me.

00:14:04.738 --> 00:14:07.430
But then I saw Omar Sharif.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.310
And I remember
that sense of, oh.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.890
Here's the first brown person.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.840
And I was taken aback.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.500
And so there was a weird
hope in terms of, oh.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.510
There's a possibility
of actually

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.050
being an actor in
Hollywood, or being

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.104
an actor, if you're
a brown person.

00:14:28.104 --> 00:14:30.020
Because I didn't really
grow up with Bollywood

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:34.060
and all the Indian actors.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:38.730
All of my acting heroes
were Caucasian men.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.170
So he was the first that wasn't.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.280
MALE SPEAKER: Well, and fast
forward to recent time--

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.850
really with this, now, it
sounds like you actually

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.290
inspired quite a few various
types brown Americans,

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.930
Muslim Americans, Indian
descent, whatever.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.930
And so it's almost as if
you've, to some degree,

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.750
come most of the full circle.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.250
Do you feel like this book is
a bit of an homage to that,

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.860
hoping to inspire other
young Aasifs out there?

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.860
AASIF MANDVI: That's a
tough question to answer,

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.318
because you never really feel
like you've come full circle.

00:15:10.318 --> 00:15:13.370
You just end up feeling you're
somewhere on the treadmill

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.160
trying to figure it out.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.180
But yes, I am
always proud when I

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.720
feel like there are
younger South Asian

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:29.540
writers, performers, whatever,
who have been inspired by what

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.040
I've done, or have read
my work, or whatever.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.440
So yes.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.280
When I wrote,
"Sakina's Restaurant,"

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.740
I grew up-- so as a young
actor, you go to auditions,

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.230
and you would have to do
a monologue, and whatever.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.340
And I would always
have to do something

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.600
from like, "Death
of a Salesman,"

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:56.840
because there were no plays
written for brown characters.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.360
There were no parts.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.210
And so when I wrote
"Sakina's Restaurant," one

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.340
of the personally
most fulfilling

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.820
moments was that
because I created

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.720
these characters
for brown actors--

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.840
because there were
brown, Indian characters,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.990
a kid came up to me one time
and said, I got into grad school

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.350
using one of your monologues
from "Sakina's Restaurant."

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.629
Which was pretty cool for me.

00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:24.670
Outside of everything
else, that was really cool.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.628
Because I was like, oh.

00:16:25.628 --> 00:16:28.230
You actually had a character
that you could personally

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.940
relate to instead of doing Biff.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.770
You could do this
brown, Indian character,

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.960
and actually get into
grad school with it.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.859
So yes, that feels good.

00:16:41.859 --> 00:16:42.900
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.040
Actually, so you
said, there were

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.730
no roles written
for brown people.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:47.890
But on a much more
depressing level,

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.220
and one that you've
written on, there

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.094
were plenty of roles
written for brown people

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:52.250
given to white people.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:52.600
AASIF MANDVI: Right.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.160
MALE SPEAKER: And you called
it-- "whitewashing," I guess,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.930
is a term probably
used in Hollywood more.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.440
AASIF MANDVI: Yeah,
there were, yes.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.280
It's happened across- it's
not just brown people,

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.490
but anybody who
was not Caucasian

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.690
was often, in early
Hollywood, especially,

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.190
Mickey Rooney in "Breakfast
at Tiffany's," of course,

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:15.920
is the most famous case of
whitewashing that there is.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.460
But even in the '80s,
you had Fisher Stevens

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.280
playing an Indian guy in "Short
Circuit," and stuff like that.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.940
So when they actually started
to hire Kal Penn, it was cool.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.640
When "Harold and Kumar" came
along, it was like, oh, OK.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.390
Now, we see a brown
guy and an Asian guy

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.680
in the leads in a film.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.810
So things have
changed since when

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:45.460
I was auditioning to be a snake
charmer for a commercial, which

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.050
they ended up
casting a white guy.

00:17:49.595 --> 00:17:51.220
MALE SPEAKER: I think
you refer to that

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.451
in the book as potanking.

00:17:53.451 --> 00:17:54.450
AASIF MANDVI: Potanking.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.120
So potanking is a word that my
good friend, Sakina Jaffrey,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.617
who you might all know
from "The House of Cards."

00:18:01.617 --> 00:18:03.450
Oh, there's whole bunch
of people over here.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.550
I have not even
been looking at you.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.934
Hi , how are you?

00:18:06.934 --> 00:18:08.100
AUDIENCE: Good, how are you?

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.080
AASIF MANDVI: Nice to see you.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.870
So she came up with this term.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.300
And we used to
use this term when

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.840
we were actors in New York.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.130
And it was potanking,
which is basically

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:25.130
when they want you to embody
the Indian stereotype.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.520
And what it sounds like to
them is, (INDIAN ACCENT)

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.310
potank, potank, potank,
potank, potank, potank, potank.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.000
So when we would
go to auditions,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.732
she would always say
to me, how'd it go?

00:18:34.732 --> 00:18:35.690
And I'd be like, great.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.398
And she's like, did
they have you potank?

00:18:37.398 --> 00:18:39.840
And I would be
like, yes, they did.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.740
Because they invariably
were always like,

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.710
could you do-- nobody
knew that's what

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.750
it was called except us.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:52.892
But that was our inside
beltway slang for it.

00:18:52.892 --> 00:18:55.100
MALE SPEAKER: Although when
you look back, certainly,

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.600
the more notable
things you've done.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.717
I don't feel like you had
to put on that accent.

00:18:58.717 --> 00:19:00.550
So do you feel like
you've been able to grow

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.260
through that as an actor?

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.170
Or do you still feel like you're
faced with this constantly?

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.350
AASIF MANDVI: Well, no, I
am faced with this still,

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.000
to this day.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.210
And luckily, I have a little bit
more leverage now than I did.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:14.710
In fact, talking of when
I did "The Internship,"

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.070
I had to do the Indian accent.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.530
And they wanted the character
to have an Indian accent.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.160
And I remember going
in and auditioning,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.805
and meeting with Vince Vaughn
and Shawn Levy, the director,

00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:32.130
who were very great.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:36.160
But then I got a call from one
of the producers of the film

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.470
saying that Warner
Brothers would

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:48.660
like to hire a dialect coach
for you for the Indian accent.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.740
And I said, they know
that I am Indian, right,

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.550
and I have Indian parents.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.070
And they were like, no, no, no.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.570
They know.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.000
But they felt like
your accent was not

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.120
as strong as the other
actors that were coming in.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.640
And I was like, I know.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.420
That was for a reason.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.460
And so I had to push
back a little bit

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.380
and be like, this
guy, I'm not going

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.730
to do him as some stereotype
of an Indian accent.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.000
So I actually modulated
the Indian accent

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.860
so that they wanted the
accent, but I gave them

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.020
my version of what that was.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:35.395
And I remember saying
to them, do you

00:20:35.395 --> 00:20:37.109
know the way Fareed
Zakaria sounds?

00:20:37.109 --> 00:20:38.400
And they were like, yes, we do.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.610
And they're like, that's
the accent I'm going to do.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.984
And they were like, we
love Fareed Zakaria.

00:20:42.984 --> 00:20:43.839
We think he's great.

00:20:43.839 --> 00:20:44.880
I was like, there you go.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.510
That's it.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.420
That's not Apu,
it's Fareed Zakaria.

00:20:51.365 --> 00:20:52.156
MALE SPEAKER: Nice.

00:20:53.498 --> 00:20:56.164
AASIF MANDVI: Fareed is watching
this right now, (MOCKING FAREED

00:20:56.164 --> 00:20:58.308
ZAKARIA) He doesn't
sound like me at all.

00:20:58.308 --> 00:20:59.802
MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHING]

00:20:59.802 --> 00:21:01.802
AASIF MANDVI: (FALSETTO)
Do I sound like the guy

00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:04.715
from "The Internship?"

00:21:04.715 --> 00:21:06.035
MALE SPEAKER: That's hilarious.

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:09.591
AASIF MANDVI: I don't know why
I just gave him Stewie's voice.

00:21:09.591 --> 00:21:14.302
(IMPERSONATING STEWIE FROM
"FAMILY GUY") I say-- Go ahead.

00:21:14.302 --> 00:21:16.010
MALE SPEAKER: You were
raised in England.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.718
It's an interesting
background, because I

00:21:17.718 --> 00:21:21.700
don't think anybody
would have guessed that.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.350
AASIF MANDVI: It's
a well kept secret.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.300
MALE SPEAKER: Well, your accent
doesn't tell that at all.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.200
AASIF MANDVI: Right.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.810
It's funny.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.117
Sometimes people
hear it-- I feel

00:21:32.117 --> 00:21:34.450
like I have one of those
accents where sometimes, people

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.595
are like, once I tell them
I was raised in England,

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:37.260
then they're like, oh yeah.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.100
I totally hear it.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.350
And I'm like, no, you don't.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.310
You think you do now,
because I just told you that.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.310
But I grew up in the
north of England.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.820
So I had a very thick Northern
accent, like that, really--

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.885
[GRUMBLING]

00:21:51.885 --> 00:21:54.093
(NORTHERN BRITISH ACCENT)
Right, where are you going?

00:21:54.093 --> 00:21:55.400
Oh yeah, great.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.900
Like I sound like that.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.000
And imagine if I
sounded like that now.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.210
But I think, again, going back
to the whole idea of adapting

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.930
to various, different
environments,

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.880
I think I got to
Florida and realized

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.050
that nobody knew what
I was talking about.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:17.330
And when I was
living in Florida,

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.510
the combination of a
northern, British accent

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.050
with an American
accent ended up making

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.172
me sound like I
was from Brooklyn.

00:22:25.172 --> 00:22:26.880
And so people thought
I was from Brooklyn

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.879
when I lived in Florida.

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:29.266
I'd never even
lived in Brooklyn.

00:22:29.266 --> 00:22:30.640
And so it was
really interesting,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.279
because the way it
melded together.

00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:35.070
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:36.390
And you didn't just
move to Florida,

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.720
you moved to Tampa, Florida.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.320
AASIF MANDVI: Tampa, Florida.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.020
MALE SPEAKER: It's the gem.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.895
AASIF MANDVI: Which is
the armpit of Florida.

00:22:40.895 --> 00:22:41.930
No, I'm kidding, Tampa.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.670
Love you, love you.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.710
No, it was great.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.400
That was America to me
when I got to Tampa.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.280
I was like, America's
full of strip clubs,

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.790
really awesome
strip clubs-- like,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:59.052
the best strip clubs in-- no.

00:23:01.878 --> 00:23:02.940
And Chik-fil-A's.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.670
It's Chik-fil-A's
and strip clubs.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:14.260
But that was America, Florida.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.082
I think I thought my life
would be like I'd just

00:23:17.082 --> 00:23:18.873
be hanging out with a
dolphin all the time,

00:23:18.873 --> 00:23:23.370
and living on a sailboat.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.889
But I ended up in the
suburbs of Tampa, Florida.

00:23:26.889 --> 00:23:27.680
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.130
AASIF MANDVI: Yeah.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.030
MALE SPEAKER: Some of the
stories were fish out of water

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.654
to some degree.

00:23:30.654 --> 00:23:32.840
But also, you embracing
it much more--

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:37.157
or rather, your father embracing
Americanism to a degree.

00:23:37.157 --> 00:23:37.990
AASIF MANDVI: Right.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.210
You're talking about
brunch, aren't you?

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:39.810
MALE SPEAKER: I
am, a little bit.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:40.560
AASIF MANDVI: Yes.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.496
My dad, when he first came
to Florida, he called us.

00:23:44.496 --> 00:23:47.120
We were in England, and he came
out on a reconnaissance mission

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.350
to see if he wanted to
move the family to Florida.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.990
And he called us,
and he was like, they

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.340
have this wonderful thing here.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.890
It is called, "brunch."

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.210
It is breakfast and lunch.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.750
They have a third meal, brunch.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.972
He thought it was
an in-between meal.

00:24:02.972 --> 00:24:05.980
He was like, there's
breakfast, then there's brunch,

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.340
then there's lunch.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.910
And I was like, I don't
think that's what it is.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:12.890
I googled it.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:13.746
No, I didn't.

00:24:13.746 --> 00:24:15.575
There was no Google back then.

00:24:15.575 --> 00:24:16.575
People had dictionaries.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.550
He was obsessed with this
idea of this brunch thing.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.770
So I remember, that was one
of my first-- hello, hello.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:29.322
How are you?

00:24:29.322 --> 00:24:30.780
They're just on
their way to class.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:40.040
So it was one of these
first memories of America,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.420
was coming to America and then
going to get brunch at IHOP,

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.997
or wherever.

00:24:45.997 --> 00:24:47.580
So I have a story
about that actually,

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.942
in my book, about how my
father was obsessed with that.

00:24:49.942 --> 00:24:51.650
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
and he also addresses

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:56.190
what he thinks to be the golden
rule of American consumption,

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:57.860
which is like, eat
as much as you can.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.510
AASIF MANDVI: Eat
as much as you can.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.310
Eat it all!

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:04.900
Because look, the idea that
America is the land of plenty.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.550
For him, he took that literally.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.810
And he was like, let's go to
Albertson's and take pictures

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.215
of huge jars of peanut butter
and send them back to India

00:25:15.215 --> 00:25:16.720
to make them jealous.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.230
I don't know.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.400
But he definitely
embraced American culture

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.775
with open arms
and an open mouth.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.570
MALE SPEAKER: You also
wrote about your experience

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.354
and your first star or lead
role with "The Mystic Masseur."

00:25:30.354 --> 00:25:32.020
AASIF MANDVI: Yes,
"The Mystic Masseur."

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.270
MALE SPEAKER: What did you
learn from this experience?

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.010
What did that take away?

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.820
AASIF MANDVI: Again, when I
was doing "Sakina's Restaurant"

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.580
off-Broadway, which is the
one man show that I wrote,

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.310
a gentleman by the name of
Ismail Merchant approached me.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.950
And Ismael Merchant, for those
of you who might not know,

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.040
was the merchant
in Merchant Ivory.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.520
And they made all these amazing
movies back in the '80s,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.212
like "Remains of the
Day," and "Howards End,"

00:25:56.212 --> 00:25:59.060
and "Room With a View," and
won a lot of Academy Awards.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:04.550
And they created an entire
genre of films, period films.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:12.190
And so Ismael came up to me
after the play and was like,

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.670
I've got a movie that I'm making
based on V.S. Naipaul's book,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.530
"The Mystic Masseur,"
and I'd like

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.300
you to play the
lead in this film.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.480
And so it was a tremendous
opportunity as a young actor.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.230
I'd had like, two lines on
"Law &amp; Order," at that time.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.840
So it was great.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.750
But it was nervewracking
and terrifying.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.720
And he was a Barnum
&amp; Bailey type

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.525
character, like
larger than life.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.160
I remember one time--
well, when I first met him,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.320
he took me to this restaurant
that he claimed that he owned,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.987
but none of the waiters
knew who he was.

00:26:46.987 --> 00:26:48.403
But he was like,
(INDIAN ACCENT) I

00:26:48.403 --> 00:26:50.180
love-- this is a
wonderful restaurant.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.580
I own this.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.960
And then we had this meal,
and he gave me the book.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.290
And then he said, you must
read this book immediately.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:57.290
We are making the film.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.670
And it's going to be terrific,
and blah, blah, blah.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.550
And then I didn't hear
from him for a year.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.300
And then, like a year
later, he called me.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.270
And he was like, you
have to go to London

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.706
for a costume fitting.

00:27:07.706 --> 00:27:08.580
And I was like, what?

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.870
I don't even know if
I'm doing this movie.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:10.950
I haven't talked
to you in a year.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.533
He was like, of
course we're doing it!

00:27:12.533 --> 00:27:14.020
And he really offended.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.780
And so he was like, of course!

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.960
Why would I-- and I was like,
because it was a year ago.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.670
And so then he
flew me to London.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.640
But the crazy thing
was, he was literally

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.070
one of the cheapest people.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.167
The man has passed on now.

00:27:25.167 --> 00:27:26.625
And God bless him,
and I loved him.

00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:30.330
And he was like a crazy uncle
to me, and gave me this amaze--

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.414
but he was one of the
cheapest people in the world.

00:27:33.414 --> 00:27:35.330
Anthony Hopkins once
said that Ismail Merchant

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:40.030
will steal the cream out of your
coffee if you don't watch out.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.520
And he sent me to London
for a costume fitting,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:48.160
and he refused to give me
what's called "per diem."

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.860
So per diem is basically food
money to eat, and take cabs,

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.462
and whatever.

00:27:53.462 --> 00:27:55.420
So I was going to be in
London for the weekend,

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.690
and he wouldn't give me lodging.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.200
He wouldn't give me a hotel.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.650
He was basically like,
you'll stay in my flat.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.330
And then my manager
at the time was

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:09.210
like, you have to give
him some money to eat.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.750
And so he got frustrated
and called me over

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:17.350
to the Merchant Ivory offices on
57th Street, where I walked in.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.630
I walk into this room where
there's BAFTA's, and Oscars,

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:25.780
and pictures of him with
Anthony Hopkins and Hugh Grant

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.410
everywhere on the
walls, and stuff.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.382
And he's screaming
at James Ivory,

00:28:29.382 --> 00:28:31.090
who was the other part
of Merchant Ivory,

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:35.190
about how Harvey Weinstein
is an uncouth pig.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.600
Which, you know.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.750
He's not the first or
the last to say that.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:45.270
But he was screaming about this.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.747
And then I sat there
for about 10 minutes

00:28:47.747 --> 00:28:48.830
while he was on the phone.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.130
And then he finally looked up.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.350
And he said, OK.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.810
Your manager is
telling me that you

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.210
have to have money to eat
when you are in London.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.760
So here's what I'm going to do.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.135
So he takes out
a piece of paper.

00:29:00.135 --> 00:29:03.039
And he writes on it,
dear Mr. Khan-- oh no.

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:05.580
He says to me, he goes, there's
a wonderful Indian restaurant

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.310
down the street from my flat.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.470
And he writes, dear
Mr. Khan, please

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:11.340
let my friend, Aasif
Mandvi, eat whatever

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.429
he would like on the menu when
he comes to your establishment.

00:29:14.429 --> 00:29:15.970
Signed, your friend,
Ismail Merchant.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.761
And he rolls it up,
puts it in an envelope.

00:29:17.761 --> 00:29:22.680
Gives it to me, and says, you
go to this Indian restaurant.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.890
He will give you whatever
food you require.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:29.130
That means I literally only
had to eat Indian food.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.250
And then he's like, but when
the bill comes, remember,

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.090
he's supposed to
give me 50% off.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.950
So he wanted a 50%
discount on this free food.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.520
So that was him.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.810
But he was crazy.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:46.370
And then he accused me of having
sex on his chair when I was--

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:51.810
house was like the inside
of Sotheby's or Christie's.

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:54.120
Everything was from
Rajasthan from the 1600s.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:30:01.874
He had the raj, and he had
these antique chairs, I guess.

00:30:01.874 --> 00:30:04.040
And they were in his dining
room, and I sat on them.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.800
And they broke because
I was leaning back,

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.790
because the TV was
in his dining room.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.540
So I break the chair.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.940
He has a dinner party.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.260
Some woman sits on the chair, it
breaks because I had broken it.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.830
And I tried to put it
back together with glue.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.110
And then he proceeds to
tell the entire dinner party

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:27.660
that me, his guest,
had been having

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:32.990
sex on his antique
chairs and broken them.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.170
And I'm standing there.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:38.350
And everyone looking at me,
like why would you do that?

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.125
That's a terribly
impolite thing to do.

00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:42.740
And I'm like, what?

00:30:45.494 --> 00:30:47.910
MALE SPEAKER: Well, you've
mentioned "Sakina's Restaurant"

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:48.540
a couple of times.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.748
I do want to talk about that.

00:30:49.748 --> 00:30:52.230
Because it really only
showed in New York,

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.070
or maybe in New
York and Chicago.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.700
AASIF MANDVI: Well, actually,
we played in a couple of places.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.910
We played in New
York, and then we

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.160
toured it around a little bit.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.660
We brought it to LA.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.420
We took it to London, to
the Bush theater in London.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:10.230
And for a couple years, I was
touring around with that show.

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:14.090
But when we did an
off-Broadway in New York,

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:18.530
it was the first play about
a South Asian family written

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.450
by a South Asian that was done
on the mainstream New York

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.050
stage.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:25.090
And so we got quite a
bit of attention just

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.530
from that perspective.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.490
And then we made it into a
film called, "Today's Special,"

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.290
which is available on Netflix.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.500
And it was good.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.654
It was good to do.

00:31:39.654 --> 00:31:42.070
MALE SPEAKER: So your roots
are really in dramatic acting.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.195
AASIF MANDVI: Really, yeah.

00:31:43.195 --> 00:31:45.714
I went to drama school.

00:31:45.714 --> 00:31:47.880
The whole "Daily Show" thing
came out of left field,

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.870
and has changed my
life, and has been

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.570
a tremendous opportunity for me.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:59.060
But my love is really
theater, in the same way

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:03.210
that John Oliver goes back
to do standup in the clubs

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.830
where he grew up.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.640
I grew up doing theater.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.310
And also, in drama
school, you don't

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:14.100
think of comedy
versus-- in Hollywood,

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.243
they're like, you can
do comedy and drama?

00:32:16.243 --> 00:32:17.152
What?

00:32:17.152 --> 00:32:18.110
They're amazed by that.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.680
But in drama school,
you do it all.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.410
You're doing
Chekhov and Moliere.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:23.160
MALE SPEAKER: Mhm.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.284
AASIF MANDVI: A little
Chekhov, Moliere drop, boom!

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.594
MALE SPEAKER: So how
prepared were you

00:32:30.594 --> 00:32:32.010
for this "Daily
Show" opportunity?

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.510
I couldn't get the
sense of how much

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.040
standup or comedy experience.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.230
AASIF MANDVI: I had
comedy experience.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:37.690
I'd been in a
sketch comedy group.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:42.340
I hadn't really done standup,
but I'd done more improv,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.880
sketch stuff.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.190
And when "The Daily Show" came
along, the great thing for me

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.440
was specifically, John was
not looking for a comedian.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.480
Because I think they often go
scout comedy clubs or places

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.260
like that.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.920
He was looking for an actor.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.990
And so when I came in to
audition for "The Daily Show,"

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:02.090
it really was for
a one-off gig where

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.700
they had written this Middle
East correspondent character

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.160
and realized, oh.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.550
We don't have a Middle
East correspondent.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.840
So they had to audition people.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.980
So I came in, auditioned,
and he actually

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.420
offered me the job that day.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.290
Like I basically
came in and was like,

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.700
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.040
I'm just going to do my best
Stephen Colbert impression.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.820
And so I did this impression
of Stephen Colbert.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.480
Jon turned to me, said,
welcome to "The Daily Show."

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.050
And I was on that night.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.050
And the weird thing
was that I went out--

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.630
it was the weirdest
day of my life.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:35.950
So I walk out onto the
stage at the rehearsal.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.740
Because we usually rehearse
around 4 o'clock, and then

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.800
we tape at like 6:00.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.829
And at 4 o'clock,
I go out there.

00:33:41.829 --> 00:33:43.370
And usually, in the
audience, there's

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.800
a few producers, and some
of the writers, and stuff.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.110
And everything's changing,
and they're writing.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.050
So I go out there
for this rehearsal,

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.370
and I look out in the audience.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:56.290
And there's a guy sitting
there with a baseball cap.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.270
And he's just hanging out.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.830
And I'm looking at him.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.540
And I look a little
bit more closely.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.540
And it turns out that
it's Bruce Springsteen.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:08.449
And of course, my first
reaction is, holy God,

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:14.485
Bruce Springsteen works
at "The Daily Show!"

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:16.110
But he didn't work
at "The Daily Show."

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.960
He was just visiting.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.470
And so then I do the show,
and then Bruce Springsteen

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.969
comes back.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:24.176
So not only did I meet
Jon Stewart the first time

00:34:24.176 --> 00:34:25.800
and was on "The Daily
Show," I also met

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.139
The Boss who came backstage, and
told me that I was very funny.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.904
And I him, you're
a very good singer.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:35.024
You're good at singing.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.880
What can I say?

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.130
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you
mentioned that they hired you,

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:43.560
and you were on that night.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.670
I was going to ask, is that
protocol for "The Daily Show?"

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:46.230
AASIF MANDVI: No.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.699
I think I'm the
only person that's

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:49.340
ever been hired that way.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.361
Because I was
hired as a one-off.

00:34:51.361 --> 00:34:53.152
It was just going to
be for that one night.

00:34:53.152 --> 00:34:56.600
And then Jon, god
bless him, kept

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.340
calling me back and
just saying, hey.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.040
You want to come back and
hang out and do another piece,

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:01.590
and whatever?

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.881
And so I just kept coming back.

00:35:02.881 --> 00:35:05.480
And eventually, after about four
months, what I realized was,

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.490
that was my audition period.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:08.800
That was my trial.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.600
And then after four months,
they offered me a contract.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.870
And then I was there until now.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.370
MALE SPEAKER: So I
was going to ask.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:20.230
I've had a fantastic run there.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.860
I know that correspondents come
in and out of "The Daily Show."

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.470
AASIF MANDVI: I've actually
been away from "The Daily

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.220
Show" for the last six
months because I've

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.710
been doing an HBO series called,
"The Brink," which comes out

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.510
next year with Jack
Black and Tim Robbins,

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.950
and a whole bunch of
really great actors.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:38.730
And it's a half
hour comedy staying

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.050
in the geopolitical
satire world.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:47.067
But it's a half hour comedy
about the end of the world.

00:35:47.067 --> 00:35:48.650
Not specifically the
end of the world,

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.980
but like a huge global crisis.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.510
So if "24" or
"Homeland" was a comedy,

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.450
this is what it would be.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.680
So it's great.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.974
And I'm very excited
about it, and HBO's

00:36:00.974 --> 00:36:01.890
very excited about it.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:02.770
It comes out next year.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.811
So I've actually been away
from "The Daily Show."

00:36:04.811 --> 00:36:09.920
So I've actually now am more
part time on "The Daily Show."

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.160
I gave up my office.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.900
And now, I'm just going to
job in whenever they need me,

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.602
or whatever I'm free.

00:36:16.602 --> 00:36:18.310
MALE SPEAKER: So now
there's an open role

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.470
for Senior Muslim Correspondent.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:19.303
AASIF MANDVI: It is.

00:36:19.303 --> 00:36:20.010
It's great.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:23.800
And again, Jon has been the
greatest boss, because he's

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.670
let me go off and do
movies and other things,

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.640
and then come back
and always have a home

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.550
at "The Daily Show."

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.115
And so this one,
he was like, look.

00:36:31.115 --> 00:36:32.740
You're going to be
gone for six months.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.560
Why don't you just-- because
it always feels like I

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.820
go off and do other stuff.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.610
And he was like, rather
than that, why don't we

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.949
just have you come in
whenever you need to come in

00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:42.490
and do stuff?

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:44.190
So you'll still
see me on the show,

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.850
I just probably won't be
there on a full time basis.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:47.830
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:48.470
Yeah.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:49.990
You've had some pretty
great correspondent

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:51.180
names, as they are good at it.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.721
My favorite is probably Senior
Foreign-Looking Correspondent.

00:36:53.721 --> 00:36:55.680
AASIF MANDVI: Looking
Correspondent, yes.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.984
That's my favorite too.

00:36:56.984 --> 00:36:59.400
MALE SPEAKER: You said you
started out as Stephen Colbert.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.440
I've got to imagine, you
really molded this role

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:01.800
into something.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.270
So when did you envision
yourself on "The Daily Show?"

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.560
AASIF MANDVI: I never did.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.650
This is a tough question.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.020
Because other people,
I've always been like,

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.760
oh, your persona on
"The Daily Show" is so--

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.540
and the thing is, I
can't think about it.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.640
If I become aware of that,
then I am dead in the water.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.650
Because for me, I just go out
there and try to be funny,

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.810
and communicate, and try to hit
the jokes, and do the thing.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.460
And my persona is something that
just has developed organically

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.310
over time.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:34.280
I think all of that, all
of the correspondents

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.560
have their very
specific persona.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.550
But it comes, hopefully,
out of an organic process.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.770
And it took a while
for it to evolve.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.160
But I don't try to think
about it that much.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.330
Because otherwise, it
will go away or something.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:50.040
So I don't worry about it.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.330
MALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.782
I have many favorites, in
terms of scenes from your show.

00:37:53.782 --> 00:37:55.240
And you've got a
couple that you've

00:37:55.240 --> 00:38:00.550
made quite a mark on the world
at large, in terms of influence

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.931
that your work has
actually had on the people

00:38:02.931 --> 00:38:05.180
outside of "The Daily Show,"
and thinking specifically

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.625
of the politician
from North Carolina--

00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:07.890
AASIF MANDVI: Oh right, yes.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:12.010
MALE SPEAKER: --where you may
have just let him say things.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:12.760
AASIF MANDVI: Yes.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.010
MALE SPEAKER: What
was that interview?

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.468
AASIF MANDVI: That has become
my most famous interview now.

00:38:16.468 --> 00:38:20.790
And it was primarily
because-- we do interviews

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.920
like that a lot.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.270
And people say crazy
things all the time.

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.590
I think what happened
in this instance was,

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:33.380
here was a GOP guy in
North Carolina saying

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.450
the N-word and other things
on national television

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.630
at the same time as the
GOP was trying to reach out

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:41.430
to African American voters
in that same county.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:46.657
So what was sad about it
was the GOP fired him.

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.240
But it almost felt
like they fired him

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.531
because they were like, listen.

00:38:49.531 --> 00:38:52.420
You're not allowed
to say that out loud.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.370
We are trying to get
black people to vote.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.660
But it was like that.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.580
But anyway, once he got fired,
then it became national news.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:08.070
And Rachel Maddow, and CNN,
everyone was talking about it.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.342
But that was one of
those situations where

00:39:10.342 --> 00:39:11.550
you don't realize the impact.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.300
You never know.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.925
You just basically
go in there, and let

00:39:13.925 --> 00:39:15.780
people-- Stephen Colbert, again.

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.030
I go back to Stephen Colbert,
because he said to me

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.650
when I first
started at the show.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.880
He said, when you put a
camera in someone's face,

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.350
they get a lobotomy.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.250
And you want to take advantage
of that as much as you can.

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.680
And the other thing
is, use the silence.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.230
When you don't speak, they
will continue to speak,

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:35.350
and they will fill the silence.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.500
And eventually, they will
do the thing which I call,

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.430
I fucked the chicken moment.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:45.486
They will say, I
fucked the chicken.

00:39:45.486 --> 00:39:48.710
And once they say, I fucked the
chicken, you have your piece.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:49.880
That's it.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.270
Then you can just be like--
(MUMBLING) I think we're done.

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.786
We're good here.

00:39:51.786 --> 00:39:52.776
Oh, we've got everything.

00:39:52.776 --> 00:39:54.234
You pretty much
fucked the chicken?

00:39:54.234 --> 00:39:55.370
Yeah, I fucked the chicken.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:58.120
So sometimes it
takes a long time

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.870
to get to the I fucked
the chicken moment.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:03.470
And sometimes, they say, I
fucked the chicken right away.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.870
But eventually, hopefully,
if the piece goes well, they

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.472
will say, I fucked the chicken.

00:40:07.472 --> 00:40:09.430
I'm just going to see
how many times I can say,

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:10.484
I fucked the chicken.

00:40:10.484 --> 00:40:12.150
MALE SPEAKER: Is that
at all a reference

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:15.117
to Jon's favorite news clip he'd
picked up where someone's like,

00:40:15.117 --> 00:40:16.200
keep fucking that chicken.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.050
AASIF MANDVI: Keep
fucking that chicken.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:17.550
Yeah.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:20.240
And it is exactly that.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.130
It is like, when
they say that thing

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:25.180
that they or their lawyers
wish they had never said

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.740
is when you have the piece.

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:31.000
And that's what happened with
Don Yelton, where he basically

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.320
started on this whole, oh,
I'm making fun of Obama.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.650
He had a cartoon of
Obama as a witch doctor,

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.040
and he said he was making
fun of Obama's white half.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.970
Which first, didn't
even make any sense.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:46.594
And so once he
went on that roll,

00:40:46.594 --> 00:40:48.510
I knew that I just had
to stay out of the way.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:52.240
Now, my job was not to
encourage or discourage.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.814
It was just to step
back and let him go.

00:40:54.814 --> 00:40:56.980
And that's what happened,
and sometimes those things

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.340
work out really well.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.410
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.360
So do you have any
personal favorites

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.327
that you look back on?

00:41:05.327 --> 00:41:06.410
Clips that you were just--

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:07.630
AASIF MANDVI: I do.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.070
That one is obviously
a favorite of mine.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:13.250
I also loved the time
I asked Governor Rick

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:15.540
Scott to pee in a cup.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.300
We were doing a
piece down in Florida

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:21.770
about mandatory drug testing
for people on welfare.

00:41:27.325 --> 00:41:28.200
It was a valid piece.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.520
But what was great
about it was, Rick Scott

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.690
was having a press conference
to announce his budget

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.710
for the upcoming year.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:35.590
And we thought it
would be great.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.256
Because what we realized is that
like, a lot of these people who

00:41:38.256 --> 00:41:41.740
are advocating this
law, their reasoning

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.199
was that welfare
is taxpayer money.

00:41:43.199 --> 00:41:44.615
And therefore, the
taxpayer should

00:41:44.615 --> 00:41:46.030
know where that money is going.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.910
And so these people
should be drug tested.

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:49.490
But surprise, surprise.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.650
The people who
are also lawmakers

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.310
in the state of Florida are
getting paid by the taxpayer.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:57.155
And so why should they not
be drug tested, as well?

00:41:57.155 --> 00:41:59.030
So this was our premise
that we went in with,

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.150
and we thought we would
take it to the highest

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.270
level in Florida, which
is the governor himself.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:07.175
And so we interrupted a
press conference of his

00:42:07.175 --> 00:42:08.800
with about as many
journalists as there

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.050
are sitting in this
room right now,

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:15.500
and asked him if he would
give us a urine sample.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.750
And I had the cup right there.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:17.610
I said, you can do it right now.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.950
We'll all turn around.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.930
You could just give
us a quick sample.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:23.732
And he was not happy about that.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.060
I think at first, he
was trying to be polite.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.420
But eventually, he
was like, I'm running

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.090
this press conference,
not you, OK?

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:33.630
Sit down.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:36.290
And so even though he
got mad and shut us up,

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:37.980
we had the moment.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:41.280
And what was great about it was,
when it aired-- first of all,

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.950
before it aired-- because
every media outlet in Florida

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:47.230
was in that room.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:52.020
Meanwhile, none of them made a
sound while I was doing this.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.120
They were just
gobsmacked and sat there,

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.020
afraid to laugh,
afraid to do anything.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.880
Because they want to
get in that room again,

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.020
and I don't give a shit.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:01.990
You know what I mean?

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:06.920
So they're all like, we want to
be invited to this party again.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.350
We are not going to
make fun of the host.

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:10.620
So they all sat there.

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:14.980
But the minute we walked
out, they came upon us.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.390
And they were literally
like, that was amazing.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:20.110
We wish we could do that.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:24.000
And then it was in all
the Florida newspapers,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.950
it was on all the local news.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:28.550
And my parents, who live
in Tampa, of course,

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:30.770
my dad calls me.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:32.220
And he just answered the phone.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:32.845
I'm like, what?

00:43:32.845 --> 00:43:34.130
He's like, what did you do?

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:42.050
And he had heard it on the
radio and on the local news.

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:45.280
And then when the piece aired,
I realized how much Floridians

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.050
hate Rick Scott, and they
were so happy that happened.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:53.570
So that's one of my
personal favorites as well.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:54.861
MALE SPEAKER: That's hilarious.

00:43:54.861 --> 00:43:55.250
OK.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.740
Well, we are at the
top of the hour.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:57.730
Since we started
a little late, I

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.230
wanted to give us a few
minutes for questions.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.440
AASIF MANDVI: Yeah.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.226
MALE SPEAKER: Of
course, Aasif's going

00:44:00.226 --> 00:44:01.230
to want to get lunch after this.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.110
We've got a book signing.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:03.030
Make sure you grab a book.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.550
I think they take credit card,
perhaps even Google Wallet.

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:06.100
Who knows?

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:06.990
So we didn't have--

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:08.560
AASIF MANDVI: You're putting
$10 with a credit card?

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.570
Just, come on.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.869
You just give him the $10.

00:44:11.869 --> 00:44:13.910
MALE SPEAKER: So any
questions from the audience?

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:14.860
AASIF MANDVI: Yeah.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.970
Right here.

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:16.920
MALE SPEAKER: Repeat
the question for--

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.836
AASIF MANDVI: Ah, yes.

00:44:17.836 --> 00:44:20.450
So she said, why do people
agree to do interviews

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.600
when they are going to get,
I think you used the term,

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.550
"hosed?"

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:30.260
I think people
have things to say.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.390
People are passionate
about what they believe.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:34.464
And, look.

00:44:34.464 --> 00:44:35.880
Sometimes, we're
talking to people

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.505
that no one else is
willing to talk to.

00:44:37.505 --> 00:44:38.810
Let's face it.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:42.220
But sometimes, I think it's
honestly that people really

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.270
do feel passionately
about certain things.

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.270
And going back to
the Don Yelton thing,

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:50.560
I don't think he realized
that he was being racist.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.350
I think he thought he was
being honest and revealing

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:58.290
some real honesty
about the whole thing,

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:02.400
not realizing that he was
coming off as a complete racist.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.860
And so I think
people don't always

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.740
realize how the
thoughts in their head

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.470
sound when they come
out of their mouth.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:17.450
And I talked to a woman once
who tried to convince me

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:21.250
that one in five
Muslims was a terrorist.

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:23.530
And then she said, do the math.

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:25.750
And so I did.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:30.129
And it would make about
500 million terrorists.

00:45:30.129 --> 00:45:31.670
And I thought to
myself, why the fuck

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:32.930
has it taken us so long then?

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:37.720
If we have that many
people working for us?

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.090
Jesus, we are the worst!

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.040
But things like that.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:49.060
And then she was amazed
that she was getting threats

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.760
from people when
that piece aired.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.245
And not from Muslims, from
like liberal white people who

00:45:53.245 --> 00:45:54.550
were like, you can't say that.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:55.700
That's just not true.

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.450
So I think people just
don't realize sometimes.

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:00.080
Yeah?

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:00.950
How the work?

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:09.350
Well, I think theater is a great
grounding, base level education

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:13.350
in terms of acting
and [INAUDIBLE] now.

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:18.230
Even in "The Daily Show."

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:22.062
For example, people always
think, oh, Aasif Mandvi--

00:46:22.062 --> 00:46:23.770
you're just yourself
on "The Daily Show."

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.720
But I'm actually not myself.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.830
I consider myself
playing a character who

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:33.430
happens to have my
name, and a whole team

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:38.407
of Jewish writers who can
travel with him wherever he goes

00:46:38.407 --> 00:46:40.240
and a greenscreen that
he walks around with.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:45.160
But the thing is that it
was a great education.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.950
Theater was a great
place to start.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:51.810
Because if you
can do theater, it

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:56.584
teaches you everything about how
to be on television and film.

00:46:56.584 --> 00:46:58.000
You can't always
do the other way.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.810
You see film actors or TV
actors trying to do theater,

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.510
and they fail.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:07.400
But from theater to
television, I think often,

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.410
it gives you the tools.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:15.420
And playwriting, just in
terms of how a scene can work,

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.125
and what makes.

00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:16.750
And it's great.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.870
Because on the brink, I'm
actually a co-producer

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.860
and a writer on
the show, as well.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.390
And so it's been
really great to be

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:30.510
able to work with those
writers on a TV show.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:33.580
And a lot of those guys
are playwrights as well,

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:36.930
who have transitioned
into television writing.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.200
In fact, a lot of the
great television writers

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.180
today started as playwrights.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.240
Lewis Black started
as a playwright.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.800
Not a lot of you knew that.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.770
That's one to grow on.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:49.850
There you go.

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:50.470
Yes?

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:51.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.100
Is this working?

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:52.520
Hello?

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:52.810
Yes?

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:53.310
OK.

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.289
So I had a question
about "The Internship."

00:47:56.289 --> 00:47:57.830
I was actually a
Google intern, and I

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.219
want to say that it's
wildly inaccurate.

00:48:00.219 --> 00:48:01.510
AASIF MANDVI: Good, good, good.

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:02.232
Yes?

00:48:02.232 --> 00:48:03.690
AUDIENCE: And I
was wondering how--

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:05.540
AASIF MANDVI: I didn't
write it, by the way.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.690
AUDIENCE: Has that
changed your opinion?

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:09.480
Like being here today
also, how has that

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.480
affected your opinion of
what Google is, and did

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.190
you like think of
it differently?

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:14.440
AASIF MANDVI: I don't see
anybody doing a lick of work

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.340
on this campus.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.470
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:21.040
AASIF MANDVI: Here's
what I've seen.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.060
I've seen volleyball.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:26.380
I've seen people stuffing
their faces with food.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.890
Everyone's got a takeout
container, wherever they go.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:33.820
And I've seen people just
riding their bicycles.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.390
It's like a daycamp.

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:36.847
It's like a retreat.

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.680
AUDIENCE: It's like a
playground for adults.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.721
AASIF MANDVI: It is, yes.

00:48:39.721 --> 00:48:44.093
I have not seen one
person coding, nowhere.

00:48:45.958 --> 00:48:48.208
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you told
him to shut his computer.

00:48:51.312 --> 00:48:53.520
AASIF MANDVI: Of course,
the one overachieving Indian

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.230
is like, I was coding!

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:57.725
I've been coding all day!

00:48:57.725 --> 00:48:58.600
You were on Facebook.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.548
You were tweeting, I'm sitting
in [INAUDIBLE] right now.

00:49:05.548 --> 00:49:06.970
No.

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:08.080
But what did you say?

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.720
Has it changed my opinion?

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.690
Not one iota, no.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:13.620
It was a movie.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:17.350
And so obviously, there
were wild inaccuracies

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:20.550
needed in it to tell the story.

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.480
But did you guys all
have to watch the movie?

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.630
Was it a mandatory thing?

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.400
They were like,
now, we will again,

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.560
have our next screening
of, "The Internship."

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.210
You will get an F for the
semester if you don't watch it.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:38.190
AUDIENCE: So you had said
that when you came to the UK,

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:42.730
you obviously were not
treated equally like others.

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:46.330
Did you feel like you
became equal at some point?

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:50.477
Or did you have to come to
America for you to feel equal?

00:49:50.477 --> 00:49:52.060
AASIF MANDVI: Did I
feel like I became

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.290
equal when I got to America?

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:55.290
You haven't been in America
very long, have you?

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:04.470
Look-- from my perspective,
there is much more

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:07.520
representation of South
Asians in the media,

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:12.480
and on television, and
in general out there.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.750
Do we still have a long
way to go in terms of that?

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:15.640
Yeah.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.730
Look, at the end of the
day, Hollywood still

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:19.780
prefers white people.

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.750
They're easier to
light, apparently.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:31.730
You don't need all
those gobos and things.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:39.990
But look, we are a technological
milestone in the history,

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:41.830
and this place is
full of Indian people.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:45.130
So I consider that a
little bit of a victory.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:46.906
AUDIENCE: I don't
mean as a group.

00:50:46.906 --> 00:50:48.530
AASIF MANDVI: Right,
you mean personal.

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:49.457
AUDIENCE: I mean you.

00:50:49.457 --> 00:50:50.790
AASIF MANDVI: Here's what I did.

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:56.360
I got on TV, and then that
is the great equalizer

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.940
in terms of having a platform
to be able to say things.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:04.763
Even the fact that you guys are
listening to me talk right now.

00:51:04.763 --> 00:51:09.270
But in a larger
cultural context,

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:14.720
do I still deal with racism,
and all of that stuff?

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.200
Yes, absolutely.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.550
But I think,
hopefully, now what I

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:25.460
do is, I just show them
my "Daily Show" card

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.110
and get right through security.

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.489
Yes, right here.

00:51:31.489 --> 00:51:32.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:34.671
So I'm also a child
of immigrants.

00:51:34.671 --> 00:51:35.670
AASIF MANDVI: Yes, good.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:36.230
Good.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:37.670
AUDIENCE: Trinidadian
immigrants.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:39.480
So West Indian, not East Indian.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.500
AASIF MANDVI: Well, "The Mystic
Masseur" was set in Trinidad.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah, Naipaul.

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:43.150
AASIF MANDVI: And I
had to do a Trinidadian

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:44.067
accent for that movie.

00:51:44.067 --> 00:51:44.816
AUDIENCE: Did you?

00:51:44.816 --> 00:51:46.460
AASIF MANDVI: Do you
do a Trini accent?

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.340
AUDIENCE: See, don't
put me on the spot.

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.000
AASIF MANDVI: Come on.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
AUDIENCE: I can't do it.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.920
AASIF MANDVI: I'll do
mine if you do yours.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.003
AUDIENCE: I can't do that.

00:51:52.003 --> 00:51:52.599
I can't do it.

00:51:52.599 --> 00:51:54.140
AASIF MANDVI: (TRINI
ACCENT) Ya don't

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.360
like to do that Trini accent?

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:55.860
No?

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:56.245
Come on!

00:51:56.245 --> 00:51:57.860
AUDIENCE: (TRINI
ACCENT) Oh, well now.

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.250
AASIF MANDVI: (TRINI
ACCENT) Oh, now.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:01.000
AUDIENCE: OK, OK.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:01.700
I see it.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.116
AASIF MANDVI:
(TRINI ACCENT) Never

00:52:03.116 --> 00:52:05.260
call, you never call to
say, cat, how you is dog?

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.676
AUDIENCE: (TRINI
ACCENT) You can't

00:52:06.676 --> 00:52:09.790
do a Trini accent like me.

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:11.535
AASIF MANDVI: Nice, nice.

00:52:11.535 --> 00:52:13.160
AUDIENCE: And I also
moved around a lot

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.290
once I moved to America.

00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:17.270
So I was wondering,
did you ever reconcile

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:19.870
all of those different
pieces and parts of yourself

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.090
into one single identity?

00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:23.720
Or do you still think
of it as, well, there

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.530
are just multiple
parts to my identity.

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:29.620
AASIF MANDVI: I think
the multiplicity becomes

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.494
the source of where your
creativity comes from,

00:52:32.494 --> 00:52:34.660
where your power comes from,
where all of that stuff

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:36.770
comes from.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:40.010
I'm jealous of people
who are one thing

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:44.930
and can identify with
that one thing as them.

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.000
I've never felt that.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.500
So the multiplicity
and the shapeshifting

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:53.070
has always been my source
of power and creativity.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:57.140
So it took me a
long time to realize

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.250
that was a positive,
and not a negative.

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:07.900
But once I got there, I realize
that now, that is what I do.

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:09.111
Good question, good question.

00:53:09.111 --> 00:53:11.610
See now, those are the kinds
of questions we're looking for.

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:12.990
No, I'm kidding.

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.980
Anybody else?

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:14.590
AUDIENCE: There's
time for one more.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:15.674
AASIF MANDVI: Right there.

00:53:15.674 --> 00:53:17.714
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
what your thoughts were

00:53:17.714 --> 00:53:18.990
on colorblind casting.

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:21.130
I know that "Grey's Anatomy's"
a show that they've mentioned.

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:22.350
It's a thing I was
wondering if you

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:23.610
think it's the
future of casting.

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:24.985
AASIF MANDVI:
Colorblind casting?

00:53:24.985 --> 00:53:29.824
Like you mean anybody, any
ethnicity can play any role?

00:53:29.824 --> 00:53:31.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
so they don't have

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:35.010
a typical look
for the character.

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:38.859
AASIF MANDVI: Listen, that is, I
think, the tapestry of America.

00:53:38.859 --> 00:53:40.650
I don't think we're
going to get to a place

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:48.265
where we will have-- unless,
maybe they could probably

00:53:48.265 --> 00:53:49.390
do it if they were adopted.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:51.540
I was going to say, brown
parents with white kids.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.400
But you could do that
in a certain scenario.

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:58.620
But I think in terms of,
there are roles out there

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.040
that anybody can
play, in terms of,

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.770
it doesn't matter what
ethnicity you are?

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.980
I don't think we are there yet.

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.720
But there are still more
roles for white people

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.600
than anybody else.

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:16.964
And there's always that one
role for the brown person.

00:54:16.964 --> 00:54:19.005
I was just having this
conversation earlier today

00:54:19.005 --> 00:54:20.750
with someone where
it was like, there's

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:26.260
one role for a brown person
and 50 roles for white people.

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.510
So that still exists.

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:28.860
And hopefully, that will change.

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:32.570
And Shonda Rhimes is
someone who is actually

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:34.950
pushing the boundaries of
that, pushing the envelope.

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:36.325
And this is why
I've always said,

00:54:36.325 --> 00:54:40.350
we need more ethnic, or at
least minority immigrant,

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:45.240
whatever you want to call it--
writers, producers, creators

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.970
out there, and people who are
shaping the culture in the way

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:51.260
that Google is.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:53.720
Because ultimately, those
things get reflected back

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:58.705
into the media and into the
larger society as a whole.

00:54:58.705 --> 00:55:00.080
Let's face it;
one of the reasons

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.420
I was cast in "The Internship"
as the head of the Google

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.560
intern program, and
I'm South Asian,

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:10.680
is because you guys
are here at Google.

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:15.090
And so that representation
needs to be shown.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:19.037
If that movie had been
made 20 years ago,

00:55:19.037 --> 00:55:20.370
there would have been no Google.

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:23.650
But if it was a
movie like that, it

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:25.860
would've been a white
guy in that role playing

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:27.550
the boss, as it were.

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:31.910
So I think that, for me,
personally, was something

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:34.560
that I benefited from
in terms of the larger

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.244
cultural visibility.

00:55:38.244 --> 00:55:39.910
MALE SPEAKER: A great
message to end on.

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:40.819
We are out of time.

00:55:40.819 --> 00:55:42.110
But we do have a book signing--

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:42.943
AASIF MANDVI: We do.

00:55:42.943 --> 00:55:44.680
MALE SPEAKER: --for
"No Land's Man."

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.040
AASIF MANDVI: "No Land's Man."

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.710
MALE SPEAKER: I think it's going
on sale within a couple days.

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:48.925
We've got some early
advanced copies.

00:55:48.925 --> 00:55:49.710
AASIF MANDVI: You've got
some advanced copies.

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:52.375
It actually goes officially
on sale on November 4th.

00:55:52.375 --> 00:55:55.340
If you don't get one
today, you can preorder it

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:56.800
on wherever preorders happen.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.345
MALE SPEAKER: And then when
does "The Brink" come out

00:55:58.345 --> 00:55:58.630
next season?

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:00.090
AASIF MANDVI: "The Brink"
comes out next year.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:00.820
MALE SPEAKER: Next year?

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.170
AASIF MANDVI: Yes.

00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:03.020
So they'll all be
on HBO next year.

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.800
And then I'll be back on
"The Daily Show" this fall.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.700
MALE SPEAKER: Let's hear
it for Aasif Mandvi.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.116
AASIF MANDVI: Thank
you very much.

00:56:08.116 --> 00:56:10.950
[APPLAUSE]
