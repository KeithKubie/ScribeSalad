&gt;&gt; Okay.
So I think the question is wrongly asked because

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.070
India is already a
superpower.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.619
So the question is not really if India will
become a superpower.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:20.320
It's already a superpower.
The question is more when this will be -- the

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.759
world will be aware of
that and India will be aware of its potential

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:25.849
as a superpower.
