so what about 30 years ago and I used to

so what about 30 years ago and I used to
always say whenever I talk about the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.430
always say whenever I talk about the
 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.320
always say whenever I talk about the
past I take everything I say is unbiased

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
past I take everything I say is unbiased
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.100
past I take everything I say is unbiased
and I take my inspiration from a famous

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110
and I take my inspiration from a famous
 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.769
and I take my inspiration from a famous
book called the unbiased history of the

things that I would like to emphasize

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760
things that I would like to emphasize
 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.640
things that I would like to emphasize
one is that aids really is a new disease

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
one is that aids really is a new disease
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.900
one is that aids really is a new disease
secondly that it's complicated and

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910
secondly that it's complicated and
 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.340
secondly that it's complicated and
thirdly that people are the most

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350
thirdly that people are the most
 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.920
thirdly that people are the most
important things so what I mean when

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930
important things so what I mean when
 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.840
important things so what I mean when
it's a new disease is not really when

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850
it's a new disease is not really when
 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.590
it's a new disease is not really when
when was the first infection transmitted

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600
when was the first infection transmitted
 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.450
when was the first infection transmitted
from a chimpanzee to a human which we

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460
from a chimpanzee to a human which we
 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.750
from a chimpanzee to a human which we
now know it was perhaps many decades ago

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760
now know it was perhaps many decades ago
 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.760

but really when did it start to occur

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010
but really when did it start to occur
 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.830
but really when did it start to occur
with any frequency or any importance

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840
with any frequency or any importance
 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.580

anywhere and those early days in 1981 it
 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.130
anywhere and those early days in 1981 it
was a very uncommon occurrence to have

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140
was a very uncommon occurrence to have
 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.959

HIV and the United States was one of the

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670
HIV and the United States was one of the
 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.350
HIV and the United States was one of the
first first world or developed countries

had no infections in no cases even in
 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.650
had no infections in no cases even in
the early 1980s and now we have

the early 1980s and now we have
 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.910
the early 1980s and now we have
something which is the fourth leading

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920
something which is the fourth leading
 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.370
something which is the fourth leading
cause of death in the world and looks

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380
cause of death in the world and looks
 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.080
cause of death in the world and looks
like it's going to be here to stay for

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090
like it's going to be here to stay for
 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.930

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440
death in Africa the fourth leading cause
 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.740
death in Africa the fourth leading cause
of death in the world over a million

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750
of death in the world over a million
 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.570

a half a million deaths in the United
 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.729
a half a million deaths in the United
States and it really is brand-new the

States and it really is brand-new the
 

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:46.559

other thing is that it's so complicated

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569
other thing is that it's so complicated
 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.100
other thing is that it's so complicated
and we spend a lot of time as scientists

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110

difficult to understand why everybody

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160
difficult to understand why everybody
 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.220
difficult to understand why everybody
isn't tested why everybody isn't treated

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230
isn't tested why everybody isn't treated

it is easy to understand but in every
 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.250

difficult in many churches because they
simply don't do it but it's a very

simply don't do it but it's a very
 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.280
simply don't do it but it's a very
complicated problem and it has to be

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290
complicated problem and it has to be
 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.860
complicated problem and it has to be
dealt with is complexity and that

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870
dealt with is complexity and that
 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.100
