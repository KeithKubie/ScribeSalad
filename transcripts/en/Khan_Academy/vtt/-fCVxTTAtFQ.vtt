00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.694
LeBron: It's LeBron here. I got
a quick brain teaser for you.

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:07.076
If I'm down 3 with 30 seconds left

00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:09.029
is it better to take the 3?

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.230
Or is it easier to take
the 2 and attempt to fowl a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.197
bad free throw shooter and
get another possession?

00:00:15.197 --> 00:00:18.096
Here's my friend Sal with an answer.

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:21.697
Sal: That's a very very
interesting question, LeBron.

00:00:21.697 --> 00:00:24.139
Calculating the probabilities
of if you were to take a 3

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:25.954
what's your probability of tying the game

00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:27.442
and then being able to win in overtime

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:29.199
that can be done on paper

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.231
but the scenario where you take
a 2 and you attempt to fowl

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:34.445
the opposing team and
they might make none or 1

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:36.810
or two free-throws and then
you might get another posession

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.971
and then you take another 2

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.171
That's more complicated. You
could attempt to do it on paper

00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:43.407
but instead, I've written a
little computer simulation here

00:00:43.407 --> 00:00:46.972
and this type of a simulation is called
a Monte-Carlo simulation and literally,

00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:49.696
it'll run the scenarios and
it will do it as many times

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:52.844
as we put in this variable over
here. So we're gonna set it up

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.174
so we get an accurate number.
We're gonna do it a THOUSAND times

00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:58.798
for each of those scenarios and
see what fraction in each scenario

00:00:58.798 --> 00:01:02.365
which fraction do we end up winning?
And that's a pretty good estimate

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:05.450
of the probability of us
actually winning the game

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.030
depending on which strategy we choose.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.804
The rest of these things, these
variables that we set right over here

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:14.605
these are the parameters
that will essentially drive

00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:17.279
the outcomes. This three-point
percentage, this is your

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.774
three-point percentage, I have
it low here because I'm assuming

00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:22.231
it's going to be a hard 3.
It's going to be lower than

00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:24.530
a typical 3 point percentage.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.844
But obviously if this
number, if you set it higher

00:01:25.844 --> 00:01:27.947
than the three will look
better. If you set it lower

00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:29.576
than the 2 is going to look better.

00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:32.357
This is your 2 point
percentage. I'm assuming here

00:01:32.357 --> 00:01:35.128
it's going to be a relatively
easy 2 because the other

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.698
team isn't going to be defending
as heavily against a 2.

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:40.664
So I put it a little higher but
you can play with the numbers

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:42.809
to see what you get in
different scenarios.

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:46.309
This is the probability of
the opponent taking a 2,

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:47.822
this is the opponent's
free-throw percentage.

00:01:47.822 --> 00:01:50.087
Once again if this is very
high than the fowling is not

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:53.211
going to look as good. If this is
low the fowling might make sense.

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:55.792
And I put this a little bit
lower than the league average

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:58.370
because I'm assuming
you'll attempt to fowl

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.714
or you have a reasonable chance of fowling
one of the weaker free-throw shooters.

00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:04.214
This is how much time goes off
the clock when you take a 2

00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:09.375
This is how long it takes you to
fowl. This is offensive rebound

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:10.270
percentage. And then I have a slightly

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.017
different thing that I separated out is

00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:17.637
the, the percent chance of
a team taking a free-throw.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.898
If they miss their second free-throw the
percent chance that they'll actually be

00:02:20.898 --> 00:02:23.690
able to rebound it. So that's
15% you can play with that

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.140
And this is just a probability,or
your percent chance of

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.352
winning in overtime. And
I just put that at 50/50

00:02:29.352 --> 00:02:32.074
and the rest of this really
just uses those parameters

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:34.938
to go through the simulations.
This is a little code

00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:37.943
right over here just to draw the
background or actually load the images

00:02:37.943 --> 00:02:40.609
This is the meat. These two functions.

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.835
So take 3 is a scenario
where we go for the 3.

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:46.187
So we try to make the 3,
if we make the 3 then we

00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:49.185
have essentially tied the game
and now we're going into overtime

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:51.798
and if we win in overtime, then we win!

00:02:51.798 --> 00:02:53.628
If neither of those things are true,

00:02:53.628 --> 00:02:55.185
or if one of those things
end up not being true

00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:57.235
either we make the 3 and
we lose in overtime, or we

00:02:57.235 --> 00:03:00.357
don't make the 3, then
false, we didn't win.

00:03:00.357 --> 00:03:03.109
And this function is going to
be called as many times as that

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.138
variable trials. So it could
be called a thousand times

00:03:05.138 --> 00:03:07.467
a million times, whatever we
set it to, to figure out what

00:03:07.467 --> 00:03:09.688
fraction of the scenarios do we win in?

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:13.963
This does the same thing for the
taking the 2 and trying to fowl.

00:03:13.963 --> 00:03:16.690
It gets a little bit more
complicated but it's not too bad.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.328
And it's a very simple simulation, I
think a lot of people listening might

00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:23.718
be able to add some,
little bit more complexity

00:03:23.718 --> 00:03:26.048
to maybe make it a
little bit more accurate.

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:28.330
But what it does, it keeps
of who has the posession,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.722
how many points you're
down,how much time is left,

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:33.721
and the way I implimented it, it
really only works for specific

00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:35.716
scenario we talked about. You would
probably want to make it fancier

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.268
if you had more time on
the clock or if you wanted

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:43.121
to cover more scenarios of different

00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.140
point spreads. But this
is essentially saying,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.463
look, while we're gonna
keep running this scenario,

00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:51.094
while there's time left on the
clock, this clause is talking about

00:03:51.094 --> 00:03:53.017
what do we do if we have the possession?

00:03:53.017 --> 00:03:58.465
If we're down by more than 3,
then we're gonna want to take

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.041
it as quickly as possible and
we just take the minimum time

00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:05.087
off necessary to shoot a 2.
Otherwise, we would acutally

00:04:05.117 --> 00:04:07.517
want to run down the
clock. So if we happened,

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.594
for whatever reason while going
through this over and over again

00:04:09.594 --> 00:04:12.395
to be up, we would probably
want to run the clock down

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.760
before we take a shot. Now
this right over here says,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.923
remember, this is a scenario
where we're taking a 2,

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:21.666
so this says, okay, lets try
to go for the 2 if we make it,

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:26.726
then we're down by 2 less. And then we,
the possession goes to the other team.

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:33.222
If we do not make it, does
the opposing team rebound it?

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:35.801
So this is essentially
saying, if the opposing team

00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:38.416
makes the rebound, so we
did not make the offensive

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:41.501
rebound, then they now
have the possession.

00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:45.895
This clause over is, what about the
cases where we don't have the possession?

00:04:45.895 --> 00:04:52.368
This is essentially what we say
if we're down by a more than

00:04:52.368 --> 00:04:55.425
zero points than we're
going to try to fowl.

00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:57.925
We're going to take the
time off the clock to fowl.

00:04:57.925 --> 00:05:02.146
Then the opponent is going
to take their two free-throws

00:05:02.146 --> 00:05:04.402
right over here, and there's
a little bit of code to see

00:05:04.402 --> 00:05:08.897
if in the situation that they
missed the second free-throw,

00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:12.202
there's some probability that
the opponant might actually

00:05:12.202 --> 00:05:15.493
be able to get the offensive rebound, so
we actually put that in there as well.

00:05:15.493 --> 00:05:21.282
Then there's the scenarios where
maybe we just happen not to be down,

00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:26.948
in which case, the opponent
is likely to take a 2.

00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:29.278
At least we assume that.
This is a case where I think

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:32.118
other people could modify
it more. The bottom line is

00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:35.892
if we're not down, we
definitely do not want to fowl.

00:05:35.892 --> 00:05:38.162
So we're not fowling in this scenario.

00:05:38.162 --> 00:05:41.268
Remember, we're in this 2 point scenario.

00:05:41.268 --> 00:05:45.201
This essentially says,
look, when the clock ends,

00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:48.225
when time goes to zero, if
we're down by more than zero

00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:50.278
we lost. If we're down by
less than zero, we won.

00:05:50.278 --> 00:05:54.068
Otherwise, it's tied
and we go into overtime.

00:05:54.068 --> 00:05:58.832
So this clause right over here
tests to see if we win in overtime.

00:05:58.832 --> 00:06:01.059
All of the other things
are really just to draw.

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:03.802
This draws the bars, this draws
some of the numbers on top of it

00:06:03.802 --> 00:06:07.355
Then, this is we actually run the trial.

00:06:07.355 --> 00:06:10.633
So we call this as many
times as there are trials

00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:13.256
that trials variables, and
we count how many times

00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:15.633
do we win taking a 3? How many
times do we lose taking a 3?

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:18.292
How many times do we win
taking a 2? How many times

00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:22.353
lose taking a 2? Then we just
display everything right over there.

00:06:22.353 --> 00:06:25.767
Now that we have a decent
understanding of the program

00:06:25.767 --> 00:06:29.066
itself, let's get a
little bit of a drumroll,

00:06:29.066 --> 00:06:31.061
and see whether it makes
sense to take the 3,

00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:33.032
given these assumptions.
Instead of having ten trials

00:06:33.032 --> 00:06:35.736
let's give it a big number.
Let's say a thousand trials,

00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:39.047
let me reset this this thing.
So restart it right over here.

00:06:39.047 --> 00:06:42.629
You see its getting better approximations.

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:45.794
This is what fraction of
the trial so far resulted in

00:06:45.794 --> 00:06:48.592
a victory. So right now taking
a 2, looks like it's about

00:06:48.592 --> 00:06:54.049
15-16%, looks like we got
a victory. Here its 12-13%

00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:56.547
As we got more and more trials
we're more likely to have

00:06:56.547 --> 00:07:00.901
a much much more accurate
sense of our probabilities.

00:07:00.901 --> 00:07:02.992
A more accurate approximation
of the probabilities.

00:07:02.992 --> 00:07:06.157
But let's see, it's getting close...

00:07:06.157 --> 00:07:15.546
And we get... 2. Well based on
this, it looks like there's...

00:07:15.546 --> 00:07:17.956
Based on the assumptions that
we made, and this is important,

00:07:17.956 --> 00:07:20.290
based on these assumptions, it
looks like we were better off

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.545
by a little bit, slightly higher,
taking the easy 2 then trying to fowl.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:28.590
But if we change things, and
I'll make it lower trials

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.714
so that we don't have to wait all
day, let's make it 300 trials,

00:07:32.714 --> 00:07:35.762
if you were to raise your
3 point percentage to say,

00:07:35.762 --> 00:07:40.376
let's say it's 35% and let's
say the 2 is much harder

00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:43.792
than we had before, let's
say its 40% and let's say

00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:45.994
your opponent is a really
good free-throw shooter

00:07:45.994 --> 00:07:50.506
so let's say it's 80%, I suspect that
you will have a different outcome.

00:07:50.506 --> 00:07:53.400
Let's restart it and see what happens.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.925
Now all of a sudden, it looks
like you're much better off

00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:03.999
given these assumptions. You're much
better off going for the 3 to tie.

00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:07.212
and go into overtime. So these
are really the assumptions

00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:11.000
that drive it for this simulation.
