00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:12.487
A hostile artificial intelligence called 
NIM has taken over the world’s computers.

00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:15.535
You’re the only person skilled 
enough to shut it down,

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:17.888
and you’ll only have one chance.

00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:20.115
You’ve broken into NIM’s secret lab,

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:25.484
and now you’re floating in a raft on top 
of 25 stories of electrified water.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:28.465
You’ve rigged up a remote 
that can lower the water level

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:31.908
by ejecting it from grates 
in the sides of the room.

00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:34.232
If you can lower the water level to 0,

00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:36.192
you can hit the manual override,

00:00:36.192 --> 00:00:37.328
shut NIM off,

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.643
and save the day.

00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:43.170
However, the AI knows that you’re here,
and it can lower the water level, too,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.706
by sucking it through a trapdoor 
at the bottom of the lab.

00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:49.742
If NIM is the one to lower 
the water level to 0,

00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:51.587
you’ll be sucked out of the lab,

00:00:51.587 --> 00:00:53.545
resulting in a failed mission.

00:00:53.545 --> 00:00:57.449
Control over water drainage 
alternates between you and NIM,

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.292
and neither can skip a turn.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.346
Each of you can lower the water level 
by exactly 1,

00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:03.034
3,

00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:05.158
or 4 stories at a time.

00:01:05.158 --> 00:01:08.223
Whoever gets the level
exactly to 0 on their turn

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:10.435
will win this deadly duel.

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:13.613
Note that neither of you can lower 
the water below 0;

00:01:13.613 --> 00:01:15.186
if the water level is at 2,

00:01:15.186 --> 00:01:19.034
then the only move is to lower 
the water level 1 story.

00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:23.821
You know that NIM has already computed 
all possible outcomes of the contest,

00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.550
and will play in a way that maximizes 
its chance of success.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.060
You go first.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.661
How can you survive 
and shut off the artificial intelligence?

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:36.566
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:37.921
Answer in: 3

00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:38.992
Answer in: 2

00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:40.411
Answer in: 1

00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:44.829
You can’t leave anything up to chance -
NIM will take any advantage it can get.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.905
And you’ll need to have a response 
to any possible move it makes.

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:53.370
The trick here is to start from where 
you want to end and work backwards.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.341
You want to be the one to lower 
the water level to 0,

00:01:56.341 --> 00:02:00.120
which means you need the water level 
to be at 1, 3, or 4

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.286
when control switches to you.

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:03.904
If the water level were at 2,

00:02:03.904 --> 00:02:07.068
your only option would be
to lower it 1 story,

00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:09.760
which would lead 
to NIM making the winning move.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.935
If we color code the water levels,

00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:14.572
we can see a simple principle at play:

00:02:14.572 --> 00:02:16.632
there are “losing” levels like 2,

00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:21.482
where no matter what whoever starts 
their turn there does, they’ll lose.

00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:24.883
And there are winning levels,
where whoever starts their turn there

00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:28.859
can either win or leave their opponent 
with a losing level.

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.260
So not only are 1, 3, 
and 4 winning levels,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.533
but so are 5 and 6,

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:37.713
since you can send your opponent 
to 2 from there.

00:02:37.713 --> 00:02:39.529
What about 7?

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.174
From 7, all possible moves would 
send your opponent to a winning level,

00:02:44.174 --> 00:02:46.724
making this another losing level.

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:50.258
And we can continue up 
the lab in this way.

00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:55.456
If you start your turn 1, 3,
or 4 levels above a losing level,

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:57.524
then you’re at a winning level.

00:02:57.524 --> 00:03:00.273
Otherwise, you’re destined to lose.

00:03:00.273 --> 00:03:03.766
You could continue like this 
all the way to level 25.

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.520
But as a shortcut,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.575
you might notice that levels 8 through 11
are colored identically to 1 through 4.

00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:16.416
Since a level’s color is determined by
the levels 1, 3, and 4 stories below it,

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:20.746
this means that level 12 
will be the same color as level 5,

00:03:20.746 --> 00:03:22.365
13 will match 6,

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:25.323
14 will match 7, and so on,

00:03:25.323 --> 00:03:29.732
In particular, the losing levels 
will always be multiple of 7,

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:32.257
and two greater than multiples of 7.

00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:35.529
Now, from your original 
starting level of 25,

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:40.663
you have to make sure your opponent starts
on a losing level every single turn—

00:03:40.663 --> 00:03:43.344
if NIM starts on a winning level 
even once,

00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:45.375
it’s game over for you.

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:50.732
So your only choice on turn 1 
is to lower the water level by 4 stories.

00:03:50.732 --> 00:03:52.757
No matter what the AI does,

00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:55.549
you can continue giving it losing levels

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.364
until you reach 0 
and trigger the manual override.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.475
And with that, the crisis is averted.

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:05.852
Now, back to a less stressful 
kind of surfing.
