1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,200
Jad, Robert, Radiolab. Are
these all 24 amendments?

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,000
Do you have songs? Oh my friend. Did
you say 24 amendments are the 26?

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:15,340
I don't know how many there were
there. 27, 27 of you. Of all people.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,060
I thought we'd know that. I know where
they re they add one every so often. So,

5
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,760
okay, let me explain this. Let me
explain this project for you. Okay. Okay.

6
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:26,530
So a more perfect now is
entering its third season, right?

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,373
Yay.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,240
The first two seasons,
what were they? They were,

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,700
they were extended investigative, uh,

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,410
highly reported and researched and
elaborated stories about the supreme court

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,620
cases in front of the screen. Yeah.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,480
But the idea was of more perfect cause
always broader than just the court.

13
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:49,691
I mean,

14
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:53,950
the idea is to look at the argument that
just so happens to happen at the court

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,510
and in the process of America sort of
trying to try to claw its way out of the

16
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:03,490
muck to get to higher ideals.
Now those ideals of course,

17
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:05,500
are outlined in the constitution,

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,430
which has been amended 27 times in
ways that are crucially important.

19
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,180
Especially right now. And uh,

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,530
most Americans can't name
more than one or two of them.

21
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:21,970
I was one of those people
before more perfect. And so, uh,

22
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:26,320
when I was on my break, I
had this idea, crazy idea,

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,660
which was could we make an album?

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,430
Could we make a school house rock for
the 21st century that reanimated these

25
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:36,310
amendments. Oh, a lot
of times aspiration. Oh,

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,990
well it's like you got to go big, right?
That's a very didactic thing like that.

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,020
In those songs you actually are told
exactly how to feel about the concert.

28
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,980
I'm just a bill. Yes.

29
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:52,050
I'm only a bill and I'm
sitting here on Capitol Hill.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,081
Yes.

31
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:57,340
But the idea was could we take the spirit
of it but not like didactic in the way

32
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:58,121
the old stuff was.

33
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:01,420
But like taking these things that we had
been covering for two seasons with the

34
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,510
amendments of the constitution,
the bill of rights one through 10,

35
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:08,810
the other ones from 11 to
27, uh, taking them and, and,

36
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,860
and because they're so stodgy
and musty, like the language,

37
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:14,770
some of them are really
opaque. Yeah. I mean,

38
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:18,550
and so the idea was could we take
these stuffy, stodgy, sometimes opaque,

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,690
deeply important, uh,

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,810
words and bring them to life.

41
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,870
So we reached out to a ton of
different musicians and ask them like,

42
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,990
would you interpret these amendments? Uh,

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,700
you can talk explicitly about
the amendments if you want,

44
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:34,920
or you can turn it into
something very personal to you.

45
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,590
What could they do it
though? Let me, I don't know.

46
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,290
Let me just play you a couple of, let
me see me. Let me wish I play one.

47
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,980
Should I choose one? Choose one? Yeah.
Okay. I'm going to choose swimming.

48
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:47,250
Suffrage. Which one is that?
That's the 1919 yeah. Oh,

49
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,590
you can show us a good one. You
chose a good one, my friend.

50
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:51,750
Am I going to get musically
first of all? Okay.

51
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,700
You're going to get drum
roll please. Dolly Parton,

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,880
Dolly Parton, Dolly, Dolly Parton

53
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,030
Doll E. Pardon? Or a Dolly puck. The dog

54
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,500
and the tourney dollar
doll hyphen eve. No, no,

55
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:18,220
I was just maybe your middle name. Like
Robert E. Lee. His first cousin please.

56
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,290
No. Sally Martin. Really? Yes.
I'll play a little bit of her song.

57
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,800
August 18th,

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,220
1920 women suffrage and then ratify.

59
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,180
Women have been fighting for the legal
right to vote since the 1840s in 1890 the

60
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:48,351
national American women's
suffrage association in a
w s a was established with

61
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:52,050
Susan B. Anthony is leading force.

62
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,930
Women have been fighting for their
rights since the very beginning of time.

63
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,660
[inaudible] first they said
we couldn't have danced.

64
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,570
Them said we couldn't
drink. Some man allowed it.

65
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,370
They said we couldn't think.
They said we shouldn't speak to.

66
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:20,960
We were spoken to.

67
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,030
There's just so much we were
allowed to do, but the first month,

68
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,900
I'm just reading the truth.
That's when you got smart nuts,

69
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,300
truth, but

70
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,270
we have to fight for women's
rights. They certainly

71
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,290
[inaudible] we can size because of
times marched up and down the streets,

72
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,680
the women's rights walk nesters on
our feet. We got tired of seeing.

73
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,020
Then we can tell how [inaudible] Thrones,

74
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,450
Ali Brown, when women
finally got the right tempo.

75
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,240
So good. There's so many great
turns of phrases in that song.

76
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,470
Wow. Do you want to hear
another one? I mean,

77
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,840
I'm really curious about like a, an
amendment like a technical and member,

78
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:32,030
like the 25th, like what
could you possibly, oh,

79
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,880
let me play the 25th you on
here though. One Oh 25th is the,

80
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:38,660
is the [inaudible] oh, that's very
interesting. This is session one.

81
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,830
The 25th Amendment is the amendment that
that establishes an order of succession

82
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:47,210
if the president can't do his
job. So Devendra Banhart is a, um,

83
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,990
is a sort of a freak folk musician.

84
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,760
He does like sort of psychedelic
folk. Uh, good Tillich folk. It's a,

85
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,020
it's a whole genre. Hello,

86
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,520
my name is Devendra Banhart and I
chose the 25th amendment truths about

87
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:02,354
succession.

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,070
He's an amazing songwriter and he wrote
a really funny song that takes you

89
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:08,570
through the line of succession.

90
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,730
[inaudible] 1600 Washington
DC that we're in on no pony

91
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,640
[inaudible] even though I'm
at the bottom of the beds.

92
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,750
[inaudible] succession,

93
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,160
that's been [inaudible] since
the 17 hundreds till today.

94
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,290
[inaudible].

95
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,290
It all began when the president at a
sudden total awakening that completely

96
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:45,300
rearrange this state of hog [inaudible].

97
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,180
And even worse than a newly grown moral
compass in a developing code of ethics,

98
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,430
they got into [inaudible] [inaudible].

99
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,320
And so at the White House they win
and next came the vice president.

100
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,490
Too much drywall, I have to
sing, Lincoln's Co's float. Oh,

101
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,720
so very distant proving the pole

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,770
[inaudible] and so the speaker
of the House of Representatives,

103
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:17,330
puppets and lead the, due to the
little jobs roles and responsibilities,

104
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:21,500
they rarely spoke. And so
ironically, when it came time to tug,

105
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,890
they clammed up. And so the president

106
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,940
[inaudible] sure.

107
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,270
So what he's doing is he's knocking off
every person who becomes president and

108
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:38,880
then you find that you meet the
next one in the line. And I think,

109
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:39,770
I think the sort of the,

110
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,370
the whole conceit is that everybody
dies and it also ends up with him being

111
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:45,450
president. Wow. So,

112
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:50,210
so some musicians really went to law
books and just look very kid some case.

113
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

114
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,920
Let's try one more where we
just get somebody took the
idea of the amendment and

115
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:59,640
went with a feeling rather than with
the list. Yeah. First Amendment is good.

116
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,790
The First Amendment,
number one, the big one.

117
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,000
[inaudible] let me play that
one after the break. Hi,

118
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,950
this is Ravi calling
from Brooklyn. New York.

123
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Rod this season and more perfect from
w NYC studios might be the most perfect

124
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,383
yet

125
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,280
19th amendment women have been fighting
for the legal right to vote since the

126
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:40,020
1840s. This season we are making
an album featuring, for example,

127
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,730
Dali part an album of songs and stories
inspired by the amendments to the u s

128
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:45,564
constitution.

129
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,920
Listen to more perfect
wherever you get your podcasts.

130
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,370
This is Radiolab.

131
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,650
I'm Jad. I have him. Rod, he
was a rapper. Krulwich uh,

132
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,120
offering up a preview of an experiment
that we're doing for the new season of

133
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:07,070
more perfect, uh, where we
are releasing an album. Uh,

134
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,100
it's called 27 the most perfect album.
You can find it on iTunes and Spotify.

00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:15,360
You can also find all the
songs@themostperfectalbum.org. Now,

136
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,000
on the podcast, uh, we're not
just putting out music, we're,

137
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,940
we're telling stories. We're telling
these sort of funny, quirky, poetic,

138
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,630
sometimes sad, sometimes hilarious, uh,

139
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,270
sort of explainer stories about
each of the 27 amendments.

140
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,680
I think of them as sort of like
audio liner notes for the songs. Uh,

141
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,300
let me play you, uh, the,

142
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,730
the story that we tell in conjunction
with the first amendment in the podcast.

143
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,420
Sorry, Karrie, producer it more
perfect. Created this little story.

144
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,510
I'm gonna drop into the middle of it
where she's talking with a guy named Burt

145
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,090
Neuborne who is a law
professor and he to him,

146
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,540
the first amendment is like a poem.

147
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,340
So let's drop into that one. You'll
hear a reporter Sar Cari, uh,

148
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,700
actor Jeffrey Wright reading
the amendments and professor
Burt Neuborne talking

149
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:03,450
about First Amendment, freedom
of religion, speech, Press,

150
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,960
assembly and petition.
It consists of six ideas.

151
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,100
Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion or

152
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:16,020
prohibiting the free exercise thereof or
abridging the freedom of speech or the

153
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:20,760
press or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble and to petition the

154
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:25,200
government for a redress of grievances.
Six it's only 45 words long.

155
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,910
It could have been written
on the back of an envelope

156
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,871
these days.

157
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:32,871
The first amendment is wrapped up in all
kinds of thorny stuff like kneeling at

158
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:37,530
football games and hate
speech and money in politics.

159
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,100
But if you just step back from all of
that and you read the text of the first

160
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:49,230
amendment and you really try to think
about what the words are trying to say,

161
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,230
you find that the logic behind it is

162
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,330
[inaudible]

163
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,560
kind of beautiful.

164
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,820
And the order of the words in the
first amendment is the lifecycle of a

165
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:00,840
democratic idea.

166
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,733
Here's what he means.

167
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,560
So those first two clauses,

168
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,490
Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion or

169
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:15,380
prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

170
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,890
Create a free space inside your mind
to think and believe as you wish.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,660
That's the founder saying that space
inside your head where you think your

172
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:29,170
thoughts that sacred. The
government can't touch that

173
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,380
without that free space. That
can be no shelf government.

174
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,200
So that's the first idea,
the freedom of your thoughts.

175
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,120
[inaudible]

176
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,460
once you've believed
and thought something,

177
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,310
then bet it's natural for
you to want to say it.

178
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,020
Which brings us to the next clause
or abridging the freedom of speech.

179
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,340
The speech clause says,

180
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,160
if you've got an idea formed
in the freedom of your mind,

181
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,130
by all means go ahead and share it. So
you have the freedom to think of thought,

182
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,720
the freedom to speak that
thought, but that's not a new,

183
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,200
if you really want to make a real
new type of dance in a society,

184
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,380
so you need some way to be able to speak
to one of the mass of people to speak

185
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,400
their really loud voice, which brings
you to the fourth clause for the press,

186
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,910
which is speech amplify.

187
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Then once you've gotten your message
out to a large number of people where

188
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,720
people would listen to these
ideas and move by them,

189
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,980
it's natural for those people to
want to do something about it,

190
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,080
to move together, to organize for
the right of the people piece of it.

191
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,010
[inaudible]

192
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,290
so you can think of thigh,
you can speak that thought.

193
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,110
You can create a movement,
but that's not enough.

194
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,710
Finally, the petition clause,
which is the sixth idea.

195
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,900
The petition clause says once you've
assembled, once you've organized,

196
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,390
just wait up man. The protection
of our curves, the amendment rights

197
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,460
we have, sir, we are sir.

198
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,080
They do have a right to take your argument
to the government and to petition the

199
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,330
government for a redress of grievances.

200
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,950
We can speak for this country
and we demand reform now

201
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,260
forced the government into confronting
it and either accepting or rejecting and

202
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:29,490
then that government, if it says no is
subject to being voted out of office

203
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,060
[inaudible]

204
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,060
so this is Madison giving us
the blueprint for tomorrow.

205
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,343
[inaudible]

206
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,530
when democracy begins

207
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,030
[inaudible]

208
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,030
the way I'm hearing it is like like co
centric circles like starting in inside

209
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,960
the mind of one person and then
like reverberating out. No,

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,631
exactly.

211
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:03,460
The First Amendment is a a series of
concentric circles beginning within your

212
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:08,461
mind and then moving to your closer
acquaintances then to the society at large

213
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,890
and then finally to the entire
polity to the entire people.

214
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,620
I bet that by the way is the only time
in human history that those six ideas

215
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:24,790
have ever been United in
a single taxed. Only time.

216
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,200
I went back and looked at every single
rights bearing document in our tradition

217
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,800
all the way from the magna Carta
through the English bills of rights,

218
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:35,530
through the colonial charters,
through the state constitution,

219
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,260
through the French declaration
of the rights of man.

220
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,500
It's never been done before to put the
six building blocks of democracy together

221
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,440
in a single coherent text.

222
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,230
[inaudible] the first amendment
is the ideal city on the hill.

223
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,590
It is the ideal community that the
founders were trying to establish and

224
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,550
remember, establish for the
first time in human history.

225
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,530
[inaudible] wow. [inaudible] I've
never thought of it that way.

226
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,790
It's a little bit like some kind of a
very thoughtful relay race where each,

227
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,670
as the baton is passed, it's,

228
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,730
it's the next logical step to turning
what is inside you into powerful

229
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:29,600
statements outside of you.

230
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,080
Yeah, so that's a the first
amendment line. Right.

231
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,030
Well, actually, the other
thing about that, about,

232
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:37,600
now that you've got me thinking about
the way that kite described the first

233
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:42,430
amendment as this progression
of ideas, I mean it's, it's,

234
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,780
it just comes almost like just in about
a couple of centuries after people like

235
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:51,730
Shakespeare and Servon Dyson begin
creating interiority like this.

236
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,040
Like they want to ne did,

237
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,100
you really wasn't any place to go to hear
someone talking to herself or himself.

238
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,650
Yeah. And not even a
couple of centuries path.

239
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:04,750
And then you get a government that,

240
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,870
that takes that idea that people have an
interior and that interior is distinct

241
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,400
and needs protection from the
government and then comes this,

242
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,050
this six point flow. Wow. I
never really thought of that.

243
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,850
Yeah, it's a cool idea.
Um, but interestingly,

244
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,170
the song that that's paired
with at, um, on the album,

245
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:30,930
I mean actually if we've got a couple
of different submissions for the first

246
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:34,830
amendment, but one of them came from, uh,

247
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,880
a guy named Joey styles.
He's a native Canadian, uh,

248
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,160
first nation Matisse,
um, hip hop artist. And,

249
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,290
uh, he made a song which sort of argues
with the spirit of Bert newborns take,

250
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,873
um,

251
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,080
he sort of looked at sort
of all the people that have
been left out of that city

252
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:55,914
on the hill.

253
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,820
How my track goes. As part two,

254
00:16:57,821 --> 00:17:02,821
I was dealing with the freedom of religion
from 1870 up until 1934 was legal for

255
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:06,010
native Americans to
practice our ceremonies.

256
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,420
I had in mind specifically the ghost
dance as an 1890 at wounded knee,

257
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,340
150 to 300. Mostly women and children
were massacre for ghost dancing.

258
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,210
And to me that shows they were
scared. They were scared of us,

259
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,760
have in our culture and ceremonies
because they empower us.

260
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,110
I truly hope the warrior spirit shines
on this track on a natural side of being

261
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,440
wild or free sets the tone. Oh,

262
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,693
[inaudible] [inaudible]

263
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,000
where you up to solve for the people? Oh,

264
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,740
now we'll never fear any. This is really,

265
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:21,620
I mean the lyrics and the
musical traces are all not there.

266
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,630
There you really challenge your sense
of the amendment a little bit so that

267
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:32,100
these songs, the way they're written
and the words that have been chosen,

268
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,410
and then when did they
even strike our hall?

269
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:40,310
Either arguments of tempo or arguments
of spirit or arguments of history.

270
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,310
Yeah. I would say 80% of
the songs on the record, um,

271
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,830
are arguments with the amendments rather
than just celebrations or explanations

272
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:55,510
of them. Uh, it's, it's, yeah. Well
this is very interesting. It's cool,

273
00:18:55,511 --> 00:19:00,400
right? Yeah. So a very different
way to do it. Yeah. Um, so that was,

274
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:03,280
this was just a preview it for
years to, to hear more, uh,

275
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,660
go to wherever you get podcasts,
search for more. Perfect. Um, sign up

276
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,470
radiolab.org/more. Perfect.
We'll take you there. Um,

277
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:15,850
if you want to hear the record, it's a
great record. I'm so proud of it. Uh,

278
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:19,780
go to iTunes, Spotify,
wherever, searched for 27,

279
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:20,980
the most perfect album,

280
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:25,981
and you can hear all the songs in
their entirety@themostperfectalbum.org.

281
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,120
Okay. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert
Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
