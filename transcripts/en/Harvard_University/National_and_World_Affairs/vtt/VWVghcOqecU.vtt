00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.060
So this baby has kwashiorkor

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.130
two years and four months old 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.680
so he started getting swollen like that in January

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.530
so this is the typical

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.340
sign of kwashiorkor which is protein
malnutrition

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.560
so this is just

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.950
hunger starvation

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.770
issues

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.230
so any swelling and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.700
edema we call it

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.020
is Kwash and then the dry kind is marasmus.
So the dry kind is the really really

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.180
skinny kids who have like

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.790
the wrinkly skin because they just have
no mass at all

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.150
and it's just

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.760
it's just really a difference in terms of
the balance of how much you're missing 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.500
like the kwash children are missing

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.130
relatively more protein 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.480
than nonprotein foods

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.320
and so the treatment that we give for malnutrition 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.860
is a relatively new treatment it's a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.620
ready to use therapeutic food

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.880
so it s a version, it's a peanut based

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.500
highly caloric nutritious food

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.310
that we call

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.180
Nourimanba

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.190
and manba is peanut butter

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.570
we looked at the research studies coming out about using it
especially in Africa

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.700
and it's particularly good for community-based therapy 
because you don't have to admit all of the kids

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.350
the really really sick ones you still have to admit

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.650
but you can give them

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.799
a dose

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.760
certain amount of 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.690
this paste and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.150
let them go home and teach the mom how to feed 
the kids throughout the day

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.549
and it works much much more quickly than the milk.

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.390
She was saying though that he's not able to take the manba yet

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.579
he's so sick that he is not even able to eat that

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.939
when they get so malnourished they actually lose their appetite, and the same way their legs out  
swollen, their gut is swollen as well.

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.129
so right now he is on the older fashioned milk product

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.329
and then as soon as he's

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.149
able to tolerate it, he'll get more.

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:28.479
usually the children have both

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:30.879
just calorie deficit

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.589
and protein deficit

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.790
and this child in particular it's like a balance of  

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.719
more protein

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.359
missing than other calories

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.629
so the proteins help to keep the fluids 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.180
in your blood stream

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.999
so it's just everything that's really weakened

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.589
and the treatment is just highly nutritious food

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:49.580
and antibiotics

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.580
and antparasitics

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.639
Really recovering from

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:04.939
you know there's

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.720
some evidence to say

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.280
that children who have severe malnutrition episodes like this will never truly recover

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.789
because if you're having a growth spurt, or you should
be

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:15.950
and you have this episode

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.089
you know they end up a lot of them being stunted, you know 
they never

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.439
get to their height potential

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.359
your mental development is not as good as
it should be

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.729
depending on how severe it is and how often it happens

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.439
so he could get better now with our treatment

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.609
but the n what's going to happen when we send him home? Like if 
unless we try and do something about her home

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:34.799
socio-economic situation

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:35.840
her situation for her child never going to help
