I will tell you what what was the span

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:08.629
I will tell you what what was the span
 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.279
I will tell you what what was the span
of reactions yes yes so I yes yes good

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:12.289
of reactions yes yes so I yes yes good
 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.640
of reactions yes yes so I yes yes good
so let's go this thought about the good

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650

out what it is this was the good
 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.150
out what it is this was the good

well that my group leader came to my
office one day this was in the first

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329
office one day this was in the first
 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.319

material and a smiling sheepishly he put

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600
material and a smiling sheepishly he put
 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.500
material and a smiling sheepishly he put
a x-ray diffraction book on my desk and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510
a x-ray diffraction book on my desk and
 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.750
a x-ray diffraction book on my desk and
said that something like Danny please

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760
said that something like Danny please
 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.790

read this book and so you understand

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800
read this book and so you understand
 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.009
read this book and so you understand
that what you are saying cannot be and

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019
that what you are saying cannot be and
 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.540
that what you are saying cannot be and
this is because the picture you had

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550
this is because the picture you had
 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.110
this is because the picture you had
seemed to defy all the possibilities

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120
seemed to defy all the possibilities
 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.090
seemed to defy all the possibilities
that were allowed under crystallography

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100
that were allowed under crystallography
 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.560
that were allowed under crystallography
in those day that is correct

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570
in those day that is correct
 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.079
in those day that is correct
but it's not it was not one picture it

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089
but it's not it was not one picture it
 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.240
but it's not it was not one picture it
was a series of long series of

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250
was a series of long series of
 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.899
was a series of long series of
experiments the famous diffraction

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909
experiments the famous diffraction
 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.920
experiments the famous diffraction
picture is one of very many experiments

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930
picture is one of very many experiments
 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.249
picture is one of very many experiments
all done by electron microscopy

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259
all done by electron microscopy
 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.710
all done by electron microscopy
transmission electron microscopy so he

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720
transmission electron microscopy so he
 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.870
transmission electron microscopy so he
he gave me the book in said please read

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880
he gave me the book in said please read
 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.719
he gave me the book in said please read
I said you know I know this book I'm a

how many days or how many hours it was
 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.460
how many days or how many hours it was
but he came back and said Danny you're a

traumatic but this is was not I just had
to find another group leader who will

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009
to find another group leader who will
 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.920

adopt me you know the often to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930
adopt me you know the often to
 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.289

somebody did and all it meant was that
instead of reporting to this secretary

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
instead of reporting to this secretary
 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.500
instead of reporting to this secretary
- that secretary I didn't move for my

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
- that secretary I didn't move for my
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.440
- that secretary I didn't move for my
office all for my laboratory I did it it

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
office all for my laboratory I did it it
 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.179
office all for my laboratory I did it it
was just about the same it was not very

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189
was just about the same it was not very
 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.129
was just about the same it was not very
dramatic now when people hear about all

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.139
dramatic now when people hear about all
 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.250
dramatic now when people hear about all
of you thrown away from here oh yeah but

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
of you thrown away from here oh yeah but
 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.520
of you thrown away from here oh yeah but
it was not for me at least it was no

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
it was not for me at least it was no
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.509
it was not for me at least it was no
traumatic it was not now I said I didn't

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519
traumatic it was not now I said I didn't
 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.289
traumatic it was not now I said I didn't
feel very good about it but yeah so this

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299
feel very good about it but yeah so this
 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.080
feel very good about it but yeah so this
was the span of reaction between

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090
was the span of reaction between
 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.539
was the span of reaction between
encouragement and and rejection and

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549
encouragement and and rejection and
 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.099
encouragement and and rejection and
