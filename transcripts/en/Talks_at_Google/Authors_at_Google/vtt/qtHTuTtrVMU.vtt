[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:06.300
A.D. JAMESON: Thanks
for having me.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.300
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.759
Thanks to everybody
for coming out.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.049
JOSH PYLE: So, today we want
to learn a little bit more

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.290
about you and your
book and maybe a little

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.710
of your own background
in geek culture.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.490
A.D. JAMESON: Well,
I've always been a geek.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.860
I remember some of the earliest
movies I remember seeing

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.260
were things like the
"Muppet Movie" and "Return

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.940
of the Jedi," "ET," things
like that and grew up loving--

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.670
like a lot of people,
just watched "Star Wars"

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.230
all the time and stuff like
that, a lot of animation,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.920
puppetry stuff.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.650
And then I got really
into "Star Trek"

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.020
when I was in grade school,
high school, got really

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.610
into "Star Trek Next
Generation," "Deep Space Nine,"

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.776
"Voyager," things like that.

00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:48.550
And I've always been
interested in geek culture.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.190
But the funny thing
was growing up

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.680
with that stuff in
the 1980s and 1990s,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.590
I got to be around
like 20-something,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.600
and I thought, OK,
liked all that stuff.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.680
It was fun.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.910
It's kind of for kids.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.100
That's what the culture
kept telling me growing up.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.100
You like that stuff now.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.810
Now it's time to be an adult,
move on, do something else.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.550
Sell your magic cards,
stop doing this.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.060
And then it exploded.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.660
And if anything, it just
has become even bigger

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.660
in the past 20 years.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.460
So instead of having to put
that stuff aside and move on,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.610
do something else, instead it's
become everywhere to the point

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.320
where I could write a book
about it, a mainstream book.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.709
So I never had to grow up
or put that stuff away.

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.750
JOSH PYLE: So it's just
been a constant evolution

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.185
the whole time.

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:31.976
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah.

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:36.362
It just keeps getting bigger
and bigger, the geek culture.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.070
JOSH PYLE: So, geek
culture and writing--

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.320
so as a creative
writer, I'd love

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.880
to hear more about
your background

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.240
and how you got your
start as a writer.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.840
A.D. JAMESON: Well, I became
interested in creative writing.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.327
I've written short stories and
novels and things like that.

00:01:52.327 --> 00:01:54.660
And I think I've always just
been interested in fantasy.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.400
Growing up I liked those things.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.310
A lot of the reason I wanted
to write in the first place

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.254
was I'd watch things like the
"Muppet Show" or "Star Wars"

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.170
or "Star Trek" and I'd
want to write something

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.500
like that, "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles," whatever.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.916
I mean, as I got older and I
started reading other things,

00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:11.610
I started reading
non-geeky things.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.320
But I grew up
reading like "X-Men"

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.690
comics and "Lord of the
Rings" and that kind of stuff

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.030
and fantasy novels.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.380
I read Dragonlance novels.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.320
Do people know
Dragonlance novels?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.590
When I went to college--

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.955
and I went to college
originally for math and science.

00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:29.550
And again, I was like
a stereotypical like--

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.560
I thought, I'm going
to be an engineer

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.470
because I love Geordi La Forge.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.140
He's like my hero, and I
want to live on the Starship

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.162
Enterprise, so I'm
going to go to college,

00:02:39.162 --> 00:02:40.620
get a science
degree, and I'm going

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.450
to work to try and bring about--

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.390
like help invent
transporters or something.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.890
But in my case,
what happened was

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.984
I also really loved art
and the storytelling

00:02:49.984 --> 00:02:52.150
and the movies and TV and
comics and all that stuff.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.640
And I always drew and wrote.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.360
And I got to college, and I just
find myself gravitating more

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.360
and more toward the art kids.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.170
There's always a lot of
overlap between people in STEM

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.274
disciplines and the arts.

00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:06.690
And I think actually
people forget

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.106
sometimes how much of an overlap
there is between the two.

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.375
And I'm an example
of that myself.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:12.750
But in my case,
I think my love--

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.130
I realized what
I liked more were

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.010
like the TV shows and the
movies and the comics and stuff.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.320
And I started finding
myself wanting

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.640
to take more creative writing
classes and less differential

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.680
calculus classes.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.290
And so I just slowly
followed that passion.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.190
I still like math and
science and all that.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.040
I think that in
my case I realized

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.960
was more of a hobby
or something I liked

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.270
reading nonfiction books about.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.790
And then I went more toward
story writing and fiction.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.742
The weird thing,
though, is when I

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:43.200
went into a creative writing,
of course, the first they try

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.280
and do-- if anybody
here has ever

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.710
taken especially a college-level
creative writing class,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.750
is they try to beat
out of you an interest

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.650
in fantasy and science fiction
and any of that kind of stuff.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.590
They want you to write
literary fiction, which

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.940
would be like stuff that's more
like the kind of fiction novels

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.550
that don't really have aliens
or ghosts or things in them.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.180
JOSH PYLE: You
wouldn't necessarily

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.530
see that in like Faulkner.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.850
A.D. JAMESON: Exactly,
yeah, and they certainly

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.433
don't want you to
write genre fiction.

00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:10.240
They don't want you to write
like Dragonlance novels or say,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.080
I'm going to write the next
"Star Trek" novelization

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.610
or things like that.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.950
So I went through a period
where my teachers really

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.430
did their best to kind of push.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.050
And I was a writer--

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.174
it coincided right around
that time when I thought,

00:04:21.174 --> 00:04:22.620
OK, I'm growing up.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.620
I'm going to have to
leave this stuff aside.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.060
So one of my
interests, then, ever

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.760
since then-- because
I just finished

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.020
my PhD in creative writing.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.160
And so I do have more of
an academic career as well.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.120
And I teach creative
writing at university.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.640
And I know, I understand
where that literary fiction,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.760
genre fiction divide has
come from commercially

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.027
and historically.

00:04:45.027 --> 00:04:46.860
But I'm also interested
in bridging that gap

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.934
and kind of doing both.

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:50.100
So that's kind of the
challenge for me in my career.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.660
And a book like this
is as an attempt

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.750
to try to show that a lot
of that genre stuff, a lot

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.120
of the geek culture stuff,
actually can have and often

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.560
does have a real literary
or artistic merit to it

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.841
that I think often
gets overlooked.

00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:05.090
JOSH PYLE: And that's something
want to maybe focus in

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.984
on a little bit.

00:05:05.984 --> 00:05:08.150
One of the authors you
referenced a lot of your book

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.890
is Biskind, who wrote the book
"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls."

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.479
Knowing "Star Wars" is the
focal point of this book,

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.270
that was one of things
that drew me and got

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.130
me pretty excited about it.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.180
I saw "Star Wars" when
I was four years old.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.359
I'm dating myself.

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:22.400
I saw it in the theaters.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.000
A.D. JAMESON: Very lucky.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.500
I did not.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.650
JOSH PYLE: Yes, indeed.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.570
True story, I
actually fell asleep

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.370
in the most climactic
scene of the film,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.870
because I was four years old.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.020
Since then, I watched it
a few hundred more times.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.980
So, "Star Wars" in
1977 was very much

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.190
a product of its times
in a lot of ways.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.710
So, Lucas was a contemporary
of people like Francis Ford

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.710
Coppola, Martin Scorsese.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.010
Yet in some of the
criticism works by Biskind,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.992
he seems to cut him
off from that group.

00:05:50.992 --> 00:05:52.700
So I'd like to hear
more of your thoughts

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.760
around what I think you
refer to in the book

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.860
as "the new Hollywood."

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:04.010
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah, going
back to the last thing I said,

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.180
there's been a long tendency
to separate high art

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.610
and the literary--

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.110
like if you go over to the
Art Institute, for instance--

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.580
if you go over to
the Art Institute

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.955
and look at the paintings that
are on the wall at the Art

00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:21.694
Institute and then you
buy a pack of Magic cards

00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:23.360
or a pack of Pokemon
cards or something,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.460
you can see that the Pokemon
cards and the Magic cards

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.501
are not hanging on the
wall at the Art Institute.

00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:29.750
And if you talk to
people who are in--

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.810
especially film critics
or literary critics,

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.240
the kind of books they're
often talking about are not--

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.710
if anything, they often have
hostility toward pop culture

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.340
and especially things like
"Star Wars" movies and stuff.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.940
So Biskind comes more
from that kind of--

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.370
he writes for "Vanity Fair."

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.495
He was from New York.

00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:53.870
I think he thinks of himself
as being like a high culture

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.790
kind of guy.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.830
And in a book he
wrote that came out

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.680
in the late '90s that's called
"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,"

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.380
it's looking at '70s filmmaking.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.590
And he tries to make an argument
that the last great decade

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.680
for American cinema
was the 1970s.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.947
The last great films were
the films of that era.

00:07:11.947 --> 00:07:14.030
And then ever since then,
"Star Wars" comes along.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.488
"Star Wars" kind
of kills all that.

00:07:15.488 --> 00:07:16.280
It betrays it.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.690
And then ever since then, it's
just been pop culture junk

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.440
that you get, like '80s movies,
'90s movies, up until today.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.880
Now it's just like the Marvel
Cinematic Universe and then

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.838
the "Star Wars" movies.

00:07:24.838 --> 00:07:27.350
We've all heard variations
of that argument.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.380
And I read his book
when I was in college.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.930
And it was very popular I guess
a little bit after college.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.730
And there's certain ways in
which I admire his argument.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.070
But I didn't think he was
right, and I didn't really

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.100
agree with that argument
that "Star Wars" represented

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.730
the end of ambitious,
artistic US filmmaking.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.190
If anything, I
thought "Star Wars"

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.800
was an example of
really ambitious,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.090
artistic filmmaking and that
Lucas himself was very much

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:01.490
an example of 1970s culture,
that all the things that people

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.350
tend to praise about
'70s art cinema--

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.620
and when I say "art cinema,"
I just mean a lot of the stuff

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.540
was very mainstream at the
time in American cinema,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.340
but like a strong
influence from European art

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.730
cinema, strong
influence from people

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.970
like Kurosawa, strong interest
in more experimental narrative

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.026
techniques.

00:08:22.026 --> 00:08:23.400
Lucas was doing
all those things.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.976
He was just as much into that.

00:08:24.976 --> 00:08:27.350
And part of why "Star Wars"
was such a revolutionary film

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.150
was because of those things.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.385
Those weren't things that people
were like, oh, gee whiz, I

00:08:32.385 --> 00:08:33.260
like science fiction.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.330
I'll just put up with
this other stuff.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.429
It was, in fact, those
revolutionary techniques

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.961
in realism and
filmmaking that actually

00:08:39.961 --> 00:08:42.169
made "Star Wars" the film
that people actually loved.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:46.270
So I was like, "Star Wars"
wasn't a betrayal of it.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.260
It was like the epitome of it.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.360
And the things that people
love about "Star Wars"

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.950
are, in fact, those
particular things.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.400
So just to give a quick
example, if you've ever

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.440
watched Hollywood
films from the 1960s,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.360
a lot of films in
the 1960s Hollywood

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.470
are short on sound stages
and back lots in Hollywood.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.800
One of the things they started
doing more of around '67 or so

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.470
and especially
into the '70s, they

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.260
started shooting
more on location.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.500
So if you look at
a film like "Jaws,"

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.330
they originally wanted
Steven Spielberg

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:20.030
to shoot "Jaws" in a water tank
in the back lot at a Hollywood

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.660
studio.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.550
And Spielberg said, no,
I'm not going to do that.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.330
It's going to look corny.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.871
It's going to look
like "The Creature

00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:26.870
from the Black Lagoon,"
like a '50s film.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.410
I want to go out onto the
open sea and shoot there.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.700
And he had to fight for this.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.533
And they actually fired
him off the picture.

00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:38.540
He got fired because he was
going over time, over budget,

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.859
and it was very difficult.
And then they hired him

00:09:40.859 --> 00:09:42.400
back on because they
were like, well,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.700
he's the only guy who
can finish the picture.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.070
But part of what we love about
"Jaws" now when you watch it,

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.170
like if you've seen "Jaws,"
is like they're really

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.003
out on the open sea.

00:09:49.003 --> 00:09:52.920
And it's part of what makes
that film more powerful.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.250
"Star Wars" was the same way.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.000
There's a lot of science
fiction up until then,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
where they're shooting
it-- if you've seen films

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.030
like "Forbidden Planet" or
like other science fiction

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.720
films of the period,
they're usually

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.146
shot in Hollywood
studios on sound stages.

00:10:06.146 --> 00:10:07.770
And Lucas was like,
I'm going to go out

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.205
to like Tunisia and shoot there.

00:10:09.205 --> 00:10:10.580
I'm going to go
out to Guatemala,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.850
and I'm going to shoot there.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.150
And that's a large part
of what makes Tatooine,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.750
what makes [INAUDIBLE] look
like actual alien other planets.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.120
I mean, they look
like actual locations.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.090
And that's what's a lot of
people love about "Star Wars."

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.550
What people like is they like
the realism of the settings,

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.190
and they like those things.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.480
And those were what we call
new Hollywood techniques.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.020
And if anything,
I think fans tend

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.312
to complain about the opposite.

00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:37.395
So when the prequels came
out, part of what people

00:10:37.395 --> 00:10:39.750
didn't like about them,
a lot of Star Wars fans--

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.550
people do like the
prequels, of course,

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.320
but a lot of the
older, more traditional

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.778
"Star Wars" fans
said, I don't want

00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:46.770
this to be shot on a
digital back lot in front

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:47.490
of green screens.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.040
I want this to be short
on actual locations.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.450
Why aren't they going out to--

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:55.724
I even think if you look
at "Return of the Jedi,"

00:10:55.724 --> 00:10:57.390
one of the things
that always bothers me

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.600
when I watch "Return of the
Jedi," which is a film I love--

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.180
that was my first "Star
Wars" in the theater.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.640
But when they go
back to Tatooine,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.010
they're not going
out to Tunisia.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.550
They go to Nevada.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.510
They just shoot in
the desert there.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.384
And it looks like a
totally different desert.

00:11:14.384 --> 00:11:15.990
It just doesn't look the same.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:21.060
And then the Ewok planet,
Endor, is the Redwood Forest.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.680
I mean, it's lazy on some level.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.810
I was like, by that
point Lucas didn't want

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.180
to travel anywhere anymore.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.510
He's like, I made this money.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.170
I'm not going out to-- he hated
traveling around the world

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.490
making these films.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.010
He got sick.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.200
His stomach bothers
him a lot and things.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.300
So he was like, oh,
it would be easier

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.730
to go up to the Redwood
Forest and go over to Nevada.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.310
And it's like that's what
he-- so it always bothered me

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.893
on some level.

00:11:44.893 --> 00:11:48.982
It loses a little bit of that
far-flung kind of quality.

00:11:48.982 --> 00:11:50.940
Not to say those things
are necessarily exotic,

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.950
but they're familiar from
other Hollywood films.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.310
We've seen endless Hollywood
films set, like shot

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.639
in the regions that
are close to Hollywood,

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.430
because everybody goes
there to shoot them.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.030
That's why-- because
they're right there.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.196
They're just affordable,
and they're very available.

00:12:05.196 --> 00:12:08.700
So making that extra effort is
like the realist new Hollywood

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.710
commitment.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.830
JOSH PYLE: Gotcha.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.940
Yeah, and as a personal
aside, just noticing

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.440
that-- when reading your book
I didn't actually realize that

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.750
until looking at the book about
some of those things and how

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.220
maybe there were some corners
cut in the making of "Return

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.780
of the Jedi."

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.100
Again, the realism
factor really stands out.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.690
Like I think you
mentioned how when

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.940
Luke sees the droids
for the first time,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.390
he's very dismissive because he
is used to that sort of thing,

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.980
the point being of this
world-making that's happening,

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.480
right?

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.629
And that's the world
that's lived in.

00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:43.920
And I think you also talk
about that in the book around

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.830
Tolkien and how "Lord of
the Rings," for example,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.645
how that was actually just
part of a larger mythology.

00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:53.430
And it seems like
Hollywood in general

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.570
has been taking a while to
catch up to this, right?

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:56.736
You see that in "Star Wars."

00:12:56.736 --> 00:12:58.240
You see that in
"Lord of the Rings,"

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.180
but that actually
goes further back.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.160
And so you're beginning
to see more of that today.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.450
So I'm curious about--

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.150
"Jedi" 1983 kind of dies off.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.880
But then you have
this fan lore that

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.340
begins to grow around "Star
Wars," like role-playing games,

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.240
for example.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.595
And they kind of pick up the
mantle for creating the world.

00:13:18.595 --> 00:13:20.220
Maybe tell us a little
more about that.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.240
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah, so the
book, there's a lot in there.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.000
And kind of like the whole
book is like in those questions

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.730
in some ways.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.204
[LAUGHS] I guess the easiest
way to explain it would be-- so,

00:13:32.204 --> 00:13:34.620
when I sat down to write this
book-- and again, I told you

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.140
I grew up as a geek.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.450
I also began to have
this experience where

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.690
I was dealing more with people
who taught literary fiction.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.430
I had teachers in
my writing workshops

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.180
who said, you can't
write science fiction,

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.430
things like that.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.720
I read this Biskind book.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.020
I became interested in like,
why does that divide exist,

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.590
like why is there a
separation between high art

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.110
and genre often?

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.820
So that's one set
of questions I had

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.091
that I tried to answer when I
sat down and wrote the book.

00:14:03.091 --> 00:14:04.590
And in some ways,
it's like a series

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.790
of prejudices I was trying to
overcome in writing the book.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.420
But I also had a series
of questions about

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.360
like how did this aesthetic
of geek culture develop?

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.510
If you think of geek
culture as a community or as

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.990
a demographic, how did it
actually historically develop?

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.120
Why is there more of it?

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.530
Why is it more mainstream now?

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.630
Why is it more above
ground now than it was--

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.020
well, when did it start?

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.610
Like when did people
start cos playing?

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.230
Like when did it actually begin?

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.080
When did people begin making
up fictional languages

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.210
of elves or things like that?

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.050
Like there has to be a point
where that started, right?

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.030
When did people start
having conventions?

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.150
And then obviously when they
started doing those things,

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.060
it was clearly not as above
ground or as mainstream

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.210
as it is today.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.820
So how did it develop?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.430
And what are the forces,
the cultural forces,

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.350
that took it and made
it more mainstream?

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.600
So that was a real
question I had.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:06.160
And one of the ways I got into
that was a question about--

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.220
I remembered from my youth
"Star Wars" disappearing.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.050
And I'm sure you
remember this, too.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.090
It's really funny,
especially if you're

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.760
a fan, it you're younger
than us or if you

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.890
know more "Star Wars" today.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:22.930
There was a period between
1985, 1986 and 1991,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.050
which again, that's
only like five years--

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.880
those five years were an
eternity when I was a kid--

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.670
where "Star Wars" completely
disappeared from the culture.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.680
It just completely was
gone, which is shocking

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.230
because the movies were so big.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.020
They come out in
'77, run through '83,

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.630
and by 1986, they
stopped making--

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.310
there were no more
"Star Wars" toys,

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.090
there were no more
cartoons, no more TV shows,

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:46.930
no more comic books.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.327
Marvel stopped
making the comics.

00:15:48.327 --> 00:15:49.410
There were no more novels.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.580
There was nothing.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.520
They stopped making--
no more games.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.040
It just went away.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.840
And it's unimaginable to
think that would happen today.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.690
So something clearly changed
between then and now.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.190
And I was like,
well, what was that?

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.160
What happened?

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.627
The main thing was--

00:16:05.627 --> 00:16:07.960
and this is what a lot of the
book ended up being about,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.600
was even though geeks existed in
1986, even though they existed

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.720
in 1966, geeks
were very much more

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.180
of an underground subculture.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.207
It was like a niche
culture that, growing up,

00:16:22.207 --> 00:16:24.040
I didn't know many
people like me growing up

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.123
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

00:16:25.123 --> 00:16:29.500
There was like three of us who
were into this kind of stuff.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.320
And the powers that be, a
lot of companies and stuff,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.330
they didn't even realize
it was a demographic

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.930
they could actually market to.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.680
And even if they wanted
to market to them,

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.970
they didn't know how to.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.860
It was like, what
kind of products

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.190
would actually even buy?

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:45.989
What could we do?

00:16:45.989 --> 00:16:46.780
What could we make?

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.620
So we begin to see--

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.480
the first people who kind
of really figure it out

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.830
is "Star Trek," because they
see-- when "Star Trek" was

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.930
off the air in '69, and
then all through the '70s,

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.432
they're watching "Star Trek"
fans have these conventions.

00:17:03.432 --> 00:17:05.890
And they go, wow, these people
are really into "Star Trek."

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.564
They're really not
letting it go, right?

00:17:08.564 --> 00:17:10.980
And they think, well, how can
we make some money off this,

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.584
right?

00:17:11.584 --> 00:17:13.000
They're like, we
don't really know

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.990
how to make some money off it.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.950
They don't want to
bring "Star Trek"

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.574
back onto TV, because that's not
going to be profitable enough.

00:17:17.574 --> 00:17:19.180
They couldn't keep it on.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.639
But they go, well,
what do they do?

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:22.054
And one of the
things they look at

00:17:22.054 --> 00:17:24.369
is they go, well, they
write a lot of fan fiction.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.952
They go to the conventions, they
see that all these people are

00:17:26.952 --> 00:17:28.780
writing fan fiction stories.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.700
And they go, well,
maybe we'll create

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.342
a line of "Star Trek" novels.

00:17:33.342 --> 00:17:35.800
And we'll actually invite some
of those fan fiction writers

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.740
to come and do that.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.080
So as it happened, in the very
late '70s when "Star Trek"

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.140
the motion picture comes out--

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.990
Paramount have their own--

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.900
part of the sprawling corporate
conglomeration they belong to,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.150
they have their own publisher.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.233
And they go, we'll just
hire some of these people.

00:17:54.233 --> 00:17:55.612
They'll write
"Star Trek" novels.

00:17:55.612 --> 00:17:57.820
And what you're seeing there
is the commercialization

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.820
of fan fiction.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.778
It was one of the first
things they figured out

00:18:00.778 --> 00:18:02.920
was, we could do this,
we could do that.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.566
So Lucas hadn't
figured that out yet.

00:18:06.566 --> 00:18:07.690
Paramount figures that out.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.924
Lucas then doesn't
realize, even though he's

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.340
kind of a geek
himself, he doesn't

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.340
realize that geeks
exist as a demographic

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.320
and that they're
fans of "Star Wars."

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.140
As far as he's concerned,
it's a mass market phenomenon,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.630
a mass culture phenomenon,
pop culture phenomenon,

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.609
and kids like it.

00:18:23.609 --> 00:18:25.900
So he's trying to make all
the products for pop culture

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.441
and for kids.

00:18:26.441 --> 00:18:29.980
But the problem is, pop
culture moves on very quickly.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.280
It's super fast these days.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.080
It moved fast even in the '80s.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.880
There's a lot of stuff out
there vying for our attention,

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.140
and people are like,
yeah, I liked it.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:38.890
I went and saw it.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.210
And then I'm interested
in something else.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.793
Some new movie comes
out or something.

00:18:41.793 --> 00:18:43.240
You go see that.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.600
Kids also age out of
products extremely quickly.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.375
If you make toys
for kids, something

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:49.750
they like when
they're five, they

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.100
won't like by the
time they're seven

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.880
or by the time they're nine.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.600
They age out of it very quickly.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.900
So they just thought that
the market for "Star Wars"

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.549
was gone by 1986, 1987.

00:18:58.549 --> 00:19:00.340
What they didn't realize
was that the geeks

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.506
were going to do the exact
same thing to "Star Wars"

00:19:02.506 --> 00:19:04.060
that they had done
to "Star Trek."

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.900
They were going to keep
it alive themselves.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.560
And if the culture,
if companies wouldn't

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.630
make those things for them,
they would make them themselves.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.870
So they start writing
their own fan fiction.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.962
They start making
their own costumes.

00:19:15.962 --> 00:19:17.920
And they're like, we're
going to keep it alive.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.110
We want to actually
keep experiencing

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.224
this world, this immersive
experience of "Star Wars."

00:19:23.224 --> 00:19:24.640
One of things that
happens then is

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.610
a company called West
End Games in 1987,

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.300
they make role-playing games.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.330
They go, let's get the
license to "Star Wars,"

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.920
and let's actually make a
"Star Wars" role-playing game.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.910
People will play that.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.269
So they get the license.

00:19:35.269 --> 00:19:37.060
Nobody else wants "Star
Wars" at that time,

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.760
so they probably get
it for like a song.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.310
And they start making the "Star
Wars"-- it comes out in 1987,

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.870
the "Star Wars"
role-playing game.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.830
And the thing is,
if you're going

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.160
to do a Dungeons and
Dragons role-playing

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.590
experience with "Star
Wars," you actually

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.127
have to end up inventing
a lot of stuff.

00:19:53.127 --> 00:19:54.960
So let's just picture
what it would be like.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.959
You're playing the game.

00:19:55.959 --> 00:19:57.370
You go to the Mos
Eisley Cantina.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.840
There's all the aliens there.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.940
Some of them are on screen for
like five seconds in the movie.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.310
But you're in the cantina.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.019
You can go there.

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:05.435
So you're going
to go over and sit

00:20:05.435 --> 00:20:07.160
next to this guy
sitting over at the bar

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.560
and start talking to him.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.210
What's his name?

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.780
Where is he from?

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.420
Now, none of this
is in the movie.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.160
So you go over, and
there's a toy made

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.170
of the one, this hammerhead.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.970
But you can't call
him Hammerhead, right?

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.511
Like that's just a
dumb name somebody

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:24.070
at Kenner put on the toy in 1978
because they had no idea what

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.210
else to put there, right?

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:26.389
The guy doesn't have a name.

00:20:26.389 --> 00:20:28.180
I mean, the alien just
doesn't have a name.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.080
So somebody at West End Games
had to come up with a name.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.480
And they went, mm,
Momaw Nadan is his name.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.840
And he is an authorian priest.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.730
And the reason why he's
there in the cantina

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.250
is because he was a priest
on Ithor, his planet--

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:42.910
Ithor.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.560
And it got attacked
by the empire,

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.410
and they wanted him to give
the sacred agricultural lore

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.180
of their planet, his
jungles, which are

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.700
like sentient, to the empire.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.195
He refused, and then people
thought he was a traitor,

00:20:55.195 --> 00:20:56.460
so they exiled him.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.110
And now he's in
exile on Tattooine.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.080
And he has a garden south
of Mos Eisley that he tends.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.060
But he's also an ally
to the rebellion.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.242
And he will
sometimes hide rebels

00:21:08.242 --> 00:21:09.450
like in his garden and stuff.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.560
OK, so now if you're
like the DM in this game,

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.602
you have a chance to
actually play this character

00:21:13.602 --> 00:21:14.976
and actually
interact with stuff.

00:21:14.976 --> 00:21:16.976
Maybe you could actually
go, we're on the run,

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:18.850
like when Momaw Nadan
is like, I'll help you,

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.560
and take her out to my garden.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.660
You can actually play out
that adventure, right?

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.260
So they just have to
invent all this stuff.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.760
And the people at
West End Games are

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.180
the ones who invented all this.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.040
And so they put this book out.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.030
It cost like $30 bucks.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.900
And it sells out.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.340
And it starts winning awards.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.870
And by 1988, 1989, George
Lucas is sitting there,

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.280
and the receipts
start coming in.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.860
He's like, hm, it's like money
from-- like "Howard the Duck"

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.210
just failed, right?

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.080
So he's thinking,
why is there money?

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.080
Nobody wanted to go see
"Howard the Duck," which

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.340
is playing tonight, by the
way, at the [? Music Box, ?]

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:48.840
7:00 PM.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.410
I'll be there.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.680
70 millimeter, too.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.520
But he's like, what's
this "Star Wars" book?

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.140
And he looks at it, and he goes,
I didn't invent any of this.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.360
Like what is this?

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.870
I didn't invent
any of this stuff.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.900
But he realizes-- he's a shrewd
business person, Lucas is.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.380
And he goes, there's
a market for this.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.990
So he begins to think, how can
I sell this information back

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.280
to the geeks?

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.929
So 1991, Timothy Zahn,
the first thing they do

00:22:15.929 --> 00:22:17.470
is they go, what
does "Star Trek" do?

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.222
They put out a series of novels.

00:22:19.222 --> 00:22:21.430
They go, OK, we're going to
write a series of novels.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.410
That's the beginning of
the expanded universe.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.820
And look, these people
at West End Games

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:25.903
did us a lot of work here.

00:22:25.903 --> 00:22:27.700
We're going to put
all this stuff in.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.820
So they start actually
taking the RPG,

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.620
and they start making
stories out of them.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.292
By 1996 you can read "Tales
from Mos Eisley Cantina," which

00:22:36.292 --> 00:22:37.750
is a series of
short stories, which

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.180
is all the things that
were in that RPG book,

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.300
now told as short stories.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.060
And one of them, of course,
is the "Sand Herder's Tale."

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.320
It's the story of Momaw Nadan.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.779
It's just a written
version of it.

00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:47.570
And then once they see
people will do that,

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.780
you can actually make
a toy now in 1996

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.110
that's a Momaw Nadan toy.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.230
And it's a little more detailed,
and it has a backstory.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.440
2006 you make an even
more detailed figure.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.410
And gradually, they begin
to figure out, oh, there's

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:04.990
a demographic here that will
purchase specialized products.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.390
Now, most people don't
want this kind of stuff.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.910
My parents went to
see "Star Wars."

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.187
They have no interest in
buying a Momaw Nadan figure.

00:23:12.187 --> 00:23:13.270
They don't know who he is.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.201
They don't care.

00:23:14.201 --> 00:23:15.700
But there's a niche
market for this.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.324
And what they
figured out gradually

00:23:17.324 --> 00:23:19.240
through the '80s and
'90s was they figured out

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.262
how to monetize it.

00:23:20.262 --> 00:23:22.720
And then the other thing that
happens is the internet then.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.300
You guys have heard of
the internet, right?

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.824
So in 1993 you have
the world wide web.

00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:31.240
And suddenly people can start
putting all this information

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.990
online.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.020
And suddenly you can
have the Wookieepedia.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.190
You can look this stuff up.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.220
Streaming-- you can go back
and watch all these things.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.336
And suddenly, stuff that used
to be very hard to find--

00:23:43.336 --> 00:23:45.460
and you say, well, "Star
Wars" wasn't hard to find.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.126
But some of this stuff
was hard to find.

00:23:47.126 --> 00:23:50.710
The "Star Wars Holiday
Special" was hard to find.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.410
Issues of "X-Men"
were hard to find.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.850
I remember trying
to buy them in 1987

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.480
and going into the comic book
store, which was like musty

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.310
and had water damage and smelled
like the owner's dog and stuff.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.200
And went in, and there
was like cobwebs.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.440
And I was like, how much for
that issue of "Uncanny X-Men

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.100
248?"

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.230
And he'd be like, $50.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.240
It's like, well, I
can't afford that.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.610
I want to read it, but
I can't afford that.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.780
Now you can, whether
legally or illegally,

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.030
you can download these things.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.110
You can read them online.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.860
You can stream them.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.510
If you want to watch the
"Star Trek" animated series,

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.010
you can watch on
your cell phone,

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.440
things that used to
be very hard to find.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.130
So not only has
that demographic--

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.910
people have learned
how to monetize it,

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.320
that demographic has grown.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.420
And now it's easier than
ever to get into it.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.480
And guess what?

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.510
It tends to appeal
to people who tend

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:41.220
to work at companies like Google
or companies like Microsoft,

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.050
work at companies where
they have disposable income

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.050
and they want to actually
enjoy these kinds of things.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.670
So increasingly, you see
that demographic growing.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.920
JOSH PYLE: Yeah, even from
my own personal experience,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.550
this past year was the first
time I'd ever gone to C2E2,

00:24:54.550 --> 00:25:00.190
taking my daughter there and
realizing the crowd is growing.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.374
Yeah, there's the cos
play and all that stuff,

00:25:02.374 --> 00:25:03.790
but then you see
a lot of families

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.424
and you see a lot of
growth of just attendance.

00:25:06.424 --> 00:25:08.715
And she's very excited that
the "Star Wars" celebration

00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:10.490
is going to be in
Chicago next year.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.370
I gotta give a plug for that.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.800
But I guess seeing
that and seeing

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.390
that shift, what additional
opportunities are you seeing?

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:20.860
I think you spoke a little
bit about that from a business

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.800
and marketing side, like
from your perspective

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.537
as an observer.

00:25:24.537 --> 00:25:26.620
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah, so
what you see over the past,

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.780
especially 25 years,
30 years, is you see--

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.330
so in some ways, I think of
geek culture and the growth

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.780
of geek culture as being
analogous to the invention

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.320
of teenagers that happened
in the United States

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.880
around World War II or so.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.800
So, in the 1930s they
passed labor laws.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.080
Suddenly kids and
teenagers aren't allowed

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.207
to work as much anymore.

00:25:51.207 --> 00:25:52.790
They're a protected
class of citizens.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.330
It wasn't like that before that.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:56.950
After World War II,
the United States

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.804
becomes generally a
prosperous, peaceful country.

00:25:59.804 --> 00:26:01.970
Of course, not everybody
got to participate in that,

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.130
but a lot of people did.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.340
And you have this growth
of the middle class,

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.531
especially in certain areas.

00:26:07.531 --> 00:26:09.280
And so you suddenly
had this youth culture

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.840
that has a disposable
income that

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.434
didn't exist before the 1930s.

00:26:13.434 --> 00:26:15.100
And you have this
concept of a teenager.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.090
And there's this
idea that if you're

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:18.340
a teenager, what are the
kind of things you should do?

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.700
You should consume pop
music, movies, go on dates,

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.350
go out for burgers,
things like that.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.266
And you have a whole
culture form around this.

00:26:25.266 --> 00:26:26.920
And once you have
that demographic,

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.350
they can begin making
products for that demographic.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.990
So you can make things like the
"Beach Blanket Bingo" movies.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.460
You can make drive-in movies.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.530
You can make rock music.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.700
You can have things like--

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.900
all those kinds of things.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.941
Again, not everybody gets
to participate in this.

00:26:39.941 --> 00:26:42.580
But a certain number
of people get to.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.310
Geek culture is
something similar.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.930
It's a demographic
that did not exist,

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.020
at least in the eyes of
Hollywood executives or people

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.420
like that.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.690
I mean, geeks existed.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.760
People with those
interests existed.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.277
But they didn't actually
exist as a market,

00:26:58.277 --> 00:26:59.860
as something that
could be marketed to

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.020
and specialized products
could be made for.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.260
Part of what Hollywood
likes about geek culture

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.740
as a demographic is, one,
it's a growing demographic.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:13.090
We have not hit the
limits of its size yet.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.610
We're only like
20, 25 years into--

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:17.900
I would even say it's
only more like 15,

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.600
16 years of it being socially
acceptable on some level.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.330
In my book I say 1999 is
the watershed year where

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.792
it breaks into the mainstream.

00:27:26.792 --> 00:27:28.250
You can debate the
particular year,

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.630
but it's sometime around
the turn of the century.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:35.140
And so it's still
a growth market.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.790
More and more
businesses and companies

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.460
are getting into it, hoping
they can make money in it.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.704
The other thing is, people
don't age out of geek culture

00:27:42.704 --> 00:27:44.620
the same way they age
out of being a teenager.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.869
If you're a teenager, how
long are you a teenager for?

00:27:46.869 --> 00:27:48.920
Six years, seven years.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.130
But if you're a geek,
you can be a geek

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:52.720
for the rest of your life.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.406
I've been a geek for 40 years.

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:56.280
I'll probably be a geek
for another 40 years.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.530
I'll be a geek my entire life.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:58.240
I love this stuff.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:58.930
I'm always going to watch--

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.054
I watched an episode of
"Star Trek Next Generation"

00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:01.810
last night.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.090
I'll watch them again.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.460
So I'm never going to
stop loving these things.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.700
So from a business
perspective, that's

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.700
a lifelong, heavily
enfranchised, branded consumer

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.490
who's always going to
be there and always

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.220
be looking to spend their
money and their leisure time

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.222
on those kind of
products that they like.

00:28:20.222 --> 00:28:22.180
And the other thing they
like about geeks, too,

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.220
is that geeks, as
you can probably see,

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:28.112
geeks tend to be passionate
about the things they love.

00:28:28.112 --> 00:28:29.320
They're heavily enfranchised.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.110
They call us great
brand ambassadors,

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.150
because we will
go out, and we'll

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.830
talk other people's ears off.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.820
We'll write blog posts,
make videos, all for free.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.970
We'll make podcasts.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.459
We'll write books
about the topic.

00:28:42.459 --> 00:28:44.000
On some level, this
is a book I wrote

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.999
because I was trying to
answer certain questions

00:28:45.999 --> 00:28:48.550
about the history of geek
culture and how it evolved

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.001
and how the aesthetics of
it have evolved over time,

00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:53.500
but on some level, this is free
advertising for "Star Wars,"

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.000
right?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.240
I mean it's right there
on the cover of the book.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.120
Lucas didn't give me
anything for that.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.740
I'm doing that for him.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.540
So as long as people
are talking about it.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.910
So that's a large part
of why-- it's still

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.320
a growth demographic.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.990
And it's also one that
if you could actually

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:11.305
get those people,
get geeks, they're

00:29:11.305 --> 00:29:15.700
a very highly valued type of
consumer from the viewpoint--

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.260
so two things I
can see are, one,

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.500
as much as geek culture has
saturated US culture and also

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.110
world culture, we're
nowhere near, I don't think,

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.105
the limit yet.

00:29:27.105 --> 00:29:28.480
It's a growth
market, and I think

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.377
it's still a growth market.

00:29:30.377 --> 00:29:32.710
And then it's going to become
an increasingly mainstream

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.540
culture.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.420
And then on top of that,
the politics of it--

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.170
the really exciting
story in a lot of ways

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.430
is how the politics
of it are changing.

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:41.160
And I think you wanted to ask
a question or two on that.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:41.860
JOSH PYLE: Yeah, for sure.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.820
A.D. JAMESON: Because
that's what we're really

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.660
in the midst of now.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.820
JOSH PYLE: Yeah, I think
that it's really important

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.810
to talk about that
because of how broad

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.331
the fan base has become and
how geek culture is very much

00:29:53.331 --> 00:29:53.830
ingrained.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.900
It is pop culture
in a lot of ways,

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.950
like "Star Wars" is
very much mainstream.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.800
And I think it's
really important

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.190
to talk about that, talk
about diversity and inclusion

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:05.770
in the world of geek culture.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.359
So it's exciting to see.

00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:09.400
We've seen more of them
in the past couple years.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.710
But then thinking about
that broader representation

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.020
in the culture, "Star
Trek," shout-out,

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.150
they that day one
with characters

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.490
like Uhura, Mr.
Sulu, and so forth.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:22.510
"Star Wars" began to pick this
up, maybe a little slowly.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:25.330
But then more recently, a
lot more noticeable strides.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:29.097
And then Joss Whedon
has LGBTQ characters.

00:30:29.097 --> 00:30:31.180
And then, of course, the
Marvel Cinematic Universe

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.974
with Black Panther
and Luke Cage.

00:30:32.974 --> 00:30:34.390
A.D. JAMESON:
Slowly coming along.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.931
JOSH PYLE: Yeah,
slowly coming along.

00:30:35.931 --> 00:30:38.030
It's taken a few years.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.990
And part of that adds more
complexity to storytelling,

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.500
too.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.650
Because just acknowledging that,
thinking about Black Panther,

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.790
for example, the complexity of
a character like Killmonger,

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.049
very complex, a lot
of different things

00:30:52.049 --> 00:30:54.340
you're processing when you're
seeing that battle that's

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.247
happening and some of
things he talked about.

00:30:57.247 --> 00:30:59.830
But it seems that there's some
backlash also that's happening.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.170
And especially I think it's
very noticeable with "Star

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.700
Wars," like "The Last Jedi"
being an example of that.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.390
Tell us a little
more about your take

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.400
on that and why it is that a
certain semblance of geeks,

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.240
predominantly white
males, let's face it,

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.437
are having a struggle
a bit with this change.

00:31:15.437 --> 00:31:17.020
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah,
so I mean, there's

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.395
a couple of things
going on here.

00:31:18.395 --> 00:31:20.670
The first, of course,
is in pop culture,

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.000
just the politics of our
moment are obviously greatly--

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.860
we're living through
a period where--

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.560
you can think that there's
always different politics

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.310
in the culture.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:33.520
But there's times
in our culture where

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.750
maybe politics are a little
more monolithic and top-down.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.360
And at least people
publicly pretend

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.810
to agree on the same things.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:44.826
And there's other parts
and other periods where

00:31:44.826 --> 00:31:47.200
there are just conflicting
views that are both mainstream

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.899
and people are battling on.

00:31:48.899 --> 00:31:51.190
We're clearly in one of those
latter moments right now.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.314
So everything is
politicized these days,

00:31:53.314 --> 00:31:54.730
and so we would
expect pop culture

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.250
and geek culture to be
politicized as well.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.010
But I think another
thing that's happening

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:05.110
is-- so this growth in geek
culture and its mainstreaming

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.760
is really being driven
more than anything

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.080
else I think by fans themselves
and by geeks themselves.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.910
Corporations are
coming in and trying

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:17.140
to actually monetize it and
figure out how to make money

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.320
off the demographic.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.510
But remember, there were "Star
Trek" fans making their own fan

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.700
fiction before they figured
out how to make those novels.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:29.951
And the geeks were making "Star
Wars" products before Lucas--

00:32:29.951 --> 00:32:32.200
the corporations are kind
of falling behind and coming

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.430
in and trying to figure out
how to actually corporatize it.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.530
And of course, as more
and more money flows in,

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.613
it becomes more and more
mainstream, more visible,

00:32:40.613 --> 00:32:41.330
more public.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.770
But if you think about the kind
of people geeks tend to be,

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.890
the way I describe geeks in the
book-- and anybody can be geek.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.430
If anybody wants to say, I'm a
geek, you're a geek, whatever.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:52.492
It's not like there's a--

00:32:52.492 --> 00:32:54.700
you don't need a membership
card or something, right?

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.680
But traditionally
what geeks are are

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.500
people who tend to be interested
in two things at the same time.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.120
They tend to like
fantasy of any kind.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.430
It could be
animation or puppets,

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.140
or it could be science fiction.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.040
It could be horror.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.490
It could be any of these things.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.919
But then they also tend to
be more technically minded.

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:16.210
And they tend to be interested
in the STEM disciplines.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.709
They like the
sciences, whether it's

00:33:17.709 --> 00:33:20.920
the hard sciences or the
more social sciences, math,

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.140
engineering,
computers, whatever.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.640
And what they
particularly like is

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.080
to see the intersection
of those two things.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.390
So there are people who
are interested in fantasy

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:32.210
but aren't interested in
seeing a scientific version

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.710
of fantasy.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.037
They want to see a
crazy, irrational.

00:33:35.037 --> 00:33:36.620
So like someone like
David Lynch would

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.900
be a good example of that.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.220
He likes fantasy.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.340
He likes the supernatural.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.015
But he likes it to be
mysterious and weird and more

00:33:43.015 --> 00:33:45.320
like a nightmare or something.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.390
What geeks tend to do
is they kind of come in.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.681
They're interested in fantasy,
but what they want to do

00:33:49.681 --> 00:33:51.340
is they want to treat
the supernatural

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.990
as an extension of the natural.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:56.560
They want to actually figure
out what the scientific laws are

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.845
or the biological, like
what's the history of elves

00:34:00.845 --> 00:34:03.220
or what's their culture like,
what's their language like.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.230
And so they begin
to kind of take

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.730
the supernatural
and the fantastical

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.584
and bring it in under rational,
empirical methodologies

00:34:10.584 --> 00:34:13.000
and tools and frameworks and
try to actually understand it

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.699
that way.

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.570
So it's this intersection of
the STEM disciplines and fantasy

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.960
I think that traditionally
is what defines a geek.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.170
So if you think
about it that way,

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.630
you've always had people of
all different walks of life

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.350
being interested in fantasy.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.443
But the STEM disciplines in
particular, traditionally were,

00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:32.609
if you go back historically,
if we go back and think

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:36.820
to the 1960s, 1970s,
1980s, it tended

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:41.110
to be a whiter male discipline
for various reasons.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:43.750
My mom in high school was
really interested in science.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.250
She wanted to be a
marine biologist,

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.124
and she was told when
she was in high school,

00:34:47.124 --> 00:34:49.239
you can't be that,
you can't do that.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:50.850
You should be an
English major instead

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:52.600
or you should become
a nurse or something.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.850
So she didn't become
a marine biologist.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.520
Hopefully that attitude
has changed today.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.400
And as the STEM disciplines
and tech job and things

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.400
like that are themselves
diversifying, which

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.530
is long overdue,
of course, you're

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.700
seeing geek culture
also diversify and grow.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.690
And again, that's
something I think

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:15.900
that's being driven by
the fans themselves.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.570
And so the companies
are a little slower

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.800
to pick up on this.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.130
But again, they're cautious.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.712
They're trying to figure out
how to safely monetize this.

00:35:22.712 --> 00:35:25.170
In terms of a backlash, I think
part of what you're seeing,

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.520
of course, is that for a long
time a certain group of people

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.590
perceived geek culture as
being their underground niche.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.160
And I think it's two things.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.760
I think, one, is
a lot of geeks are

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.510
kind of resentful to
see it go mainstream.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.635
The same way if you're a
fan of an underground band

00:35:40.635 --> 00:35:42.718
and then you see them go
mainstream, on some level

00:35:42.718 --> 00:35:45.050
you feel like maybe
you've lost something.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:45.680
You haven't.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.100
Pop culture belongs
to everybody,

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.558
and you can still go back and
listen to the earlier albums.

00:35:49.558 --> 00:35:52.700
But look, when I was growing
up, I loved "X-Men" comics.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.370
And I suffered from this myself.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:58.610
When I saw them making the
"X-Men" movies in 1999, 2000,

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:01.550
on some level, I felt
resentful about it.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.149
Because it wasn't
the "X-Men" I knew.

00:36:03.149 --> 00:36:04.940
I was like, look, it
looks at the "Matrix."

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.840
They're wearing black
leather jumpsuits.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.630
They're using Wire Fu.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.460
That's not the "X-Men."

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.500
When I was reading
it in 1986 and they

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.780
were in the Australian
Outback and the team

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.930
was Longshaw, Rogue,
Dazzler, Wolverine, Colossus,

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.714
it's like Havoc, Storm,
that's the X-Men.

00:36:21.714 --> 00:36:23.630
I don't want to see--
they're changing things.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.350
So I get it.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:28.280
I felt like it wasn't
exactly what I wanted.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.630
But here's the thing.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.910
I was reading "X-Men" in 1986.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.801
There were "X-Men" fans in 1976.

00:36:35.801 --> 00:36:38.300
I was the new kid on the block
who looked obnoxious to them.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.174
Like what are you talking
about 1986 "X-Men?"

00:36:40.174 --> 00:36:41.390
It's not the 1976 "X-Men."

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.987
Then you have the 1966 "X-Men"
fans, who are like, wait, wait,

00:36:43.987 --> 00:36:44.570
wait a minute.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:45.070
Hold on.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.071
We were here first.

00:36:46.071 --> 00:36:48.570
The thing about pop culture is
that it belongs to everybody.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:49.486
And it keeps evolving.

00:36:49.486 --> 00:36:51.110
And it has to keep evolving.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:55.610
And it keeps going in the
direction of our own interests.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.754
I write in the book that pop
culture characters don't die.

00:36:58.754 --> 00:36:59.420
They don't live.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.046
They don't die.

00:37:00.046 --> 00:37:02.586
The thing that happens to them
is that we might lose interest

00:37:02.586 --> 00:37:03.390
in them.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.110
So if you look at a franchise,
like a character like Dick

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:11.100
Tracy right now, Dick
Tracy seems to me--

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.370
if people even
remember Dick Tracy.

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.590
There's not much action
happening on the Dick Tracy

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.280
front, right?

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.660
There was the
movie back in 1990.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.750
I guess the cartoon, the
comic is still being made.

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.511
Does he still talk into
the wrist radio thing?

00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:25.510
There's probably some
Dick Tracy fans out there.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.190
They're probably mostly
over the age of 40,

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.810
maybe over the age of 60.

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.520
And if you're going
to make something

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.230
that appeals to
people today, you

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.070
have to update it
to the present day.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.747
So I think the smarter--

00:37:37.747 --> 00:37:39.830
so some of what the "Star
Wars" franchise has done

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.160
is like, yeah, like
the time it was made,

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.930
there were way too
many guys in it.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.571
It's overwhelmingly white.

00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:49.070
If you want to update it today
and you want to actually make

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:53.210
it appeal to the people who
are the geeks today, absolutely

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:54.630
it should be much more diverse.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:59.780
And I think it's a
confluence of these things.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.870
As the geek
industries themselves

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.840
diversify as it becomes
more mainstream, as our pop

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.010
culture fights out
these political battles,

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.880
you're going to see
those trends continue.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.510
So the two things I think we can
say about geek culture is, one,

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.409
I don't think we're
anywhere near--

00:38:17.409 --> 00:38:19.700
as big as it is now, it's
going to keep getting bigger.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.550
And then, two, I
think also the side

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:26.120
is totally on the side of
greater diversity and all

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.460
those things in geek culture.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.293
That part seems to be
taking a bit of-- that

00:38:29.293 --> 00:38:31.160
seems to be lagging
behind a bit more.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.440
I think 2014, 2016
have kind of been

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.196
inflection points with Gamergate
and then the election of Trump.

00:38:36.196 --> 00:38:38.570
I think a lot of these things
have bubbled to the surface

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:39.945
and really broke
through in a way

00:38:39.945 --> 00:38:41.660
and created
visibility for forces

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:45.734
that people weren't paying
attention to before that.

00:38:45.734 --> 00:38:47.900
JOSH PYLE: So we have just
a couple of minutes left.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.120
In just a minute, we're
going to open up for Q&amp;A. So

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.370
be thinking of your questions.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:55.530
And the microphone is
just right over there.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.250
So be thinking about that.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:02.310
We only have time probably
for one question from me.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:06.062
So I'm thinking
from the list here.

00:39:06.062 --> 00:39:08.270
So let's talk about diverse
experiences a little bit.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:09.811
So in the book, you
talk a little bit

00:39:09.811 --> 00:39:12.810
of how you'd love to experience
the "Star Trek" holodeck.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:17.630
And I think you also mentioned
in the book about holodeck

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.052
addiction, right?

00:39:19.052 --> 00:39:20.510
But the point I'm
really getting to

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:24.050
is around new technologies and
the use of new technologies.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.747
We could go on a
lot of territory

00:39:25.747 --> 00:39:27.830
here, but the use of
technology for storytelling--

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.240
I think that's
where I would like

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.470
to get your opinions for
emerging storytellers,

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.020
people who are thinking
about world-building,

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.304
who know that they
have to create rich,

00:39:38.304 --> 00:39:40.220
dense stories if they're
going to be the Harry

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.760
Potter of 10 years from now.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.619
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah, so I
mentioned that the way I define

00:39:45.619 --> 00:39:46.910
a geek in the book are people--

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.410
it's again this intersection
between people who like fantasy

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.180
and the supernatural, whatever
that entails, and then try

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.540
to bring a more
technical or scientific

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.647
or engineering based
mindset to bear upon it.

00:39:58.647 --> 00:40:00.730
And they want to see the
intersection of those two

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:01.780
things.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.507
That's a large part of why
geeks like realism, is because

00:40:05.507 --> 00:40:07.090
in a lot of ways,
what they want to do

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.790
is they want to produce this
sense that the other world

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:12.130
actually exists as much
as possible, like we

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:14.080
saw with the role-playing game.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.960
So any kind of technology
that allows them to do that,

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.960
if you think about it--
a movie is a technology

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.070
for having a fantasy.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.990
A book is a technology
for having a fantasy.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.130
A comic book is that.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.390
And I think a lot of geeks,
what they're driven then to do

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:31.224
is to try to create
immersive experiences that

00:40:31.224 --> 00:40:32.890
allow them to actually
feel like they're

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:38.217
living in that other world
and having that experience.

00:40:38.217 --> 00:40:39.550
They want it to be as complete--

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:40.924
you want to actually
be in there,

00:40:40.924 --> 00:40:42.430
and you want to
be able to believe

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:45.070
you're actually in that world
and forgot that you were--

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:46.541
I mean, I know I do.

00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:48.040
I would like more
than anything else

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.930
to go live on the
Starship Enterprise.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:51.720
It seems like a much
better place than--

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.015
and particularly the Next
Generation Enterprise.

00:40:54.015 --> 00:40:55.390
It just seems like
a better place

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.880
than a lot of where
we currently live.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.410
I'd love to live in that world.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:02.292
So if somebody actually could
build a replica of the Starship

00:41:02.292 --> 00:41:04.750
Enterprise, and I could actually
just go walk around in it,

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.989
that would be my
life's dream come true.

00:41:06.989 --> 00:41:09.280
It's like the best I'm going
to get if I can't actually

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.950
go live in that world.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.436
If somebody creates
a virtual reality

00:41:14.436 --> 00:41:17.060
headset, where I could actually
experience that, I'd love that.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.730
And I think one of the
things you're seeing,

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.770
people are trying to do
that with VR and stuff.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.920
But one of the more
recent evolutions,

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.490
and I'm not surprised by this,
is the creation of theme parks

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.967
that are modeled around
particular brands,

00:41:30.967 --> 00:41:32.800
so like the Wizarding
World of Harry Potter,

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.410
where you go in,
you got the wand,

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.240
you can actually
interact with things.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.190
Again, it's like you're
going to Hogwarts.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.640
It's like this
amazing experience.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.620
They're doing it with "Avatar."

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.036
They're doing it
with "Star Wars."

00:41:43.036 --> 00:41:46.090
So I think, again, they're
trying to figure out,

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:48.190
because they have this
demographic, how they can

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:51.130
create that
experience for people

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.057
who will go and
will spend-- like I

00:41:53.057 --> 00:41:54.140
want this particular wand.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.680
I will spend $80 on it
and have that experience.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.600
So yeah, from any tech--

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.390
it could be VR, it
could be 3D movies,

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.060
it could be video games.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.670
It could be just
building the things.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.587
People like to build
replicas of things and stuff.

00:42:09.587 --> 00:42:11.170
But to have that
immersive experience.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:14.130
JOSH PYLE: Yeah,
immersive, real, lived in.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.796
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah,
a realist-- yeah, it

00:42:15.796 --> 00:42:17.400
should look like an actual
other world you've gone to.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.110
JOSH PYLE: Yeah.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:19.320
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.352
It's like my cell phone
screen is cracked,

00:42:21.352 --> 00:42:23.560
so why shouldn't the droids
have some scuffs on them.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.290
That's what the real
world looks like.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:28.584
We get hurt, so our
characters should get hurt.

00:42:28.584 --> 00:42:29.250
JOSH PYLE: Yeah.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.430
It's true.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:33.020
All right, so we have
time for a few questions.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.460
The microphone is over there.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.903
So feel free to
step up to the mic.

00:42:37.903 --> 00:42:38.444
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:38.444 --> 00:42:41.180
Thank you for coming
to talk to us.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.200
I actually was an English
major and a fantasy nerd.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.900
But I was a Victorianist,
so I definitely

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.560
identify with your high and low
concept in literary criticism

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.110
idea.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.840
And so my undergraduate
dissertation

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.890
was on Jacques Derrida's concept
of the archive, fan fiction,

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:00.597
copyright, and Tolkien.

00:43:00.597 --> 00:43:01.730
A.D. JAMESON: Wow, good.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.440
AUDIENCE: And the Tolkien
estate was very, very anti

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:12.530
the fandom participating
in and extending the--

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:16.200
basically he went after a
lot of copyright issues.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.972
And I've watched
that kind of evolve,

00:43:17.972 --> 00:43:19.430
and I'm very curious
what you think

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:23.870
about how fandoms are kind
of appropriating things,

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.750
continuing to expand
universes, and then

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.840
that fight between
what's canon, what's not,

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.357
where they step on copyright
issues, these sorts of issues

00:43:34.357 --> 00:43:35.940
that you're getting
to talk about now.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.050
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah, I have a
background in Victorian studies

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.830
myself, too.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:46.370
And actually, it's related,
because the Victorians had--

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:48.526
you see an explosion
of literacy and reading

00:43:48.526 --> 00:43:49.400
in Victorian culture.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.550
And to this day, one of the
conflicts in Victorian studies

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.620
is like, what are the
actual works of literature?

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.420
What are the more
genre [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.210
So that's part of the
relationship, my interest

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.670
in those two things.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:04.790
Yeah, the Tolkien estate is
a funny one, because they--

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:08.300
when they first
approached Tolkien

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.137
like in the '60s about
making a movie out

00:44:10.137 --> 00:44:11.720
of "The Lord of the
Rings," they could

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.140
see it was growing in
popularity, among especially

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.840
young people, hippies.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.380
And his agent said to him, well,
do you want them to do this?

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:26.790
And Tolkien said
one of two things.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:28.930
If they won't give
me any money for it,

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.950
then we should
insist on high art,

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:32.690
like it should be a great film.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:33.650
But if they'll give
me a lot of money,

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:35.025
then I don't care
what they make.

00:44:35.025 --> 00:44:36.840
[LAUGHS] It was like
one or the other.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.780
And they actually ended
up selling the rights,

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.120
and then the rights-- there's
a really interesting book

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:47.650
on this called "The Frodo
Franchise" by Kristin Thompson,

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:51.860
where she went through the whole
history of how the rights were

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.170
caught up in legal battles
and why really the movie is

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:55.940
in some ways, besides
the animated versions,

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.315
didn't really end
up getting made

00:44:57.315 --> 00:45:00.170
until the late 90s, early 2000s.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:02.780
But yeah, the Tolkien
estate, though,

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.480
has tried to control
in a lot of ways.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.060
And they don't like the
Peter Jackson movies.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.700
And they're like, you're never
making "The Silmarillion," et

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.550
cetera, et cetera.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.870
And they also claim they
never got any of the money

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:16.590
from it and stuff.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.700
But the thing about
it is I understand

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.324
that if you're talking
about officially

00:45:20.324 --> 00:45:21.890
licensed Tolkien
stuff, but at point,

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:23.360
the copyright will run out.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.600
But I'm a real firm
believer that pop culture

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.530
belongs to everybody.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.390
Anyone who's interested
in it, anybody

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:31.370
who reads it and has a--

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:35.362
when I was a kid, I loved
Lloyd Alexander novels,

00:45:35.362 --> 00:45:36.320
the Prydain Chronicles.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.190
They were some of the first
books I fell in love with.

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:40.606
They made a Disney film, "The
Black Caldron," out of them.

00:45:40.606 --> 00:45:42.470
They're supposedly
trying to make a TV show.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.389
And I sat there, and I wrote--

00:45:44.389 --> 00:45:46.430
like those books end if
you get to the fifth one.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:47.120
They end.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.910
But I wrote Prydain Chronicles,
Lloyd Alexander fan fiction.

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.560
And I imagined myself into
the stories and meeting

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.120
Taran and Eilonwy and Hen Wen,
all those characters and stuff.

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.870
And you can't stop
people from doing that.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:03.320
I don't see why
anybody would want to.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.140
Now, I think the question then
becomes, anybody can do that,

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.030
but then if other
people like it,

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.020
it will go on and have
a life outside that.

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.310
If you want to write your
own "Star Wars" fan fiction,

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:15.980
you can do that, or your
own "Lord of the Rings" fan

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:16.580
fiction.

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:21.050
But it doesn't mean anybody else
is going to want to read it.

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:24.140
But the things that people
like will go on and become

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:29.480
fan favorites and maybe will
eventually get picked up

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.080
by these companies, I think.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.230
I think they're actually
foolish if they ignore

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:37.220
those segments of the fan base.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:40.820
Like with "Star Wars," it's
like Mara Jade is clearly

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.070
a beloved character in
the Star Wars universe.

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.400
Why they have not introduced
her into the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.900
I just think that's
foolish of them.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.330
They should, that kind of thing.

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:49.910
And similarly, if
there's somebody--

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:52.430
I'm not quite as up on
Tolkien fan fiction,

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:53.900
but if there's
somebody out there

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.610
who's writing really good
Tolkien fan fiction and people

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.470
like it, I think they
should look to that

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.270
and maybe try to
adopt it or something.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:00.645
AUDIENCE: I always
thought it was

00:47:00.645 --> 00:47:02.061
really interesting
because Tolkien

00:47:02.061 --> 00:47:05.200
himself was such a scholar
of Norwegian mythology,

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.020
Greek mythology.

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.490
He was basically
ripping off a lot

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:11.330
of archival, universal
stuff anyway.

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:13.190
So I thought it was
a bit hypocritical.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.250
A.D. JAMESON: Oh, yeah, like
the stuff comes from "Beowulf."

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.860
It comes from the
"Nibelungen," it's

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.640
like he took stuff
left and right.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.480
I mean, culture
belongs to everybody.

00:47:28.749 --> 00:47:29.670
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:31.630
Thanks for coming.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:33.590
I'm just wondering in
your definition of geek

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:36.550
and focusing on people who
are interested in STEM,

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:40.120
it seems to exclude a large
portion of the mainstream

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.495
people who might
identify as geek

00:47:41.495 --> 00:47:42.790
and are starting to--
like the kind of people

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.706
who are really excited
about "Big Bang Theory"

00:47:44.706 --> 00:47:46.260
or you mentioned "Harry Potter."

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.720
How do you see those
two worlds intersecting?

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.840
Where's the middle there?

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:54.260
There's certainly people who
travel in between those worlds.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.610
What's in the middle?

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:57.692
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah,
I do define "geek"

00:47:57.692 --> 00:47:58.900
a particular way in the book.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.350
And in a lot of ways,
what the book is about

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:03.610
is the past 40 years
of geek culture.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:07.180
It's kind of how we've had
40 years of "Star Wars" now.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.370
How did the "Star
Wars" franchise

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.310
grow up and change
in those 40 years?

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.380
And how did geek culture change
during that time period, too?

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.070
And it's changed a lot.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:19.992
And it's going to keep changing.

00:48:19.992 --> 00:48:21.950
One of the things that
is happening, of course,

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:25.130
is that as it becomes
more mainstream,

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:27.530
the definition of it is
becoming a lot more diffuse.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.500
And that's just an
inevitable-- again,

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.083
it's not that different
from something

00:48:31.083 --> 00:48:32.290
like punk going mainstream.

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.331
Punk music is something
I'm really interested in.

00:48:34.331 --> 00:48:37.952
And if you go back
in time to 1976, who

00:48:37.952 --> 00:48:40.410
would identify as a punk or
being interested in punk music?

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:42.266
It's a very specialized thing.

00:48:42.266 --> 00:48:43.390
Because it is a subculture.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:44.740
It's a small culture.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.780
Even by the time you
get to 1978, 1979,

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.660
what counts as punk music
was already really diffuse.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:54.330
And nowadays, what counts as
that is all over the place.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:57.312
So there's nothing to stop that.

00:48:57.312 --> 00:48:59.770
And I don't even think it's a
thing that should be stopped.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.780
As geek culture goes
mainstream, you're

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.030
going to see something that
maybe was more of a highly

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:08.495
specialized term or it was
more specific in a couple

00:49:08.495 --> 00:49:10.120
of different identities
it referred to.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.650
But it's going to expand.

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:14.920
And so, yeah, I think
you have very casual geek

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.080
fans these days.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.880
That's how it is.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.676
I mean, in a lot of ways, people
who are like hardcore geeks

00:49:22.676 --> 00:49:24.550
and stuff should be
really grateful for that.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:29.467
Because if it were
just the geeks,

00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:31.300
like if you go back in
time, how many people

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:36.010
would have shown up to watch an
"Avengers" movie in like 1975?

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.810
It probably wouldn't
have made any money.

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:39.709
So they wouldn't have
been able to make it.

00:49:39.709 --> 00:49:42.250
If you liked "Infinity War," if
you like the Marvel Cinematic

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.694
Universe, if you
liked the fact--

00:49:44.694 --> 00:49:46.860
the fact that "Infinity
War" just crossed $2 billion

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.840
globally, the only way it can
do that is if a lot of people

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.590
beyond--

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:53.027
there's a lot more geeks
now than there used to be.

00:49:53.027 --> 00:49:54.610
But even if all the
geeks in the world

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:56.530
showed up and saw
it like 10 times,

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:59.020
it still wouldn't make
$2 billion globally.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.230
It wouldn't even come close.

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:02.650
So there's a lot of people
who are more casual fans who

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:03.740
are showing up as well.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:07.150
And look, if they want to say
they're geeks, like whatever.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:08.260
They're geeks.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.284
I mean, I think of it
more as a spectrum.

00:50:11.284 --> 00:50:12.700
On one level, it's
like people who

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.310
are just kind of like the most
casual fans you can imagine.

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:19.427
And then at the other end, you
have the most die-hard fans

00:50:19.427 --> 00:50:21.760
who know every single thing
and are completely obsessed.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.180
And I'm not even
at that end myself.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.180
I don't know where I am.

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.346
I'm someone on the spectrum.

00:50:26.346 --> 00:50:29.710
I'm probably closer to
the more enfranchised end.

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:32.740
But maybe it's only like 75%.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.240
Trust me, in writing
this book, I've

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.860
met people who are
far more into it

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:39.050
than I am and are
far more into it.

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:43.480
I know people who all they wear
at home is a Starfleet uniform.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.740
So it's like, that's great.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.740
And then on the other
hand, you have some people

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.430
who just want to go to
Target and buy a T-shirt,

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:49.221
and they're a geek.

00:50:49.221 --> 00:50:51.030
And that's-- you know.

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:52.870
But that's the sign
that it's going

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:54.520
mainstream, the fact that--

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.260
I think it's in many
ways a lovely thing

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:59.650
that it's something that's
more accessible to people

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:02.311
and they can choose their
level of engagement with it.

00:51:02.311 --> 00:51:03.310
Its doesn't have to be--

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.360
because it used to be like
if you wanted to read--

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.360
again, I go back to "X-Men"
comics in the '80s, but if you

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.609
wanted to read these things,
it was hard to find them.

00:51:09.609 --> 00:51:13.640
And I'm happier now that they're
accessible to more people.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.710
So does that answer
the question?

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:17.156
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks.

00:51:17.156 --> 00:51:19.564
I also selfishly
appreciate that it's

00:51:19.564 --> 00:51:22.230
going more mainstream, because I
think it encourages more gender

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.990
diversity.

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:25.990
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah, totally.

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:27.940
AUDIENCE: Howdy.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:30.337
I have not read your book yet.

00:51:30.337 --> 00:51:31.170
And at the risk of--

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:32.810
A.D. JAMESON: I forgive you.

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.060
[LAUGHS] We have copies.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.570
AUDIENCE: At the
risk of giving away

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.080
in the nucleus of
your argument, I

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.070
want to know what
interpretation I can expect

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:43.480
to take away from the title.

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.440
"I find your lack of
faith disturbing."

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.850
How do you tie that in?

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:48.726
A.D. JAMESON: Yeah, so
when I wrote the book,

00:51:48.726 --> 00:51:51.058
I was just calling it "Star
Wars and the Triumph of Geek

00:51:51.058 --> 00:51:51.660
Culture."

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.160
And my publisher
said to me, we have

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.890
to have a thing to
put in front of that.

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:56.390
And I said--

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:57.794
I said, well, why?

00:51:57.794 --> 00:51:59.210
And they said,
because we have to.

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:00.410
And I said, OK.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.190
So I mean, that
was their decision.

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:05.669
So then they said to me, they
said, we want to call it--

00:52:05.669 --> 00:52:06.710
what was it they wanted--

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:08.411
they said, we want to call it--

00:52:08.411 --> 00:52:09.984
oh, man, I wish I
could think of it.

00:52:09.984 --> 00:52:12.400
They had another line from
"Star Wars" they wanted to use.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.880
And it was terrible.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.340
Because it sounded like I
was insulting geek culture.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.284
It will come back
to me what it was.

00:52:19.284 --> 00:52:21.200
Oh, it was, "I Have a
Bad Feeling About This--

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.160
Star Wars and the
Triumph of Geek Culture."

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.542
And I said, first
of all, I said,

00:52:23.542 --> 00:52:26.000
that's like the biggest "Star
Wars" cliche you can possibly

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.030
imagine.

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:29.000
And I said, it's also
just completely wrong.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.060
I love my publisher.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.040
FSG is a great press.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.665
They're a bit more
of a literary press.

00:52:32.665 --> 00:52:34.940
They're not so much a geekier--

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.120
even like the science
fiction stuff they do,

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.070
they tend to do things
like the Southern Reach

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:40.820
trilogy and stuff.

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:42.320
So it's a little
more like literary.

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.278
They want to call it
speculative fiction stuff.

00:52:44.278 --> 00:52:48.327
So anyway, I said, no, no,
no, that's completely wrong.

00:52:48.327 --> 00:52:50.160
So then I was like, OK,
I'm on the hook now.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.050
I better come up with a better
expression, a better line

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:53.633
from "Star Wars" or
else they're going

00:52:53.633 --> 00:52:55.067
to completely ruin this book.

00:52:55.067 --> 00:52:57.150
And you should have seen
the cover they originally

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.670
wanted to put on this, too.

00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:00.660
It was like this sad, emo Darth
Vader like crying or something.

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.920
I was like, guys, you're
not marketing this book

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.420
to hipsters.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.628
You're marketing it to geeks.

00:53:04.628 --> 00:53:05.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.301
So, and there's an intersection
between geeks and hipsters,

00:53:08.301 --> 00:53:08.800
too.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.620
But I said, this is
a book for geeks.

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.631
And so this book is a
defense of geek culture,

00:53:12.631 --> 00:53:13.880
like I want to defend what's--

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.480
there's plenty of
books and articles

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.190
out there telling you what's
wrong with geek culture.

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:18.606
This is a defense
of geek culture,

00:53:18.606 --> 00:53:21.450
and it's a defense of
it on artistic grounds,

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:22.937
moral grounds, cultural grounds.

00:53:22.937 --> 00:53:25.020
It's like a full-throated
defense of geek culture.

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:29.410
So I said, well,
how about this one?

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.246
I actually went through.

00:53:31.246 --> 00:53:32.620
I just watched
"Star Wars" again.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.420
I wrote down anything that could
possibly be a title in front of

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.797
And finally I went,
OK, how about,

00:53:36.797 --> 00:53:38.421
"I find your lack of
faith disturbing,"

00:53:38.421 --> 00:53:40.630
because I thought that
one works because it means

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:41.810
two different things, right?

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:43.030
Like it's true.

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:45.460
If you're a geek, on some
level, when you meet non-geeks,

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.876
especially if you find out
those non-geeks are going to be

00:53:47.876 --> 00:53:50.740
in charge of making the new
"Star Wars" movie or the new--

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.760
you get scared.

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:54.220
Because you find their
lack of faith disturbing.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.890
It's like you don't want them
to be in charge of making--

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:58.640
the best example would
be like Michael Bay

00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.920
making the "Transformers"
movies, right?

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.529
A lot of people who are geeks
hate the "Transformers" movies

00:54:02.529 --> 00:54:03.820
because they're not very geeky.

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:07.120
And so when Michael Bay was
going make "Turtles" movies,

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.470
people get scared, right?

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:10.330
So there's that.

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:12.760
You want to find out instead
that people you trust

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.802
and who are fellow geeks
are making these things.

00:54:14.802 --> 00:54:16.468
But at the same time,
I think the people

00:54:16.468 --> 00:54:18.040
who are outside
geek culture, there

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.270
is something a little like--

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:24.130
it looks a bit maybe like a
cult or a religion or something.

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.620
So it kind of goes both ways.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:28.450
It is like these geeks--

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:30.280
and again, that's from
my own experience.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:33.460
I remember being 15
years old, 14 years old

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.260
and going over to
my friends' houses

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:38.394
and talking to their parents
about the "Princess Bride"

00:54:38.394 --> 00:54:40.810
and why they should watch it
and probably talking about it

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:43.240
for like an hour and them
being like, why is he just

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:48.160
talking about this, this movie
and this book for like an hour?

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:48.940
It's crazy.

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:49.630
It's absurd.

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:51.770
So yeah, it kind of
cuts both ways, I think.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:54.760
So I wanted to get that
duality in the title,

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.040
if that makes sense.

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.164
But they made me put
something on the front.

00:54:59.164 --> 00:55:00.830
I wouldn't have thought
of it on my own.

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:01.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:03.487
That's a market
force at work on me.

00:55:03.487 --> 00:55:05.320
I don't know why they
had to have the title,

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.692
but they say it sells better
if you have the title.

00:55:08.692 --> 00:55:11.150
Although now they refer to it
as "I Find Your Lack of Faith

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:12.500
Disturbing," and
I'm like, I'd rather

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.100
call it "Star Wars and
Triumph of Geek Culture."

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.808
That gets more to what
the book is about.

00:55:15.808 --> 00:55:20.430
But they keep calling it "I Find
Your Lack of Faith Disturbing."

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.790
JOSH PYLE: All right,
and with that, I

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:25.040
think we have come to
the end of the hour.

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.870
I would love to
ask more questions,

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:28.837
but we have to sadly end.

00:55:28.837 --> 00:55:30.920
But thankfully, you're
going to be sticking around

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:31.485
for a few minutes.

00:55:31.485 --> 00:55:33.710
A.D. JAMESON: Oh, yeah, and if
people want me to sign copies

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:36.210
or if you had a question and
you didn't get a chance to ask,

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:37.254
I'd love to hear it.

00:55:37.254 --> 00:55:39.170
JOSH PYLE: We have books
for sale in the back.

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:41.000
And Adam will be
sticking around.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.296
The book is "I Find Your
Lack of Faith Disturbing--

00:55:43.296 --> 00:55:45.170
'Star Wars' and the
Triumph of Geek Culture."

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.770
Thanks, Adam.

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:46.260
A.D. JAMESON: Thank you.

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:47.010
And thanks to everybody.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.176
JOSH PYLE: Thanks, everyone.

00:55:48.176 --> 00:55:51.260
[APPLAUSE]
