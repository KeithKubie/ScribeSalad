00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.140
Puberty is awkward enough for teenagers, but
now puberty is starting to occur in children

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.799
as young as first grade…

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.870
What is happening here and what should we
do about it?!

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.430
Hey there girls and boys, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.570
In the mid-19th century, puberty didn't start
until the later teen years.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.000
By the mid-20th century, it was pre-teen,
and today, the National Institutes of Health

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.880
says it starts between the ages of 8-13 for
girls and 9-14 for boys.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.860
But, and I don't say this often, those numbers
aren't really accurate…

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.560
Research is showing puberty can start for
African-American girls as early as SIX!

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.610
Those girls are in first grade.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.789
We all learn puberty starts at different times
for different individuals, but when it starts

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.079
super early like before age 7 or 8 for girls,
and before 9 for boys, it's called precocious

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.079
puberty.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.109
This has happened throughout history, but
usually due to glandular disorders or a tumor

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.170
pressing on the pituitary gland.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.600
Some scientists believe precocious puberty
is getting more common.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.260
The age of menarche, or the first menstruation,
has gotten younger by four months every decade

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.550
for every social, economic, ethnic and racial
group from the mid-1800s until the 1960s,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.330
and doctors aren't sure why… theories propose
it could be improved health, nutrition, obesity,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.930
or even environmental factors like plastic
chemicals, smoking, family structure… studies

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.110
have even found emotional stress -- like when
a girl has a depressed father, a child is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
adopted into a foreign country, or a child
is exposed to war -- can all cause early-onset

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.970
puberty.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:31.970
SO MANY THINGS.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.140
To be honest, no one really knows why, they
just know it is happening for both boys and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.140
girls.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.171
We have a video explaining some of these theories
if you want to know more, but today, we wanted

00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:42.860
to know why it matters.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.460
It turns out early puberty, and precocious
puberty, can cause some pretty serious side-effects,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.340
because puberty is not just one thing.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.990
Instead, it's a whole series of changes to
the body over time.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.220
Puberty is our biology is setting us up for
sexual maturity, offspring creation, and adulthood.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.320
So if it starts earlier, that will affect
the rest of that kid's life.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.480
For example, the bones have growth plates.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.130
During puberty kids get a growth spurt, but
if that spurt starts earlier (like at age

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.150
six instead of a few years later), the bones
will grow and stop -- causing the person to

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.300
be shorter.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.209
That's right, early puberty causes short stature.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.010
On top of that, the earlier onset can change
how the child sees their 'chronological peers'

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.470
as they may more closely identify with 'biological
peers' who may be older.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.001
This "loss of childhood," as it was referred
to in some of the research I read, can cause

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:35.810
children to become more sexually active at
a younger age, abuse alcohol or tobacco, have

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.719
lower academic achievement and delinquency,
and put the kids at a higher risk for developing

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:41.719
depression.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.200
On top of that, they could develop eating
disorders because puberty often causes weight

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.829
gain, and puberty literally has been shown
to make girls more cognizant of the relationship

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.220
between diet, exercise, and weight.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.859
There are even more serious risks like adult-onset
asthma, type 2 diabetes, and breast cancer!

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.319
Even though no one really knows entirely why
this is happening, it's important to note,

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.920
physically maturing early does not mean a
child is prepared for adulthood mentally.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.890
Yes the brain is changing during puberty as
well as the body, but the rational part of

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.620
the brain doesn't stop developing until age
25.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.529
People are people, and we can't always control
our biology, but we can control our social

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.030
reactions to it.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.150
So keeping open and honest communication will
go a long way to helping young-adults adjust!

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.279
It is the new normal; it's nothing to be ashamed
of, and increasing awareness and acceptance

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:36.999
while scientists do more research on why it's
happening will help everyone understand it

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:38.499
better, we hope.

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.290
Knowing yourself and your body can be incredibly
empowering.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.110
TLC has this show called 'I Am Jazz' about
a transgender teen who has a whole different

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.590
picture of the regular drama of going through
adolescence.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.590
And you can watch it now by downloading TLCGo
-- the app will let you watch all the episodes

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.639

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:18.500
Do you remember going through puberty?

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.930
What was the worst part for you?

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.879
I kept getting GIANT ZITS right on my nose.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.729
It was the WORST.
