00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,730
Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab. Today's topic,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,900
parasites, where we have already
learned that parasites can be good.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,390
Sometimes Harris' fades
can of course be very bad.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,050
That also parasites can affect
human behavior. Making this,

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,350
some of us a little lethargic
or solving our allergies. Yeah.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,580
Here's the question to consider though.
Can they not just affect our behavior?

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,880
Can they control our behavior and
different question in time? Yeah.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,130
And you know, we were, we were
thinking about this question, you know,

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,560
in the abstract doing some research,

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,770
but then things got kind of real when
our producer Ellen Horn called in late to

11
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:37,274
work one day.

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,550
Hey Lulu, it's Alan. I just
got home from the, that um,

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,380
I've been waiting on chest x
rays, um, blood work from my cat.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,270
She managed staff to meet with
them. This is my cat, my big,

15
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:52,840
lovely affectionate kitty. She's like
the sweetest cat you will ever meet.

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,540
I've met Louis. He's a very sweet cat.
He's a darling. But Moose has, uh,

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,040
digestion problems.

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,980
And this one day I had to take her to
the vet and as I was putting her into the

19
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,330
kitty carrier,

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,620
she managed the scratch me with her
bat claws and like a bloody wound on my

21
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:15,860
hand. Her back claws are
like totally pooped covered.

22
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:19,310
So I'm kind of worried I
have six months pregnant.

23
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,200
The very first thing that they tell you
when you get pregnant is stay away from

24
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:29,180
cat poop. So after it happened, I called
my with my CSC. Are you ready for me?

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,410
Yeah. She told me to rush right down
to her office to bled pretty profusely.

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,970
H did. Wait a second. Why? What's
so scary about cat poop? Well,

27
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:42,971
it turns out that cat poop can have in
it this tiny parasite called Toxoplasma

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,420
Gondii. Well what is the threat to
the baby if it gets to the baby?

29
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,100
It can cause miscarriage.

30
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,140
It can cause stillbirth and it can
also cause seizures, blindness.

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,760
So you're, you're, you're
freaking out at this point. Yeah,

32
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,400
I'm kind of freaking out the,
this cranium small head. Ah.

33
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,440
My midwife said there's probably nothing
to worry about. So just took my blood.

34
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,160
That's probably the better arm.

35
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,490
Can you say question yet?
And she sent me home.

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,880
The turnaround time for the test is
between two and three days. Okay. Okay.

37
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:22,180
So I'm looking, um, the Antoinette, yeah.

38
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,860
At home I proceed to get
myself even more freaked out.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,680
A bunch of things about toxoplasma.

40
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,070
One of the things that I found was
this lecture by Robert Sapolsky.

41
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,170
Tell me an example I'm talking about here.

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,520
He's a neuroscientist who
we've had on the show.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,090
It has to do with a
parasite called Toxoplasma.

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,430
And um, I just decided that
I was going to call them up.

45
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,360
Hello and ask a few questions.
Okay. So what's the deal with Toxo?

46
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,850
And he proceeded to tell me one of the
most amazing zinc feats of mind control,

47
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,360
but I'd ever heard one.
What'd he tell you? Well,

48
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,460
the first thing he me is that toxo

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,860
doesn't actually want to be in me. Yes.

50
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:07,150
It really has wandered off into the
wrong county. If it winds up in a human,

51
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,800
it wants to be inside Moose
for totally mysterious reasons,

52
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,600
at least to me. Toxo can only
reproduce sexually in the gut of cat,

53
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,860
so it's there in mooses intestines
that the toxoplasma meet and hook up.

54
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,570
Then they lay eggs.

55
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,470
Next Moose takes a trip to the backyard
where she EGX those eggs in her put.

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,880
See what's out there now on the cat
feces. Step two says, suppose key is that,

57
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,380
you know, maybe a week later a rat
will come along and eat the cat poop.

58
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,260
Now toxo has a problem.

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,040
It's stuck inside a rat that
really wants to be inside a cat,

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,080
but rats totally freak out whenever
they so much as even smell cat.

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,290
It's, it's a hardwired aversion and talk.

62
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,540
Sue's evolutionary challenge now has
been to figure out how to get rodents

63
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,310
inside cat stomachs.

64
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,340
Here is where the mind control comes
in and it's kind of hard to believe,

65
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,760
but this is what supposed to be says
happens. Toxo starts off in the stomach.

66
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,930
The welding takes about six weeks to
migrate its way up to the brain and once

67
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:22,760
it's in there, it finds this
particular region called the Amygdala,

68
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,820
which isn't like command central
for year end design error,

69
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,580
all of that.

70
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,990
It also finds this other region kind of
right next door where a very different

71
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:34,860
emotion, legs sexual around.

72
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,110
So one way he ran way in what talks so
seems to be able to do is to somehow

73
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,670
cross the wires. This may be some
horrifically simplified sound bite,

74
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,660
but what I think is going on is the
talkshow knows how to make cat urine smell

75
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:53,700
sexy. What to rodents,

76
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,950
which that is so likable, totally bizarre.

77
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,980
But talk soap makes rodents like the
smell of cats and thus they approach

78
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,260
and they're more likely to wind up
in the cat stomach. That's rough.

79
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,280
Yeah. In all other ways. The
written is totally normal.

80
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,480
Normal olfaction in normal social
behavior. Just hot for cats.

81
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,470
Oh good, good. I start to wonder.
Well, this really likes the microphone.

82
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,630
I love cats. Yeah. Is it possible
that Toxo Lucy is wonderful,

83
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,470
is what's been drawing me to cats.
Sorry, we let her put her for everywhere.

84
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,930
I ask him pure speculation, but people
who think about this stuff with you,

85
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:41,700
it is not just purely speculative.

86
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,120
The notion that talk so can produce some
sort of attraction to cats and humans.

87
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,530
They don't think that's
all that crazy, Lisa.

88
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,990
So you're saying that like the crazy
cat lady could be toxoplasma? Well,

89
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,890
no one's really studied
that yet. Testing, testing.

90
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,360
But there are scientists out there that
are making the case that talks o can

91
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,450
really change you. Okay.

92
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,770
Probably the most interesting
established link is between Toxo and

93
00:06:07,771 --> 00:06:08,604
schizophrenia.

94
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,270
Are you Dr Tori? Yep. There's
actually been last count,

95
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,300
54 studies on Toxoplasma in people
with schizophrenia and other psychosis.

96
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,920
That's Dr. Fuller Torrey.

97
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,670
He works at the Stanley Medical Research
Institute that sponsors a lot of these

98
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:25,180
studies. Well,

99
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,750
I've been doing research on schizophrenia
since the early seventies anything?

100
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,770
So there's a link. Yeah,

101
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,820
not a huge effect. Very,

102
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:36,200
very small risk of schizophrenia simply
because schizophrenia is very rare.

103
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,110
Well, why would it cause
schizophrenia to begin with?

104
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,670
Is it trying to cause schizophrenia?

105
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,440
Is that you imagine if the Toxo
is sort of lost in the brain.

106
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,010
It thinks it's in a rat brain.

107
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,310
Maybe it's just trying to do
what it usually does to rats,

108
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:51,400
but in humans it has a very
different effect. Nice.

109
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,470
And one of the reasons he
thinks this might be true,

110
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,480
this connection between Toxoplasma and
schizophrenia is because of a historical

111
00:06:58,481 --> 00:06:58,750
link.

112
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,750
The fact that what we now
call schizophrenia was quite
rare until the late part

113
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:09,340
of the 18th century. And
then during the 18 hundreds,

114
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,490
schizophrenia increased very rapidly. Why?

115
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,900
This was the first time when we
started to keep catches pets.

116
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,480
They first were adopted by the um,

117
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,990
kind of east Greenwich
village types in parish,

118
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,440
the artists. And it was really
considered kind of weird,

119
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:32,830
but it's the kind of thing that if you
were an artist or writer or something

120
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:33,400
like that,

121
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,990
you started to do a mini kind of spread
to London now where the writers and

122
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:42,160
artists kept it there. And then
starting in about the 1840s,

123
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,800
he had started to become
a little bit more popular.

124
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,030
And then in the 1860s and
seventies, it was what called a cat.

125
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,870
Crazy cats were all over bleeding cards.

126
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,270
The first cat show was at London
and 1870 and Madison Square Garden,

127
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:02,890
I agreed to 80 it became very
fashionable to have a cat,

128
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,750
we should say. I mean he'll agree at
this point it's just a theory. Okay.

129
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:12,460
But is there any evidence that toxo can
actually control our behavior like it

130
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:13,710
does with the rats? Well,

131
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,920
there are some scientists out there who
believe that toxo may affect something

132
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,540
more common to all. Okay,

133
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,930
here's another one of those gimme a
break. That's Robert Sapolsky. Again,

134
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,790
science fiction branches to the story.

135
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Two different groups independently have
seen people who are toxo infected have

136
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:36,020
two to four times the likelihood
of dying in car accidents.

137
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,420
Really? Yeah. And I asked him why,

138
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,510
insofar as toxo makes Rodens get
really imprudent about cat smells,

139
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,500
maybe toxo is making all sorts of
mammals get imprudent about anything that

140
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,330
they're normally a skittish about,

141
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:53,660
like your body hurdling
through space at a high speed.

142
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,690
So in the end it might be possible,

143
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,790
might be possible that talkshow
is guiding our emotions.

144
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,090
[inaudible]

145
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,820
changing who we are in some basic way.

146
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,890
And if you consider that toxo might
just be one of thousands of tiny little

147
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:17,580
parasites inside us pulling
our strings from the inside.

148
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,930
Well, that thought is pretty creepy.

149
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Even if the entire lesson with toxo is
a small subset of infected people now

150
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:32,430
have one half of 1% more likelihood
of wanting to drive really recklessly.

151
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,090
Um,

152
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:38,090
even lurking in that one half of 1% are
some serious implications for thinking

153
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,090
about freewill.

154
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,480
We haven't a clue the biology lurking in
the background that makes freewill seem

155
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:46,920
a little bit suspect.

156
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,790
Either way, whatever
happened with your test.

157
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,080
Whoa.

158
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,580
Well this is me with my midwife,
Barry Winter, my absence.

159
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,300
She's giving me the news,
whatever we find out from the Tux.

160
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,930
So test that you have had
past infection with toxoplasma

161
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,430
positive,

162
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,970
you're positive. Yeah, but my midwife
says that the baby's going to be okay.

163
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,560
So the baby look like she's small.
She looks like she's a nice size too.

164
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:20,210
A little bit on the larger size.

165
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,280
So not a baby I'd be worried
about and I believe her.

166
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,200
Thanks Helen. Sure.
