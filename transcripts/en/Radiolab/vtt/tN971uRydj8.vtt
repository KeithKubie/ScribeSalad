You're listening to radio lab from New York public radio, public radio,

2
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.203
w.

3
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.500
Y. Y. C. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.670
<v 2>I'm Jad Abumrad.</v>

5
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:20.060
I'm Robert Krulwich and this is Radiolab season three and let me start with a

6
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:20.900
story. Okay.

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.990
1893 an anthropologist friends Boaz goes to the woods of British Columbia.

8
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:30.590
He has a giant wax cylinder recorder with him and he records this guy

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.483
<v 3>singing and healing. So,</v>

10
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.573
<v 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.080
<v 3>and who? Who is this?</v>

12
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.170
This gentleman is an Indian from the [inaudible] tribe and his name will told is

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.673
[inaudible]

14
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.970
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.310
<v 0>what? At old castle. I was pronounced the castle at, I don't know,</v>

16
00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:52.840
I'm not quite sure how it would be pronounced.

17
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.630
<v 2>Daniel Mormon. He's an anthropologist.</v>

18
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.050
He's written a lot about Kessel because it's a neat story and it goes like this.

19
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
<v 1>The young Caslit begins as a skeptic.</v>

20
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.100
It was a skeptical about the activities of the shame and he thought they were

21
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.180
tricking people in some way. The Shaman or the village healers, very,

22
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.250
very powerful man. They were scary man.

23
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.070
He'd see them doing these dramatic healing rituals.

24
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.170
He thought they were full of it, and so he decided to go undercover one day.

25
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.440
Kessel approaches some of these shaman and asks if he can apprentice with them.

26
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.980
Yeah,

27
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.770
there's three or four of them taking them out into the woods and doors into a

28
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:31.930
clearing or something. I'm like, tell him a bunch of things,

29
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.010
or they taught him the songs

30
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.800
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

31
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.060
<v 1>he learned that stuff and eventually after he'd gained their trust a little,</v>

32
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.590
they taught him their best trick of all a trick that's widespread in the world

33
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:50.500
of shamanism. Will you find variations on it all over the world?

34
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.860
Here's what you do. They told them, get some feathers, some down feathers,

35
00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:55.220
and just tuck it in your tree quick, right?

36
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.330
Just stick it in your mouth secretly so that nobody knew that it was there.

37
00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.860
Then during the ritual,

38
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:01.720
let's say the patient is there and they're on the ground.

39
00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:05.110
Maybe their chest hurts. You lean down, literally get down.

40
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.430
If it's your mouth on the patient's chest and suck, and here's the last thing.

41
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.181
While you're sucking,

42
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:13.030
you bite the inside of your cheek to get some blood in there,

43
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:15.790
which mixes with the feathers. Then at the pivotal point,

44
00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:17.250
you throw your head back in

45
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.483
<v 3>car felt the feathers</v>

46
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.900
<v 0>which were now bloody and nasty,</v>

47
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.570
so you ended up at this bit of bloody down in the palm of your hand,

48
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.880
which you would then say is the disease which you have sucked out of the body of

49
00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:31.714
the patient.

50
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.460
<v 2>Kessel had learned all this and thought I knew it, those,</v>

51
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.790
<v 0>the problem was that part of the obligation of his apprenticeship was that</v>

52
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:43.130
whenever anybody asked, he had to go and treat them for free.

53
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:46.460
That was sort of part of the deal of being an apprentice and somebody from a

54
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:51.461
famous family called him to come and treat a daughter who was sick,

55
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.720
very sick according to the written account,

56
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.760
and so he went to see this family and he treated the girl and he went through

57
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.910
the songs that he sang.

58
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.630
Then he did the feather trick, which he knew was false.

59
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.810
Put the feathers in his mouth, get the inside of the tooth, pretended to set,

60
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.580
cough the whole thing out. And Lo and behold, she was healed. She was fine.

61
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:17.200
She was fine. She was, it was a great success. Wow. And what did he think? Well,

62
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:17.881
he, he,

63
00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:22.210
he clearly indicates a kind of ambiguity.

64
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.300
He knows that he was tricking her, but he also knows that she's better

65
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.970
<v 2>not convinced. Kessel had tries to trick again and again and again.</v>

66
00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:32.720
And every time he does it, it works. So at the end of the story,

67
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.790
he decides to become a healer.

68
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.300
Does that mean that he ends up believing in the lie that he set out to disprove?

69
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.190
<v 0>I think that he realizes that truth and lies are not that fundamentally</v>

70
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.750
different as we might think they are

71
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.060
<v 2>today on radio lab. We look at that,</v>

72
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.900
<v 5>the true healing power of lies, which she,</v>

73
00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:57.980
in medicine we call the placebo effect. No, no, we don't. What do you mean? No,

74
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.450
we don't? Well, it's actually called Plug Chabo pla cable. Who calls it that?

75
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.430
It was Latin scholars. I think it's a Latin word. [inaudible] lack word.

76
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.480
Why you call it the placebo effect.

77
00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.250
I'm going to try and figure it out how it works,

78
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.540
and then I'm going to tell some stories,

79
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.360
including one about a dramatically dressed gentleman.

80
00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:18.530
He dressed entirely in purple and maybe it was lacked who used a placebo effect

81
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.920
to make the ladies feel real good.

82
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.400
<v 2>That's all coming up on radio lab.</v>

83
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.923
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

84
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.380
<v 8>Steve [inaudible] documented [inaudible] eh? Yes. Speak [inaudible].</v>

85
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.600
I am somebody [inaudible] I cannot hear anything.

86
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.280
<v 2>We had a little trouble with the phone connection for Reseal Benedetti as a</v>

87
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:46.930
doctor at the Turin Medical Center in Italy and he's one of the most expert

88
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.910
experts on the placebo effect. Better? Yeah. Now I can hear you. Yes.

89
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:52.000
So we thought we'd start with him.

90
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.720
He's been studying the placebo effect for about 15 years. Yeah,

91
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.620
<v 8>I got too interested in the placebo effect because, uh,</v>

92
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.950
I realize that that sometimes the placebo group gets much better than,

93
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.780
uh, the active treatment group.

94
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.203
<v 2>Much, much better.</v>

95
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.970
<v 8>Yeah. Sometimes. Sometimes.</v>

96
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.870
<v 2>For what kind of stuff? Well, he saw it first in pain, pain,</v>

97
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.650
pain trials. Oh. And then he saw it in depression, oppression,

98
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.290
and then antidepressants. Right. And then digestions Jen immune response. Yes.

99
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.880
<v 5>All of these places where placebos were doing things they just were not supposed</v>

100
00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:29.220
to do.

101
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.890
<v 8>Yeah. It's really amazing. Particularly for some conditions like [inaudible].</v>

102
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.010
<v 2>This one's a little surprising</v>

103
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.690
<v 8>Parkinson's disease,</v>

104
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.340
<v 2>since there's the serious [inaudible] neurological disorder,</v>

105
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.500
people with Parkinson's have shakes, they have tremors.

106
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.190
Dr Benedetti treats a lot of these folks, and in the really bad cases,

107
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:48.790
the only treatment that really seems to work at all is surgery.

108
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:49.720
So these patients,

109
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:54.721
you open up the patient's skull and implant a little stimulator deep into their

110
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:55.720
brain,

111
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.790
<v 8>deep into the brain in two brain regions.</v>

112
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.690
<v 2>Essentially what that does is it hot wires,</v>

113
00:06:00.691 --> 00:06:02.910
the parts of the brain that aren't working. And when you do that,

114
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.140
you turn the stimulator on, the shakes go away. It's a real treatment. Yes.

115
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.450
<v 8>So we can switch the stimulator on or off and the patient doesn't know that the</v>

116
00:06:13.931 --> 00:06:15.730
stimulator is on or off.

117
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.960
<v 2>And that is where the trickery comes in. And one experiment,</v>

118
00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:21.870
he stood in front of his patient with the stimulator and said,

119
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.230
<v 8>now we are going to switch your stimulator on.</v>

120
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.793
<v 2>Except he didn't [inaudible].</v>

121
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.380
<v 8>No, of course. Of course. It is a sham turning.</v>

122
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.120
<v 2>He only pretended to turn it on, but that's the weird thing. It didn't matter.</v>

123
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.570
Pretending to turn it on work just as well as turning it on for real.

124
00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:38.940
The tremors disappeared. Really?

125
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.930
He even has a video of this where he's with a Parkinson's patient and he says

126
00:06:42.931 --> 00:06:43.764
those words,

127
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.620
<v 8>no, we are going to switch your stimulator on,</v>

128
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.220
<v 2>which is a lie by the way. Yeah,</v>

129
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:52.330
but it doesn't matter because what you see on the video screen is a shaking hand

130
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.660
go completely [inaudible].

131
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.280
<v 8>Yeah, that's correct. In a few seconds,</v>

132
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.840
you see that the Riza dramatic improvement in motor performance,

133
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.630
even though the, the stimulator is still off,

134
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.810
<v 2>just from words, and this is an equivalency. The lie is as good as the medicine</v>

135
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.480
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

136
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.430
<v 2>for awhile. What do you mean for a while coming out of the gate,</v>

137
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.500
a placebo seems to be 100% as effective as say, a real Parkinson struggle.

138
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:22.180
Yeah. Gotcha.

139
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.650
<v 8>The plastic only about 25% the duration of the actual drug.</v>

140
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.220
<v 2>Ah, still it's just words. Words are cheap. Yeah. You want it cheaper than,</v>

141
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.900
Oh yeah,

142
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.930
<v 1>overstatement.</v>

143
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.870
25% that is so different from 100% never said it was 100% to,

144
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.460
I didn't roll the tape back. What's wrong with you?

145
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.700
The fact that it happens at all. That words, that's all we're talking about.

146
00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:48.100
Words can be as effective as surgery. Doesn't that one,

147
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.850
doesn't that intrigue you that you want to know how that works? Yes,

148
00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:51.750
actually I do.

149
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.670
<v 2>How does it work? We have no idea,</v>

150
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.570
but for the first time we can see it.

151
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.180
See what we'll see it in action. See the placebo effect in action. Oh, testing.

152
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:07.250
Testing. Dr Benedetti referred us to a guy. Actually right here

153
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.600
<v 9>in your yard. Probably. You have a token with the Tar Wagga? No.</v>

154
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:17.230
Should we? Yes, totally. Go. Are you [inaudible]? Yeah. Hey, how are you? Oh,

155
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.060
to work. I use a really good new imager. We should introduce yourself. Okay.

156
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:21.923
I'm Troy [inaudible].

157
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.720
I'm an assistant professor of Psychology at Columbia University.

158
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.680
And here's what tour wigger does. He puts subjects in the brain scanner. Yeah.

159
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.230
<v 1>Puts a hot pad on their arm like I'm doing to you right now. So that's very,</v>

160
00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:35.540
yeah, right, right. We'll give them these pulses of heat

161
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.730
and then he'll give you some pain relief cream.

162
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.940
<v 9>This creamier cream that we tell you is [inaudible].</v>

163
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.600
We say this is going to be really effective. This is going to block pain,

164
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.490
take away the

165
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.920
<v 2>pain. Really. It's just fascinating, but you know,</v>

166
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:56.030
know that I'm having a hard time playing this role. Many games,

167
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.740
right as you're putting on this fake cream and feeling better,

168
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:01.490
having a placebo effect. In other words, he takes [inaudible]

169
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.950
<v 9>picture of your brain. So I have many things I can show you.</v>

170
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.770
Come on until I show it to him. He does. He shows me going on his computer.

171
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:10.070
It's very pretty. Now we had a brain in front of us,

172
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.500
the brain scan of a person right in the middle of being placebo,

173
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.700
meaning that they've just been given the placebo cream and now they're expecting

174
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.200
to feel better. Those expectations, placebo expectations, first of all,

175
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:26.340
they seem to start here in your forehead, kind of on the sides of your forehead.

176
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:28.770
Above your temples. When you believe that you're going to feel better.

177
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.920
That belief seems to live kind of near your temples,

178
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.140
but then once that belief is there, it seems to turn on. Turn on this,

179
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.960
this other part, the midbrain, he points to it on the screen.

180
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:42.900
It's a little nugget deep in the center of the brain.

181
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.950
What's important about this area is that it's one of the major centers for the

182
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:53.070
production of opioids in the brain. Oh, opioids like opium. Yes.

183
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.990
Yeah. Right. Like opium.

184
00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.230
<v 2>Opium as in</v>

185
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.050
<v 10>[inaudible].</v>

186
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.390
<v 2>Jad the greatest painkiller known to man there.</v>

187
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:10.850
It was inside our heads in a strike.

188
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.310
<v 9>By the way, that that stuff actually is inside our heads.</v>

189
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.520
I can't get over that [inaudible] that these illicit substances are actually

190
00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:20.150
inside us. Right? We know there's kind of a neat story about that,

191
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:25.210
and here is where tor blows my mind right out my face as he explains it.

192
00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:28.670
Every drug out there in the world, every single one,

193
00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:33.671
even the ones you see on TV or in a sense already inside our heads,

194
00:10:34.161 --> 00:10:37.310
your brain must have its own internal chemicals.

195
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.270
The only reason those drugs work he says is because our brain has receptors for

196
00:10:41.271 --> 00:10:43.160
them. And why would it have those receptors?

197
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.450
Because it can already make them in house every pharmacological agent or drug

198
00:10:47.451 --> 00:10:48.730
that there is. You know,

199
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.360
there is a chemical that's produced by your own brain that essentially does that

200
00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:54.194
thing.

201
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.240
It's like an internal pharmacy in there and it's just stocked full of drugs.

202
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.140
Right. And we just have to figure how to unlock it.

203
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.140
<v 8>We have a sort of a, as you said, we can turn our pharmacy,</v>

204
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.190
but we don't know why. Sometimes you does not work.

205
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.840
<v 2>What? What does that mean? Well, what it means is that the placebo effect,</v>

206
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:17.250
though it can be incredibly powerful. It's rarely consistent.

207
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.280
It's hard to predict who's going to get a placebo effect under what

208
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:21.114
circumstances.

209
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.650
But just imagine if we could figure this out and we can have all the drugs we

210
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:28.320
ever need without those nasty side effects.

211
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.070
<v 8>Oh yes, absolutely. Yes.</v>

212
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:34.410
We are working a lot with a drug companies in this direction

213
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.390
<v 2>with Dr Benedetti he's looking at now,</v>

214
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:39.090
which could be huge for patients with chronic pain.

215
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.290
<v 8>It toxic drug like morphine. Hmm.</v>

216
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.340
<v 2>Gradually replace it with a placebo substitute.</v>

217
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.240
So say on Monday he would give you some morphine and then on Tuesday slip in a

218
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:49.890
placebo

219
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.950
<v 8>and you'd give motion to gay on Wednesday and the placebo on Thursday and so</v>

220
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:58.410
forth. In the longer run that you can have a reduction of morphine by 50%

221
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:03.560
<v 11>Aha. And perhaps one day, I'm sorry, I can't contain my enthusiasm.</v>

222
00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:04.880
We won't need drugs at all.

223
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.780
Maybe one day we'll have a little box that I can plug directly into my midbrain

224
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:13.890
and I can just spend all day hitting the joy button. Joy, joy,

225
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.103
joy,

226
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:22.843
<v 12>[inaudible].</v>

227
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.433
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

228
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.670
<v 11>Sorry about that. Well,</v>

229
00:12:28.671 --> 00:12:33.470
while we're waiting for your glorious drug soaked future,

230
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:37.010
you could do it much more simply by simply telling a story.

231
00:12:37.011 --> 00:12:39.950
I'll tell you a story about telling stories. How about that?

232
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.110
I have no idea what you're talking about, right? Well, let me start.

233
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.690
It's a story I learned from Daniel Carr. Daniel B. Carr, m d a.

234
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.220
He told me about a guy who's really the father of placebo research.

235
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.240
His name is Henry Henry [inaudible]. Annexed,

236
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.900
annexed is his original name, German.

237
00:12:56.901 --> 00:13:00.230
As Dr Carl will tell you which given the poor quality of my German,

238
00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:05.260
I would roughly scan as meaning anti anxiety or perhaps anti pain.

239
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.960
This may be one of those cases with the name shapes the man.

240
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.920
It may well be,

241
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.210
it may well be cause even though he ends up changing his name to be sure Henry

242
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.450
knows Beecher, he does go into medicine to become a doctor.

243
00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:24.080
And then during World War II he joined the army as a doctor and found himself

244
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.910
the great battle of Anzio and the Americans landed in Nazi Europe and he was

245
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.950
right there. He was

246
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.360
<v 4>beach. Well let's go. Flying.</v>

247
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.640
Soldiers were being killed and some were being wounded

248
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.310
<v 11>and since Beecher was the doctor, it was his job to treat them. That's correct.</v>

249
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:54.070
The treatment at that time for pain as it still is nowadays was morphine.

250
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.790
One problem though,

251
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.070
Beecher's division was cut off from supplies and reinforcements and he began to

252
00:14:01.071 --> 00:14:02.660
run low on morphine.

253
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.890
He had to figure out which soldiers needed it the most and he's,

254
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.290
he's talking to them and he's asking him that.

255
00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:11.450
How much pain they're actually having. This is Scott Podolsky,

256
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.120
he's a doctor and his star. And he would go up to these patients and say them.

257
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:20.790
So soldier, yes, as you lie there, as you lie there, are you having any,

258
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.470
you having any pain quote unquote. So imagine Jed, you're a soldier,

259
00:14:24.471 --> 00:14:28.400
you're lying there with shrapnels stuck in your guns or severe injuries and you

260
00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:32.290
haven't had any morphine for at least seven hours previously. Yeah. Seven hours.

261
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:36.920
So what would you say? Oh would, I said, well, um, I'd say,

262
00:14:36.921 --> 00:14:39.290
give me some more feed. I'm in pain. Do you want to know something?

263
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.070
The striking finding was that in 75% of them they'd say, no, no,

264
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.550
no doc, I'm okay. I don't need any morphine right now.

265
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.010
Three quarters of them said that, wow,

266
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.190
this didn't make a whole lot of sense to be true because knew about pain before

267
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:54.530
the war. He ran a clinic in Boston,

268
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.380
so he would see people with bullet injuries and gun injuries,

269
00:14:57.381 --> 00:15:00.320
more or less the same kind of injuries he saw on the battlefield.

270
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:04.560
But back in Boston, doc, they really hurt. Did I have anyone?

271
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:09.340
Morphine please. Nurse. For some strange reasons. As Daniel Carr,

272
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.400
the intensity of the pain associated with being shot was lower in the

273
00:15:14.411 --> 00:15:18.500
battlefield than in civilian life. What could explain that? Yeah.

274
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.340
Maybe soldiers are just, they're tough guys. They don't. They suck it up.

275
00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:26.170
They don't. Well, no, no context context. That was beaches.

276
00:15:26.171 --> 00:15:29.350
Very simple explanation, context, context,

277
00:15:29.351 --> 00:15:32.380
meaning that the pain that you feel when you're hit by a bullet,

278
00:15:32.381 --> 00:15:34.120
it's not just about the bullet,

279
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.810
it's just as much about the story that comes with the bullet.

280
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.010
So consider these two different stories. Story number one,

281
00:15:42.011 --> 00:15:44.230
you are a soldier than you've been shot.

282
00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:51.730
As the bullet passes through. The first thing you think is, Oh man,

283
00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:55.600
I'm shot. The second thing you think is, wait a second, I'm alive.

284
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.230
If I can be evacuated from here, I'll have a period of recuperation.

285
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.330
They'll take me to a hospital, there'll be nurses there.

286
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.880
I may get a metal and a pension or a bonus and they'll certainly be a though,

287
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.610
send me home, throw me a parade.

288
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:09.603
<v 4>I'll be a hero.</v>

289
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.290
<v 11>Now consider the civilian story this time. You're a regular guy,</v>

290
00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:18.680
civilian in Boston. Maybe you own a shop. Can I help you pick up,

291
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:24.160
give me your money and you've been shot as the bullet passes to you this time,

292
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:30.830
the thoughts flashing to your head have nothing to do with the glory.

293
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.380
That's right. Instead you think, yeah, I'm alive,

294
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.880
but what's going to happen to me now? You wouldn't get a metal. Uh,

295
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.970
you were in trouble. Am I going to pay the doctor bills?

296
00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:40.760
Going to be out of commission but to lose my job? How do I pay the rent?

297
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:43.490
And if your family was dependent upon you, they suffered.

298
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.160
Nothing good is going to come up. This one bullet,

299
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:51.720
two very different stories. And it's the difference in the stories.

300
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.720
So Dr Beecher, that explains the difference in the experience of pain.

301
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.220
Those stories you're saying are somehow filtering the pain even before it's

302
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:03.270
felt. Yeah. That even as the bullet enters the skin right away,

303
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.950
within seconds thereafter,

304
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.310
you spin yourself a story about what's going to happen to you next.

305
00:17:08.311 --> 00:17:09.144
Not Consciously,

306
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:14.280
but way down deep in your head and the story you tell that makes all the

307
00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:15.114
difference.

308
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.200
<v 13>Scientists currently view our whole identity as something that we construct one</v>

309
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.640
fraction of a second to another.

310
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.080
You are the unfolding of an ongoing narrative,

311
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.510
but it's not just a narrative in words. It's a narrative that involves touch,

312
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.190
color, odors.

313
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.930
We use all those inputs to generate the next frame from the last four

314
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.010
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

315
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.370
<v 2>true. Let me talk for a second about color. He just mentioned color, right?</v>

316
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.260
Daniel Mormon. Yeah. Okay.

317
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.980
Tell me something really interesting about color and pill.

318
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.270
<v 0>Cool colored pills,</v>

319
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:05.271
blue pills or purple pills as placebos make better sleeping tablets than yellow

320
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:10.380
or red pills, which tend to wake people up. That's been, that's been shown. Oh,

321
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:12.910
yeah, yeah, yeah. There's that. Okay. Take two pills that are the same.

322
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.140
It says color one blue [inaudible] the other red and the people that take the

323
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:19.410
blue pill will sleep longer and they will sleep better than people who took the

324
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.370
red. This has been shown, he says all over the world except,

325
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.410
and here's the cool part. Yeah. Except in Italy, Italy. Hemp in Italy,

326
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.490
blues sleeping tablets have the paradoxical effect of being sleep inducing for

327
00:18:32.491 --> 00:18:37.260
women but not for men. What, how does that work? Well, I'm not really sure,

328
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:38.220
but uh,

329
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.280
but my speculation is that the Italian national football team is called

330
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.750
[inaudible], which is blue.

331
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.870
And so what blew evokes in an Italian man is the World Cup and soccer and

332
00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:52.270
screaming and hollering again

333
00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:57.730
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

334
00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:59.290
<v 0>and it's hardly something that's like</v>

335
00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:01.923
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

336
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.170
<v 0>I guess by contrast, Hulu for Italian women is the color of the virgin.</v>

337
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.800
The original does of course always presented in blue

338
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:14.340
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

339
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.990
<v 0>and the virgin is a very comforting and protective figure for women in Italian</v>

340
00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:19.824
culture.

341

<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

362
00:20:25.151 --> 00:20:28.450
I'm Jad Homerun and I'm Robert Krulwich and this hour we've been talking about

363
00:20:28.451 --> 00:20:29.860
the placebo effect. Yes,

364
00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:33.910
about the power of belief and suggestion and thus far we've looked at it from

365
00:20:33.911 --> 00:20:35.590
the perspective of the patient,

366
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.400
but certainly the doctor has a role to play in all of this and so I have a story

367
00:20:39.401 --> 00:20:44.170
to tell you. Five four, three two one zero it's,

368
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.920
it happens to be a better doctor. Yeah. I'm Dr. Mason.

369
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.100
<v 5>I was trained in medicine in guy's hospital back in the 1950s Albert Mason was</v>

370
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:55.840
delivering babies at a hospital in London.

371
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:59.050
He was a young guy at anesthesiologist and he was looking for a new way to

372
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:03.400
anesthetize his patients, the moms southern, maybe safer than drugs.

373
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.050
And one day he ran across a book about mythical hypnosis,

374
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.400
medical hypnosis.

375
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:13.600
And I just read the technique and tried it out on some friends.

376
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.770
And under what circumstances, like you,

377
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.240
you would put a watch and have it swing back and forth left and right. No, no,

378
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:19.640
no.

379
00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.640
Just lay them down on a couch and say I'm now I want you to let your whole body

380
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:28.600
go loose at your arms, go loose as your legs go loose.

381
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.100
And it worked on some people and not on others, but the more he practiced,

382
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.400
the better he got. You know, putting his friends on tour trans stay,

383
00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:39.910
getting them to remember stuff from their fifth birthday and all sorts of games

384
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:41.650
that we played as medical students.

385
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.300
And so we took this little party trick into the delivery room and it worked.

386
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.860
That's right. I delivered about 20 babies under hypnosis.

387
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.190
And the moment you start to do hypnosis,

388
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.690
you start to get a reputation as being somebody who has power. Well,

389
00:21:58.691 --> 00:22:00.400
I would think you'd get two reputations.

390
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.920
The patients might think you have power and the doctors might think you're a

391
00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:05.140
quack. Well, both of those are true,

392
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:09.610
but at that time it was kind of fun because the hospital administrators were

393
00:22:09.611 --> 00:22:12.790
kind of curious about this young doctor. Slash. Hypnotist.

394
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.920
Maybe he was onto something, who knows?

395
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:19.150
So they started to send him all kinds of patients, skin disorders,

396
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.280
asthma, and he'd hypnotized them,

397
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:25.600
which led to a weird little discovery of all things that hypnosis might help.

398
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.550
The one that seemed to work the best was warts, warts,

399
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.680
warts. To my delight,

400
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.370
I found that if you hypnotize them and told them that the waltz would go,

401
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.990
they went in a certain number of cases. Let's fast forward a little bit.

402
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.280
Dr. Mason is treating lots of these warts patients and things are going pretty

403
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:49.420
well and one day a young boy came to this hospital.

404
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.660
He was wheeled in on a Gurney and the first thing I saw was his arm.

405
00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.400
I could have dropped through the floor because this wasn't a dozen walls.

406
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.720
This was millions. This was the entire surface of the skin.

407
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.040
It's cracked and got infected and his life was impossible.

408
00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:11.790
He couldn't go to school because he smelled a,

409
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:14.150
I don't know if you've ever seen the photographs of this boy.

410
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:18.610
Just check this out. Look at this pictures here. Oh my God.

411
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.680
It looks like he has a, a black hide over his whole body.

412
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.760
It looked like an elephant skin. That's what it looked like.

413
00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.280
So they take this poor boy to surgery. The surgeon, a man called Jerry Moore,

414
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.750
was trying to graft healthiest skin onto the hands.

415
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.530
And when I saw this skin, I said to Mr. Moore,

416
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.220
why don't you treat him by hypnosis? And he looked at me and he said, well,

417
00:23:46.221 --> 00:23:49.910
why don't you, and he walked out with here.

418
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.570
Why don't you in, in despair or in contempt?

419
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.830
I think a mixture of both. And by the way, when you asked that question,

420
00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.540
you're the kid asking the senior practitioners. So I was cheeky.

421
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.600
Yeah, you were cheeky. So there's Albert Mason,

422
00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:09.020
cheeky Aloma is boy with a million warts and Albert asks him,

423
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.120
do you mind if I hit my Tyson? This kid who was 15 said, okay,

424
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:18.110
didn't you have to tell the parents? Um, no.

425
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.660
Couldn't have got away with it today, could I?

426
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.420
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

427
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.220
<v 15>so I hypnotized this kid.</v>

428
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.240
I told him the watch on your right arm will shrivel up and die and new skin will

429
00:24:33.531 --> 00:24:38.180
grow. And why did you choose the right arm? Oh,

430
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.630
I had to start somewhere and I sent him away.

431
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.620
He came back in a week and one arm was clear.

432
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:48.280
<v 4>Aw,</v>

433
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.960
<v 5>totally clear. I mean, imagine this,</v>

434
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:55.170
the left arm is black and scaly like elephant skin and the right arm is totally

435
00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.570
normal. Totally normal looking yet. But here's the rub on look,

436
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.810
this no's a real photo. This is a, this is verifiable.

437
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.160
It looked like a normal skin, but rather pinker than usual.

438
00:25:06.161 --> 00:25:08.620
Slightly pink and soft and supple.

439
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.023
<v 4>Oh,</v>

440
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.210
<v 5>this is for real? Yes.</v>

441
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.900
It's like all those thousands and thousands of words that covered the right arm.

442
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.940
I guess they just fell over. And what were you thinking when you first saw it?

443
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.740
I was thinking how wonderful.

444
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.890
I was thinking, oh wait, let Mr. Moore sees this.

445
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.480
So he takes the boy, he runs down the hall to the operating room.

446
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.430
When Mr. Mueller is in the middle of an operation,

447
00:25:36.431 --> 00:25:38.620
he takes the boy up to the big, you know, the glass window,

448
00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.830
and I held up both his arms, one black and Scaly,

449
00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:46.831
the other pink and and more put down his scalpel.

450
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:52.070
He came out of the theater and he looked and he said, oh my God,

451
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.150
look at that. And I sure will. I told you a waltz could go.

452
00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:00.220
And he looked at me pityingly he said, this isn't what this is congenital

453
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:07.060
[inaudible] [inaudible] of bro went off. For those of us who are uninitiated,

454
00:26:07.061 --> 00:26:10.690
what is Roma? Damien with witty guy, bad guy with Axios, hopeless condition.

455
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.700
Never been known to,

456
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.860
to change this surgeon informed Albert Mason that he had just hypnotized away a

457
00:26:17.861 --> 00:26:22.861
condition that never once in medical history had been known to go away for any

458
00:26:23.711 --> 00:26:26.230
reason, whatever. So he says,

459
00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:30.970
we're going to take him to the Royal Society of medicine to show him to all the

460
00:26:30.971 --> 00:26:33.100
dermatologists in London.

461
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.480
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

462
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.300
<v 5>so more took me up there with the boy.</v>

463
00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.760
Thank you Dr Molan to the Royal Society for this opportunity.

464
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:48.530
And I demonstrated, yes. First of all, I demonstrated how to hypnotize.

465
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.990
This is quite easily achieved. You simply lie the patient down and say,

466
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.670
now I want you to let your whole body go loose. Let your arms go loose,

467
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.400
let your legs go loose. And then I showed his arm, please, if you don't mind,

468
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:00.310
raise both arms.

469
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.430
They were staggered. In fact, the president,

470
00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.410
this is upset that it's

471
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.240
inconceivable that this gets well because we all knew that congenital

472
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.640
[inaudible] is incurable

473
00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:19.900
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

474
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.070
<v 5>That was the exact word he used in curable, incurable,</v>

475
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.343
<v 3>no</v>

476
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.810
<v 5>curable. And the thing was, since all this took place at a hospital,</v>

477
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.550
every stage of it was documented.

478
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:36.780
There are photographs every step along the way before shots after shots,

479
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.780
closeups, all available to reporters. You can imagine what happened, right?

480
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:45.690
It was picked up in every newspaper, Time magazine, big media story. In fact,

481
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.680
the first I heard about it, I was in bed one morning,

482
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:53.100
a year after I'd sent the paper in from habilitation,

483
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:57.420
and the phone rang and the voice said, this is whipsnade zoo.

484
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.880
We have an elephant with a skin like a little boy, can you kill him? And I said,

485
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.340
what's up? I don't know what the hell are you talking about?

486
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:10.790
And then the phone started to ring and ring and ring and hundreds of calls,

487
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.620
hundreds of letters came in from all over the world.

488
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.660
And I had people coming in with the most terrifying illnesses wanting to be

489
00:28:18.661 --> 00:28:22.350
killed, especially people with that very rare skin condition,

490
00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:24.660
congenital [inaudible], whatever it's called. Yes.

491
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.970
They flocked to him from all over the world.

492
00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:31.020
And that's now here's where the story takes a turn. He would see these patients,

493
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.220
he would hypnotize each one one at a time and then send them away,

494
00:28:35.221 --> 00:28:36.880
hoping of course that they'd get better. Right.

495
00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.340
And they would come back a week later.

496
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.360
<v 16>And</v>

497
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.370
<v 5>none of the others ever got well</v>

498
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.540
<v 16>at all. No,</v>

499
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.890
<v 5>not in any way. No improvement. Um,</v>

500
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.760
I've spent the rest of my life trying to understand this phenomenon because I

501
00:28:52.761 --> 00:28:55.220
gave up and it's just a few years later,

502
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.150
Albert Mason quit medicine and he decided to become a psychiatrist.

503
00:28:59.151 --> 00:29:03.860
He wanted to understand why he had the touch the first time and why after that

504
00:29:03.861 --> 00:29:05.330
it just didn't work.

505
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:09.980
So the central question in your mind was not what happened to the kid,

506
00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:13.400
but what happened to me. That's right. That's right.

507
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.040
And what do you think the answer to that is? Like? Well,

508
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:21.070
there is a condition called infantile omnipotence that we all suffer from when

509
00:29:22.521 --> 00:29:23.480
we're kids.

510
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.890
We think we can do anything unconsciously.

511
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.340
I knew this was incurable. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

512
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.420
My reason cause it incurable would mean that it had never been cured.

513
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:39.830
But you've tried. You had tried, created an exception. So look,

514
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:45.190
when you're 20 and the president of the Royal Society of medicine tells you it's

515
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:50.680
incurable, it has an effect. That's his best guess.

516
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.200
He thinks that that word incurable

517
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.790
<v 9>changed him just a little bit.</v>

518
00:29:56.010 --> 00:30:01.010
<v 5>I lost my crazy confidence even though I had the evidence,</v>

519
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.210
but it didn't work.

520
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:04.920
<v 4>No.</v>

521
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.700
<v 5>Confidence is a hard thing to measure. You can't put it on a scale.</v>

522
00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:09.871
You can't weigh it,

523
00:30:09.871 --> 00:30:14.310
but you can sense it because it's conveyed in a million little ways how you

524
00:30:14.311 --> 00:30:17.940
stand, whether you look your patient in the eye, when you pause,

525
00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:20.490
where you pause, what you say, what you don't say.

526
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:24.210
All these things are like signals may say to the patient,

527
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:29.510
they murmur to the patient. I can help you. They can do this. You know,

528
00:30:29.511 --> 00:30:34.010
you go to a doctor, you got this horrible rash all over you and he says,

529
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.600
um Oh that's everything my multiform me and you feel better immediately cause

530
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:39.920
he's named it will.

531
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:43.790
All he said is many red spots in Latin.

532
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:49.160
But the thing is that he knows what it is and you feel that,

533
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.280
oh he knows now I'll be okay

534
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.210
<v 17>because when you're feeling terrible,</v>

535
00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:00.920
what you just want to do is hand over the authority for your situation to

536
00:31:00.921 --> 00:31:03.200
someone else who's got information. Yeah,

537
00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.300
hour and he's going to tell you you're going to be fine.

538
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:10.100
And maybe that comes out from early childhood when it seems to us that our

539
00:31:10.101 --> 00:31:13.490
parents have that capacity. Harvard historian and Harrington,

540
00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:17.420
I have a two year old and we're already now at the stage where, you know,

541
00:31:17.421 --> 00:31:21.440
he gets a little bump and he comes to me and holds the bit of his body out

542
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:26.470
that's been hurt and I kiss it and it's OK and I,

543
00:31:28.041 --> 00:31:32.630
there is a way that mommy's kiss is kind of a placebo effect. Testing,

544
00:31:32.631 --> 00:31:35.720
testing and now imagine that are sick.

545
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.130
You know when you're sick there's a strong impulse to kind of revert back to

546
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.200
that way of interacting with people.

547
00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:47.250
<v 9>Say something just a duck that's Arabic for what do you want?</v>

548
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:52.530
How's that? How are you? I'm good dad. How are you? I'm doing very well.

549
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.410
This is my dad. Do you see how your voice goes on the thing? He's the guy.

550
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.140
I bring my booboos too as a kid. Tell me what you do.

551
00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.830
Actually I still do like your title and that kind of thing cause he happens to

552
00:32:01.831 --> 00:32:05.280
be a doctor. I'm the chairman of the Barclay of surgery at Vanderbilt.

553
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:11.190
Vanderbilt is in Nashville, Tennessee where we grew up for much of our life.

554
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.440
Where are you? Grew up for much of your life. Okay,

555
00:32:13.441 --> 00:32:17.400
so my dad had no idea why I wanted to follow him around the hospital.

556
00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:21.090
I didn't exactly lead with the whole placebo thing. Often do see patients.

557
00:32:21.091 --> 00:32:25.230
Truth is, I feel okay about that because this show isn't really about lying.

558
00:32:25.231 --> 00:32:28.500
It's about healing the healing process, which doesn't happen in a vacuum.

559
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.770
Patient of course has to believe in the cure,

560
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.450
but the doctor has to create that book. Okay, wait, you have to walk slower.

561
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.950
I can't talk slowly now. How does he do that? Tell me where we're going.

562
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:44.240
Now we're going into the clinic and it'd be more specific with what happens at

563
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:47.450
the clinic. If I have patients scheduled to come to see me today.

564
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:51.140
These days my dad's hair is white, is his white Dr Kobish,

565
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.300
but he still sees patients every Wednesday.

566
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.120
I have four patients and that is why I'm here.

567
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.900
1:00 PM clinic begins in the clinic and as if to illustrate an Harrington's

568
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:07.190
basic point, when you're sick,

569
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.260
there's a strong impulse to kind of revert back to that way of interacting with

570
00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:12.770
people.

571
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.400
As soon as my dad's first patient shows up a hairstylist from Murfreesboro,

572
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:19.220
Tennessee, when she walked down the busy hallway and sees him.

573
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.520
As soon as she sees him, she bursts into tears.

574
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.480
<v 1>Okay, okay. So</v>

575
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.900
he gives her a hug. Every time I see him,

576
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:33.910
it's kind of like a whole app,

577
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.020
have to be strong and I feel like when I see him I can let him let it down

578
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.350
because I know that he's going to hug me and make me feel better.

579
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.510
I'm a single parent and I own my own business and I,

580
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:50.560
I've always been in survival mode and I've always had to be strong and so that's

581
00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:52.030
why this has been so hard for me.

582
00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.730
<v 9>They go into a tiny exam room,</v>

583
00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.640
which is quiet and super intimate compared to the hallway.

584
00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:01.670
Dad Has Megan sit on a table if stuff,

585
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:07.930
and he gently presses two fingers to her next swallow a little bit [inaudible]

586
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:14.500
there's a tiny gland in her neck that should be the size of a Ph [inaudible] but

587
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:16.730
over the past four years it's gotten bigger.

588
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.540
Three inches and bigger word and two and a half inches in the other direction.

589
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:27.560
Now it's the size of a golf ball and it presses against your area.

590
00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.050
<v 1>Yeah. At night sometimes I wake up and I'm, you know, and I think, Oh God,</v>

591
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.080
should I call nine one one and I keep asking him every week,

592
00:34:36.081 --> 00:34:39.080
are you sure I'm not going to choke? I got a choke kiss. Not going to choke me.

593
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:45.230
Or You know, just him reassuring me it's not gonna affect the airway.

594
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:48.500
I tried to remember the little things that he says to me when I'm,

595
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.860
especially in the middle of the night when I start feeling anxious or panic at

596
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.820
all. Same time. How do I deal with the anxiety surrounding this thing?

597
00:34:55.821 --> 00:34:56.654
Because like

598
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.940
<v 9>anxious feelings of anxiety that I don't know.</v>

599
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:06.260
We're going to scared of the unknown part that is worrying about the future.

600
00:35:06.261 --> 00:35:08.810
I think just because I think, well I know,

601
00:35:08.811 --> 00:35:13.070
but I guess it's just because of my race, my personal responsibilities.

602
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.720
You got to put them at ease.

603
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.710
Nothing life threatening today you have to put them at ease.

604
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:23.770
I'm going to give you a short term plan and a longer term medicine where just

605
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:28.781
science and all of this talk would be just noise because the real business

606
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:33.680
within happen in the next room where this big machine ready to scan Megan's

607
00:35:33.681 --> 00:35:37.780
thyroid, but medicine isn't purely science. Yeah. I mean, which my dad had met.

608
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.420
It's an art. It's communication,

609
00:35:39.421 --> 00:35:44.421
which is why he and Megan talk and talk and talk and talk for over an hour.

610
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.860
In a way it's a kind of negotiation.

611
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.430
She wants to know one thing like what if my thyroid has gotten bigger?

612
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.940
What if I have to have radiation, will I have to quit my job?

613
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.800
He needs her to focus on anything but the what ifs to stay focused on what they

614
00:35:58.801 --> 00:35:59.371
do know,

615
00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:03.840
which unfortunately is that they won't know anything for another day.

616
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.660
<v 15>Then you draw the blood today and believe it or not,</v>

617
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.760
I know it's within 24 hours. Okay.

618
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.540
I need to know the size of that title.

619
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:17.010
<v 9>Okay. Somehow in the end, despite all the open questions on this,</v>

620
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.180
because as they do that, he gets there to relax. We're gonna work together.

621
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.820
We're going let you guys talk on the town so much.

622
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.470
It's really inconvenient for me. How much performances in it?

623
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.330
What do you mean performance? Yeah.

624
00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:34.340
How much of doctoring is having to play a certain role that the patient needs at

625
00:36:34.341 --> 00:36:37.430
that moment? It's just about every bit of it.

626
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.630
So if I were to call it theater, would that offend you or no,

627
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:46.250
it's not a theater that uh, it is,

628
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:50.570
I'm living that throat. It's part of me.

629
00:36:50.571 --> 00:36:54.380
It's not part of a fake image that I'm projecting.

630
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.310
I think you know what I'm trying to get at, you know, you know,

631
00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:02.900
you call it theater, you can call it theater, but I just mean that.

632
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:04.630
I mean when you, when you don't have the white coat on you,

633
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.970
you're not like in doctor mode. You know, you don't have all the answers.

634
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:12.200
You don't, I mean, I don't have all the answers then like, but you,

635
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.130
but you seem to, and you know, with her, that's what I really wanted to know.

636
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.860
That magic pixie dust called certainty.

637
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.300
How do you project that instantly to patient? The moment you walk into a room,

638
00:37:23.301 --> 00:37:27.290
even when the patient hits you with questions like doc, am I going to make it?

639
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.140
It can seem kind of mystical, that aura,

640
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.520
but then again there are the props. Okay.

641
00:37:34.521 --> 00:37:35.660
You have to tell me what you're doing now.

642
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.890
What does this for instance to rewind a moment here we are before clinic in my

643
00:37:39.891 --> 00:37:43.730
dad's office and he's just opened up his little coat closet. I think my coat on,

644
00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.020
I've got my, usually on the day of the clinic I choose a clean white coat.

645
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.870
Really? Yeah. Do you have many to choose from?

646
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.430
I have one, two, three, four, five, five,

647
00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.550
five blindingly white light coats.

648
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.640
He flips through them because the whitest of the bunch puts it on and I swear to

649
00:38:01.641 --> 00:38:05.120
you, even now when I'm older, it's supposedly wise to these kinds of things.

650
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.000
It's like he changes somehow.

651
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.150
Do you ever go to see patients without your weight?

652
00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:16.430
<v 15>Uh, I don't like to it. Yeah. It's almost like you're naked without it.</v>

653
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.490
You do seem tolerant with it on, can I do? Yeah.

654
00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.810
<v 9>There is inherent power in the props, especially the code.</v>

655
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:28.000
And if you have any doubt the doctors don't know this, go to a med school,

656
00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:31.960
any med school on the day the new students arrive and you'll probably find

657
00:38:31.961 --> 00:38:34.630
something like this. Excuse me. If we could all have a seed,

658
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.770
we'll start ceremony.

659
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.710
<v 1>The white coat ceremony. Thank you.</v>

660
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.790
It's as close to religious ritual as you can get in medicine. In fact,

661
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:45.670
the one that we attended at Columbia University in New York,

662
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:49.630
I asked the students to please stand with me included a chaplain.

663
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.243
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

664
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.590
<v 1>As you are able let us pray together.</v>

665
00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.990
Compassionate God.

666
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:00.410
<v 4>Okay.</v>

667
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:04.520
<v 1>Bless these new medical students of the Columbia University College of</v>

668
00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.930
Physicians and surgeons and bless the white coats that they receive today.

669
00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.070
May these white coats be for each student,

670
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:18.590
a cloak of compassion, a clear statement of purpose,

671
00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.580
a sign of assurance and a symbol of respect.

672
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.050
The ceremony we pray for the straight and fucking times has some on the

673
00:39:27.051 --> 00:39:31.790
spiritual component, the art of healing. It's quite moving, I think.

674
00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.400
I hope you'll find that's Arnold and Sandra gold.

675
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:37.880
They began the white coat ceremony at Columbia almost 20 years ago.

676
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.880
God be with each student and they were in the audience today. We were there,

677
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:45.200
God be with each of us along with about 250 students and their families first.

678
00:39:45.201 --> 00:39:48.680
Each student is cloaked individually and Cole by name,

679
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:53.480
<v 18>Eric, j. R e s James J at Tra.</v>

680
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.810
<v 1>They then return to the seats that we see,</v>

681
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:59.290
this visual transformation that occurs.

682
00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:04.060
This is a change that you can actually see at these people come into this room

683
00:40:04.061 --> 00:40:07.960
with their coats on their arm and they're wearing blue and black and green and

684
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:10.010
yellow, and that's who they are, God.

685
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:14.320
And you see the room filling up in white and they see the room filling up in

686
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:19.150
white Alexandra j Borst. And you know in the old days, doctors were black.

687
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.860
It's true. A hundred years ago, doctors were gothic black coats,

688
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:28.750
but then someone discovered germs and have the insight that germs live in dirt.

689
00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.530
And because you couldn't see dirt on black coats had to be white.

690
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.080
They changed for antiseptic reasons.

691
00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:39.880
That is when a certain symbolism took hold. When you think about angels,

692
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.940
they're never in red. They're never in black.

693
00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:45.920
<v 18>Please turn around to face the audience</v>

694
00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:51.890
and I present to you the class of 2000

714
00:42:01.441 --> 00:42:04.650
I'm Jad up and running and I'm Robert Krulwich and today we are talking about

715
00:42:04.651 --> 00:42:07.980
the placebo effect and the power of suggestion.

716
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:12.180
We're looking at a lot of new research. Well, I don't know. It was new research.

717
00:42:12.181 --> 00:42:13.710
We've, we've done well. It is a new research,

718
00:42:13.711 --> 00:42:15.630
but the problem has been with us for centuries,

719
00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:19.770
even at the very beginning of the age of reason. Let me take you back.

720
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:25.020
18th Century. The enlightenment was in full swing. There was change in the air.

721
00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:28.200
Both hair was denouncing the church by Belize. Man.

722
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.430
Ben Franklin was flying kites

723
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.400
live was Yang, was inventing chemistry.

724
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.910
It was the beginning of modern times. Modern Science, you might say,

725
00:42:41.911 --> 00:42:45.390
reason in creep. People were reexamining the big questions.

726
00:42:45.391 --> 00:42:49.530
How does the world work? What possibly could hold everything together?

727
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.280
And this was new. Well,

728
00:42:52.281 --> 00:42:55.280
you have to understand that in earlier historical moments,

729
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:58.940
the unification of the universe was not a problem because it was God that

730
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:01.940
unified everything and everything was a manifestation of God.

731
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.830
That's Ed Cohen talking about God, he's a historian.

732
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:10.070
But if God isn't the glue that holds the universe together,

733
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:14.910
then what does hold the world together? Enter End Twan. Mesmer and who?

734
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.780
N Twan. Ms Maria. Have you ever said, uh, you mesmerize me, my darling.

735
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.380
Go to that said the word Mesmer.

736
00:43:22.381 --> 00:43:24.690
I'm as mesmerization comes from Anton Mesmer.

737
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.890
So he's part of our narrative. Yeah,

738
00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.360
I'll get out of my way over to the other side of the story.

739
00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:34.570
Out in 1778 he moves to Paris and he has a theory.

740
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:39.750
He believed that the world was filled with a kind of fluid that moved to all

741
00:43:40.091 --> 00:43:44.410
living things and he gave it his own kind of sexy name, animal magnetism,

742
00:43:44.411 --> 00:43:47.350
or as they say in the fringe, magnetism. [inaudible]. Right.

743
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.140
And as this force flowed through all of life,

744
00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:54.400
occasionally it would get stuck in a traffic jam. It would bunch up. Right.

745
00:43:54.401 --> 00:43:58.540
And that is also the bunching up can also be a cause of a problem.

746
00:43:58.541 --> 00:43:59.201
That's what he thought.

747
00:43:59.201 --> 00:44:04.201
Being sick was blocking the flow restrictions and the flow of animal magnetism

748
00:44:04.541 --> 00:44:05.860
in the organism. I mean,

749
00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:09.730
not that dissimilar to the way that we understand traditional Chinese medicine

750
00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.760
or like ci with the needles and the and the acupuncture.

751
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.460
Mesmer thought this life was when it got stuck,

752
00:44:15.461 --> 00:44:19.640
could be released with a little help from needles. No, no. This is a breakfast.

753
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.240
A lot more theatrical. He created a kind of [inaudible].

754
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.320
<v 20>I actually think of it as um, a prototype for the,</v>

755
00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:31.200
the idea of a happening in the 60s that's the way I like to think of it.

756
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:31.741
You know,

757
00:44:31.741 --> 00:44:35.700
it's sort of like everybody kind of came in and there was this like music

758
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:36.510
playing,

759
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:41.510
there was like dim lighting and he would walk around in his lovely purple suit

760
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:45.210
and, and he had a lit her pole. Yeah, I think he was a, a Laila

761
00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:46.870
<v 5>was, I believe actually the,</v>

762
00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:51.190
the shade that was reported and then he would go over to a particular client.

763
00:44:51.191 --> 00:44:51.911
Usually it was a women,

764
00:44:51.911 --> 00:44:55.960
most of his clients were women and he would sit across from them and their knees

765
00:44:55.961 --> 00:44:58.290
would tuck yo magnet.

766
00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:02.490
[inaudible] it is, how do you say,

767
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.510
pushy and then to unblock this flow,

768
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:11.380
he would stare into her eyes stare. Right.

769
00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:16.220
And if he, if he jammed you, how would you know? Okay,

770
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.190
<v 20>cause you would have a healing crisis. What was that? A simple,</v>

771
00:45:20.191 --> 00:45:22.710
they would scream, they would vibrate

772
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:31.530
<v 12>actually a padded room where the ladies could go and loosen their corsets and</v>

773
00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.900
fling themselves about and banging their heads against the wall and do whatever

774
00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:41.980
they needed to do in order to kind of release the damned up energy.

775
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:44.480
<v 11>Well, it was apparently quite dramatic</v>

776
00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:47.940
<v 5>by the looks of it.</v>

777
00:45:47.941 --> 00:45:51.360
They were real seizures and people said they felt better afterwards.

778
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:55.350
So word spread and Sunni had disciples and then more disciples.

779
00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.740
<v 11>It had a lot of popularity. Yes, it did.</v>

780
00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:01.940
So we did what any business man would do. He franchised it, he branched out.

781
00:46:01.941 --> 00:46:06.290
And I mean this, literally, he magnetized trees, trees,

782
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:08.750
trees, Mesmer,

783
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.890
or sometimes his assistants would take to magnetised iron rods,

784
00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:16.130
touch them to a tree in the forest,

785
00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.260
and that would transfer the magnetism to the tree.

786
00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:23.310
<v 17>The tree would then have the kind of therapeutic powers that a mesmerist would</v>

787
00:46:23.711 --> 00:46:26.560
have. How convenient. That's in Harrington, a Harvard historian.

788
00:46:26.561 --> 00:46:30.430
And this was quite efficient because then you could sort of have the trees do

789
00:46:30.431 --> 00:46:31.470
part of the work for you.

790
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:32.700
<v 11>So imagine if you will.</v>

791
00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:36.540
Lots and lots of people gathered around the tree touching each other and the

792
00:46:36.541 --> 00:46:40.260
tree and allowing the flow to move through them and they would all have fits

793
00:46:40.261 --> 00:46:41.094
together.

794
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:45.270
And the problem was the doctors of the time who used to have all these people as

795
00:46:45.271 --> 00:46:48.000
their patients were now losing patients and money.

796
00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.880
<v 17>So they protested to the king. The king established a commission.</v>

797
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:57.680
And actually one of the members of that commission was Benjamin Franklin,

798
00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:00.770
who at the time was the ambassador to France.

799
00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.890
And there were other important scientists on the [inaudible]

800
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.780
<v 11>[inaudible] teen was one of them. Is that the g team? We know from the right.</v>

801
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:15.100
So we're talking here about a major, major league panel. These were big guys,

802
00:47:15.101 --> 00:47:15.670
big names,

803
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:20.670
<v 17>and they devised a series of experiments to test for magnetic field.</v>

804
00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:26.140
<v 11>They weren't concerned whether or not animal magnetism work.</v>

805
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:30.160
They were concerned whether or not animal magnetism

806
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.010
<v 2>existed because they figured, you know, it couldn't work.</v>

807
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:34.220
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

808
00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.810
<v 2>even though it may not exist.</v>

809
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.790
<v 17>And one of the most dramatic, uh,</v>

810
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:44.060
tests that they devised is sometimes identified as the first placebo controlled

811
00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:45.590
trial in history.

812
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:48.650
<v 12>[inaudible].</v>

813
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:51.260
<v 17>They were actually down on Benjamin Franklin's estate.</v>

814
00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:56.120
This was just south of Paris and Franklin himself conducted experiment and it

815
00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:00.820
involved blindfolding kind of a young boy. Is it on too tightly? No. Yeah,

816
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:05.600
that was what? 1213 years old. Can you see anything? No. Any light at all?

817
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:10.040
No. And uh, he was told that is the deal, young boy,

818
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:11.910
a lot of these five oak trees,

819
00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:17.200
one of the trees on the estate has been advertised by an actual mesmerist.

820
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.660
Oh, we'll take him to one tree at a time.

821
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:25.880
Your job is to tell us which one has been magnetized and they said one of the

822
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.290
tree has been magnetized. And where you blindfold you and you,

823
00:48:28.291 --> 00:48:31.370
you tell us when you know you're up by the magnetic trees.

824
00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:36.470
Cause patients insisted that they could feel the energy. And by the way,

825
00:48:36.471 --> 00:48:37.304
I believe that

826
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.590
I'm totally persuaded that the real experiences were happening.

827
00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:48.660
They brought the boy to one tree. This is tree number one. Huh?

828
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:54.290
He began to kind of shake and they brought him to another. Nah,

829
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.590
we started before tree number two. He began to sweat.

830
00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.060
And by the time they brought him to the third and then the forward.

831
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.190
<v 2>Yeah, we are all before tree number.</v>

832
00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:09.900
<v 17>He sort of collapsing convulsions, which is all dramatic except okay.</v>

833
00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:14.370
Tree number one, tree number two and number three and number four. Yup.

834
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:17.410
<v 2>Had never been magnetized. So</v>

835
00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.650
<v 17>this was seen as pretty definitive evidence that there was no man magnetic force</v>

836
00:49:21.651 --> 00:49:26.180
here. But they also didn't think that the boy was sort of faking it.

837
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:29.900
So what they concluded was that there is no magnetic force,

838
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:34.930
but that all the effects which they don't deny the reality of were caused by the

839
00:49:35.691 --> 00:49:36.710
imagination.

840
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.600
<v 2>That was Harvard historian and Harrington and Rutgers historian Ed Cohen.</v>

841
00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:46.970
I final stuff in this hour comes from reporter Gregory Warner who recently

842
00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:52.040
visited a tent revival, upstate New York, little Adirondacks,

843
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.270
lakeside community, very rural to see a faith healing. Okay. So,

844
00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:00.020
so I get there and I'm a little bit late. I'm a little bit nervous.

845
00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:02.840
There's a lot of mosquitoes. People are restless.

846
00:50:02.841 --> 00:50:05.840
They're sitting in their chairs, the tent flaps are still up,

847
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:09.350
the sun is kind of setting. And Steve,

848
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:14.540
Steve Booza is going on about some verses of scripture and people are really

849
00:50:14.541 --> 00:50:18.650
bored. And he says, don't worry, we're going to get to the healing. Pretty soon.

850
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.830
The reading's important to, you know, that kind of thing like a teacher. Like,

851
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:24.290
so then he says, okay, now it's time for some healing.

852
00:50:24.291 --> 00:50:28.460
The flaps go down and suddenly the changes because

853
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:33.890
<v 1>what was before this kind of people milling in and out becomes this very focused</v>

854
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:39.870
chamber and it begins your Neat Ministry of any kind.

855
00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:45.470
Come on up. This preacher who, who is this guy? That's Steve Booza,

856
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:49.040
he owns a construction company in Syracuse. All the need

857
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.340
physical healing finances.

858
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:56.180
So he's looking out into the crowd and then a volunteer comes up,

859
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.690
strawberry blonde hair, pink Cardigan. Um, I knew my backbone shit and

860
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:07.220
in your bed, fall straight and tell me what's wrong. How old is she?

861
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:11.570
She's in high school. B diagnosis,

862
00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:14.950
her scoliosis. That's don't, don't want to scare you.

863
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.120
Now I'm not trying to scare her.

864
00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:21.470
Scoliosis of the spine is 100% of the time.

865
00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.270
The mind like, okay, that's not even physical. That's a demon.

866
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.720
I'm standing next to Steve.

867
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.050
Do you believe it's going to be straightened right now? Can Be your hands full.

868
00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:34.640
He spins her around. I break any generational curse off of my sister right now.

869
00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.940
In Jesus' name. You'll spirit of scoliosis.

870
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:43.150
I break your power and then all of a sudden now in Jesus name won't be

871
00:51:43.151 --> 00:51:44.460
straightened and Jesus,

872
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:49.340
she's kind of shoved her forward right now in Jesus name and Jesus.

873
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:53.300
Now try it now. Move around. Do what you're comfortable before.

874
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.770
Stand back and give yourself plenty of room

875
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.850
faith is what you're calling bill before.

876
00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.550
I really don't want to say that she was healed or that she wasn't healed

877
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.370
painter cause she was just crying.

878
00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.730
Isn't a hundred percent bad.

879
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:19.220
But I did meet a woman who something,

880
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.590
I think something did happen with the other woman that I met,

881
00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.990
had a x-ray. There was nothing wrong with it from my phone sticks.

882
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:29.330
Now she comes up,

883
00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:33.750
I'm older woman in her 50s or 60s and she just holds her hands out and I know I

884
00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:38.830
cleaned some tents.

885
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:43.370
Try to grab something. You have carpal tunnel problems,

886
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:46.790
probably carpal tunnel. Explain what that is. I mean, as far as I know,

887
00:52:46.791 --> 00:52:50.270
it's like an inflammation of the, of the ligaments and it's really,

888
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:52.280
really painful. It's a repetitive stress injury.

889
00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:55.510
I want to show you something though. Sandra sand right here, sideways cover.

890
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.810
You could everybody see what he does is he basically tells her to to grip

891
00:52:59.811 --> 00:53:00.790
together her little pen,

892
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:05.570
pinky and her phone and make a ring like an okay symbol.

893
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.000
Now I'm going to take my smallest finger, my pinky.

894
00:53:08.001 --> 00:53:10.250
Then he sticks his finger in in the room.

895
00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.310
Try to see if I can pull my pinky through your hands. He says,

896
00:53:13.311 --> 00:53:14.150
I'm going to try to break it,

897
00:53:14.151 --> 00:53:17.240
and he tried to stop me and I want you to fight me. Now I want to.

898
00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:19.070
I want to see how much strength you have. After you're ready.

899
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.510
He just pops it right open. You got no strength. Throw it all day.

900
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:27.060
She can't hold her grip. That means she got trouble in her carpal tunnel,

901
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:30.780
which is right here. Give me those hands. Give me those hands.

902
00:53:30.781 --> 00:53:33.720
She gives them her hand. He takes it in both of his carpal tunnel.

903
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:38.220
I command you in Jesus name for all swelling and inflammation rubbing right with

904
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:38.880
his thumbs.

905
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.270
I command all the ligaments and tendons that go back to the normally last.

906
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:44.130
Statistically that's supposed to be a narrowed command,

907
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:48.030
all pain to be gone over to this carpal tunnel region like coromandel healing

908
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:51.720
like one to this entire arm and his carpal tunnel and all strength that come

909
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:55.140
back there and Jesus now then do it again. He says, okay,

910
00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.730
let's do the same demonstration right again.

911
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:00.900
He hasn't bring her pinky against your thumb like that. Make that grip.

912
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.050
I'm going to take my big finger and I'm going to fight you and when he puts his

913
00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:07.110
finger in this and to watch what's going to happen in Paul, you're ready.

914
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:13.020
He doesn't break her grip and you can hear,

915
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:14.610
he just drags her right across the stage.

916
00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:15.723
<v 4>Okay.</v>

917
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:23.360
<v 1>This is the way it worked. It maybe did Lee's temporarily. Um,</v>

918
00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.230
she went back to her seat. They gave her a blanket. She was really trembling.

919
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.610
I went over to talk to her.

920
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:33.060
Can you describe what the experience was like for you?

921
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:38.550
I didn't feel anything at first.

922
00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.130
But then when he did that thing,

923
00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:50.950
Christian belief is that Christ died for our sins.

924
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:55.960
They actual phrases, which they always repeat is Jesus Christ. I'm healed.

925
00:54:55.961 --> 00:55:00.110
By his stripes, we were healed by the stripes of Jesus. You were here, heal me.

926
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:04.300
When he died on the cross, what does that mean? It means that you were healed.

927
00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:08.890
Meaning he died on the cross for our sins and also for our ailments.

928
00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:11.440
So we've already been healed. We've already been healed.

929
00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:15.820
We just have to access it and realize it by our connection and relationship to

930
00:55:15.821 --> 00:55:20.500
God. Okay, so, so what happened to Linda afterwards?

931
00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:24.100
The carpal tunnel came back almost immediately and um,

932
00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:25.780
I met with her in a coffee shop.

933
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:30.470
<v 18>But let's talk about, this is my belief from reading the word of God. The Devil,</v>

934
00:55:30.471 --> 00:55:33.950
Satan comes in, tries to talk you out of that. He, like he say,

935
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:38.090
you didn't really get healed. You know, like those things come into your mind.

936
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:40.400
And I believe that's just Satan.

937
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:45.680
So you have to have strong faith to stand against that

938
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:50.120
<v 1>pain is Satan's way of testing her belief. I think that's what she thinks.</v>

939
00:55:50.121 --> 00:55:54.140
I talked to Satan and I tell him, yeah, like the pain is part of the test.

940
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:59.120
God says you're a liar and if the pain is there, she's not healed.

941
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:03.200
She's seeing this, this bigger struggle,

942
00:56:03.201 --> 00:56:08.060
this bigger battle where pain is just one more kind of obstacles.

943
00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:12.950
<v 18>Not that there aren't times that I, I doubt I do. I thought I,</v>

944
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:15.260
but I have to be pet and I have to say I'm sorry God.

945
00:56:15.261 --> 00:56:20.210
I doubt it because I know you've healed me so many times and so many different

946
00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:22.790
things so I know it's for real. It's,

947
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.780
<v 1>you know, fake on my part cause I know that. I think that's a crucial point.</v>

948
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:31.480
I mean if we think of it as a medical encounter,

949
00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:35.230
it's about pain and the body.

950
00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.860
But if we think of it as a spiritual encounter, the way she sees it,

951
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.490
it's really a battle against doubt.

952
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:53.790
<v 2>Reporter Gregory Warner, thanks to him and to you for listening.</v>
