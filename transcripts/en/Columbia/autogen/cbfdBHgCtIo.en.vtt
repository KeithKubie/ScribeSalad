Institute the second thing that we try
 

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.580
Institute the second thing that we try
to do with them is create communities of

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:22.590
to do with them is create communities of
 

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.580
to do with them is create communities of
action and we created two communities of

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:25.590
action and we created two communities of
 

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.940

you know are really dealing a lot with
 

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:45.040
you know are really dealing a lot with
computer modeling and design and so it

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.050
computer modeling and design and so it
 

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.600
computer modeling and design and so it
becomes a very different kind of

becomes a very different kind of
 

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.049
becomes a very different kind of
resource for people to access and also a

00:12:50.049 --> 00:12:50.059
resource for people to access and also a
 

00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:51.699
resource for people to access and also a
very different kind of resource for

00:12:51.699 --> 00:12:51.709
very different kind of resource for
 

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:54.670
very different kind of resource for
people to begin to publishing to get

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.350
the architectural historians are calling
a pig pile just that information that

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360
a pig pile just that information that
 

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.269
a pig pile just that information that
gets brought from everywhere else

00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279

architectural historians and again we're

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180
architectural historians and again we're
 

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.680
architectural historians and again we're
working with art store and we're also

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:03.690
working with art store and we're also
 

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.960
working with art store and we're also
we're following two models really the

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:05.970
we're following two models really the
 

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.310
we're following two models really the
art store model which is a more

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320
art store model which is a more
 

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.710
art store model which is a more
traditional model and the Flickr model

faculty and students etc and so we're
 

00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:21.909
faculty and students etc and so we're
bringing scholars who work with media

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:21.919
bringing scholars who work with media
 

00:15:21.919 --> 00:15:25.609

photography and and we really want to

00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:40.799
photography and and we really want to
 

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:44.589
photography and and we really want to
focus them in on what's the critical

00:15:44.589 --> 00:15:44.599
focus them in on what's the critical
 

00:15:44.599 --> 00:15:47.629

what are the research agendas that need

00:15:49.429 --> 00:15:49.439
what are the research agendas that need
 

00:15:49.439 --> 00:15:51.319
what are the research agendas that need
to be developed in order to really

00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:51.329
to be developed in order to really
 

00:15:51.329 --> 00:15:53.509
to be developed in order to really
understand the infrastructures that need

of the things that we've been able to do

00:15:59.059 --> 00:15:59.069
of the things that we've been able to do
 

00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:01.519
of the things that we've been able to do
in this institute that we weren't with

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:01.529
in this institute that we weren't with
 

00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:03.710
in this institute that we weren't with
architectural historians is to bring

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720
architectural historians is to bring
 

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.149
architectural historians is to bring
together both theorists and

00:16:05.149 --> 00:16:05.159
together both theorists and
 

00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:08.029
together both theorists and
practitioners and in fact out of the 25

00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:08.039
practitioners and in fact out of the 25
 

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:10.039
practitioners and in fact out of the 25
people that we have coming to the

people that we have coming to the
 

00:16:10.049 --> 00:16:12.679
people that we have coming to the
Institute we did not invite anybody who

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:12.689
Institute we did not invite anybody who
 

00:16:12.689 --> 00:16:15.590
Institute we did not invite anybody who
was either a theorist or a practitioner

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600
was either a theorist or a practitioner
 

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.289
was either a theorist or a practitioner
but people who are both theorists and

00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:18.299
but people who are both theorists and
 

00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:21.829
but people who are both theorists and
practitioners because we feel that that

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839
practitioners because we feel that that
 

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:24.679
practitioners because we feel that that
integration of the tube is absolutely

integration of the tube is absolutely
 

00:16:24.689 --> 00:16:28.189
integration of the tube is absolutely
critical to moving forward and what we

00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199
critical to moving forward and what we
 

00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:30.769
critical to moving forward and what we
hope to develop this summer is now a

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779
hope to develop this summer is now a
 

00:16:30.779 --> 00:16:33.229
hope to develop this summer is now a
community of action which is a visual

00:16:33.229 --> 00:16:33.239
community of action which is a visual
 

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:35.509

scholarship community of action and
 

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:37.939
scholarship community of action and
until we have that summer institute

00:16:37.939 --> 00:16:37.949
until we have that summer institute
 

00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:40.999
until we have that summer institute
meeting we really don't know what the

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:41.009
meeting we really don't know what the
 

00:16:41.009 --> 00:16:43.159
meeting we really don't know what the
communities of action are going to

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:43.169
communities of action are going to
 

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.559
communities of action are going to
exactly look like and what kind of real

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:45.569
exactly look like and what kind of real

exactly look like and what kind of real
advances we think we can make with that

00:16:47.779 --> 00:16:47.789
advances we think we can make with that
 

00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:51.229
advances we think we can make with that
community of action one of the ones

that's clearly on online right now is

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:53.159
that's clearly on online right now is
 

00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:54.739
that's clearly on online right now is
the development of a research agenda

00:16:54.739 --> 00:16:54.749
the development of a research agenda
 

00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:58.069
the development of a research agenda
because we think that that's really key

00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079
because we think that that's really key
 

00:16:58.079 --> 00:17:01.280

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.270
Centers for digital humanities and they
don't have much money yet because they

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280
don't have much money yet because they
 

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.590
don't have much money yet because they
don't know what it is they want to do
