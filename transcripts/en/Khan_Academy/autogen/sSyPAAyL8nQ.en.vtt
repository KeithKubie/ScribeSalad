00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.260
 Let's say I have a path in the xy plane, that essentially 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.990
 is the unit circle. 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:15.080
 This is my y-axis, this is my x-axis, and our path 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.780
 becomes the unit circle. 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.070
 And we are going to do it this way. 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.940
 We're going to turn it clockwise. 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.460
 I think you understand the idea. 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.530
 And the comparison is therefore that of the unity circle. 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.600
 So the equation is x squared plus y is squared 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.440
 equal to 1; has a radius of 1 unit circle. 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.690
 And as far as we are concerned it is about the line integral 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.700
 about this curve c. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.310
 It is a closed curve c. 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:11.400
 Actually it goes in the direction of 2y dx minus 3x dy. 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.760
 So, we are inclined to Green's statement 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.520
 to use and why not? 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.200
 Let's try. 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.970
 This is our path. 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.510
 So the statement of Green tells us that the integral of a curve 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:33.640
 f times dr over a path where f equals-- let me have it 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.020
 what nicer writing. 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:46.650
 Where f of x, y is equal to P of x, yi plus Q of x, y j. 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.960
 That this integral is equal to the double integral of the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.510
 area-- This is the area that it is about 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.780
 in this example. 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:10.140
 over the area of ​​the portion of Q with respect to x 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.170
 minus the portion of P with respect to y. 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.250
 All that times dA, the differential of the surface. 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.110
 And of course, the area is what I just showed you. 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.690
 Maybe you remember-- there is one 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.500
 something small here, whatever you like it 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.590
 would give the wrong answer. 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.370
 In the last video we said that Green's statement applies when 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.220
 we go counterclockwise. 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.905
 See it with a little thing on the integral 

00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:42.410
 counterclockwise. 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.740
 In our example, the curve goes clockwise. 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.430
 the area is on our right. 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.295
 Green's position applies if the area is on our left. 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.000
 So in this situation if the region is to our right and 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.340
 we are going-- so this is counterclockwise. 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.140
 So in our example, where we go clockwise, the area is 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.960
 on our right, Green's position becomes 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.730
 the negative of this. 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.970
 So in our example, we need the integral of c - en 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.670
 we go clockwise. 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.910
 So that's how I draw it. Van f times dr. This is 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.000
 equal to the double integral of the area. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.960
 You can swap this-- the part of P relating to 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.880
 to y minus the portion of Q with respect to x da. 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.650
 So let's do that. 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.480
 This becomes equal to, in this example, the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.420
 integral of the area-- let's leave it now 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.000
 keep abstract 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.420
 We could set limits, but let's 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.930
 keep the area abstract. 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.790
 And what's the part of P regarding-- let's remember, 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.650
 this here is our-- I think we can assume now 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.010
 that if we take dr f times, we get this. 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.940
 The dr gives these parts. 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.330
 The f gives these two parts. 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.570
 So this is P of x, y. 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.370
 And then this is Q of x, y. 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.865
 And we saw it. 

00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:16.010
 I don't always want it 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.950
 take product. 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.120
 I think you can see that this is the internal product 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.570
 of two vectors. 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.310
 This is the x component of f, y component of f. 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.300
 This is the x component of dr, y component of dr. So let 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.290
 we take the part of P with respect to y. 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.740
 We take the derivative of this with respect to y, you get 2. 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.740
 the Derivative of 2y is just 2. 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.590
 So you get 2, and then, minus the derivative of 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.270
 Q with respect to x. 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.100
 The derivative of this with regard to x is -3. 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.800
 So we get -3, and all that times da. 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.430
 And this is equal to the integral of the area. 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.540
 What is this, it is 2 min -3? 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.510
 That is the same as 2 plus 3. 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.190
 So it's the integral of the 5dA region. 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.280
 5 is a constant, so we take it from the integral. 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.230
 So it becomes a fairly simple problem in the end. 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.790
 So this is equal to 5 times the double integral 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.870
 of the area R dA. 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.080
 What is this now? 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.610
 What is this here? 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.880
 It seems very abstract, but we can solve this. 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.770
 It is only the surface of the area. 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.550
 That is what the double integral stands for. 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.470
 You just take all the small DAs. 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.490
 This is a dA, this is a dA. 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.270
 You count the infinite amount of small 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.150
 dAs in the area together. 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.580
 Well, what is the surface of this unit circle? 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.730
 This involves a bit of third-class knowledge. 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.630
 rather than that maybe-- pre-algebra or first year 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.860
 geometry. 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.960
 Surface area is equal to pi r squared. 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.360
 what is our radius? 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.800
 Unity circle, so our radius is 1. 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.980
 Length is 1. 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.200
 So the surface here is pi. 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.290
 so this little thing here, that whole thing is 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.350
 just equal to pi. 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.460
 so the answer to our line integral is 5 pi, what 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.570
 quite a simple one. 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.420
 I mean, we would have the trouble of setting up a double 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.870
 may have taken integrally, where we take the primitive with regard to 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.990
 write y first and write y is equal to the negative square root of 1 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.990
 min x squared y equals the positive square root. 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.810
 x ranges from minus 1 to 1. 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.060
 But that really takes a beard and we don't feel like it. 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.250
 And we just have to realize, no, this is just the surface. 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.000
 And I challenge you 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.170
 solve the same in its entirety without using Green's theorem. 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.310
 You know, after generating a parameterization of these 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.230
 curve, in that direction, taking the distractions 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.660
 from x from t and from y from t. 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.880
 Multiplying the appropriate and then the primitive taking-- 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.540
 A huge detour so compared to using 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.810
 Green's statement to get 5 pi. 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.645
 And remember, the reason it wasn't a -5 pi here, 

00:06:54.645 --> 00:06:57.980
 is because we go clockwise. 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.040
 If we went counterclockwise 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.330
 we could have used the normal position of Green. 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.200
 And we would have received -5 pi. 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.530
 Anyway, I hope you found this useful.
