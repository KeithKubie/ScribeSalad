00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:12.010
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.990
My goal is to not actually
do any measurements

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.460
other than using pie.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.560
So the entire thing is
going to pie based.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.020
We get the circumference in
the exact number of pies--

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.770
give or take-- we get the
diameter in number of pies.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.350
Divide one by the other,
we get pi.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.030
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.795
Pi was historically rarely
calculated this way, because

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:41.420
it's notoriously inaccurate
to try and get--

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.510
I know, we're idiots-- it's
notoriously inaccurate to try

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.640
and calculate pi by measuring
a circle.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:01:10.020
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.480
To get any kind of accuracy on
our final answer we have to be

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.900
as precise as we can be.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.382
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.520
This is a mild problem, because
I want to go from the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.290
very edge of the circle.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.680
But as you can see, I've
positioned all the pies

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.500
exactly on the line as if
they're little mini tangents.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.880
So I'm going to have to move
these two out and then I can

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.920
start doing the diameter exactly
on the circumference

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.904
there, like that.

00:01:41.904 --> 00:01:59.620
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.195
So that's 84 and 1/3.

00:02:03.195 --> 00:02:08.020
264 and 2/3 pies around,
we have the diameter,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.860
is 84 and 1/3 pie.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.120
To get pi, we just divide the
circumference by the diameter.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.255
OK, and if we actually work out
what that is, it equals--

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:21.640
that's pretty good.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:34.000
Pi from pies, we got 3.13834,
which is approximately 3.14.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.295
So using pies, we've
got pi to be 3.14.

00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:44.306
I am a very happy
man right now.

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:48.070
With the diameter, and if I know
that ratio, I can just

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.200
measure the diameter.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.160
That's the easy bit
to measure.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.000
The center point will
be my pen, and the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.390
outside will be the chalk.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.510
So the pies, in theory, are
a fairly consistent size.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.680
So they're all--

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.302
yeah they're about the same.

00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:03.754
OK.

00:03:03.754 --> 00:03:13.840
