00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
 

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.930
In the video where we introduced
the atom, I went

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.430
off a bit about how at the
center of an atom we have the

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.100
nucleus, and it's actually a
very small fraction of the

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.270
total volume of the atom.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.930
And the electron, even though we
call it a particle, it can

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.640
really be best described
as kind of a

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.600
smear around this nucleus.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.980
That although it's a particle,
because of the Heisenberg

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.730
uncertainty principle, we can
never tell exactly at a given

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.870
moment where the particle is
and what its momentum is.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.479
So to describe it as a particle
is a little bit, I

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.530
don't know, at best, it's
a little bit strange.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.880
And we said that the way that
they describe it, they don't

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.170
say that this particle is in
an orbit, like the planets

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.720
around the Sun in orbit
would be like that.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.040
That would be like the
orbit of Halley's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.680
Comet around the Sun.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.590
Instead, it can be described
as a probability function

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.920
around the nucleus.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.040
So if the nucleus is there, we
have one orbital, actually the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.900
1s orbital, and we'll talk
about that in this video.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.850
It'll be a sphere around
the nucleus.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.890
And actually the sphere has
no strict boundary.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.440
Whenever you see someone draw
it, they're just saying, where

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.050
is 90% of the time the
electron going to be.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.120
And then they'll cut
off a boundary.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.450
And they'll say, OK, it's going
to be within this sphere

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.290
and it actually gets denser
as you get into the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.270
center of the sphere.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.550
So if this was a cross-section,
it would be

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.330
really dense in the center, and
it gets less dense, less

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.350
dense as you go outside.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.330
Which just means that there's
a much higher probability of

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.570
finding the electron in the 1s
orbital near the center than

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.650
near the outside.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.710
Although this boundary point out
here is just artificial.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.060
You can find the electron
pretty much anywhere.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.810
It just has a much lower
probability out

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.570
there than in here.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.150
But I'll touch on that
in more detail in the

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.670
rest of this video.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.100
But I wanted to go back
to the Bohr model.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.430
And the Bohr model is the kind
of-- let me write that down.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.060
Bohr model.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.240
And sometimes it's
nice to know it's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.570
named after Niels Bohr.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.550
And don't think that this
guy was some slouch.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.150
He was at the cutting
edge and this wasn't

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.280
even that long ago.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.550
This was roughly about
100 years ago.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.980
So already we're talking about
things that you can probably

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.630
dig up research papers in your
library not too long ago where

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.600
people are debating some
of these issues.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.590
But in the Bohr model, that's
the model where he kind of

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.470
modeled electrons as planets
revolving around a star or

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.970
around the Sun.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.950
And that model is actually
useful, at least it's useful

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.380
in my brain, to conceptualize
the idea of energy states.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.140
So this is an electron around
the nucleus, right?

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.400
It's moving around
in an orbit.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.070
And we know, and I want to
emphasize, orbits aren't

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.060
really what happen.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.520
Orbitals are what happen.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.750
And orbitals are more like
probability functions as to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.740
where you might find the
electron, while an orbit is a

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.740
very kind of classical,
mechanical way of describing

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.610
the path of a classical
object, like a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.780
planet around a star.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.520
I don't want to say the
analogy too much.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.880
But if you view this model,
the idea of energy levels

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.900
start to make sense.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.840
For example, if I have something
orbiting, if I have

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.020
a planet orbiting a
star, like that.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.390
And if it were to have more
energy, perhaps its orbit

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.930
would become more elliptical.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.160
Maybe for some reason I put some
more energy into this.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.640
I had a little rocket booster on
this planet right now that

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.430
temporarily put some
energy into it.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.990
Instead of going down this path,
maybe it'll push it this

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.950
way, and maybe it'll
accelerate it

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.850
a little bit faster.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.540
And maybe it'll go something
like this.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.180
I don't know, I haven't
done the math.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.850
But in general it's going to
have a little bit higher

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.150
kinetic energy, so it's going
to get a little bit further

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.450
away from the planet.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.580
And then maybe if I
rocket-boosted it again, its

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.230
path would look something
like this.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.070
 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.550
Its orbit would get further
pushed out and as it

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.740
approaches the planet, it
actually would achieve faster

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.020
speeds as it approaches the
planet with gravity.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.560
And there's a couple of
interesting things here.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.560
One, obviously, the planet or
the rocket that has this orbit

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.810
has more energy.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.250
 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:26.560
This one right here will have
more energy than, let's say,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.530
this one over here.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.520
And energy, even though we're
talking in the quantum world

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.510
and this is just analogy,
because we know orbits don't

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.270
really apply, but energy is
really the same energy that we

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.160
talk about in anything.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.610
And energy is the ability to
do work or transmit heat or

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.360
create heat.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.160
So, you know, if you're not
doing work and you have

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.990
energy, you might kind
of waste the work

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.950
by generating heat.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.320
We'll talk more about that
in future videos.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.650
But it's the same idea, right?

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.970
If I had a little rocket pack
and put some energy into this,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.570
or pushed it somehow, I might
get into this higher orbit.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.950
The idea of orbitals is the same
thing, except obviously

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.800
they aren't these well-defined
paths.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.340
That as electrons get more
energy, and that energy can be

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.970
given to the electron, mainly
through light waves, or

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.380
electromagnetic waves can be
put onto the electron.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.850
And when we do quantum
mechanics, we'll do that in

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.650
more detail.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.630
But, essentially, if you view
light as a bunch of packets,

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.440
as a bunch of photons, and a
photon hits an electron in a

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.950
certain energy state, all of a
sudden it will enter a higher

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.540
energy state.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.260
And maybe it'll go to this
probably distribution that's a

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.850
shell around that one.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.980
And maybe if, after it gets
excited-- these are words that

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.500
you hear physicists and chemists
say a lot-- but

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.550
excited just means that energy
was put into the electron and

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.650
it went to a higher
energy state.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.920
And it might stay there or it
might just want to go back to

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.060
its lower energy state.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.260
So when it goes back to its
lower energy state, it would

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.850
emit the photon back, and that's
actually why you see

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.595
some things sometimes glow.

00:05:57.595 --> 00:05:59.920
But we'll talk more about that
in the future, as well.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.980
But I really want to give this
intuitive point, because in

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.700
the rest of chemistry and in a
lot of physics people talk a

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.210
lot about energy states, or
the electron going into a

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.720
higher or lower energy state,
and that's just the general

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.240
idea, is that an electron in a
kind of higher orbital has had

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.670
energy put into it, although
it wants to get back to its

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.800
lower orbital.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.480
Now you might ask, how
can an electron

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.850
stay in a higher orbital?

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.940
For example, what if an electron
just stayed, what if

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.440
we already had two electrons
in this orbital over here?

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.650
And we'll talk a little bit
about how the different

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.960
orbitals get filled.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.890
But I want to give you the
intuition first. Let's say you

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.590
had two electrons.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.790
They're just all over
this place.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.170
You can't even pinpoint them.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.640
And then I were to add
a third electron.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.640
So you might say, oh, the lowest
energy state is this

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.850
magenta inner sphere
that I just drew.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.060
Why wouldn't that third
electron go there?

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.490
Well, my intuition is that,
well there's already two

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.590
electrons there, and although
the electrons are attracted to

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.180
the nucleus because the nucleus
has all the positive

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.850
charge in it, and the electrons
have all the

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.130
negative charge, it's repelled
by these two electrons.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.430
Because negative, like charges
repel each other.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.700
So it will want to stay away
from these two electrons.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.600
And so it will go to the
next energy state.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.520
It'll maybe go into this
shell out here.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.590
And the other interesting thing
about energy states--

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.400
and this is key to chemistry
when we start talking about

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.900
reactivity and how something
might react with something

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.640
else, and why would it -- is
that things at a high energy

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.760
state, for example if we use the
orbit analogy, this high

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.180
energy state, in the case of
planets they get further from

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.310
the body that they're kind
of attracted to, so the

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.300
gravitational force is weaker.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.530
Or in the case of electrons,
when they get further away

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.360
from a high energy state,
the coulomb

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.260
force is weaker, right?

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.170
The charges we talk about when
we talk about electrons and

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.565
protons, those are the
coulomb forces.

00:07:51.565 --> 00:07:54.130
So this is a negative charge
and then you have positive

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.310
charges in the center.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.330
But it gets further away,
I guess is the best way

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:57.980
to think about it.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.340
And so the force from the
nucleus is weaker, so they're

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.480
easier to pluck off.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.390
They're easier to pluck off
and maybe share with other

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.980
atoms. Or maybe to give to other
atoms, and we'll talk a

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.770
lot about that when we
talk about bonding.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.480
But I wanted to give you
this intuition first.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.350
So then the next question that
might arise is, well, so how

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.190
do the electrons fill the
different orbitals, and what

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.990
do those orbitals actually
look like?

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.170
And I've cut and pasted
some interesting

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.450
graphics from Wikipedia.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.090
So here are the orbitals.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.130
Here are the different
orbitals.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.370
And so there's two aspects
to the orbital.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.090
One is its shell, its
energy shell.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.610
And that's given by this
number here, n.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.960
That's the energy shell.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.549
And just so you know,
everything

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:41.929
kind of fits together.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:46.260
Those energy shells correspond
to periods in

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.370
the periodic table.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.880
So a period on the periodic
table is literally

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.910
just a row in it.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:59.060
So this is period one in the
periodic table, right there

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.970
all the way to helium.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:01.790
That's period one.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.400
It's just the first row.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.350
And that means that the elements
in that first period,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.520
that their electrons will fill
the first energy shell.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.110
So for example, hydrogen
has one proton.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.680
And everything we do, we're
going to assume neutral atoms.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.880
So we can take-- we learned in
the last video, that the

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.440
atomic number tells you how many
protons there are, right?

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.650
This is how many protons
there are in hydrogen.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.130
But if we assume it's a neutral
atom, we can say that

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.655
this is also the number
of electrons.

00:09:34.655 --> 00:09:38.210
So we can use the atomic number
also as an indicator of

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.640
how many electrons in
a neutral atom.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.000
So this has one electron.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.530
Where does it go?

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.180
Well, it's in the first period,
so it's going to go

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.110
into the first energy shell.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.620
And so the first electron
will go right here in

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.420
the 1s energy shell.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.310
So if we wanted to write the
electron configuration for

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.430
hydrogen, we would write--
so hydrogen, the electron

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:08.570
configuration, it's in the
first energy cell, at 1s.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.775
And there's only one
electron there.

00:10:10.775 --> 00:10:14.080
And what does that first
orbital subshell, that

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.970
s-shell, look like?

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:15.970
It's just a sphere.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.770
It's actually what I just drew
at the top of the video.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:18.870
It's literally just a sphere.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.820
And if I were to draw a
cross-section of it, it gets

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.550
denser in the center and
then it gets less

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.880
dense as you go outside.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.040
And in the last video I showed
you what the helium, you could

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.760
kind of say, the orbital
function looks like.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.450
And you saw, it was really dark
and dense in the middle

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.290
and it got more sparse
and grayer and

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.650
whiter as you went outside.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:40.960
So what is helium's electron
configuration?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.580
Well, in each of these
subshells-- and I'll be a

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.560
little bit more specific in
probably the next video,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.340
because I'm pretty much out
of time-- you can put two.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.080
I guess in each of the geometric
configurations for

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.180
each subshell, you can
put two electrons.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.620
And we'll do that in some
detail in the future.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.380
So the configuration
for helium.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.820
It's in the first period.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.560
So it's 1s2.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.520
So in the s subshell within the
first period or the first

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.380
energy shell, it has two
electrons there.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.350
Fascinating.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.940
So what about lithium?

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.310
Lithium, right here.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.900
Also the name of an
Evanescence song.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.020
I think it's the name of an
Evanescence song because it's

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.540
used to treat depression, or at
least in the past it's been

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.610
used to treat depression.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.330
So, lithium.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.020
What is its electron
configuration?

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.450
So the first electron
goes into 1s1.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.770
The second electron
goes into 1s2.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.280
And when I say the first
or second, I'm

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.620
saying energy states.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.680
So the first electron
wants to go into the

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.810
lowest energy state.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.350
That's in the s1.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.240
Then the second electron
also wants to go there.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.370
And two electrons can fit in
that first energy state, or

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.520
that first sub-orbital,
or that first shell.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.480
So then it becomes 1s2.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.720
Then lithium.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.540
It fills that first 1s2.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.760
It fills the first energy shell
and that first subshell,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.170
which is the S-shape.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.690
And so now it has to go to the
second energy shell, and that

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.340
works out relative to what I
told you before, because it's

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.930
in the second period.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.570
The second period is
that right there.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.060
Right?

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.970
It's in the second period.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:28.190
So its electron configuration
is going to be 1s2.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.260
Two of its electrons fill just
the way helium filled.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.600
And then its third electron
will be 2s1.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.430
 

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.980
So that's its electron
configuration.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.870
What do I mean by 2s1?

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.530
Well, so, lithium is going to
have two electrons in that

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.960
little dot that I
overwrote it.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.880
And then around that dot,
there's another shell, which

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.260
is the second energy shell.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.960
And it's going to have one
electron in there.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.260
So let me see if I
can draw that.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:59.070
So it's going to have one
probability, I guess, sphere,

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.130
where the first two electrons
are going to reside.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.320
And if this is a cross-section,
that third

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.510
electron is going to reside in
it in a probability shell

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:06.970
around that.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.530
When I draw these, that's not
like the electron is exactly

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:10.550
there in the orbital.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.210
I'm just drawing where you're
just doing a cutoff, where you

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.110
say it's a 90% chance of
finding the electron.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.880
The electron could show up
there or there or there.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.500
But this would be a very low
probability, while right here

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.870
would be a very, very
high probability.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.340
Anyway, I'm out of time
in this video.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.430
I'm going to continue this
discussion in the next video.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.290
And I'll start talking about
the more bizarro shapes the

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.240
orbitals can take on, and
maybe give you a little

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.910
intuition on why these shapes
aren't really that bizarro.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.254
