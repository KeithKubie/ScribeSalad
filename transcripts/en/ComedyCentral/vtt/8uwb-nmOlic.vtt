00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.080
75% of Americans believe there are events
that cannot be explained.

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:10.218
Over half of them are
celebrities.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.100
Noises, shapes, shadows.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.073
Hello? Weird dolls.Ghost hands.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.016
Uh-oh.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.785
Bye!

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.794
As a celebrity,
I'm not superstitious, but I do assume

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:32.665
that everything I don't
understand is black magic.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.340
This was the first vacation
I booked since I got famous,

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:40.005
so I wanted to treat myself
to a fancy hotel.

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:41.040
(bell chimes)

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:42.675
(laughing)

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.380
Just having
a bit of fun. In the past, I've always stayed
at motels where the door

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:50.183
to my room opens
directly to the parking lot,

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.118
which is cool 'cause you can
check on your car.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.988
But this time, I was looking
forward to being treated

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:57.290
better than other people.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:58.825
I don't have to tip
'cause I have this.

00:00:58.891 --> 00:00:59.958
Bye.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:02.094
Yes.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:06.733
The first night, I met a really
chill couple from the Keys,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.701
who, like me, were
down for whatever.

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:10.936
We should go have sex
with each other.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.072
Then, at the last minute,
they had a change of heart.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.640
No hard feelings.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.977
And if they change their mind,
like, they know where I am.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.714
In the morning,
I woke up to a strange sound.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.517
It was like...

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:27.020
(knocking)

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.656
(knocking continues)

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:33.459
It was like a door noise
but on the other side...

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.095
...of the door.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.265
What?

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.802
When I opened the door,
a "USA Today"

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.239
had appeared on the floor.

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:50.043
So I was like, um,
"Okay, that's weird."

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.845
Like, now it's weird.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:55.582
I was bugging out.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:59.118
So I went into town
to do a Segway tour

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.720
and score some
Caribbean Adderall.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:04.256
When I get back,

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:08.194
the first thing
I notice is that my towel

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:11.531
has been transformed
into a swan.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:18.904
And then I see that
on top of my pillow

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:23.709
is an even tinier pillow
made entirely of chocolate.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.811
And now I know
there's a ghost.

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:27.680
I know.

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:31.483
I tested my ghost theory by
dumping out all of the shampoo

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.220
and drinking all of
the bottles from the mini bar.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:36.589
I remember thinking, like,

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:39.926
"Let's see
a ghost deal with this."

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:41.960
But then I bounced out

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:44.396
and I ran into the guy
who had sold me

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:46.832
a shark tooth necklace.

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.668
And just crashed
at his place.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:49.669
It was cool.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.371
He had a snake.

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:57.810
When I got back, I was almost
too scared to open the door.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:05.083
All the bottles
were full again.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.953
And the room was spotless.

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:09.622
I just broke down.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.725
I called my personal life
coach and psychic, Cheyakee.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.328
There's a (bleep) swan here!

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:23.035
I've known Amy for 12 weeks and
if she says she saw a ghost and

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:25.238
agrees to fly me down
business class,

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:28.207
then guess what,
she saw a ghost.

00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:30.910
(knocking)

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.778
That's the door noise
I told you about.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.547
(woman)
Mrs. Schumer!

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:36.516
What do you want
with us, spirit?

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:37.750
(woman)
Hello, housekeeping.

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:39.285
You're not
welcome here!

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.286
(woman)
Okay, thank you.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.287
I come back.

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.222
(screaming)

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.691
Oh God!

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:48.594
(Amy)
I checked out that day.

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.764
I guess there are more forces
out there than meets the eye.

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:57.003
And sometimes, those
forces bring us swan towels.
