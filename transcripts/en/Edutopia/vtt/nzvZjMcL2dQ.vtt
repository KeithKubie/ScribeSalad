&gt;&gt;Jon: What if I told you,

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.556
you could stop taking
papers home to grade?

00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:18.046
Have I got your attention yet?

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:21.046
Well, you can in a
flipped class environment.

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:24.996
It frees up valuable class
time for interactions

00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:27.386
and formative assessments
with your students.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.736
&gt;&gt;Aaron: In a flip classroom,
you get a lot of time back.

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:32.326
That time that's now freed up,

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:34.596
since you're not delivering
direct instruction, you're doing

00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:36.336
that outside of the
classroom through video,

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:38.076
you can use that for
formative assessment.

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:40.976
You can talk to every kid
in every class, every day,

00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:42.906
in order to get them
moving along as well

00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:44.876
as getting valuable
information for yourself

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:47.356
about who has mastered
what skills and concepts.

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:50.636
This gives you the power
to differentiate for each

00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:53.066
of those individual students,
based on the feedback

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.776
that you're getting
from each of them.

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:57.996
So when a teacher is
checking in with each student

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:00.396
like that every day, they've
got a lot more information

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:01.056
to go from.

00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:02.556
No longer does the
teacher need to wait

00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:05.416
until that summative assessment,
that final exam or that end

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:07.776
of unit exam to know
where the students are at.

00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:11.036
They have all sorts of
information and data in front

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.716
of them to know where each
kid is in their understanding

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:15.296
and their mastery
of these objectives.

00:01:15.296 --> 00:01:17.376
&gt;&gt;Jon: Since you're going
to spend more time talking

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.146
to every kid in every
class, every day,

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:20.916
you're able to customize
the learning

00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:23.356
and particularly the
assessments for each kid.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.416
The kids are still going to
be learning the same content,

00:01:25.536 --> 00:01:27.206
but they're going to
be learning in a way

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:30.166
that makes the most sense for
them, and also being assessed

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:34.446
in a way that is individualized
and differentiated for each kid.
