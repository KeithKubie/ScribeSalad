Dr. Tyson, I want to do exactly what you do.
What did you study to be where you are right now?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.330
Neil: I studied physics and math both of which

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.380
constitute the language of the universe.
In the same way you want if you go

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.400
to China you learn Mandarin you speak to
people there, and you learn Spanish to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.730
go to Spain you speak to people there.
You want to speak to the universe

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.779
and understand what it's telling you,
you gotta speak its language.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.109
It's math and physics basically. The
foundations of the sciences. And so

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.050
that's what I did. So I majored in
physics in college and then got a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.760
PhD in astrophysics and then you are
conversant. But I do these other

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.850
things - I write books and this sort of thing - 
so I think a lot about how people learn

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.100
and how they pay attention and so I fold
in what I know with what it is to share

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.879
that love. Then I'm just doing what Carl
Sagan said you do. "When you're in love

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.260
you want to tell the world." 
Chuck: Ooh, how romantic!
