[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.390
JEREMY WALKER: Hi.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.720
My name's Jeremy Walker.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.210
Welcome to YouTube
Developers Live.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.620
Today is all about WordPress.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.570
We're actually to talk about a
plug-in that we've kind of

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.190
released under the radar called
the YouTube Upload

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.540
Widget plug-in.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.740
And today, actually, I
have Pete Mall with

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.475
me today from Range.

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:08.520
Say hi, Pete.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.620
PETE MALL: Hi.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.740
JEREMY WALKER: So Pete actually
wrote the code for

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.500
the plug-in itself to take
advantage of the widget.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.440
And I think that's all
in PHP, right?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.490
PETE MALL: Yeah, all PHP.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.140
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.850
So what we're going to actually
do is Pete's going to

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.970
talk a little bit about
WordPress in case any of you

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.710
don't know about it who
live under a rock.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.890
And he's going to talk a
little bit about Range.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.140
And then I'm going to give a
little bit of history of what

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.820
our new plug-in does and
how we came about it.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.530
And we're going to go into a
demo, and then some code.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.550
So why don't we get started.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.440
Why don't you tell us
about WordPress.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.620
PETE MALL: So for this of you
who don't know WordPress, it's

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.760
a content management system.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.970
It started about 10 years ago
as a blogging system, a

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.580
blogging platform.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.190
And I guess over the
years, it's not

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.470
just for blogs anymore.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.470
We can see full-blown sites as
well as even apps that are

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.090
being powered by WordPress
on the back end now.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.460
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.220
So what is Range?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.520
And how does that come into
play with WordPress?

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.420
PETE MALL: So Range is a
full-service design and

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.390
development agency that I
started last year with a

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.300
couple of other WordPress
core contributors.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.090
And we've just been doing
WordPress work for the last

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.060
year, including plug-ins and
custom sites for people.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.950
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.320
So for any of you that don't
know, we obviously have the

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.080
YouTube APIs that let
you do a lot of the

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.280
things you do on YouTube.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.030
Via APIs, maybe even in your
apps, one of those things is

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.930
uploading video.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.410
And what we did a little while
ago is, we decided we wanted

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.980
to make uploading video
much easier.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.980
So we made the YouTube Upload
Widget, which not only allows

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.560
you to choose a file to upload
to YouTube, but it also allows

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.670
you to record a video from
your webcam and upload

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.370
directly to YouTube.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.510
So we wanted to take advantage
of that widget and expose it

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.800
to the WordPress folks so that
they can use it within their

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.060
environment without having to go
and mess around in YouTube.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.745
So that's where we came into
contact with you, through some

00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:12.160
of the WordPress folks.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.740
And you guys took it from there
and built out a nice

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.740
little plug-in using
this widget.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.050
And why don't we just
dive into and have

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.120
a look at it live?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.250
PETE MALL: Yeah.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.380
So, real quick, the plugin
lives on WordPress.org.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.310
If you go there, look
under Plug-ins.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.060
You'll be able to search for
the YouTube Upload Widget.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.060
And for those of you who are not
familiar with WordPress,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.850
this is how the dashboard
looks like.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.060
So the first thing I'm going to
do is go ahead and install

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.310
the plug-in.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.270
And I'm searching
for the plug-in.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.440
And it should be
the first one.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.970
And looks like it's already
installed for me.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.740
So I'm just going to go ahead
and create a new post so I can

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.300
test out the functionality.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.150
So WordPress, by default, ships
with this media manager

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.430
that lets you insert images,
galleries, either from your

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.590
computer or from another
source on the web.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.000
And we just wanted to flow the
same UI and make it that easy

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.240
for you to use your YouTube
videos or just record a video

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.950
from inside WordPress without
ever having to log into

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.430
another site.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.360
So we have this YouTube
button here.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.320
If you click that, it opens
a similar pop-up.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.030
And the first thing it's going
to ask you is a title for the

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.640
new video that you're
trying to record.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.130
I'm just going to
say Test Video.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.110
And you can have a description
there which

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.070
flows through to YouTube.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.190
And you can have keywords that
are going to be attached to

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.080
your video.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.600
JEREMY WALKER: I noticed you
guys are installing the

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.170
reference to the blog, which
is really helpful.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.160
So if someone finds your video
on YouTube, they can click on

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.400
this, and it'll take them to
the post related to that.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.640
So it drives traffic
both ways.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.340
PETE MALL: And you can always
edit this description.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.570
You can add more to it and still
leave the link in there,

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.475
so it's easy to go back and
forth between your blog and

00:09:04.475 --> 00:09:06.460
your YouTube account.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.940
So I'm just going to go
ahead and click on

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.540
the Record from Webcam.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.680
And that pops up the YouTube
Upload Widget

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.730
that you guys created.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.920
And it tells me I'm
logged in as Pete

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.400
Mall, which is my account.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.230
And it gives me a button to
record for my webcam.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.260
JEREMY WALKER: Now, if he hadn't
logged in already, he

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.540
would have gotten an
authorization window coming up

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.170
to authorize.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.040
PETE MALL: Yeah.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.800
It's the same OAuth window
that pops up.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.310
You log in.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.900
You give it permissions
to the YouTube account

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.080
to upload the video.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.330
So I can see myself.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.450
And I can just click
Start Recording.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.480
And it's going to say, do you
really want to give access to

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.570
your webcam to YouTube?

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.810
I say yes.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.510
And I can record anything.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.380
It doesn't matter whether
it's five seconds

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.170
or it's five minutes.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:51.850
It will just go through.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.350
It's the power of YouTube
behind the scenes.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.590
I clicked Stop Recording.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.320
So now I can either go back and
look through my video and

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.040
see if I like it.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.840
If I need to re-record
it, I can.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.580
But if I'm happy with it,
I can just click Upload.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.040
And if you look, it's already
got the ID for the video.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.640
So I can just directly
insert the video into

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.800
the post right now.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.130
Or I can wait a few seconds
until the video is done

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.170
processing.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.920
And then I'll actually see the
processed video show up here

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.270
and still insert the link.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:23.810
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.150
And so I guess while that's
uploading, so there's another

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.390
way to handle this as well--
oh, there we go.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.740
I'll let you insert it.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.780
PETE MALL: So again, the
video's now live.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.590
I can insert it into my post.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.610
And this uses oEmbed support,
which is baked into WordPress.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.540
So even if you're not using
this, if you want to directly

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.890
copy a link to a YouTube video
and post it, as soon as you

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:56.150
publish, it will use oEmbed to
actually grab that video.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.170
And if I just click on View Post
now, I see my new post

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.770
with the video that I just
recorded in there.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.470
And so I don't need to fumble
with any embed codes or

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.980
anything else.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.930
I just use the link directly.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.210
JEREMY WALKER: That's great.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.230
So--

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.420
and I was actually asking about
this just a second ago.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.070
So let's say you want to insert
video from YouTube, but

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.700
you don't necessarily want to
upload or record anything.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.310
Maybe you have something in
mind that'll help add some

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.796
more color to your post.

00:11:25.796 --> 00:11:26.750
PETE MALL: Yeah.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.855
So there's a lot of times
when you just

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:29.760
want to record something.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.610
But there's times when you
already have something

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.500
recorded, or you found a really
cool video that you

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.530
want to embed.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.920
Or if you're just writing a post
and you want to search

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.750
for something, you can go to
the second tab, which is

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.280
Browse YouTube Videos.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.390
And it gives you a
field to search.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.200
So I could just say WordPress.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.080
And if I click Find Videos,
it'll use the

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.680
Feeds API from YouTube.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.460
And it grabs the videos that
match my search terms.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.920
And same way, I could go through
and preview the video,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.540
or I can just click Insert.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.880
Oh, there's the video
from Matt Cutts

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.910
about SEO and WordPress.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.700
So we'll insert that one
into the post as well.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.300
So again, I can have
multiple videos.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.680
Or I could just move
my other video.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.640
As soon as I click Update,
this goes ahead

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.700
and updates my post.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.510
So I have both my videos, and
it's right there for you.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.470
JEREMY WALKER: So one thing we
always like at Google is

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.570
open-source, and the code
for the plug-in is all

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.200
open-source.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.790
So anyone that's interested
in grabbing the code and

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.090
extending it can certainly
do that.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.400
If you want to show a little
bit about that

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.080
and talk about it?

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.640
PETE MALL: So you touched
upon open-source.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.250
WordPress itself is released
under a GPL license, which

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.040
means it's free.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.320
So you can download it and do
anything you want with it as

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.230
long as you maintain the
GPL restrictions

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.430
that come with it.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:02.480
Also, any plug-in or theme
that's built on WordPress has

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.880
to either be released under
a GPL license or a license

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.790
that's compatible under
the GPL license.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.110
So it gives you the same
freedoms as the creators have.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.400
Again, if you go to
WordPress.org and search for

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.390
the plug-ins, you can search for
the YouTube Upload Widget.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.540
And it will get you
to this page.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.840
It has the info on
your licensing.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.770
It has the features,
installation instructions,

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.740
some screenshots, as
well as support.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.500
So if you have any issues, you
can just click Support, and

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.960
you can add a post to
it, and someone will

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.935
either get back to you.

00:13:33.935 --> 00:13:36.570
Or there's a huge community in
WordPress where someone would

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.820
be able to help you.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:44.260
The code itself lives on SVN
under WordPress.org.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.720
So if you click on the
Developers tab, you'll have

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.400
access to the development log,
the SVN repository, as well as

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.070
a browse track, which is one of
the bug tracking systems we

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.440
use with WordPress.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.075
But if I just want to look at
the SVN, I could see that all

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:04.720
of the code base lives there.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.500
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.400
And so it's pretty basic,
the code you wrote.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.090
You just separated it into
the pop-up window.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:18.080
And it's PHP, so there's just
a couple files that they can

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.090
browse through, correct?

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:19.860
PETE MALL: Yes.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.860
So real quick, I've broken the
code up into YouTube.php,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.730
which, if you look through it,
it has the WordPress-specific

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.680
bootstrap at the top.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.170
It tells us is the plug-in name
and a little bit about

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.920
the license and everything
else.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.210
And this is the file that we use
to hook into WordPress, to

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.280
add the button, and tell
WordPress to open a pop-up

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.880
window when someone
clicks on it.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.550
And the second file
is yt-popup.php.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.670
This is the file that actually
powers the pop-up.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:58.290
It embeds the YouTube Upload
Widget, and it's the one that

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:02.650
grabs the search API to show
that as the videos for you.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.630
So again, most of the code is
HTML, with some sprinkling of

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:07.890
PHP in here.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.780
And it just uses the
JavaScript API.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.640
So everyone's more than happy
to browse through the code.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.800
If there's any enhancements you
guys like, we're more than

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.660
happy to send in a request,
and we'll look

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.910
through your patch.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:21.350
JEREMY WALKER: Awesome.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.810
Well, thanks again for showing
this to us and the great work

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.410
you did on it.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.940
We really appreciate it.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.340
If you're interested,
check it out.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.590
If you do use WordPress, you
should definitely install the

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.870
plug-in and start
playing with it.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.530
It will definitely make
things a little bit

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.510
more easy for you.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.410
And we don't have any
questions today.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:47.740
But if any of you are interested
in a job it with

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.120

We're always looking to
hire great developers.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.020
And I think that covers
it for the show.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.570
Thanks again for coming today.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:02.750
We really appreciate it.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.110
And yeah, again, check out

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.710
Thanks, guys.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:07.960
PETE MALL: CHEERS.
