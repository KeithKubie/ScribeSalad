things that were a little confusing in
 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.539
things that were a little confusing in
the original like when Lando Calrissian

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549
the original like when Lando Calrissian
 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.190

special edition you see it's a speaker

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320
special edition you see it's a speaker
 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.590
special edition you see it's a speaker
that reaches out to the entire city but

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600
that reaches out to the entire city but
 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.740
that reaches out to the entire city but
then again does he just have a little

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750
then again does he just have a little
 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.840
then again does he just have a little
microphone like that anywhere couldn't

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850
microphone like that anywhere couldn't
 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.490
microphone like that anywhere couldn't
anyone get on that microphone and

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500
anyone get on that microphone and
 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.800
anyone get on that microphone and
details details you also see a lot more

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810
details details you also see a lot more
 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.270

opening and you see how the hell Vader
 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.990

got from Cloud City to the Star

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
got from Cloud City to the Star
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.090
got from Cloud City to the Star
Destroyer so quickly yeah that always

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100
Destroyer so quickly yeah that always
 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.560
Destroyer so quickly yeah that always
bother me in the original it's like he

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570
bother me in the original it's like he
 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.210
bother me in the original it's like he
was in one location and suddenly he's in

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220
was in one location and suddenly he's in
 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.460
was in one location and suddenly he's in
another here we actually see him take

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470
another here we actually see him take
 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.550
another here we actually see him take
the ship and go

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560
the ship and go
 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.560
the ship and go
back it's a little detail that's nice to

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570
back it's a little detail that's nice to
 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.690
back it's a little detail that's nice to
have Jedi most of the changes are good

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700
have Jedi most of the changes are good
 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.460
have Jedi most of the changes are good
too but there's still a couple things

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470
too but there's still a couple things
 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.320
too but there's still a couple things
are a little too crazy the dance

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330
are a little too crazy the dance
 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.060
are a little too crazy the dance
sequence in Jabba's palace for example

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070
sequence in Jabba's palace for example
 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.150
sequence in Jabba's palace for example
goes from this muddy dark dirty place to

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160
goes from this muddy dark dirty place to
 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.280
goes from this muddy dark dirty place to
this big musical number and there's a

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290
this big musical number and there's a
 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.040
this big musical number and there's a
lot of moving and dancing and it's just

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050
lot of moving and dancing and it's just
 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.200
lot of moving and dancing and it's just
a little too childish for me on top of

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210
a little too childish for me on top of
 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.850
a little too childish for me on top of
the fact that again the CG monsters

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860
the fact that again the CG monsters
 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.530
the fact that again the CG monsters
never really look like they're there but

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540
never really look like they're there but
 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.480
never really look like they're there but
whatever again it's neat to kind of see

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490
whatever again it's neat to kind of see
 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.280
whatever again it's neat to kind of see
a new point of view we also see a plan

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290
a new point of view we also see a plan
 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.050
a new point of view we also see a plan
at the end that we never saw in any of

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060
at the end that we never saw in any of
 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.550
at the end that we never saw in any of
the other versions but would later be in

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560
the other versions but would later be in
 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.290
the other versions but would later be in
the prequels yeah remember that planet

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300
the prequels yeah remember that planet
 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.420
the prequels yeah remember that planet
that's entirely a city you see it here

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430
that's entirely a city you see it here
 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.070
that's entirely a city you see it here
and on top of that if you look closely

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080
and on top of that if you look closely
 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.930
and on top of that if you look closely
you see a statue of the Emperor falling

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940
you see a statue of the Emperor falling
 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.280
you see a statue of the Emperor falling
over that's actually a nice little

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290
over that's actually a nice little
 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.140
over that's actually a nice little
detail so when they first came out I

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150
detail so when they first came out I
 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.879
detail so when they first came out I
didn't mind the special editions and I

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889
didn't mind the special editions and I
 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.010
didn't mind the special editions and I
still don't it's neat to see a brand new

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020
still don't it's neat to see a brand new
 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.900
still don't it's neat to see a brand new
angle on a lot of this and it's cool

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910
angle on a lot of this and it's cool
 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.030
angle on a lot of this and it's cool
that artist gets to go back revisit his

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040
that artist gets to go back revisit his
 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.500
that artist gets to go back revisit his
work and touch it up a bit

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510
work and touch it up a bit
 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.420
work and touch it up a bit
honestly I'm not even against the idea

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430
honestly I'm not even against the idea
 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.280
honestly I'm not even against the idea
of constantly going back and changing

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290
of constantly going back and changing
 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.200
of constantly going back and changing
things up yeah it's a little weird you

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210
things up yeah it's a little weird you
 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.790
things up yeah it's a little weird you
should probably leave good enough alone

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800
should probably leave good enough alone
 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.550
should probably leave good enough alone
but at the same time effects do keep

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560
but at the same time effects do keep
 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.530
but at the same time effects do keep
changing and they do keep updating I

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540
changing and they do keep updating I
 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.180
changing and they do keep updating I
kind of like the idea of comparing

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190
kind of like the idea of comparing
 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.680
kind of like the idea of comparing
different special editions and seeing

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690
different special editions and seeing
 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.690
different special editions and seeing
which effects hold up better how far

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700
which effects hold up better how far
 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.550
which effects hold up better how far
we're coming or how backwards weren't

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560
we're coming or how backwards weren't
 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.440
we're coming or how backwards weren't
going some of these CG effects look so

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450
going some of these CG effects look so
 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.760
going some of these CG effects look so
much better but then some of the

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770
much better but then some of the
 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.529
much better but then some of the
practical effects looked a lot better I

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539
practical effects looked a lot better I
 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:41.820
practical effects looked a lot better I
kind of like comparing and contrasting

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830
kind of like comparing and contrasting
 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.250
kind of like comparing and contrasting
so the idea of constantly going in and

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260
so the idea of constantly going in and
 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.830
so the idea of constantly going in and
updating it I don't mind what I do mind

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840
updating it I don't mind what I do mind
 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.440
updating it I don't mind what I do mind
is that we can't see the original that's

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450
is that we can't see the original that's
 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.730
is that we can't see the original that's
where I think people can get

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740
where I think people can get
 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.950
where I think people can get
legitimately upset we should be allowed

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960
legitimately upset we should be allowed
 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.050
legitimately upset we should be allowed
to compare and contrast why are we just

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060
to compare and contrast why are we just
 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.600
to compare and contrast why are we just
ignoring history if Abraham Lincoln

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610

would love to see that but if you went

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419
would love to see that but if you went
 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.450
would love to see that but if you went
back and said no this is what I said

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460
back and said no this is what I said

doesn't exist I'm gonna erase it that
 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.159
doesn't exist I'm gonna erase it that
would be stupid
