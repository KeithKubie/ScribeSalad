00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:04.104
I'M AN AMAZING PERSON
WITH AN AMAZING LIFE.

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:06.106
- AND I'M LIZ.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.442
I'M A COLLEGE GRADUATE
AND I EXPECT THE BEST.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.510
I'M THE DRIVEN ONE.

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:11.144
- AND I'M TRYING TO HAVE A LIFE.

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:15.115
OUR PR FIRM
IS CALLED PUBLIZITY.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:18.719
- IT'S BASED OFF OUR NAMES.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.020 line:0%
 
SO THIS MORNING,
WE HAVE MEETING WITH, LIKE,

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.755 line:0%
 
A VERY DEMANDING NEW CLIENT.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:25.926
THE CEO OF CULTURED YOGURT WATER
AND LIZ BETTER WAKE UP.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.828
YOGURT WATER? I LOVE IT.
- WOW.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.464
I THINK, LIKE, A LOT OF WOMEN
REALLY WANT TO DRINK SOMETHING

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.467
THAT'S, LIKE, MEDIUM-THICK.
- TRY IT.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.102
- I'M GONNA TRY IT,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.171 line:0%
 
LIKE, I LIE IN MEETINGS A LOT,
IT'S TRUE.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:39.439
I LIKE THE IDEA OF JUST,
LIKE SUCKING DOWN

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:40.574
ONE OF THESE LITTLE THINGS.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.776
BUT, LIKE, IN THIS CASE,
I REALLY DO HATE WATER.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.877
LIKE, I HATE IT.

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:44.878
IT'S, LIKE, VERY EXCITING

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:46.647
TO BE TRYING A NEW BEVERAGE.
[sniffs]

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.182
I LOVE IT.
IT'S DELICIOUS.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.816
- WELL, TH--THANK YOU.
- I LIKE WATER,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.555
BUT I WANT THAT SOUR TASTE THAT,
LIKE, ONLY YOGURT CAN BRING.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.990
SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP
PROMOTE YOUR PRODUCT?

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.058
UM, LET'S SEE.
[snorts]

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.194
OH, I JUST HAD
AN AMAZING IDEA.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:01.328
WHAT IF WE DID AN EVENT?

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.863
- LIZ!
SORRY.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.598
YOU ARE A GENIUS.
- I LOVE YOU.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.066
- I LOVE YOU, TOO.
- YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.334
- YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.
- HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.368
WE SHOULD DO.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:10.704
CULTURED WATER IS, LIKE,
VERY CULTURED,

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.073
AND, LIKE, WHAT IS THE
MOST CULTURED THING--

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.575
[snorts]
OH, MY GOD. ENGLAND.

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:16.510
- OH, ENGLAND.
- LONDON, ENGLAND.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.345
- OH, MY GOD,
I LOVE LONDON ENGLAND.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.914
- SO IT'S, LIKE,
A THEME PARTY ALL ABOUT

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.850
LONDON, ENGLAND
AND CULTURED WATER.

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:25.219
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE,
LIKE, ADELE PERFORM!

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.221
WE SHOULD HAVE
ADELE PERFORM!

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.556
- I THINK ADELE MIGHT BE
A LITTLE EXPENSIVE.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.226
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.
I COULD PERFORM THEN.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.427
I COULD DO IT.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.828
I COULD ACTUALLY JUST COMPLETE
THE PERFORMANCE.

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:36.763
I COULD DO IT.
I COULD PERFORM.

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:37.931
- RIGHT?
- BUT--

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:39.233
- YOU DON'T PERFORM.
- MM.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.969
- LIZ IS, LIKE,
CRAZY UNTALENTED,

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:43.403
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE CAN DELIVER.

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.974
SO I'M THINKING WHAT IF WE HAD
ANYBODY ELSE PERFORM?

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:48.442
- MM, OR I COULD DO IT.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.277
- OR YOU KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO
IS WE COULD JUST HAVE, LIKE,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.113
A MONKEY WITH DOWN SYNDROME
SMASHING ON CYMBALS.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:56.183
I THOUGHT THAT WAS, LIKE, A GOOD
POSSIBILITY FOR SOMETHING TO DO.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.384
- YOU KNOW WHAT, LIZ,
I'M GONNA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE

00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:00.787
BECAUSE I WOULD BE
SO NERVOUS FOR YOU

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.190
IF THAT TINY MONKEY
WITH THE BRAIN PROBLEM

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.392
WERE TO JUMP UP AND JUST SCRATCH
ON SOMEONE'S FACE.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.261
- IT'S, LIKE,
THE CLIENT'S DECISION.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.730
WHATEVER YOU THINK
IS BEST IS FINE.

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:11.331
SO, LIKE, EITHER
WE DO THE MONKEY

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:13.567
OR SOMETHING ELSE
OR WE HAVE LIZ SING.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.570
- RIGHT, AND, LIKE,
WHATEVER YOU THINK IS FREE.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.938
- WELL WHY DON'T WE TRY IT?

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.574
WHY DOESN'T LIZ HAVE A SONG--
- GREAT. AMAZING.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:21.942
- LET'S TRY IT.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:22.943
[singing nasally]
- ♪ I WOULD LOVE TO SING

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.245
♪ AT YOUR EVENT

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.080
- WOW.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.782
- WELL THAT'S PROOF POSITIVE
RIGHT THERE THAT WE SHOULD

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.217
THINK OF A BUNCH OF OPTIONS.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.920 line:0%
 
COMING UP NEXT ON <i>PUBLIZITY...</i>

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:35.956 line:0%
