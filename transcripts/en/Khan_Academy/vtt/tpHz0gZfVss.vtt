00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.090
Well, I've been requested to do
some videos on concativity and

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.410
maxima and minimum points and
inflection points, and all the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.490
like that you normally see in
your first semester of

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.320
a calculus course.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.170
So, I thought I would
start doing them.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.140
But before we kind of go into
the actual problems that you

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.980
might see in your book, I just
want to give you a

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.780
broad intuition.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.950
Because in calculus class,
people-- there are all these

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.120
rules, when, you know, the
second derivative is positive,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.330
you're concave this way.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.830
When the second derivative
is negative, you're

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.930
concave this way.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.740
And people memorize the rules,
and they take the tests, and if

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.820
they memorize it correctly
they do well on the tests.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.750
And then they forget it.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.350
Maybe they memorize it again by
the time of the final exam.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.770
But by the time they are
30 years old, they will

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.750
have forgotten it.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.500
And that, frankly, is useless.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.410
Unless your whole goal
is just to pass exams.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.990
So I want to give
you some intuition.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.610
And hopefully, you will never
forget this intuition.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.240
So when you're first learning
calculus there's much more

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.240
to functions than what I'm
going to do in this video.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.920
But there's kind of 3 types of
interesting points on most of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.950
the curves we'll talk about.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.680
So let's say, let
me draw a curve.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.310
Let's say the curve looks
something like this.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.650
You know, if this is the
x-axis-- that's too thick--

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.330
that's the y-axis.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.580
The curve could look
something like this.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.620
I don't know.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.215
Let me see.

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:17.395
It could look like this.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.840
And so on.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.440
And if you have a curve like
this-- and you'll see all sorts

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.260
of curves when you do your
calculus, because you have

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.730
multiple degree polynomials, et
cetera-- what are the

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.400
interesting points?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.590
Well, the interesting
points tend to be when

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.180
the slope is equal to 0.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.580
So, in this, where does
the slope equal 0?

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.070
What are the interesting
points here?

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.900
Let me make sure I'm
using the right tool.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.020
Right there the
slope is 0, right?

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.430
Because if you were to take the
tangent right there, it would

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.440
look something like that.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.940
Right there the slope is 0, as
well, because if you took the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.820
tangent it would look
something like that.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.910
And then right there, as
well, the slope is 0.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.400
And the line, it really
isn't a tangent.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.560
It crosses the graph.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.200
But as we could see, the graph
kind of flattens out there.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.950
So these are the three points
that you tend to deal with in

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.070
your first semester calculus
class when you're graphing

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.340
and looking for extrema.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.180
And this is called a maximum.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.045
And in this case,
it's a local maxima.

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:20.380
If, you know, if this was the
highest point for the entire

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.780
function, it would be
a global maximum.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.260
This is a local minima.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.030
And if it was, you know, if it
was the lowest point of the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.970
entire graph-- which is the way
I drew it-- maybe this graph

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.480
keeps going up like that, and
keeps going up like this.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.640
So this would be the
global minimum point.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.680
And then this is called an
inflection point, because it's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.000
neither a maximum, minimum, but
you kind of see that the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.670
graph kind of inflects.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.640
So let's study them a little
bit more and see if we can get

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.410
a little intuition on what
happens to the graph, the first

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.590
derivative, and the second
derivative, at each

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.110
of these points.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.140
Let's start with a maximum
point, because maybe that's--

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.660
well, let's start with a
minimum point, because that's

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.570
what we see the most.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.360
You know, when we used to study
y equals x squared, or regular

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.280
parabolas, that was the
most common thing we saw.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.830
And then of course, if we have
a negative of a parabola,

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.345
it becomes like that.

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:05.820
But anyway, let's study a
minimum point where the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.930
graph is concave upward.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.240
Let's say we have a
point like this.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.210
So that's the graph
of the function.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.950
I don't know what that
is, that's f of x.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.400
So what is happening to
the slope as we go from--

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.270
roughly-- from here to there?

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.640
Well, let's try a few points
and see if we can, by drawing

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.960
the tangent lines, we get
intuition for the slope.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.410
So let's see, if I pick this
point, just randomly, the slope

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.910
looks something like that.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.630
I'm trying to do a tangent.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.590
If I take this point-- I'm just
moving to the right a little

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.070
bit, I'm just increasing my
x value-- the slope will

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.710
look something like that.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.720
So it's negative here, but
if you look here, the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.790
slope is less negative.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.450
The slope is less
negative there.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.810
And if we go to the
minimum point there,

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.000
the slope flattens out.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.800
And so, of course, the
derivative there would be 0.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.520
And then as we pass that
point, what happens?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.010
Well, here, the slope is
increasing a little bit more.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.950
Now the slope is
actually positive.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.520
So the slope was negative, less
negative, 0, a little positive.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.325
And then when you go here,
it goes more positive.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.520
So let's see if we
can graph that.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.760
Just to get an intuition.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.910
Obviously I haven't written any
numbers down, so we don't know

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.840
what the exact value
of the slope is.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.000
So what does the
slope look like?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.320
So here it's really negative.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.540
So the slope is going to be
something really negative here.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.330
I'm just picking
a random point.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.210
And then, at this point right
here, it was less negative.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.920
So the slope is going
to be less negative.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.060
And then here, roughly
here, the slope is at 0.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.290
Right?

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.070
The slope was 0.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.550
And then the slope gets a
little bit more positive.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.050
And then over there, it gets
a little bit more positive.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.590
So the slope, if we were to
actually graph the derivative

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.570
of the function at that point,
it would be an upward sloping.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.400
And so I'm assuming this is
a second degree polynomial.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.580
If this was third degree, then
this would actually be a curve.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.870
So the slope will actually
look something like this.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.230
And does that make sense?

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.040
Well, sure.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.420
The graph of this could be
y is equal to, I don't

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.220
know, ax squared plus b.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.310
And then the derivative, or,
you know, f of x is equal

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.710
to ax squared plus b.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.380
And so the derivative of
that, of course, would

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.710
be-- what is that?

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.140
2ax plus 0.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.080
So this would just be a line.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.390
And it actually
goes through 0, 0.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.290
But it didn't have to.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.570
But hopefully that gives
you a little intuition.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.180
But now let's move to
the second derivative.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.300
So the slope of the slope.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.310
Let me draw it down here.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.490
The second derivative.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.490
My wife is coming home, so I
have to finish these videos

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.010
before she gets here, otherwise
I have to continue it tomorrow.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.330
She called 5 minutes ago,
so I have to hurry.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.970
Anyway, so this is f
prime, prime of x.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.730
Or the second derivative.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.150
So what's happening to the
second derivative here?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.810
Well, the second derivative
is just the slope

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.850
of the derivative.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.740
So what's the slope?

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.270
Well, it's just a constant,
in this case, it's just a

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.380
constant upward moving slope.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.590
So the second derivative--
actually, if we were to just

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.670
evaluate that-- it would be 2a.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.950
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.230
And I can actually-- it's going
to look-- it's just going to be

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.700
a constant number, and it's
going to be positive.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:37.240
So, in general, when you study
your extrema points, and say,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.190
whether it's a minimum or a
maximum, et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.640
The way that you think about it
is, well, if it's a minimum

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.790
point-- like this-- if it's a
minimum point, what is

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.960
happening to the
slope around it?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.560
Well, the slope has to be
constantly increasing, right?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.760
Even though, for example.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.260
Even though, as we go from
here to here, the value

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.550
of f of x is decreasing.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.580
The rate at which it's
decreasing is getting less.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.190
So the slope is
actually increasing.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.200
It's getting less
and less negative.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.990
And then it increases
even more.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.640
So you know you're at a
minimum point when the

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.800
slope is increasing.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.950
And similarly, you know that
it's concave upwards when the

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.010
second derivative is positive.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.490
So hopefully that helps you a
little bit, getting the

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.250
intuition of what happens when
you're at a minimum point and

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.380
you're concave upwards.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.860
Well, what happens when
you have the opposite?

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.990
Well, pretty much everything
becomes the opposite.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.440
Let's say that this
is your curve.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.660
I know that this is the x-axis.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.450
If that's your curve,
well, here you have

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.020
a very high slope.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.160
Then your slope becomes a
little bit less, then it

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.320
becomes 0, then it becomes a
little bit more negative, then

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.120
it becomes more negative.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.200
Then it goes more negative.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.380
The rate of the slope becomes
more and more negative the

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.740
whole time that we're kind of
going through this

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.830
maximum point, or this
concave downward.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.240
So what will the
slope look like?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.200
Well, in this example, if I
were to draw the derivative,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.520
the slope is going to
look something like this.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.280
Because back here, the slope
is-- actually, a really high

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.940
number is going to be up here.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.250
And then as we get close-- as
we move further and further,

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.390
increasing values of x--
the slope decreases.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.980
It becomes 0 right around here.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.130
And then it just
keeps decreasing.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.470
And then similarly, if we were
to draw the second derivative,

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.250
what will that look like?

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.710
Well, the second derivative
is just going to be the

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.010
slope of this function.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.770
So it's just going to be a
negative number, if we assume

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.650
that this is constant.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.800
So the second-- if this is
the x-axis, the second

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.810
derivative is going to
be something like that.

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:35.920
It's going to be some
negative number.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.250
I'm assuming this is 0, 0.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.790
Anyway, I'm about to run out
of-- well, I'm not about to

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.750
run out of time, but I think
I don't want to rush it.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.720
So, that's the maximum,
minimum points.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.710
And in the next video, I'll
give you a little intuition

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.810
on what happens with
inflection points.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.440
And then we will do a bunch of
examples that you will normally

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.980
see in a calculus textbook.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.300
But I just wanted to do this
for you because there's nothing

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.220
magical about a lot of the
rules that you'll learn.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.210
You know, when they say, oh,
you take the second derivative.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.070
And if the second derivative is
positive, it's concave upwards.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.520
And if the second derivative
is negative, it's

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.460
concave downwards.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.170
And you might, you know,
fill your brain with all

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.260
of these memorizations.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.710
But it's hopefully-- if
you think about it this

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.100
way-- fairly intuitive.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.270
And hopefully, it should be
fairly intuitive that whenever

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.160
the first derivative
is 0, your slope is 0.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.630
And you're at a point
that is interesting, at

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.360
least in this context.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.080
But anyway, I will do the next
video on inflection points, and

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.240
then I'll do a bunch
of actual problems.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.760
See you soon.
