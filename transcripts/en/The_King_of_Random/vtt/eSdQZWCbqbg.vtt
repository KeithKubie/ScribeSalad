00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.520
Hmm

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.000
Delicious!

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.740
So far! It's not going to be in a minute. Hey guys. I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.920
We've got another fun experiment today using molten salt.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.250
Today we're going to see what happens if we combine the molten salt with popcorn

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.449
We're gonna see if we can get some kernels of popcorn to pop and then just for the heck of it

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.369
We're gonna see what happens if we pour molten salt all over some popcorn. That's already been popped. Let's give this a shot

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.879
We'll probably try a few different varieties with the kernels including dropping one kernel into the salt, dropping several kernels into the salt and then

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.349
Taking kernels putting them in a pan and pouring the salt all over them. We'll just see what happens

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.500
Let's pour some salt into our crucible fire up the furnace and get started

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.489
All right molten hot salt and that is impressive how liquid molten salt is that's just

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.180
Super runny, and of course. It's hot netha it's gonna light my stick on fire

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.979
All right when you start with just one kernel see what happens here goes

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.750
And it lit on fire

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.390
Popcorn is usually cooked in hot oil which is of course very hot but more like

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.099
400 degrees hot maybe a little more than that, but this is probably almost 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That's a lot

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.910
But let's try pouring in a few more kernels and see what happens

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.320
Whoo our salt is solidifying on top

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.819
We've got our kernel, which is sort of resting on there throwing individual kernels down into it

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.369
It slightly breaks the surface of the salt a little bit

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.789
I'm just curious if any of these can pop if we can get one kernel of corn to pop I'll be pretty happy

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.839
Also be happy at this point if I can actually just aim well

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.950
There's probably still a lot of molten salt underneath the crust that is formed on top

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.110
I'm still so

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.839
We've got like half popping corn. The kernels are breaking open. They're just not popping like normal popcorn does

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.199
Going a little bit more on top as it cools down and they cook a little bit slower a little bit lower temperatures we have

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.049
slightly better chance of getting an actual pop kernel

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.280
Hey, there's a sort of pop one yes, haha, we're getting popcorn

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.279
It's kind of working yeah

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.719
A little bit, it was probably the worst way to pop corn. I've ever seen I had more

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.130
Now it smells like burnt popcorn instead of just bringing salt. Ha ha yeah

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.819
Explode

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.980
Smallest explosions known to man

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.130
This too excited to get about kernels of corn popping

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.179
Actually, it's edible it got thrown clear of our crucible and our salt, but

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.230
You know it still tastes burn

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.199
Let's see if we can scoop out our bundles of burned corn here I

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.049
Think at this point we have a very hot crucible

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.959
filled almost solidly with

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.719
Salt so let's throw this back in the furnace

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.759
Get it back to a nice liquid state and then see what happens if instead of dropping the kernels into the salt

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.760
We pour salt over the kernels

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.269
That had some remaining corn kernels in it they largely got just incinerated in our furnace

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.459
Alright here goes super orange glowy burning hot salt being poured onto popcorn kernels in three two one

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.349
That is an even grosser smoke than some other things

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:32.199
We've burned with salt we had a similar result when we poured molten salt onto gummy bears and gummi worms

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.209
This smells worse burning sugar yeah, not a terrible smell burning popcorn

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.180
pretty terrible smell

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.789
Bad fan

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.288
While the salt is still hot but not as hot

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:00.939
We have movement and it moved to kind of a whole block so some of it might be tunnels underneath the salt

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.770
Yes

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.059
I'm still thinking some of these kernels might keep popping

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.070
But I think it can already definitively say this is a terrible way to make popcorn

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.660
We leave nice colors

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.289
To burn salt and gray black with like the nice golden brown mix with the yellow and tell the Fox away

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.479
I don't know. I just kind of like it still

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.909
quite hot possible more kernels will still decide they want to pop but

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.179
Not a lot of popping going on we actually had more

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:50.199
popping when we would just put the kernels down on top of the molten salt inside the crucible and I wonder if that's just because

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.249
All of the air inside of the crucible was very hot as well

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.529
So they're nice and evenly surrounded with Heat whereas now. They're just getting cooked from one side alone

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.509
or it's just timing take a look at the bottom of this thing I

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.369
Also fused together if one

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.190
Blackened salt mess couple of kernels that manage to pop underneath it

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.769
I think we saw our whole piece of salt sort of jump a little bit as the kernels on the bottom

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.500
did pop

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:43.339
There we go we're pretty neat as this all cools down it does quickly start forming its crystalline structure, so we've got some good

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:50.270
Shiny light reflective spots even 
 though, this is turned pretty much black, which as I understand it

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.960
It's actually pulling some of the carbon out of the graphite crucible

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.250
It's part of what's turning black, and then of course it gets further stained

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.010
By all the burning popcorn

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.809
We have tried mixing our molten salt with our uncooked popcorn, and it didn't work very well

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.899
But just to finish off and make sure we've really exhausted every possibility

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.690
We're gonna try pouring our molten salt over this cooked popcorn

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:18.050
Which I predict is just gonna burn it and make it maybe catch fire and smell really bad, but we don't know until we try

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.310
Three-two-one

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.230
Mmm burn popcorn

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:02.110
I think what's burning now. Is that there was oil on the popcorn, so there's now little puddles of burning oil here

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.579
Salt on one side pop corn husks on the other

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.740
Definitely not going to taste that

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:32.790
Mixing molten salt with popcorn normally salt on popcorn is a good thing it tastes great and really adds to the whole experience

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.650
But it turns out that temperature of the salt is extremely important cold salt

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.150
Excellent hot salt not so excellent at least once you're up to a temperature of almost

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.050
2,000 degrees Fahrenheit

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:48.330
It burns the kernels it burns the popcorn and overall you just get a smoky

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:54.869
Stinky mess that of course is not even close to being edible we did get a couple of kernels to pop in both methods with

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.710
The raw kernels and the molten salt dropping some kernels into the cup of salt

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.030
We got a few that would pop

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.030
but when the kernels landed on top of the

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.379
Solidified layer of salt that was still extremely hot it was able to create a little bit of an oven and crucible

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.450
I think and some of those kernels did pop and even had enough energy to pop up and out of the container when we poured

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.150
The molten salt all over the kernels while they are in our metal pan

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.739
We got a couple of them popping a couple even popped underneath the cooled layer of salt

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.670
Which made it sort of bounce around a little bit?

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:28.289
Pouring molten salt onto our already popped kernels had pretty much exactly the effect that predicted. It was going to it all just caught fire

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.880
That's what's gonna happen when you pour 2,000 degrees liquid salt onto popped popcorn

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.710
If you have any cool ideas of things that you want to see covered in molten salt

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.239
Let us know down in the comments. We might try it out, and if we use your idea. We will be sending you 25 bucks

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.190
