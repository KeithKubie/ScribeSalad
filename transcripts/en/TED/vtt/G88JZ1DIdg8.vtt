00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.200
I'm from Detroit.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.896
(Applause)

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.920
A city that in the 1950s
was the world's industrial giant,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.496
with a population of 1.8 million people

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.096
and 140 square miles
of land and infrastructure,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.840
used to support this booming,
Midwestern urban center.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.136
And now today,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.880
just a half a century later,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.280
Detroit is the poster child
for urban decay.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.336
Currently in Detroit,
our population is under 700,000,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.816
of which 84 percent are African American,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.120
and due to decades of disinvestment

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.056
and capital flight

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.880
from the city into the suburbs,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.080
there is a scarcity in Detroit.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.616
There is a scarcity of retail,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.936
more specifically, fresh food retail,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.576
resulting in a city
where 70 percent of Detroiters

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.240
are obese and overweight,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.440
and they struggle.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.400
They struggle to access
nutritious food that they need,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.856
that they need to stay healthy,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.776
that they need to prevent premature
illness and diet-related diseases.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.496
Far too many Detroiters
live closer to a fast food restaurant

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.816
or to a convenience store,
or to a gas station

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.896
where they have to shop for food

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.200
than they do a full-service supermarket.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.680
And this is not good news
about the city of Detroit,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.176
but this is the news

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.576
and the story

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.576
that Detroiters intend to change.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.250
No, I'm going to take that back.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.336
This is the story
that Detroiters are changing,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.120
through urban agriculture
and food entrepreneurship.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.496
Here's the thing:

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.896
because of Detroit's recent history,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.976
it now finds itself

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.920
with some very unique assets,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.680
open land being one of them.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.656
Experts say that the entire cities
of Boston, San Francisco,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.216
and the borough of Manhattan

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.520
will fit in the land area
of the city of Detroit.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.576
They further go on to say

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.280
that 40 square miles
of the city is vacant.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.896
That's a quarter to a third of the city,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.696
and with that level of emptiness,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.280
it creates a landscape
unlike any other big city.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.016
So Detroit has this --
open land, fertile soil,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.056
proximity to water,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.856
willing labor

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.480
and a desperate demand
for healthy, fresh food.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.016
All of this has created
a people-powered grassroots movement

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.576
of people in Detroit

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.736
who are transforming this city

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.800
from what was the capital
of American industry

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.520
into an agrarian paradise.

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:23.456
(Applause)

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.536
You know, I think,
out of all the cities in the world,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.336
Detroit, Michigan, is best positioned
to serve as the world's urban exemplar

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.896
of food security
and sustainable development.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.936
In Detroit, we have over 1,500, yes, 1,500

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.616
gardens and farms
located all across the city today.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.176
And these aren't plots of land

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.000
where we're just growing
tomatoes and carrots either.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.136
You understand, urban agriculture
in Detroit is all about community,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.016
because we grow together.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.416
So these spaces
are spaces of conviviality.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.416
These spaces are places
where we're building social cohesion

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.816
as well as providing healthy, fresh food

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.176
to our friends, our families
and our neighbors.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.736
Come walk with me.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.376
I want to take you
through a few Detroit neighborhoods,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.776
and I want you to see what it looks like
when you empower local leadership,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.736
and when you support grassroots movements

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.576
of folks who are moving the needle
in low-income communities

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.136
and people of color.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.216
Our first stop, Oakland Avenue Farms.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.416
Oakland Avenue Farms is located
in Detroit's North End neighborhood.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.136
Oakland Avenue Farms is transforming
into a five-acre landscape

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.256
combining art, architecture,
sustainable ecologies

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.336
and new market practices.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.096
In the truest sense of the word,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.360
this is what agriculture
looks like in the city of Detroit.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.656
I've had the opportunity
to work with Oakland Avenue Farms

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.840
in hosting Detroit-grown and made
farm-to-table dinners.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.496
These are dinners
where we bring folks onto the farm,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.976
we give them plenty
of time and opportunity

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.096
to meet and greet and talk to the grower,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.296
and then they're taken on a farm tour.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.096
And then afterwards,
they're treated to a farm-to-table meal

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.056
prepared by a chef

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.880
who showcases all the produce on the farm
right at the peak of its freshness.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.536
We do that.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.456
We bring people onto the farm,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.696
we have folks sitting around a table,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.056
because we want to change
people's relationship to food.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.336
We want them to know
exactly where their food comes from

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.176
that is grown on that farm
that's on the plate.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.776
My second stop,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.456
I'm going to take you
on the west side of Detroit,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.256
to the Brightmoor neighborhood.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.000
Now, Brightmoor is
a lower-income community in Detroit.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.480
There's about 13,000
residents in Brightmoor.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.256
They decided to take
a block-by-block-by-block strategy.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.776
So within the neighborhood of Brightmoor,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.680
you'll find a 21-block microneighborhood
called Brightmoor Farmway.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.416
Now, what was a notorious,
unsafe, underserved community

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.176
has transformed into a welcoming,
beautiful, safe farmway,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.960
lush with parks and gardens
and farms and greenhouses.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.936
This tight-knit community
also came together recently,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.336
and they purchased an abandoned building,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.816
an abandoned building
that was in disrepair and in foreclosure.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.016
And with the help of friends
and families and volunteers,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.776
they were able to take down
the bulletproof glass,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.656
they were able to clean up the grounds

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.496
and they transformed that building
into a community kitchen,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.296
into a cafe, into a storefront.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.096
Now the farmers and the food artisans
who live in Brightmoor,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.216
they have a place where they
can make and sell their product.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.776
And the people in the community

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.840
have some place where they can buy
healthy, fresh food.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.336
Urban agriculture --
and this is my third example --

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.360
can be used as a way to lift up
the business cooperative model.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.976
The 1,500 farms and gardens
I told you about earlier?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.256
Keep Growing Detroit
is a nonprofit organization

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.640
that had a lot to do with those farms.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.776
They distributed last year
70,000 packets of seeds

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.336
and a quarter of a million transplants,

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.416
and as a result of that last year,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.336
550,000 pounds of produce

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.616
was grown in the city of Detroit.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.400
(Applause)

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.896
But aside from all of that,

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.496
they also manage
and operate a cooperative.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.416
It's called Grown in Detroit.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.696
It consists of about 70 farmers,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.216
small farmers.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.280
They all grow, and they sell together.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.576
They grow fruits,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.800
they grow vegetables,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.296
they grow flowers,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.256
they grow herbs in healthy soil,

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.216
free of chemicals,
pesticides, fertilizers,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.576
genetically modified products --

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.120
healthy food.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.536
And when their product is sold

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.416
all over the city of Detroit
in local markets,

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.120
they get a hundred percent
of the proceeds from the sale.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.480
In a city like Detroit,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.776
where far too many, far too many
African Americans are dying

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.480
as a result of diet-related diseases,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.416
restaurants, they have a huge role to play

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.856
in increasing healthy food access
in the city of Detroit,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.296
culturally appropriate restaurants.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.056
Enter Detroit Vegan Soul.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.536
Yes, we have a vegan soul food restaurant
in the city of Detroit.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.776
(Applause)

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.280
Yes, yes.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.256
Detroit Vegan Soul
is providing Detroiters the opportunity

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.696
to eat more plant-based meals

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.496
and they've received an overwhelming
response from Detroiters.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.056
Detroiters are hungry
for culturally appropriate,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.000
fresh, delicious food.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.456
That's why we built a nonprofit
organization called FoodLab Detroit,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.576
to help small neighborhood
burgeoning food entrepreneurs

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.480
start and scale healthy food businesses.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.296
FoodLab provides
these entrepreneurs incubation,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.736
hands-on education, workshops,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.136
technical assistance,
access to industry experts

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.840
so that they can grow and scale.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.056
They're very small businesses,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.336
but last year, they had a combined revenue

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.896
of over 7.5 million dollars,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.216
and they provided 252 jobs.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.456
Listen.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.256
(Applause)

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.400
These are just a few examples

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.216
on how you expand opportunities

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.696
so that everybody can participate

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.096
and prosper,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.096
particularly those
who come from neighborhoods

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.320
that have been historically excluded
from these types of opportunities.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.040
I know, I know.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.240
My city is a long way from succeeding.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.456
We're still struggling,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.296
and I'm not going to stand here
on this stage and tell you

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.736
that all of Detroit's problems
and all of Detroit's challenges

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.696
are going to be solved
through urban agriculture.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.376
I'm not going to do that,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.496
but I will tell you this:

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.896
urban agriculture
has Detroit thinking about its city

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.496
now in a different way,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.360
a city that can be both urban and rural.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.656
And yes, I know, these stories are small,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.536
these stories are
neighborhood-based stories,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.616
but these stories are powerful.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.456
They're powerful because I'm showing you
how we're creating a new society

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:03.256
left vacant in the places and the spaces
that was disintegration from the old.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.616
They're powerful stories
because they're stories about love,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.816
the love that Detroiters have
for one another,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.656
the love that we have for our community,
the love that we have for Mother Earth,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.176
but more importantly,
these stories are stories

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.216
on how devastation, despair, decay

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.096
never ever get the last word
in the city of Detroit.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.136
When hundreds of thousands
of people left Detroit,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.416
and they left us for dead,
those who stayed had hope.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.216
They held on to hope.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.536
They never gave up.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.176
They always kept fighting.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.456
And listen, I know,

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.456
transforming a big city like Detroit
to one that is prosperous,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.936
one that's functional, one that's healthy,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.096
one that's inclusive,
one that provides opportunities for all,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.656
I know it's tough,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.056
I know it's challenging, I know it's hard.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.320
But I just believe

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.656
that if we start strengthening
the social fabric of our communities,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.736
and if we kickstart economic opportunities
in our most vulnerable neighborhoods,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.896
it all starts with healthy, accessible,

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.096
delicious, culturally appropriate food.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.336
Thank you very much.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.600
(Applause)

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.000
Thank you.
