00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.130
When we created the main
restaurants page,

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.970
we executed a query to get all of
the restaurants in the database.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.020
I will use the ID number of each
restaurant entry in order to

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.040
find a specific restaurant to update.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.610
Let's go ahead and

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.320
replace that hashtag with the restaurant
ID number, and then a backslash, and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.950
the word edit to indicate a new path
where we will edit our menu entries.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.410
I will now create another if statement
that looks for /edit in my URL.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.030
Since I chose to edit
restaurants by their ID,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.540
I need to find a way to grab
that ID number out of the URL.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.760
The split command in Python
comes in handy here and

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.850
returns an array of strings
separated by the backslash.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.480
I figured out that the third value
of this array contains my ID number.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.580
So with this 2 here,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.620
I'm grabbing the third element
of this zero indexed array.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.800
I then do a restaurant query to
grab the restaurant entry equal to

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.490
the ID in the URL.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.850
If I find that query, then I generate
a response and begin to render the page.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.450
I can create a form with one field for
the new restaurant name.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.720
Let's create a post method,
and pass in the path for

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.398
the /restaurants/ID/edit, passing in
the ID of the restaurant I want to edit.

00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:05.620
I also pre-filled this field with
the current name of the restaurant.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.150
I close all my tags and
add this output string to the wfile.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.230
Now, let's write up the post
response for our edit form.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.890
Some of this code might be
starting to look pretty familiar.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.460
After making another if statement,
we grab the input from our form again.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.850
Then we perform the query to find
the object with the matching ID.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.700
We reset the name field to
the entry we created in the form,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.880
then add to the session and commit.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.850
I then added a redirect to bring
us back to our restaurants page

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.320
after the code has been executed.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.690
This was a lot of code to write.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.790
So let's save and rerun our
server again to see if it worked.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.070
If I rename Panda Garden to
The New Panda Garden, look!

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.430
It's been updated in the database and
in our restaurants page.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.450
The source code for objective four is
also available in the instructor notes.
