Speaker 1:          00:01          But now it just want to give you some biographical details. Um, that might be kind of interesting. Parallel, um, to, um, the basically the entire body of work by a Fitzgerald that wears thin. Um, last time we were ready assault that Fitzgerald was married to seldom, um, psia. Um, and she was a very, um, um, you know, basically the, the um, social center in Montgomery, Alabama where he was stationed. Um, so, um, he referred to her as the first American flapper. So obviously there has resonances of for the story, but he's, Bob's her here, you know, we know that that is where he gets that part of his inspiration for. Um, and so it, it actually, um, and he has other stories about flappers as we know. Here's the whole collection called flappers and philosophers. So, um, seldom has been there pretty much, um, from quite early on in the short stories, but really the work and we're just seldom has the most important presence is um, tenderness and Nate, so just some interesting details, some interesting parallels.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Some of you might have been surprised that the call you refers to dig as captain diver right when she raised him from the sanitorium. Um, and in terms it's not really a very well accounted for because Dick and fat, um, didn't really fight. Um, he was considered too valuable to be lost in battle. So he was in Switzerland. He was nodding in combat. Um, but, um, Nicole refers to him as captain diver and it turns out that this is kind of an interesting personal connection to Fitzgerald's on live and this relation to the seller. It turns out that, um, in the, uh, Fitzgerald collection that I was talking about last time, uh, the University of South Carolina, um, there are a couple of very price, uh, of items in that collection. One is this briefcase, uh, saying Scott Fitzgerald Fifth Avenue, um, and the other is this hip flask, uh, with an inscription from it.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Um, and it turns out that this is a gift from Zelda to Scott. Before they were married, when they were just coding. And this is the inscription on that flask to first lieutenant as Scott Fitzgerald, 65th infantry. Camera's Sheridan, forget me, not [inaudible], September 18, 1918, Montgomery, Alabama. So it turns out that the, the military rank is a small personal detail, um, in the caution the attribution, um, often military ran that in fact was not really the real professional identity for first year at any point. But, um, she finally, I mean he was there, he was in Montgomery, he was not fighting, uh, either in Montgomery, Alabama, but, um, she referred to him as first attending more dignify a title and we'll see the titles as they were the ones referred to as doctor or mister as they make a difference. Um, intended. It's nine. So from the very beginning, I kind of title consciousness on my part of Fitzgerald that gets translated into the captain drop diver in tender is the night.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Um, but that's just a very, very small connection. The most important condition is some of you might know has to do with a very long history as long and painful history, um, of mental instability on the part of the cell. There basically from the 1930s on. Um, she never was not inside clinic at some point, you know, Hook career until she died. Um, she was in and out of mental institutions. Um, some more luxurious than others. I'm not looking like Amanda Institution has also, we'll begin with those. Anyway, this is their, um, referenced to him as Captain Diver and a tennis tonight. But, um, this is the one of the first issue when two, I think it might've even had been the first, uh, car praying Gwynn's in, um, problem in Switzerland. Um, uh, and we'll see a picture of her room there. There was in 1930.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Uh, and as you can see almost like a hotel room and very, you know, not looking like a idea of Amanda Mental Institution and certainly not the place where Dar would go to when it goes to Jackson, Mississippi. So at the very other end of the social spectrum, that's where she started out when she began her long career of medicalization. Um, and this is, um, her, the picture of her release from problems and you can see the, she actually looks very different from when she was 18. Um, the almost unrecognizable the two of them. Even what, I mean, I guess it's separated by a number of years as well, but really I'm looking very, very different. Um, and that was, I think there was the, the earliest instance in 1930, um, to, um, even there was a unduly optimistic that noses that she was recovered as you recover from, um, the, the breakdown because she was very soon hospitalized again.

Speaker 1:          05:47          And this time in and other even more famous Swiss clinic, um, the rural Horsley which is where young actually your practice. Um, so in an infant I think for, I was sharing was there briefly as well. So in tender is the night, there's a reference to fry that Dick Divers to get to Vienna before Friday retires. And there's also, um, the Swiss clinic. So all that is, is in part, um, it kind of has the connection to sell us on medical history in Switzerland. Um, then, and then she went to a bunch of other ones. Um, I can't even keep track of all the ones, different ones that she went to. Uh, but at some point in 1932, she went to Johns Hopkins was back in this, they were back in this country. She went to Johns Hopkins Hospital and that turned out to have put an opponent in fact on both of them because when she was at Hopkins, um, what part of the treatment was there?

Speaker 1:          06:47          She would have to write for two hours a day. That was part of the medical treatment. Um, so she started writing. She wrote a novel called, um, save me the walls, uh, which was published in 1932. Um, it was only about a thousand copies, so, so it, you know, it didn't make its way into American literature. Exactly. Um, but it's interesting in many ways because it is sell the, using her own medical history, using her marriage to a scarf is general, um, using all their personal stuff as material, um, for this, for this novel. And Fitzgerald actually tried to stop it from the impoverish or try to revise it very significantly, uh, before it was published. Um, and then after it was published here, this opinion about his wives novel plagiaristic unwise in every way should not have been written. Um, so this is a, in many ways kind of long and painful example of the many, many instances in American literature of the husband having some control over the wires writing different.

Speaker 1:          08:05          Most famous example is Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath rater who lenders were actually edited by him, um, after her death. Um, so in this case she did get it published but it didn't reach a very wide audience and he was against their from day one. Um, the daughter Scottie had the similar different opinion. She just said that this sort of competition is traditionally the bane of literary romances. So at least she has a fairly clear view about the marriage that there was quite a bit of competition going on, even though obviously he was the one who was the writer. She has some aspirations as well. And if she had encouraged my actually help have had more of a career. Um, so the element of competition, uh, between husband and wife I think is quite an important theme. Even though, um, Fisher road try to downplay it, you know, in saying that his wife is the one who really had no talent and she had to plagiarize from him, um, that he must've register the fact that she was more of a competitor than he let on.

Speaker 1:          09:12          So we'll see how that plays out in the dynamics between, um, Dick Diver and they call and who winds up. So there's one other super interesting, this is actually not so important, but just the kind of a point of reference. Um, as we know, there's another woman, significant woman in tenders and they, rosemary the actress. Um, and it turned out that I think this is, it's generally thought that this is the person, um, bad rosemary is based on, and we can sort of see that, you know, she has this very wholesome in the sun look, but she also was tremendously disciplined as an actress. Um, and in these shared a very distinguished career as an actress. Um, so this is the, the, um, the, the Hollywood contribution to tender is the night, but I want to emphasize, um, and other, um, today's lecture actually will be more about cinematic techniques.

Speaker 1:          10:08          So in even though she personifies Hollywood's contribution to tender is the night, um, Ashley is in terms of formal techniques that film would have more of an input on the narrative technique of tenders night. Um, but I want to go back very briefly to, um, do something that we've been talking about all semester, which is the very important, um, and in many ways, uh, variously played out dynamics between the half and half, not, um, so just, I know you guys might not have gone to the and of this novel, so I apologize for giving you, but there's really no way I could talk about the novel without talking about the ending. Um, so without knowing the details in between, this is the last two paragraphs of tenders tonight. But he became entangled with a girl who worked in a grocery store and he also, he was also involved in the lawsuit about some medical question.

Speaker 1:          11:13          So he left Lockport after that. He didn't ask for the children to be center in America and then answer when they call wrote asking him if he needed money in the last leather she had from him. He told her that he was practicing in Geneva, New York, and she got the impression that he has saddled down with someone to keep housely and she looked up at Geneva in an atlas and found it was in the heart of the finger lakes section and consider a pleasant place perhaps. So she liked the thing, his career was biding his time. Again, like grants and Galena. His latest note, it was postmarked from corn. Now New York, which is some distance from Geneva in various more time. In any case, he's almost certainly in that section of the country in one time after, in one time or another. So those last five nurse, uh, it's five of the pruners was in American literature.

Speaker 1:          12:13          Um, he's a total nobody by the animal novel in one time or another. Um, so this is a novel that, um, loose very fast. You know, we start out with him, um, at the top of his profession, full of promise. In fact, when we first see him, he is idolized by everyone, um, around him, um, to get from there to this ending that the woman in his life would be someone that he sees in the grocery store. And not even that I'm getting into trouble of his very modest medical practice, a drifter, a drifter going from one small town to another, and there's the additional in south that he starts out in Seward, Switzerland of city that everyone knows about to Geneva, New York, which Nicole has to look up in an atlas and he can even hold on to this Geneva. So, um, it is in many ways the ending is the beginning, but the highly ionized beginning.

Speaker 1:          13:25          Uh, so just to, um, we've seen this structure before and I promise you will see it one more time. Um, so, um, the last three novels that we read basically of this thing structure, but for totally to totally different effect. So from what we've, no, at this point we know that there's one other novel has this circular structure. The ending is the beginning, which is for whom the bell tolls. So we've talked about this, we just want to give you those two sentences. Beginning, he laid flat on the Brown pine near the floor of the forest and then the last line he could feel his heart beating against the pioneer floor of the forest. Um, so it is having ways, very tender rendition of a life that could be construed as the life of a half not right. You know, we talked about that possibility that maybe he really has nothing I has is a broken leg that's very alcoholic.

Speaker 1:          14:21          We then, which is not to be dismissed, but against that ironic reading, um, handling where post variable there, uncle, um, image of in the [inaudible] as the beginning, uh, as the kind of, uh, Adler's deferral of the moment of death. So he's still alive is almost as if it were beginning of again, and we as the readers one end to begin all over again. It is that illusion perpetrated in our minds to me this morning that Hemingway is able to write a novel that in some sense doesn't really have an ending. Right? You know, if the in the ending is the beginning, the actual death scene is the four to the point of infinity. So this is having ways very tender, uh, wrapping up of the life of Robert Jordan and for whom the bell tolls. And in contrast to that, Fitzgerald is about as brutal as can be.

Speaker 1:          15:22          Um, it's um, so he, you know, this actually is, um, kind of surf surprising that, um, that he would want to be so thorough going, um, in the dental or the vision of the diver. But that's, that's he wants how he wants to rate. Um, so today we'll look at that ending, um, the cruelty of that and laying that, um, to, um, the question there is a speed. We know that the novel was moving very fast. Lots of things have to happen for us to get to that very, very low point at the end of the novel. So what has happened and what this Fitzgerald have to do in order to speed up the narrative to such an extent that he would get to that absolute low point. So, um, last time we talked about, um, montage and we talk about flash back, right. Um, as to cinematic techniques that are input into Fitzgerald.

Speaker 1:          16:22          And today we'll look at three very, very common, uh, filming techniques and the way that they actually help to speed up the narrative. It is not self evident that a close up would in fact speed up the narrative. But the way Fitzgerald uses his close ups actually does, and it's not always clear the cross cutting with speed up the narrative, one of the scan. And he uses this very fun techniques to move things forward. And then we have the very fast motion of the negatives resolutions, things being taken away from, from, um, from Dick Diver of. So, um, let's look at a couple of instances of close up. Um, and this is just so obviously visual that it's sort of hard to look away from that without actually with how to read this without having some kind of visual image. Um, this is about rosemary as you know, she has this crush on him, on the diver, um, and really desperately ones, um, you know, to, to have an affair.

Speaker 1:          17:29          Um, so, but it doesn't quite happen for, for awhile. Presently she kissed him several times in the mouth who face getting big as it came out to him, he never seen anything so dazzling as the quality of the skin. And since sometimes beauty gives back to images once best thoughts, he thought of his responsibility about Nicole and have the responsibility of her being two doors down across the corridor, the reins over. He said, do you see a sign on the slate? Rosemary stood up and leaned down and said, most sincere thanks to him. We're such actors, you and I. Um, so okay, so, you know, we're starting out and you know it on one kind of register. Um, we're starting out with the notion of, um, rosemary as this kind of love stick puppet. Um, that's just pining for him. Um, and, and, and, and unrequited love on top of that.

Speaker 1:          18:33          That is going nowhere. Um, so and so the first part up to the last, uh, three lines of that, of that passage is really all about Dick dies in this noble person. Even though he could have taken advantage of rosemary and she was pining for him, he could have easily taken advantage of hers. And I doing that because thinking of his results to Nicole, two doors down the hall, all that is really about a nobility and magnanimity and uprightness of Dick Diver. Um, the last three why's swingers to the other and of other sides and narrative. And all of a sudden we see what kind of a person rosemary is, that in fact we don't really, and she was completely truthful. Rosemary is never not truthful. Um, even though she's an actress, she actually is the most truthful person in the novel. Um, and this is an absolute statement that is completely right about both of them.

Speaker 1:          19:39          She is an actress. Um, so it's very hard to know where, um, you know, where the acting begins and where the feeling with the acting and, and where they're feeling begins. Um, she's so discipline that you would act in a certain way and then she runs into an obstacle and she stops acting in that way as she was doing right there. You know, it's like trying out, you know, one rude and saying that is going nowhere and then suddenly seen that maybe you should act in a different fashion. Um, so there is a way in which the emotional life of rosemary has been completely a professionalized to such an extent that, um, that she's always acting, which was not even to say that she's not sincere and, um, Fitzgerald credit score of being sincere. It's just that that is what she is. I don't think that she's capable of having any kind of emotions outside of her professional identity as an actress.

Speaker 1:          20:41          Um, so this is, um, you know, this, this is what she is. So it is the blindness to that, that he doesn't realize, um, that she's not exactly a lovesick puppy. She is someone who is actually acting in a particular fashion. Um, and who not only has the full understanding of what kind of person she is, but she is a full understanding of what he is. Right. So it's not surprising that she should know herself to be primarily an address is not an accusation to say that that's what she is above everything else. She was primarily an actress, so she has that degree of self knowledge, but she also has the knowledge about him that even though he is supposedly a doctor, he actually is at heart an actor and that is an accusation and much more serious accusation directed at him than it is directed at her because she has been totally upfront.

Speaker 1:          21:51          You know, she's not, she never, she never is not an actress, um, from beginning of the novel too. And she is defined by that. Um, he is supposed to be a doctor so he's not supposed to be an actor, but they turn up, turns out that maybe the end, the most truth about him is that he is an actor. And then all the, all the appearance of nobility or the appearance of uprightness, my turn out to be an act that is putting up for her benefit and act that is putting up for his own benefit. Sometimes we can act for ourselves as well. So it shows the degree of knowledge of him and it clear eye on the set amount of, on off sick evaluation of exactly what kinds of man he is. So it is the most acute statement about Dick Diver that we've seen up to this point.

Speaker 1:          22:49          This is quite early. Page one oh five. So it is that acuteness that astute knowledge about the man that she was supposedly idolizing that gives the lie Ashley to the adoration that she seems to be raining on him. Um, that is actually completely within bangs. She was practicing, you know, what if, what it's like to be an enduring love puppy, she's acting that pot, but it's a pot that she is just doing it very well. Um, so the, just to move this to the two analysis of the narrative technique, um, the moment, um, that, um, that, that when we have that kind of sudden switch in perspective, um, Ashley comes with um, a visual detail that her face is coming closer and closer to him and a face is getting big as it comes up to him. So let's remember that one visual detail that her face completely fills his field of vision that he sees nothing but her face.

Speaker 1:          24:02          So let's keep that one visual detail in mind and see what Fitzgerald does with that detail that close up. So this is another scene quite a bit later. Um, Ashley's a flashback. So going back to the point when they call, we're still in the sanitorium when she was asking him to take care of her, Nicole was up in her head now crew or school, trying to collate the center mentalities of a childhood as deliberate as a man getting drunk after battle. He breathed over her shoulder and turn her insistently about. She kissed him several times. Her face getting the, every time he came close her hands, holding him by the shoulders, Israeli hot. Suddenly there was a booming from the wise loves across the lake. Cannons were shooting and have bearing clouds in order to break them of help, bearing clouds knowledge to break them.

Speaker 1:          25:00          The lies of the prom and not went off went on again. Um, so the, we get that the repetition of that same visual detail, um, they're kissing her face, getting very big as it gets close to him. So the repetition of the same clothes out and we'll this odd is that we get exactly the same narrative sequence. After that close up, after their visual detail of the fares getting big, we get the sacs switch to a different narrative. Register, right? So this is not Nicole, uh, passing judgment on him. So it was not exactly the same structure as the incident with Rosemary, but there's a switch abrupt switch to a different sequence of narrative in this case is such a quite a trivial event. Um, there were, there were shooting cannons in order to break up the hell bearing clouds, I guess is something he do in Switzerland.

Speaker 1:          26:06          Um, but the point is that cannons were being fired, right? Um, in peace time in Switzerland, which is the kind of surprising fact in itself since when those not so familiar with Canada's being fired for that purpose, but given the fact that we'll be seeing the intertwined, the superman pose, um, images of love and war, the firing of the cannons is certainly not trivial at this point. So at the very least, we can say that there's an intrusion into this scene of the undeniable and historical proven reality of war as well. One is just a fact of history that there was such a war. So this is visceral, is not going to recreate that war for us except for the going over the battleground and talking about it ticking, you know, 20 lies to events of foot that referenced and we saw last time, he's not going to go further in the direction of whirlwind and he has done so far, but he is going to give us echoes of Whoa, Whoa.

Speaker 1:          27:22          One in civilian situations. And not only that, but he's going to use that as a narrative follow up to love scene specifically to close up when a woman's face is getting bigger and bigger. So we can say that what the close up is doing for Fitzgerald is, especially the woman's face getting bigger and bigger is the dramatization of visualization of the woman's power goes with demand, right. So when Rosemary, his face is getting so bad that she stills the entire visual tableau, that is the point when we see that Rosemary Ashley knows exactly what comes from and the driver is that she is absolutely clear that about him. Um, here there's not that equivalent cleared. I judgment from the pilot and they call because she's still a patient. She hasn't gotten to that point yet. But Fisher is giving us equivalent the structure equivalent of that kind of judgment in the sense that there's a sudden break up of the love scene and the replacement of that love scene by something that is like an intimation of battle.

Speaker 1:          28:34          So at the very least, we should be prepared for the fact that maybe war is not extraneous to laugh, maybe more is actually organic to love that maybe Warren is the narrative structure of love. That love takes the form of a battle between the two people who are turning joined in this fashion. Um, so this is, um, in many ways a kind of a prelude to a kind of visual tableau, um, that is, uh, a kind of a gesture towards the future of that narrative. Um, but I want to look at another technique now, um, which is also very prominent and very unmistakable, um, in, uh, tenderness tonight, which is determining of crosscutting. Um, so this is in book two of a tangent is tonight. And especially in section 10 of 10 of Bach too. So the beginning of session 10 begins where in Zurich, in September, Dr Diver had tea with baby Warren.

Speaker 1:          29:42          So at this point still a doctor, um, and is in that professional capacity that he would have tea where baby Lauren and sister who's trying to get a doctor to take care of her by a doctor from their call. Um, so they're having tea and talking about various things and he's still not agreeing to being alive lawn care taker for Nicole at this point. Um, but this is what happens on page one 58, one page done. Next page actually. Um, we get a southern abrupt switch to Nicole's point of view from her point of view and narrated by Nicole herself as in the first person. Um, so let's see. This is outside of her exchange. Um, the ladders there, she wrote rise to dig, die for. We'll get a sense of how Nicco things by following this, um, this, this kind of monologue that is given to us.

Speaker 1:          30:43          Um, as counterpoint to the TB train, Dick Diver and, and, and baby Warren. How do you do lawyer? We're going to call tomorrow for a week and then back to Zurich. That's why I want you in system to settle this because it doesn't matter to us how much I'm allowed. We're going to live very quietly in Syria for two years and Dick has enough to take care of us. No baby. I'm more practical than you think. It's only for clothes and things. I'll need it. Why? That's more than than the estate. Can they stay really afford to give me all that I know will never managed to spend it. Do you have that much? Why do you have, why do you have more? Is it because I'm supposed to be incompetent? Alright. Let my share pilot them. No, they refuse to have anything. Whatever to do with it.

Speaker 1:          31:34          I have to feel bloated for us. I'm not even reading and very well at this could in and read much better. Um, to get the tone. Exactly. What a sharp business woman, Nicole. Yes. In the space of one short exchange. She achieves through things she manages to get her share of the estate, right. So you know, she only needs, it begins by saying, okay, we're going to live very modestly on the next page. We don't need the money. I just needed for clothes and you know, incidentals. So very modders requirement, very modest demand on the estate. She gets the amount, she says it's too much. She checks out to see how much baby is getting and finds, I'll you. In fact, what she's getting is less than what baby gets. So she gets an increase right then and there on the spot. More than that, this of course the question whether they will have a share of that income and she's admitting to the fact that she would have to feel below that for the two of them, that he's not going to get a penny of that any home.

Speaker 1:          32:48          So in the space of one paragraph, that switch from the exploded view to Nicole's point of view is in fact an incredible fast forward of the narrative. Changing our conception of Nicole from a patient in a mental institution to sharp business woman who is going to keep very, very tight control over the money that comes to her, um, that we shouldn't forget after all, she is the granddaughter of a man, um, who has a huge fortune who has made that huge fortune and there's a constant reference as an, uh, for whom the bell tolls, the length, the cross generation linked to the grandfather, um, in tenders the night this also across generation cross-generational link to Nicole's when father that maybe she is more her grandfather's granddaughter than we may think. So the effect of that cross cutting is to take the narrative away from the x side of the story and deposit the Asian saves.

Speaker 1:          34:03          Strictly on Nicole side, the, she is the one who's asked, they call them the shops. She is the one who actually has to financial control over the future of that marriage. Um, so it, it, it, let me just give you one other, um, much more smaller incidents of that cross cutting. Um, all of this many pages after that cross cutting his toe in the first person in the Co's voice. Um, and so from being a mental institutions and there's just married to, to, to, to take diverse are there the saddle, she has the control over the money. Um, but she also is beginning to complain about the particular shape the marriage is taking. But I was gone again by that time trains and Beiges they were all one. That was why he told me a traveling. But after my second child, my level go topsy was born, everything got dark again.

Speaker 1:          35:04          If I could get word to my husband who has seen fit to the, certainly here to leave me in the hairs of incompetence. You tell me my baby is black. That's farcical. That's very cheap. We ran to Africa merely to see 10 God. Since my principle interest in life is archeology, I'm tired knowing nothing and being reminded of it all the time. So page one 61, um, we can see the speed of this development of that particular orientation of the marriage from the beginning when she's not even married to Dick Diver to the next page one 59 when she's married to him. But retaining full control of her finances to page one 61 when she is in a position to complain about his behavior as a husband. Uh, well there's art here and the thing is actually quite have a handle on the [inaudible] is that once again, this was with two of those completely in explicable intrusion of a racialized detail.

Speaker 1:          36:19          Um, and the person of Nicole's daughter tops it, um, that my baby is black is really coming out of nowhere except for the fact that we know that Fitzgerald has a long history of racializing particular characters or critical moment. So let's just go and you guys know the tops is a reference to, um, uncle Tom's cabin right into Harriet Beecher. Stowe is novel. Um, and um, Tufts is a black character and it's one of the most vivid black hairdressers in that novel. So his fist gyros kind of backhand attributed to 19th century classic. And resurrecting the name of a black character, um, totally inappropriate names for the dollar of Nicole, but nonetheless, that's what he just give her. Um, so this is just to just to flesh out the features of the history of racialization, um, in Fitzgerald and the great Gatsby. We know that there really are no black characters in the great Gatsby, but there's this constant intrusion of black hairdressers strangely.

Speaker 1:          37:25          So as we cross Blackwell's island limo, same pastors driven by way show for and which that three mothers knee, two bucks an hour ago, I laugh, allow us the yolks of the eyeballs, rope to others in holiday rivalry. So this is gas. We go into town with, uh, nick and all of a sudden the intrusion of the three blacks in the Limo Syndrome by wedge show for that is a kind of a visual metaphor, uh, for the upstart guest be trying to, um, to elevate themselves higher than he, than he should be. Um, in this case it, the racialization, um, that, that we see in tender is the night, um, has to do I think with a Mormon of marital volatility. Um, we know that she actually has control of the basic structural future of that marriage, which is the money. Um, and the given that control, she is in a position to put a particular spin on that marriage and the marriage has to do with Nicolette, with the fact that they are traveling because he is, he needs to travel, that she has an involuntary appendage, um, to his constant travel and um, the, his neglecting her.

Speaker 1:          38:49          So this is in many ways a very early paving of the ground for the eventual outcome of the novel that is highlighted by Nicole presenting herself as the victim. Nice party in the marriage. Right? So to racialize herself and to racialize, her daughter is a very specific and I guess tested technique of demonstration, a degree of grievance. The degree of felt oppression of the pod, even though she's not really black, is almost as if she were the black person at that rate. So that's what the metaphor is doing for her. She's anything but black. But she's treated as if she were black. That's what she's claiming. So we don't really know with, we agree with her. Yeah. But this is who Nikos interpretation of the marriage is that she is the oppressed party in that marriage. Um, so let's look at one other instance of crosscutting to Nicole.

Speaker 1:          40:08          And this is once again taking the narrative agency or at least taking those, landing the story on Nicole side to why don't you, why don't you register, register and why did you register mister and Mrs diver instead of doctor and this is diver. I just wonder it just throw it through my mind. You're taught me that work is everything. And I believe you used to say a man knows things and when he stops knowing things, he is like anybody else. And the thing is to get power before he stops knowing things. If you want to turn topsy turvy or right, but most you are Nicole follow you walking on her hands. Um, so I think that by page one 60 to one page for the shape of what is to come is pretty much unmistakable and it is conveyed very much through a tome of voice, um, through, in this case, almost a repetition of exactly the same kind of structure that we're seeing between dead and rosemary.

Speaker 1:          41:20          Rosemary is the one who am page one oh five already has seen true take the heifer. She has thin through him so that he or she can pass the most wounding judgment on the Houston. Now the doctor isn't afterward. Um, Nicole has arrived at that conclusion on page one 62 that he, he's not a doctor or a doctor as opposed to know to have medical knowledge. That's what makes a medical doctor another good after his dad. Here's more knowledge than his patient, but she knows at this point that in fact he doesn't have any more knowledge than the average person. They just lost his claim to being a doctor. And so, you know, they're not that many more identities available to him once it's lost that claim to a professional identity. She's not saying outright that he's a dog, the, he's an actor, but she's implying as much.

Speaker 1:          42:22          And there's that other detail about his wellbeing turned topsy turvy. Um, as well as the naming of the thing that the thing is to get power before he starts knowing thing. Um, it is naming exactly what it is the deep diver has failed to do. If he has done things from bright, he will have had after we can chose the marriage before he loses out in the Department of Knowledge. But now that he's lost out in the department of knowledge, he's not going to have power in that marriage as well. So the very sharp, clear, I absolutely understand the of judgment of her husband is very much an echo of what rosemary has test into it much earlier. Um, and it comes, it comes over to us, comes across to it once again through the technique of cross cutting. So, um, you know, I was, I would say that the, so, so the, the emptying out of any kind of sustenance anymore of sustenance in Dick divers come very, very early and is through this complete the steady erosion of any emulation, um, for him on the part of the two women who started out as great, um, idolizes of him.

Speaker 1:          43:41          Um, so now we've gotten to a point where we actually see the speed of the, of the negative resolution and picking up the speed becomes just faster and faster. Um, so this is the first, um, the Sousas the couple there three, basically the three points of no return for desire for, on his way to losing his medical practice and Lockport. Um, the first point of no return is the fight he gets with a cabin near Erie. He walked past the staring a currently in airy and up to the grinning face, hit it with a smashing, left the side of the jaw. The man dropped her for this is a cab driver he got into a fight with for moment. He stood over him in trials. But even as the first Pang of doubt shot through him, the world real, he was clubbed down and FIS and boots beat on him in the strange tattoo.

Speaker 1:          44:34          It felt as nose break like a shingle. And his eyes jerk as they a snap back on the rubber band into his head or rib splintered. And those then pain, he'll voluntarily, he lost consciousness, regain it as he was raised her same position and there's risk joke together with him cards. The plain clothes lieutenant, whom here knocked out was themselves drew back his arm as smashing into the floor. Um, this was a very brutal scene. Lots of people are getting shot and Duke diver is important to turn out to point out this, not except from that violence. And this is the first emptying out of his professional identity, um, that he adopted is supposed to be treating someone who has been subjected to that kind of violence. And instead it turns out he is the one who needs a doctor to take care of him.

Speaker 1:          45:30          Um, so, um, this is what happens when you have things happening very fast and this is, um, um, image. Ashley of the Caribbean area, which it's still, it's kind of sinister looking, but this is the person that gang of them actually beating up on the guy for. Um, so what is interesting is that even though things aren't actually happening raining down fast, they can fast on dig diver. He's actually accused of being moving too fast with see the various people who accuse him a very things we've seen. Rosemary is accusing him of something. Nicole accusing him of something and he's now being accused by his partner in a clinic. Um, in, in this conversation between the France and his wife for sharing. Cathy said, you are the solid when you do the work as the kids are here and toys. And in my opinion, the hairs raises almost done.

Speaker 1:          46:24          Friends let themselves believe with ever increasing conviction that dig travel intellectually and emotionally at such a rate of speed that the vibrations Java, it's only two of them talking behind his back saying that you know, that he's not such a great partner to begin with. And we see the consequence of that kind of conversation between France and his wife. Uh, when they're talking about they're solving that medical partition, this is no go. He says suddenly, well, that's occurred to me. Praise and that your heart isn't in this project anymore. I know I want to leave. We should strike some arrangement about taking Nicole's money up gradually. I thought about that too, that I've seen this coming. I'm able to arrange other backing and it will be possible to take all your money out by the end of the year to can not intended to come to decision so quickly.

Speaker 1:          47:17          Nor was he prepare for friends who sold readily acquiescence in the brake. You know, he was really without now without desperation, he had long felt the ethics of his profession dissolving into a lifeless mask. So this is the speed of the break out of that and medical practice against again at the speed that they can not comment on that he had not asked for. It is somebody else's being that is dictated the narrative development. Um, and they'll just give you, I know that we're on, was running all the time, so it gives you the final part of that resolution, um, against in fast motion. You get, actually I'm going to skip this because I know that we're running out of time, so there's this, um, this will be on the PowerPoint, but I'm just going to go to the very end of the narrative about love as war with spin, seeing the super imposition of love and we're, we're one all the way through.

Speaker 1:          48:22          And finally we see the infusion of world one into this description of Nikos idea of what the marriage was like. Again, she struggle with it, finding him with a small fine eyes with the pledge arrogance of a top dog within these and transferring to another man with a Kimberly with sendlane of years, she'd fallen with her money and her faith that his sister just liked him and was behind her. Now with a thought of the new enemies he was making his bitterness for this other battle she used, even her weaknesses, fighting bravely and courageously with the oak hands and crockery and bottles, empty receptacles of his experience, his sins, outrages, mistakes and sunlight in the space of two minutes. She achieved because they train and justify herself to herself without liars. Subterfuge cut the court forever. Okay, two minutes for her to come to the final decision about the marriage and this is the final mirror image.

Speaker 1:          49:30          And this, I would just say this is a great moment to pair up with the barber. Uh, seeing the rape scene and filmed about holds the mirror in front of them. They call reflected the passage between the man side and the ones and the cost. Dot it up at the side of Tommy Bob. And the manager's going to narrate, entering and willing sharply into the manager. She knew of of joy that there was going to be some kind of showdown in a minute. They came into Nicole's booth. His expression in merging and no way from behind the towel is hastily wins phase. Your friend has worked himself up into a state. He wants to see us together. So I agree to have it over with. Come along, but my hair is half cut. Nevermind. Come along. Resentfully she understanding coffers, remove the towels, filling messy and unadorned. She followed date from the hotel outside. Tommy bent over her hand. We'll go to the cafe that alleys so deep. So stay in Barbara's. I've seen the same cutting of the hair except that in this case the here is only have cut. It is the spirit of them resolution. The marriage is and so hastily that did hair coloring job is not even completely done, but that's the story. That's the child wants to delve is hastily done job.
