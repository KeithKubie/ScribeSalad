CHRIS CARDE: So hi everyone.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.880
I'd like to welcome you
all to this special

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.930
Google I/O tech talk.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.590
This is just one of very few
where we invite an external

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.950
partner to come in and talk
about what they're doing with

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.270
Google products.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.370
So my name is Chris Carde.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.960
I'm a Technical Program Manager
in our Munich office.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.030
I work in our automotive team,
and our team focuses on

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.610
putting the right products and
APIs into the hands of car

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.020
makers to enable awesome
Google-powered navigation and

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.890
infotainment systems.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.605
So we have a long history of
working with Mercedes.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:33.310
It's been years now.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.130
Back in 2008, they were one of
the first car companies to

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.050
launch Send to Car.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.230
This is an integration from
Google Maps that allows users

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.630
to send destination businesses
directly from Google Maps to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.620
their connected car.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.980
They've continued to innovate
since then.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.130
They've launched Google Local
Search and Street View built

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.210
into a number of their cars.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.530
And actually, I believe just
yesterday, they announced the

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.060
new 2014 S Class with built-in
Google Maps.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.540
So we're pretty excited about
Mercedes Drive, if you will,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.750
to integrate connectivity and
Drive innovation, and that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.560
brings us to today.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.800
So Daimler came to us with
this new smartphone and

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.190
app-based platform.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.620
They'll tell you a lot more
about it in their talk, but

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.470
what excites us is that
packaging these features into

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.850
a smartphone app really enables
them to innovate and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.090
iterate at a pace that's
basically been unheard of in

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.290
automotive.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.750
So we saw this great opportunity
to work with them

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.770
to help them bring connected
cars into the reality that our

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.140
Google Maps users have been
experiencing for years now,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.420
and that's basically a fast,
predictive search for

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.100
businesses and addresses, and
a rich visualization of

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.600
results on a map.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.980
So there are probably
two types of

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.760
people in the audience.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.460
There are people here who build
cars, and then there are

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.130
people here who build
other things.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.800
And I've talked a number
of people at the show.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.420
It's probably the
people who build

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.770
cars are in the minority.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.750
We've asked Mercedes to kind
of split the difference

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.250
because there's some interesting
stories they can

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.170
tell about automotive
challenges, but we'd also like

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.200
them to provide this broadly
applicable case study for how

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.850
they've taken the Google Maps
and Places APIs and built this

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.259
rich, beautiful product
of their own.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.980
So without further delay, I'd
like to hand it over to Kal

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.140
Mos and Mike Cheng from
Mercedes, and they will tell

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.210
you about the digital
Drive style app.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.800
KAL MOS: Thank you, Chris.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.910
Hello, everyone.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.470
Thanks a lot for coming
today to listen to us.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.230
I will walk you through our
experience implementing Google

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.500
Places and the API, and I will
hand the microphone after that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.500
to Mike Cheng, who is leading
the development on our team at

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.160
Mercedes Benz to dive deeper
into the code and talk about

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.000
some of his experiences
with the code.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.620
I work for Mercedes
Benz Research and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.590
Development North America.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.230
Our office is actually in
Palo Alto south of here.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.160
And as Chris said, we've
been working with

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.060
Google for a while.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.410
So actually, when you buy a
Mercedes Benz car today, it

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.060
comes equipped with some of
Google's services already.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.720
The way it works today is that
we have an embedded head unit.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.210
There is a head unit that is
already coming with the car.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.660
HeadUnit is what you used to
call in the old days radio.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.340
It's now a computer running
multiple different

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.320
features in the car.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.660
We offer different Google
browser-based services within

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.540
that embedded HeadUnit.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.080
And we get the connectivity
either via Bluetooth phone

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.110
paired to the car or via
embedded telephony in North

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.600
America using M-brace
system that we

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.770
have for safety features.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.440
The features that are offered
usually in these cars, you get

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.720
Google Local Search, you get
Street View, you get Panorama

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.310
View, and if you are buying the
new S Class that was just

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.920
released yesterday, you get also
Google Maps and a full

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.720
implementation of Google Maps.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.420
So we know that people come
to the car with their

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.610
smartphones, and there is always
a question of what

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.870
drivers actually want when they
get into the car with

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.120
their smartphone.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.880
In most of the cars today, you
will be able to access your

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.550
contents from your phone.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.410
So you have some private
contents, you have your music.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.940
Can access your music,
for example.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.120
You can access your
address book, you

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.870
can make phone calls.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.550
But drivers want more.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.780
And there is a study
that actually was

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.030
conducted by JD Power.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.430
They actually went to drivers
who had navigation systems in

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.070
their car and asked them
what did they want?

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.310
And what they got back from
drivers is that they want an

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.790
easy and feature rich smartphone
integration.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.630
So it's not just about contents
from the smartphone.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.290
They want the features from
smartphone to be integrated,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.030
and they want it to be easy,
and that's a key word here.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.780
They want to use smartphone
for navigation.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.040
So those are actually drivers,
not in Mercedes Benz cars, but

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.140
in all different cars.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.890
47% of them downloaded a
navigation app and used it

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.035
while they had actually an
embedded navigation experience

00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:17.950
in their cars.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.880
So there is some kind of
growing preference for

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.370
navigation apps running
on smartphones.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.710
And when the study dived deeper
into the reason for

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.530
that, they found that
destination input and

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.990
selection is a major pain
point for drivers.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.350
And six out of the top 10
problems with the navigation

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.680
system they cited in that study
where actually related

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.810
to input and selection
of the destination.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.320
The study concludes with
this statement.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.290
One-shot destination
entry is the dream.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.120
So that's what we have
out there from

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.890
that study by JD Power.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.940
So we looked at what
we have internally.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.960
We have a system that's running
on a smartphone.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.460
The system is called
Digital DriveStyle.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.820
It's an application, runs
on the smartphone.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.370
And with that, once you run on
a smartphone, you get the

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.930
quick update cycle, which
basically you can virtually

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.450
release a new version of the
application every couple of

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.180
weeks if you want to.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.450
And that helps us and offers us
an opportunity to continue

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.750
the innovation cycle
with that.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.480
We can add features, we can
modify features, and we can

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.310
adjust the customer's
demand very quickly.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.430
We also are able to harness the
power of the smartphone.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.200
It's not a secret to anyone
here that smartphone is

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.290
leading in the hardware
and software areas

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.320
of innovations today.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.270
They are running now very,
very powerful processors.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.410
And as you probably can see
around us, outside this room,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.980
lots of things are running
around the platforms itself

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.445
like Android platform,
for example.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:16.425
So we brought all of these
advantages of smartphone and

00:07:16.425 --> 00:07:19.580
the ecosystem of smartphone
applications, and we run this

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.330
in the car.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.880
So once you get into the
car, you connect your

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.780
phone to the car--

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.295
you actually use the
car displays.

00:07:26.295 --> 00:07:31.220
You use a system like the audio
system in the car, the

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.720
speakers in the car, the
microphone in the car, the

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.980
input mechanism of the car.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.580
So you don't touch the phone
once you get into the car.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.500
The whole logic is coming
from the phone.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.170
All the screens are actually
rendered on the phone, but you

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.825
don't do even feel that as you
are driving your car and

00:07:48.825 --> 00:07:50.861
interacting with the system.

00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:54.030
The specific application here,
the Digital DriveStyle that

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.570
you see, it has three main
categories of features.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.960
It has Social, it has Media,
and it has Places.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.440
Social basically gives you a
safe, non-distracting way to

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.520
access your social
media networks.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.430
For example, you can access your
Facebook, you can access

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.620
your Twitter feed.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.360
You can access also your
Google+, as we show actually

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.450
in the vehicles out there.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.510
And Media will get you access
your on board media if you

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.340
have some music stored on the
phone, some files that you

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.410
purchased on the phone, or you
can also access your connected

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.820
music like internet radio.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.330
You can access your personalized
radio.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.940
So that's also possible
with this application.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.320
Places is a complete turn by
turn navigation on board, and

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.640
on board here means on
the phone itself.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.770
So we have the Maps locally
stored on the phone, and we

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.550
have the whole navigation
engine, route matching, and

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.060
destination entry
on the phone.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.480
That product is actually
available on iPhone.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.090
It's already released
last year.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:02.150
It's available in about 20
different markets, and we

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.970
started from that.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.590
We looked at that, and we
actually in the process of

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.017
developing the Android version
of this too to

00:09:08.017 --> 00:09:10.140
run on Android phones.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.910
But that's what we
have out there.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.610
And we looked into what we can
do with that and what we can

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:16.850
add into this.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.850
So the first thing that we, of
course, thought about is how

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.070
to make that on board navigation
engine that is not

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.830
connected, how do you make it
a hybrid navigation engine?

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.450
How do you had the connectivity
piece of it to

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:32.360
interact with Google Places and
become basically a hybrid

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.420
navigation system?

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.850
So we did a lot of things, and
you can watch them and

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.220
experience them in the car that
we brought out in the

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.306
Sandbox area of Google Maps.

00:09:44.306 --> 00:09:47.150
But I will focus here and we
will focus our talks on three

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.900
different things we consider
kind of major, and we would

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.860
like to discuss this
with you today.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.740
The one thing that stands out
is a single text box-based

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.950
destination entry.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.980
Basically, what you have in
Google Maps for years is now

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.960
available in the car.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.470
You don't have to think about,
I'm going to search, or I'm

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:13.300
going to input a
street address.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.820
You don't have to think
about these things.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.580
You just type what you want
and the system has an

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.030
autocomplete function powered
by Google Places API to find

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.970
what you want.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:28.140
And in few clicks as you are
trying to find the address,

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.600
Google Places API will propose
for you a few selections that

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.150
you pick the destination from.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:41.300
So that was actually one of the
new things that we tried

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.850
to address based on the study
that we saw from JD Power, and

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.450
we are happy to have it
today in our cars.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.345
And at least six of the top 10
major problems that customers

00:10:51.345 --> 00:10:55.140
are complaining from probably
are gone with this.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.600
The second thing is once you
are in the car and you're

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.580
actually driving from Point A to
Point B, you probably want

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.540
to know more about Point A or
Point B or something in

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.410
between, so we offer you this
kind of rich metadata and

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.790
visual information that helps
you while you're driving to

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.500
get more information about
your drive experience.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.490
So we enable you to review
Google+ local photos.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.970
We enable you to browse Street
Views around the destination

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.490
that you're going to.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.735
If you are actually driving to
a business location, we let

00:11:28.735 --> 00:11:31.640
you see the ratings or
the opening hours.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.990
And of course, you can make
phone calls and call and order

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.440
pizza if you're doing to a pizza
place to pick up your

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.965
pizza, or make a reservation
in a restaurant.

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:43.140
And at the end of the day, you
most likely want to navigate,

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.770
so we let you get, of course,
turn by turn directions to the

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.020
destination.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.740
And in many other cases, you
just want to glance and get an

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.220
idea about your surrounding
environment.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:03.580
So we added the ability to
overlay real time information

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.000
on Google Maps.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.615
So you can actually just glance
and see the weather in

00:12:07.615 --> 00:12:10.290
the area around you, or you can
see the traffic situation

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.090
in the area around you.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.930
So that's the third thing that
I would like to discuss and

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:18.060
highlight today here
in the talk.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.350
There were some challenges,
of course, like any other

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.410
interesting development
project.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.310
And I will talk about some
of the automotive related

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.510
challenges we faced.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.910
In automotive in anything we do,
there are a few challenges

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.010
that come whether we integrate
with Google or we integrate

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:40.680
with other features and
service providers.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.240
The automotive related
challenges that we have, one

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.680
of them is the reliability
requirements.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.120
Probably not too many of you
developed automotive

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.060
applications before, but
all of you drive car.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.860
And as you're driving the car,
the last thing you expect is

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.570
to have a system that hangs in
the car or the need to restart

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.510
a system in the car.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.050
That's completely unacceptable
and unheard of, and customers

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.840
do not expect that and
will not allow that.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.460
So that's a little
bit different.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.640
We all want to develop
bug-free features and

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.590
applications, but the reality
is there are a few bugs.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.670
How you judge those bugs, some
of the things that you might

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.300
look at in a mobile environment,
like on the

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.340
smartphone, something that you
could fix in the next release,

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.570
we cannot release it with.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.870
It's a showstopper for us.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.890
We stop.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.210
We have to fix them.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.820
So reliability requirements
here are extremely high in

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.160
automotive environment.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.090
Even though the app is running
on smartphone, but once you

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.030
get in the car, you see it on
the car display so it's a part

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.510
of the car system, and
immediately, the expectations

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.430
of customers are different.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.980
The second thing is
release cycle.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.320
We of course can update the app
every couple of weeks on

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.680
the phone, but what happens
on the car side?

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.370
The app has to talk to some
hardware on the car side, and

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:02.020
that hardware somehow is
also related to the

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.190
car development cycle.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.490
And the car development cycle,
as you all know, is probably

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.500
between three to four years.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.230
And we can release an app
every couple of weeks.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.290
So how do you match these
two different cycles?

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:18.620
So that's an issue that
we had to deal with.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.000
We have also that hardware
that lives in the car to

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.930
receive the contents from the
applications and display them

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.370
on the car side.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.750
It has to be automotive grade.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.170
And automotive grade means
many different things.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.410
The hardware, to be automotive
grade, means lots

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.300
of different things.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.650
But in general, it's about
temperature range.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:43.530
It has to work in Alaska, it has
to work in Mojave Desert

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.530
if you leave the car
for a week there.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.000
It has to work everywhere in
extreme heat and extreme cold

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.510
environments.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.390
It has to work under different
conditions of vibrations.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.350
So if you're driving on a
concrete road, on a dirt road,

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.760
on an asphalt road, different
conditions for vibrations, it

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.970
has to follow and work within
an environment that's very

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.510
challenging from a mission
point of view.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.280
And there are so many other
things for automotive grade

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.500
hardware that we actually have
to follow and make sure our

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.915
hardware will actually become,
at the end of the day, an

00:15:22.915 --> 00:15:24.450
automotive grade hardware.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.420
What that means is that we
cannot just tap to an existing

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.020
pool of hardware that's
available out there.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.670
And for any hardware to be put
in the car, it has to go

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:38.650
through a very rigid and tedious
process of being

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.250
qualified as an automotive grade
hardware and maybe even

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.890
change it to become an
automotive grade hardware

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.680
which makes it, of course, a
little bit more expensive and

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.070
also makes it a little bit late
to come to the market.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.970
So I cannot just step to the
chipset that was just released

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.810
last week and put
it in my car.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.970
I will have to take it into
a process to make it an

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.790
automotive grade hardware.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.920
Last but not least, the
driver distraction.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.690
As you are inside your
car, you are driving.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.650
That's the main job of every
driver is to drive.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.520
Eyes on the road, hands
on the wheel.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.020
Anything else is actually
secondary.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.500
Anything else is background.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.790
So our application has to
function in a way that's not

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:25.450
distracting for the driver,
and that is itself a big

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.230
challenge because even though
there are guidelines,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.620
interpreting the guidelines and
following the guidelines

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.960
is a big challenge.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.390
There are AAM guidelines in
North America, there is ISO

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.870
guidelines in Europe, there is
JAMA guidelines in Japan.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.266
And we follow all these
guidelines and we designed the

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:42.400
app to satisfy all
these guidelines.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.080
Now, some challenges are also
related to how you implement

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.210
Google Places API in
that environment.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.230
The first one is the end
to end use case.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.340
We are actually stitching
two things together.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.010
We are still using the on board
navigation maps and on

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:03.350
board navigation core, and
actually augmenting that and

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.390
adding to that the information
and the experiences we're

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.000
getting from Google
Places API.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.790
And at the end of the day,
customers do not need to worry

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.829
about that, do not need
to care about that.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.460
The customer needs just end to
end experience that's smooth

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.099
and seamless, and that provided
a challenge for us.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:26.540
The second thing is the reality
of cellular coverage.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.830
It's not a secret that you are
driving in the United States

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.180
especially in many areas
that do not have

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.710
good cellular coverage.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.000
You get from 3G to 2G, and then

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.310
sometimes you get to zero.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.200
There is no G at all.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:41.720
There is nothing.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.280
There is no connectivity
at all.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.660
And if you are in the middle
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.380
entry and you are making a
request to Google back end to

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.495
get the information and you lose
connectivity, what are

00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:53.370
you going to do?

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.770
So the fallback scenario on how
you gracefully fall back

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.690
when you make requests and you
don't get an answer and how

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.870
the user will see that in
front of it is a great

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.790
challenge here because customers
expect the system to

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.980
work, obviously.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.120
And then assuming that we solve
the end to end use case

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.190
problem and we have good
coverage and you've got the

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.950
information, now how can you
stitch all these different

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.960
databases together?

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.050
These databases, they have
different formats.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.710
They're optimized for different
conditions.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.180
And just trying to get the right
information to show in

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:35.110
the right location is a
challenge in itself.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:42.450
So how did we think about ways
to make a successful

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.940
automotive App Engine?

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.720
How did we do that?

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.680
For DriveStyle App, we developed
a strategy that's

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.330
based on very few
requirements.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.820
The first one is to focus
on user experience,

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:56.800
not number of features.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.980
So we actually have access to a
huge number of features and

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.520
we pick and choose
few of them.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.570
We don't offer everything.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.320
We offer a few of them.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.860
If for some of you, it makes
sense to have 200 different

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.270
apps on your phone, probably for
many of you, you wouldn't

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.450
need that in the car.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.150
You need a few that are done
right, and that's what we are

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.980
focusing on here.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.150
We focused on social.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.570
We know that people now, they
have their own digital

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:28.730
lifestyle, and we know that the
car is part of that and in

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.690
many cases, that goes
around social.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:36.060
So in Digital DriveStyle, we
made sure that your navigation

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.630
is part of your social
experience, your media is part

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.680
of your social experience,
and vice versa.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.620
So social is a core component
in everything we do.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.510
And context is also extremely
important in car environment

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.760
because you don't have a lot
of time to choose from

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.630
multiple options.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.830
So we use context here to limit
the number of things.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.880
So when you do a search for
pizza, we don't show you the

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.590
pizza everywhere around
in the United States.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.385
We show you just the pizza
around your location because

00:20:04.385 --> 00:20:06.190
most likely, that's what
you're looking for.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:11.070
So context is extremely
important in that regard.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.410
We don't develop the app and
then adjust it to satisfy

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.340
driver distraction requirements
or to avoid

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.360
driver distraction.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.030
We don't do that.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.590
We actually design the app from
the beginning, one of the

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.520
input and constraints in the
design is the driver

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.530
distraction guidelines.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.900
So we start with that,
not end with that.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.930
And that's extremely important
because it's in the DNA of the

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:39.110
app itself that it will
run in a car.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:43.750
Then we keep, as much as
possible, logic and

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.640
information on the phone side
because we know that is the

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.220
side that we control better.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.710
We can update that
much faster.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.840
And there is some software, of
course, living on the hardware

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.770
in the car, but we minimize that
to the minimal amount in

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.420
order to be able to innovate
much faster

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.130
independent of the car.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.430
What is the long term goal?

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:10.900
So what we want, at the end of
the day, at one point, is a

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.970
seamless experience
in navigation and

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.070
in everything else.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:20.190
So you basically don't have to
send information from your

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.950
laptop to the car or from
your phone to the car.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.640
We want the information
to be available.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.580
We want one state for you
navigation, whether you are

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.520
working on your desktop or
working on your laptop, on

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.760
your smartphone, or you're
actually getting in the car,

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.850
the state is maintained and the
state is available for you

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.050
for navigation and for
other features too.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.910
So that's what we would like
to have at the end.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:43.920
And we will get there.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.180
We'll get to that point
eventually.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.380
So I would like now to pass the
microphone to Mike Cheng

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.760
from our team to talk a little
bit about the implementation.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.990
MIKE CHENG: Thanks, Kal.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.580
So I'd like to share with all of
you some of our experiences

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.540
and lessons learned in
developing the DriveStyle

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.200
application and bringing the
Places API into this product.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.880
I'd like to cover how to improve
traditional address

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.510
entry and destination entry,
and then we'll move on and

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.160
talk a little bit about how
to create a system that's

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.280
connected and brings information
from the web into

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.920
the product.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.950
And then we'll talk a little
bit about the Google Maps

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.850
solutions that we use in the
Digital DriveStyle app.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.450
So let's start with the
destination entry.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.940
This screen is probably familiar
to a lot of you.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.760
It's the traditional
address entry flow.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.660
So at the top, you have entry
fields for state, and then you

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.280
select a city, and then you
select a street, and then if

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.550
you want, you can go select
a house number.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:50.060
And even after that, you can
select an intersection

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.570
if you wanted to.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.360
This is a really tedious process
because each entry

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.330
that you go into, you need to
then go into the speller and

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:57.980
type it out.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.010
And this is so tedious to use
while driving that, according

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.820
to the AAM standards
in the US, it's not

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.830
allowed while driving.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.040
So you need to be stopped on
the side of the road or in

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.570
your garage, for example.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.650
But I think the bigger issue
here is that people don't

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.530
really use street addresses
anymore.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.130
Just like how on your phone you
have phone numbers, but

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.890
you get the phone number
from your friend once

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:23.870
and then it's stored.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.270
It's stored on your device.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.360
It's stored in the
cloud somewhere.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.440
It's stored in your
social network.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.210
So what can we do to improve
the experience?

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.760
So we took a close look at how
Google manages this product.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:42.790
So we look to Google Maps
online, and we really want

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.680
this experience of, instead of
telling my navigation system

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.470
where I want to go, I should
tell it what want to do.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.480
The solution should help me
reduce the number of inputs

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.570
that I need to enter.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:59.780
So you see here that I type in
C-O-F, and already, I have

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.870
suggestions for coffee shops
and businesses matching

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:06.490
"coffee." And most importantly,
we need to make

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.970
this safe to use
while driving.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.210
So with that in mind, we've
taken advantage of the Places

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.920
Query Autocomplete APIs.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.160
it's a really nice API that
returns us a mixed list of

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.140
query suggestions--

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.730
so coffee bean, coffee,
coffee shops--

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.600
as well as a few business
names, so Coffee Inc and

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.560
Coffee Bar.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.660
You see on the right
here that it's not

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.090
limited to just queries.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.170
You can actually start
typing in an address.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:38.690
So 800 H matches to 800 Howard
Street, which is actually the

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.540
address for the Moscone
Center for people

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.940
who don't know addresses.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.440
If I type in 850, it immediately
matches our office

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.410
in Palo Alto at 850
Hanson Way.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:54.010
And so typically with three
or four characters, I can

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:58.220
actually get exactly what I
want, and this enables a user

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.790
experience that's much more
similar to Google Maps than

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.040
what we had before.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.820
So let's take a look at what
happens underneath, just at a

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.050
very high level.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.500
At the top, you see boxes
for the Google Places

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.910
queries that we make.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.130
These are API endpoints that
we have access to.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.860
At the bottom, you get an
example of the responses

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.630
coming back from
these queries.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.840
So if we type in the example
from before, C-O-F, we put

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.540
this into the Places Query
Autocomplete, the Autocomplete

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.400
API returns us the list of
coffee bean, coffee, coffee

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.450
shops, coffee drink,
coffee bar.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.730
But these are just
string results.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.970
It doesn't have any metadata
associated with it.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.040
So the next step that we need
to take is we need to take

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.250
that coffee query completion and
then put it into the Place

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.190
Search API.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.110
So this Place Search API will
actually return me businesses

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:02.750
or establishments or street
addresses, for example.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.640
You see here that there's
some duplication.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.790
So the two items on the bottom
for the Query Autocomplete

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.570
also show up for Place Search,
so we'll try to optimize for

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:11.770
that a little bit.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.180
But the Place Search will give
us a reference that we can

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.610
then put into the Place Details
API to get back rich

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.870
metadata about this location
such as the lat, long, the

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.340
opening hours, review
data, and so on.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:30.300
So actually, what's new since
about two days ago, the Places

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.400
Query Autocomplete API Response
does return you the

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.880
reference for locations such
as 800 Howard Street.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.450
So this is really handy because
in our flow that we

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:44.120
saw before, we basically
remove an entire step.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.780
So that's an entire request to
the network, and you need to

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.560
wait for a response.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.940
We've simplified it from three
requests down to two.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.600
So that's really helping us in
improving the performance for

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.470
our customers, and I'll talk a
little bit later about why you

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.610
should not count on the
network being there.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.970
So here, we have a
comparison video.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.230
On the left, you have the
traditional address entry, and

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.530
then on the right, you
have the address

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.150
entry powered by Google.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.510
I'll play this video
really quick.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.940
Watch the right very closely
because it goes quick.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.540
On the left side, it
takes a little bit

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.890
longer, and you'll see.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:26.510
So here we go.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.840
On the right side, we
have a search field.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.320
We type in 1, and immediately,
we have 1600

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.080
Amphitheater Parkway.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.980
We select it, and then we go,
we calculate a route, and

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.130
we're done.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.860
So that was about 10 seconds.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.233
On the left, we're still
typing in Amphitheater.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.720
OK.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.570
House number 1600.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:52.820
OK.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:58.540
And there we go.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.780
So on the right with the Places
API, we've cut down the

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.480
amount of time it takes
to enter an

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.790
address by two thirds.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.250
So the one on the right takes
10 seconds, the one on the

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.890
left takes 30 seconds.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:15.080
So we expect this to be a huge
improvement to the product.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.600
We expect it to be the best
implementation, actually, of

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.830
destination entry in any
automotive product when it's

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.080
released next month.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.380
So let's talk about going
beyond street addresses.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.750
So again, we look at for the
Google Maps APIs again and

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.400
Google Maps Web Service, and we
see that we have a lot of

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.300
social features.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.390
So you see that we have Street
View here, we have Photos, we

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.910
have Reviews and Ratings.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.770
So this is how we've brought
this into our product.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.590
Using the Place Details API, you
get all this information

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:54.090
for star ratings and
opening hours.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.820
We also get the Google+
Local Photos back,

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.750
which is very nice.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.520
It feels like you've been to
that location without actually

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.960
having been there.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.870
And of course, the immersity
of Google Street View

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.610
experience, which I highly
recommend everybody to go to

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.800
our SL 550 outside to experience
for yourself.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.630
A little bit about blending
online data with offline maps.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.740
Don't count on having a
network connection.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.020
You could be driving through the
desert or driving through

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:25.300
the forest or coming to Google
I/O where there's no network

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.330
connection whatsoever.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.580
Cache as much as you can.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.500
Cache aggressively.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.890
Don't block or restrict the UI
or the flow if you don't have

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.520
a network connection
because customers

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.050
absolutely hate that.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:43.570
Map data can be different or
incomplete, so with an off

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.520
board solution where you're
grabbing everything from the

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.900
internet, the data is always
constantly updating.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.290
And in markets such as China,
actually, there are actually

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.100
lots of changes being made to
the infrastructure constantly,

00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:00.120
so streets are being built,
businesses are moving around,

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.010
and it's most likely not going
to match your on board data.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.420
And then finally,
be careful with

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.790
geocodes and reverse geocodes.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.040
If you have an address and you
convert that into a lat long,

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.800
don't convert it back
to an address.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.600
It's not going to be
the same address.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.260
Just be consistent in how you
store this information and how

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.510
you present it to the user.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.020
And then finally, unique maps.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.640
Our product actually takes
advantage of the Google Maps

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.750
SDK for iOS.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.170
It's a really nice library that
you can integrate into

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.550
your product.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.010
You link a few libraries and
you reference a resource

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.140
bundle, and you're basically
ready to go.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.740
It matches very closely to other
map frameworks, so you

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.520
get access to all of these 3D
buildings and traffic players

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.770
and map types.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:56.780
And finally, we have our Heatmap
concept, which is

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:02.210
based off of the Places
API Radar Search.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:06.120
The Radar Search was actually
initially released by Google

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.210
in January of this year.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.820
We'll be the first automotive
manufacturer actually to take

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.770
advantage of these APIs.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.490
What the API does is it returns
you a point cloud of

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.880
200 locations around
a certain location.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.170
So we can generate these
density maps

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:22.820
based off of the data.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.080
So you see the white spots here
are higher density, and

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.510
then the darker spots
are lower density.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.830
And it really gives you an idea
of the character of a

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.740
certain location if you haven't
been there before.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:42.090
Just a quick note on the
JavaScript Maps API that we

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.620
use for City Guide.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.270
One technique that we've
actually used is instead of

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:54.540
referencing image data stored on
disk, we Base64 encode all

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.940
of the image data and feed
it directly into

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.740
the JavaScript API.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.770
This gives us a few
advantages.

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:04.540
The JavaScript API, we can sense
this image data without

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.850
a network connection.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.930
So once your maps have loaded,
then you can basically change

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.600
the overlay as often
as you want.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.500
And the second point is that you
have no need to save the

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.360
image data to disk, so you
gain some performance

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.610
improvements there.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.340
And that's pretty much it.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.060
So thanks a lot.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.800
We've hopefully given you some
insight into how we've

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.090
developed the Digital DriveStyle
app, and please

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.460
stop by our Sandbox demo.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.200
CHRIS CARDE: So it looks like
we've got about seven minutes

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.320
left for questions.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.160
We have two microphones set up
in the aisles, and if anyone

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.160
would like to come up, this
is your chance to ask an

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.740
automaker anything about
navigation or infotainment.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.130
Anybody?

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:51.876
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:51.876 --> 00:32:54.715
I've got a couple use cases that
seem to be pretty common

00:32:54.715 --> 00:32:56.490
when I want to go somewhere
in my car.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:59.760
One, someone texts me an
address, and then I've got to

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.370
somehow put that in either the
car nav or my phone, and

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:04.060
that's pretty annoying.

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.680
Two, I'm at my desktop, I find
somewhere I want to go, do all

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.180
my navigation, figure
out my route.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:14.350
Now I've got to somehow get
that into my car, too.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:19.970
Do you foresee some way of
making that transparently

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.270
entered into the car nav so that
there's maybe no UI and

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.050
it just somehow gets there?

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.430
How would you handle
that, I guess?

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.610
MIKE CHENG: Yeah.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:28.460
That's actually a very
interesting problem, one that

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.670
we're hoping to solve.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:33.300
We've kind of handled the
problem the opposite way, so

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.860
we've integrated Glimpse
into our product.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.090
And what this does is that we
can actually send our current

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:41.120
location to a third party
so that they know

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.200
where you are, at least.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.060
I think the next step to that
is to bring it the other way

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.860
around so that somebody can send
you a destination or you

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.110
can send yourself
a destination.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.940
CHRIS CARDE: And I should point
out that Google Maps

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.810
does already have a feature
called Send To Car.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.290
We do integrate with a number of
automakers to allow you to

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.710
send an address directly
from Google Maps

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:01.960
to a connected vehicle.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.400
AUDIENCE: Another question.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.719
What about voice control
integration in the car?

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.929
I just represents a company that
develops technological

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:18.000
systems for the car called
Robin service.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.600
KAL MOS: So the application
itself

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.400
today runs on the iPhone.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.080
We have Siri integration
completely

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.690
integrated in the product.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:31.610
On the Android version that we
are working on, we are looking

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:35.370
into integrating the Google
Voice as part of that.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.810
You have text to speech built
in on board, so there is

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.100
always text to speech to read
stuff back to you, to read

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.900
your Facebook postings and the
different information to you.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.179
But more than that, just for the
interaction itself, we're

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:52.860
going to depend on the voice
integration that comes with

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.290
the phone itself.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.190
AUDIENCE: OK, I look in
our products also.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.200
It's right there.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.920
AUDIENCE: You mentioned having
to comply with automotive

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.140
grade hardware.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.380
What about the consumer-provided
cell phone?

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.911
Is that considered automotive
grade, or did you have to do

00:35:08.911 --> 00:35:11.120
anything special for that?

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.130
KAL MOS: No.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.100
Of course, the phone itself
is whatever phone you buy.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.330
It's usually not automotive
grade.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:23.580
Today, you will still have to
plug the phone, but we offer

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.640
the phone a place where you can
plug it close to you, like

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.840
in the armrest, for example,
where you can plug it.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.180
Usually, you don't leave a phone
in the car, and that's a

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.280
huge difference from the
hardware itself.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.550
The hardware is always
in the car.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.180
When you park the car
in the desert for 10

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.730
hours, it is there.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.020
But your phone is always in your
pocket, and that's why

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.470
the problem is not that
severe with the phone.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.460
The phone is usually with you,
and once you come into the

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.250
car, the phone is usually within
your vicinity, and

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.060
that's always air conditioned
and a nice environment that

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.680
doesn't really have to satisfy
lots of automotive grade

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.166
requirements.

00:35:58.166 --> 00:35:59.416
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:03.390
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:07.200
I'm interested to know where you
think it will be in, say,

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.530
five years down the line?

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:12.440
What's your ambition for the
socialization of the

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.880
automotive experience
at Mercedes Benz?

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.040
Is that something you think will
develop in partnership

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.280
with Google?

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.730
I'm kind of interested to know
how experimental you are right

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.180
now with all of these
restrictions you

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.360
also have to consider.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.626
KAL MOS: We are as open as
we can be, I would say.

00:36:30.626 --> 00:36:33.230
We look into this seamless
experience, really.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:36.850
We think the car is part of
your digital lifestyle.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:38.090
We need to maintain the state.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.190
I want to have one state
for everything.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.320
Whatever you do on the phone,
I want it to be available in

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.320
the car without you sending
anything back and forth.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.340
So that is what I'm looking at,
is that whatever the next

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.000
greatest applications and
features that Google will come

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.020
up with and other companies
will come up with, I want

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.520
these to be immediately
available in the car without

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.250
needing to synchronize and send
things back and forth.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.950
So that's, I think,
where we can go.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:07.350
And what we're trying to do is
to develop a platform that we

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.260
can easily provide that.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:14.010
So it's a platform that runs
on a phone, so I can always

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.890
push the newest and greatest
update to it.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:20.630
I open information on the car
side as much as possible so I

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.290
can take advantage of the
sensors in the car and merge

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:26.770
that with all the information
that comes from the back end.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.300
The vision that we have for the
car really is that because

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.710
the car, at the end of the
day, is your friend.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:32.840
It knows about you.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.950
It knows about your customs
and habits.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:38.630
It knows about what you did on
your phone a few minutes ago.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.005
And you should not come to the
car every time and start from

00:37:42.005 --> 00:37:43.220
zero again.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.950
You should just continue what
you've been doing as you get

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:46.750
in the car.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:47.950
And the only difference,
of course,

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:48.870
is that you're driving.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.460
So that's our job, is to make
sure that you can continue

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.790
what you were doing but in a
safe, non-distracting way.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:57.100
AUDIENCE: In the future, is it
planned to be across every

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.880
single variation of
Mercedes vehicle?

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.110
KAL MOS: Well actually, the app
is offered now in most of

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.680
our car lines.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.470
So it's offered in the
A class, B class,

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:10.290
E class, and CLA.

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.340
We're offering it one by one
to all different models.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.510
So that's the target, yes.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:21.670
There is a heavy focus, of
course, on the new cars.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.310
It's a little bit hard to go
backwards and try to offer it

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.900
for existing customers on
the road for 10 years.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.190
But that's part of what we're
trying to do that once we

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:31.580
offer it now, it will actually
live with you in

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.620
the coming few years.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.890
And even five years from now,
you can still have the latest

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:37.110
and greatest experience
in a car that you

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:39.520
bought five years ago.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.770
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.350
CHRIS CARDE: OK, well, I think
we're just about out of time.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:49.150
Thank you very much
for coming.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.960
We'll be available in the
Sandbox area for at least 15

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.750
minutes, 30 minutes thereafter
to answer questions.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:55.800
Come see us.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.730
Come see the demo.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:58.980
Thanks again.
