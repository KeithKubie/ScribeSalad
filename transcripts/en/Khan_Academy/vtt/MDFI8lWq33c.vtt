00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:01.579
- [Voiceover] Hey Kim.

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:02.605
- [Kim] Hey, Becca.

00:00:02.605 --> 00:00:05.233
So, we've been talking
about Uncle Tom's Cabin,

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.592
published in 1852 by
Harriet Beecher Stowe,

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.724
and said to have been
one of the main causes

00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:13.082
of the American Civil War.

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:15.391
So, remind me again of
what Uncle Tom's Cabin

00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:16.798
was actually about.

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:18.935
- [Becca] So Uncle Tom's Cabin was about

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.841
the horrors of slavery in the deep south

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:25.996
and also appealed to a lot of
American's Christian values

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:28.657
and tried to point out these
fundamental contradictions

00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:31.314
between Christian faith and slavery.

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:33.081
- [Kim] So, it was published in 1852.

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:34.764
How did people receive this book?

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:36.980
- [Becca] So there was a
lot of mixed reactions.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.710
But, it was the most read
book of the 19th century,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.889
so there were a lot of reactions.

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:43.722
(laughing)

00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:47.785
In the north, mostly, people
were reading this all the time,

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:50.205
no matter if you were an intellectual

00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:54.056
or just kind of a 17 year old
picking up a book off a shelf,

00:00:54.056 --> 00:00:55.864
you were going to read Uncle Tom's Cabin.

00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:57.655
And a lot of the people
that actually read the book

00:00:57.655 --> 00:01:01.503
were young men that would
later fight in the Civil War.

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:02.336
- [Kim] How interesting.

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:05.279
Okay, so, like this would be
our book club book of the month

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:06.553
except everybody was,

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:11.046
this was like the Oprah's
book club choice of 1852.

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:12.245
- [Becca] Exactly.
- [Kim] Everybody was

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:13.227
reading it.

00:01:13.227 --> 00:01:15.773
- [Becca] Yeah, there's
really almost nothing like it.

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:17.212
Not even Harry Potter.

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:19.199
But it did have the
same international scope

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:20.844
that Harry Potter does today.

00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:23.605
- [Kim] So, it was popular in
the northern United States,

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:25.215
and elsewhere in the world.

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:26.655
So, where else was it popular?

00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:28.972
- [Becca] Mostly in Europe.

00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:31.322
But it was translated
into over 60 languages.

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:32.191
- [Kim] Wow.

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.589
- [Becca] And, this also
kind of put the spotlight

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:36.773
on American slavery.

00:01:36.773 --> 00:01:39.782
So, there was all this
international attention.

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:41.304
What is going on in America,

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:42.576
and what's going to happen?

00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:43.409
- [Kim] That's so interesting.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.170
It reminds me of The King and I.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.377
If you've seen that she,
the woman goes to Siam,

00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:50.794
and shows people

00:01:52.093 --> 00:01:54.103
the book Uncle Tom's Cabin

00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:56.898
and they put on a version of a play

00:01:56.898 --> 00:01:58.295
based on Uncle Tom's Cabin

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:00.515
in what would be Thailand.

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:02.032
- [Becca] So yeah, so
this makes it this kind of

00:02:02.032 --> 00:02:04.210
international spectacle.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.240
The fate of slavery had
to be somehow figured out,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.256
and everyone was watching.

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:10.089
- [Kim] That's so interesting.

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.165
So, I'm imagining that white southerners

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.135
were not big fans of this book.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:15.938
- [Becca] So, white
southerners were definitely

00:02:15.938 --> 00:02:18.682
not a fan of Uncle Tom's Cabin.

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:21.098
And in response, there was
this movement of these things

00:02:21.098 --> 00:02:23.186
called anti-Tom novels.

00:02:23.186 --> 00:02:25.976
Here's an anti-Tom novel right next to us,

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:26.919
right over here,

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.016
Aunt Phillis's Cabin.

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:28.849
(Kim laughing)

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.900
- [Kim] Creative name.
- [Becca] Aunt Phillis' Cabin,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.353
yes (laughing), very creative name.

00:02:32.353 --> 00:02:35.269
These anti-Tom novels
aimed to point out that

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.997
maybe Harriet Beecher Stowe didn't know

00:02:36.997 --> 00:02:38.521
what she was actually talking about.

00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:40.246
They also accused Harriet Beecher Stowe

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:42.758
of not actually even
living in the deep south,

00:02:42.758 --> 00:02:44.991
so she didn't even know
what slavery was like.

00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:47.781
They wanted to paint
southern slave society

00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:49.378
in this really positive light.

00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:51.591
They wanted to show all
the ways that it actually

00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:53.276
maintains social order,

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:55.573
and promoted economic welfare,

00:02:55.573 --> 00:02:58.115
so this was kind of this
response from the south,

00:02:58.115 --> 00:02:59.630
also in novel form.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.885
- [Kim] So, it's this big
kind of cultural battle

00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:04.029
over the interpretation of slavery.

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:05.918
You have people on one hand saying

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:08.256
slavery is destructive to families,

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:11.449
slavery is incompatible with Christianity.

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.243
And then, responses from the white south,

00:03:14.243 --> 00:03:16.702
saying, oh no, actually slavery is great,

00:03:16.702 --> 00:03:18.185
it helps everybody.

00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:20.035
- [Becca] Right, so there
was this kind of battle

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:22.010
within the literary community

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.637
about the peculiar institution of slavery.

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:25.625
Which one was it?

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:28.414
- [Kim] So what if, I'm illiterate, right.

00:03:28.414 --> 00:03:31.162
I mean, not everybody
in 19th century America

00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:33.848
was a New England intellectual

00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:37.014
who was reading Christian novels.

00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:39.027
How would I have heard
about Uncle Tom's Cabin?

00:03:39.027 --> 00:03:40.636
- [Becca] That's a really good point, Kim.

00:03:40.636 --> 00:03:44.778
So, Tom Shows were depictions
of Uncle Tom's Cabin

00:03:44.778 --> 00:03:46.337
in theaters around the world.

00:03:46.337 --> 00:03:49.993
And so, they were often times
put on by abolitionist people

00:03:49.993 --> 00:03:53.648
trying to point out the
issues with slavery today

00:03:53.648 --> 00:03:56.229
and end slavery immediately.

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.196
- [Kim] So, this is before
there's copyright law, right,

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:01.157
so you can just put on a
show of anybody's novel

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.396
if you feel like it.

00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:03.993
- [Becca] Exactly, but often times,

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:06.490
they really misconstrued the novel.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.491
And actually, now are
remembered as contributing

00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:12.684
to the problem of racism in America.

00:04:12.684 --> 00:04:14.493
- [Kim] Racial stereotypes,
too, I would imagine,

00:04:14.493 --> 00:04:17.201
because we still have
this phrase Uncle Tom

00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:18.929
kind of to mean

00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:23.689
an African-American who is
a martyr to the status quo

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:26.778
as opposed to someone who
might fight against racism.

00:04:26.778 --> 00:04:28.258
It seems like they might have borrowed

00:04:28.258 --> 00:04:30.596
a lot of these stereotypes
from minstrel shows

00:04:30.596 --> 00:04:33.142
which were also very
popular in this time period.

00:04:33.142 --> 00:04:34.340
- [Becca] And some of the characters

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.654
within these minstrel shows

00:04:35.654 --> 00:04:39.304
turned into the character that
was remembered as Jim Crow,

00:04:39.304 --> 00:04:41.483
which became the dominating racial order

00:04:41.483 --> 00:04:43.695
after the Civil War.

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:47.010
So, in the Civil Rights
era in the mid-1950's,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.761
lots of activists actually
wanted to completely reject

00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:52.931
the progress that Uncle Tom's
Cabin and these Tom Shows

00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:55.808
had made because they actually
reduced African Americans

00:04:55.808 --> 00:04:58.065
to this terrible stereotype.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:01.233
And so, later on, this kind of idea that

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:04.970
someone was an Uncle Tom
became a racial slur, really,

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.919
and they then rejected Uncle Tom's Cabin

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.124
as being a tool towards racial equality

00:05:11.124 --> 00:05:14.170
and more saw it as a part of the problem.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.228
- [Kim] So, I think,
the most important thing

00:05:16.228 --> 00:05:19.393
about Uncle Tom's Cabin
is that it's this catalyst

00:05:19.393 --> 00:05:22.726
of really intense emotions about slavery

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:28.300
which in the 1850's will lead
eventually to the Civil War.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.750
And, following the publication
of Uncle Tom's Cabin,

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.848
you'll see more and more violence

00:05:33.848 --> 00:05:35.660
on both sides of this issue.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.532
For example, John Brown,
this famous abolitionist

00:05:38.532 --> 00:05:41.942
actually goes out to
Kansas and murders people.

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:44.287
- [Becca] And I think that
Lincoln was very astute

00:05:44.287 --> 00:05:46.015
in pointing out that Uncle Tom's Cabin

00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:49.294
really catalyzed a lot of this violence.

00:05:49.294 --> 00:05:51.313
And he even met with
Harriet Beecher Stowe,

00:05:51.313 --> 00:05:54.479
so she earned herself
a little meeting with

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.339
Abraham Lincoln.

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:56.197
(Kim laughing)

00:05:56.197 --> 00:05:57.109
- [Kim] And he said,

00:05:57.109 --> 00:06:01.276
"So you're the little lady
that started this great war."

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:07.819
I'm trying to think of another
book that has started a war.

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.728
- [Becca] I think we would
probably remember that.

00:06:10.728 --> 00:06:13.152
But I do think Lincoln was
really astute in pointing out

00:06:13.152 --> 00:06:16.200
just how impactful this
cultural phenomenon,

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.655
this Tom-mania was on
the question of slavery

00:06:19.655 --> 00:06:22.641
and on the fate of the American people.

00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:25.682
And really, it just begged
the question in a new way,

00:06:25.682 --> 00:06:28.553
in this kind of public setting.

00:06:28.553 --> 00:06:30.516
I mean, I just think that the book itself,

00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:32.485
the way that the book could just travel

00:06:32.485 --> 00:06:33.962
all around the United States

00:06:33.962 --> 00:06:35.607
and so many different kinds of people

00:06:35.607 --> 00:06:37.981
were able to read it and
get their hands on it.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.764
This really was just
this movement of people

00:06:40.764 --> 00:06:42.366
just thinking a lot about slavery,

00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:43.842
reading a lot about slavery.

00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:47.162
- [Kim] Yeah, well, I think
after Uncle Tom's Cabin,

00:06:47.162 --> 00:06:49.792
I don't think there was a
way to not have an opinion

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:51.843
on the slavery issue.

00:06:51.843 --> 00:06:53.075
Either you were for it,

00:06:53.075 --> 00:06:54.395
or you were against it.

00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:57.303
And that divisiveness would
lead to the Civil War.

00:06:57.303 --> 00:06:59.677
- [Becca] And again, there's
this international focus.

00:06:59.677 --> 00:07:01.969
There's a deeper, sectional divide

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:03.654
between the north and the south,

00:07:03.654 --> 00:07:06.434
and there was this kind of
sorting over the slavery question

00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:08.311
that Uncle Tom's Cabin really promoted.
