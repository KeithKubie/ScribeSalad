&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.173
&gt;&gt; Chang-rae Lee immigrated to
United States from Korea in 1965

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.560
when he was just three years old.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.053
He attended some of the country's
most prestigious schools -

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.193
Phillips Exeter Academy
and Yale, earned an MFA.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.540
And then like most aspiring writers,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.933
he became a financial
analyst on Wall Street.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280
[ Laughter ]

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.916
&gt;&gt; That, fortunately, did not last
long, and soon he turned to fiction.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.023
His novels immediately
attracted wide critical praise.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.803
"Native speaker" and "A
Gesture Life" are searching

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.810
and powerful stories about
the special challenges

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.146
of immigrant life, the fragility of
identity and the burdens of memory.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.533
His work can be dark and
very serious as we've seen

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.386
in his new novel "The Surrendered"
or even comic and poignant as we saw

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.426
in his previous novel, "Aloft."

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.820
Now, a professor of Creative
Writing at Princeton University,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.893
Chang-rae Lee is a novelist
who reminds us not only

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.176
that we're a country of
immigrants, but that the process

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.490
of immigration is always
more fraught

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.356
and more complex than we imagined.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.023
Please join in welcoming him.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.590
[ Applause ]

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.490
&gt;&gt; Hi!

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.490
&gt;&gt; Hi!

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.556
&gt;&gt; You know, it seems
like I can never run away

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.090
from that one brief
year on Wall Street.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.490
[ Laughter ]

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.823
&gt;&gt; I worked literally 365 days to
the day, and I quit on that day,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.060
so I could say to my father I worked
a year and I'm gonna quit now.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.400
But sometimes I see I get e-mails
from friends and acquaintances

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.753
from that time, and you
know, they always say, "Oh,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.686
it's great that you've started
writing books and da-da-da."

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.773
And you know, but they
always, of course say,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.453
but you would have
made a lot of money.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.920
[ Laughter ]

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.920
&gt;&gt; You know, I'd like
to have a two more zeros

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.986
in my account, but that's okay.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.786
I was just gonna talk a little
bit about "The Surrendered,"

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.770
a book that came out
in the late spring.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.113
It's a book that I've been thinking
about writing for a long time.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.940
And I guess I'll just say a
few words, and I hope that's--

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.466
I hope that you people will ask
questions 'cause I much rather

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.146
respond to questions
that you might have.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.113
But one of the questions I
always get is about, you know,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.380
where stories come from for writers.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.733
People are always curious.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Even people who know me well,
you know, sometimes look at me,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.693
and think, "Why did you write that
book and where did that come from.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.040
You know, what's wrong with you?"

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.573
Or, you know, what's--
why that obsession.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.310
And there are lots of reasons.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.376
You know, sometimes, it's stuff

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.310
that I've been thinking
about for a long time.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.110
Sometimes it's an accident.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.310
You know, my second novel, I
read an article in the newspaper

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.606
about Korean comfort
women and I decided, "Boy,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.406
I can't believe I don't know about
this, so I'm gonna look into it,"

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.766
and thus a novel came to be.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.546
But this particular novel, I was--

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.080
I've been thinking about
writing it for a long, long time.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.006
It's a novel that takes place
partly during the Korean War.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.536
Its main character meet during the
Korean War and it follows their--

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.323
their relationships and their
struggles after the war.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.950
It's really a postwar novel
rather than a war novel.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.783
But it's a book that, obviously,
I'm Korean-American, and I'd thought

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.323
about writing a book about that
time for a long time, you know,

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.490
ever since I became sort of,
I guess, a writer in earnest.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.276
I guess I'm still a
writer in earnest.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.780


00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.983
And obviously, it's my background
that, you know, that spurred me on,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.883
and particularly my father and my
mother's experience during the war.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.013
This was 1950s, so they
were young, you know,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.500
young kids about 11
and 12 years old.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.306
They never talked about their
experience during the war.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.340
A lot of people, you know, of their
generation never wanted to talk

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.333
about the war and still never
want to talk about the war.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.026
So, it's something that
I didn't know about.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.893
You know, writers often write
to fill in their questions,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.336
to you know, to satisfy
some curiosity

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.060
about a particular subject.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.076
And it was particularly
something that was, you know,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.500
important in my life
back in college.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.420
I was taking a Korean history class,
Modern Korean History class seminar.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.723
And for that seminar, I had to
write something about my family,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.303
kinda autobiographical piece.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.270
And I ended up kinda cornering
my father and asking him

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.260
about his experience during the war.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.656
His family, just for a quick
background, was from Pyongyang

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.570
which is now the capital
of North Korea.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.193
And on the eve of hostilities, like
many thousands of other refugees,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.886
they had started to move southward

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.686
to escape the fighting
and to get to the south.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.980
So he told me a little
bit about that time.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.906
That was the first time
we'd ever talked about it.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.320
I was just kinda idly
writing notes, you know,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.826
not really thinking
about what I might hear.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.500
He got into this story of how
they moved southward, you know,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.073
on foot, sometimes on trucks.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.720
And on this one particular night,
that he focused on by a train.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.096
And if you think about it, it was
a car along many cars of train,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.350
you know, many train cars all
put together moving very slowly

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.196
through dark countryside.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.523
He was actually on top of the train

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:41.176
because there was no
room inside the trains.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.230
These are, you know, cargo
cars not resident, you know,

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.353
not passenger cars as we know them.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.296
So he and his family,
and particularly he

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.383
and his brother were
on top of this train.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.610
They kinda balanced on top
with lots of other refugees.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.726
It turns out, of course my
research that I found out,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.193
that this was often the case.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.410
And one night as they're
chandelling along at this low speed,

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.660
the train hit something
way up ahead, it lurched,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.360
and his younger brother
who was about eight

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.846
or nine years old fell
off in between the cars.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.296
And unfortunately,
his leg was amputated.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.696
And my father jumped out.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.296
And unfortunately, his
brother died of blood loss.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.083
It was an amazing story to hear.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.273
And my father really, you
know, probably devoted

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.030
about five sentences to it.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.563
You know, it's amazing to me to
think of my father, someone who'd,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.950
you know, he's-- my father is a
psychiatrist, very mild mannered

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.103
and someone who'd never, you
know, none of his actions

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.093
or things we talked about,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.340
the way he conducted his life
whatever portray that something

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.180
like this had happened to him,
which I taught was amazing.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.086
But of course, that
story stayed with me.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.976
And for many years, I
thought, you know, I--

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.996
that would maybe be
some kind of lynchpin

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.463
or something for a longer story.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.583
So, I started this particular
novel about five years ago,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.923
not writing about my
father but writing

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.950
about three other characters -

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.350
one character in particular a young
girl, a Korean girl named June,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.856
who at the start of this
book, begins a journey

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.530
as my father did with
her twin siblings.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.726
It's-- you know, again, as I
mentioned, my father only described,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.120
you know, just a few things
on that trip, so obviously,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.193
I had to reinvent everything
and elaborate

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.240
to a great extent everything
that happens in this book.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.806
And of course, as all books are, you
bended tales and you create things

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.780
for the purpose of the
book, not so much worrying

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.013
about what happens in real life.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:12.236
So, this is a book that in some ways
was galvanized by that experience.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.060
And that experience
was the spark of it.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.113
So, I'll just-- what I'd thought I'd
do is I'll just read the first page

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.760
or two about it just
to give you a sense

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.160
of how it sounds 'cause I
believed that prose should sound

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.513
like something that the
writer wants it to sound like,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:28.660
it's not just about storytelling,

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:30.780
it's not just about
showing you what's happen.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.313
And then I'd love to hear some,
you know, questions from you

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.100
about really anything you'd like.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:40.670
Korea, 1950.

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.176
The journey was nearly over.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.213
The night was unusually chilly,
the wind sharpened by the speed

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.450
of the train as it rolled southward
through the darkened valley.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.586
The cotton blanket June had stolen
was large enough to spread as a tarp

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.663
and at the same time wrap around
her younger brother and sister

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.776
and herself, but it was threadbare

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.516
and for brief stretches
the train would accelerate

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.513
and the wind would cut
right through to them.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.210
It had not been a problem the night
before but now they were riding

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.750
on top of the boxcar, as there was
no more room within any of them,

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.056
even as the train was more
than a dozen cars long.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:19.656
A massive phalanx of refugees had
met the train at the last station,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.270
and in the time it took her siblings
to relieve themselves by the side

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.243
of the tracks they had lost
their place and had had

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.710
to climb the rusted ladder between
the cars, June running alongside

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.273
for fifty meters until her brother
was high enough on the rungs

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.240
so she herself could jump up and on.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:41.650
There was a score or so
of people atop every car,

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.030
groupings of families and
neighbors, mostly women and the old

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.146
and the young, and then a
cluster or two like theirs,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.780
children traveling by themselves.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.023
June was eleven; Hee-Soo and
Ji-Young had just turned seven.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.923
They were fraternal twins, though
looked as much alike as a sister

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.123
and brother could, only the cut
of their hair distinguishing them.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.420
&gt;&gt; June knew they could have
waited in the hope of another train

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:09.420
with room inside but
it hadn't been cold

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.150
when they stopped just before
dusk and she decided they ought

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:15.076
to keep moving while
they had the chance.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:17.613
To keep moving was always safer
than lingering in one place,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.040
and there was nothing back
at the depot to eat, anyway.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.753
There were a few scruffy soldiers
drinking and playing cards

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.493
by the depot shack, though their
presence could only mean trouble,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.240
even for a girl her age.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.336
She was tall besides and she was
wary of soldiers and any stray men.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.516
They were some two hundred
kilometers south of Seoul,

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.063
past Chongju, and June
was now thinking

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:43.883
that they would make
their way down to Pusan,

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:46.076
where her uncle's family lived,

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:48.366
though she didn't know whether they
were still there, or even alive.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.640
The train sped up on a slight
decline and June curled her arm

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.400
around her siblings,
spooning them tightly.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.493
They lay as low as they
could between the ridges

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.053
of the steel roof of the boxcar.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.076
They were on the front
end of the car and as

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:05.486
such they were fully
buffeted by the rushing wind.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:08.666
They were fortunate
to have a blanket;

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.733
many others on top
of the cars did not.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:13.976
It was too early to sleep but
it was cold and it was better

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.403
for the twins not to be
active, especially given

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.790
that the two had shared only a
few crackers early in the day.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.366
June herself had eaten nothing.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.253
They had eaten well the day
before, as June had found,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.853
below a footbridge, a GI's
abandoned pack of canned rations,

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.673
a small bar of chocolate,
and a sleeve of crackers.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.066
Her brother and sister were
so hungry that they'd bolted

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:39.856
down the chocolate first as
June was smashing the cans open

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.890
against a rock.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.510
She'd cut her finger and gotten some
blood on the food but they ate it

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.003
without hesitation, two tins of
stewed beef and one of sardines

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.823
in tomato sauce, afterward each
taking a turn to lick the insides,

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.890
carefully, with the
deftness of cats.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.653
She made them save the crackers.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.606
They'd been by themselves on
the road since their mother

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:05.906
and older sister were killed two
weeks before, at first traveling

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.426
with some people from their
town but then blending

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.596
in with the endless stream of other
refugees moving southward along the

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.776
pushed-up roads and
embankments of the river valleys.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.520
At another time it might
have been a pretty journey,

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.026
the hills just turning the colors
of pumpkin and hay and pomegranate

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.103
and the skies depthless and clear,
but now everywhere one looked most

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.540
of the trees had been felled for
fuel and there was only a hazy,

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.253
oppressive brightness refracted
from the shorn hillsides.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.193
There were formerly cultivated
fields of potatoes and cabbages,

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.170
and then the terraces of rice
paddies, but all had been stripped

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.816
and then abandoned during
these first months of the war.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.203
I'll stop there thanks.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.170
[ Applause ]

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.036
&gt;&gt; As I said, the first
chapter then goes on

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.003
and we follow the lives
of the other characters.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.736
But enough about me and this book,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.580
I hope that someone of
you have a question.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.780
Sir?

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.446
&gt;&gt; Hi, could you please
talk a little bit

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.726
about your writing process
and your daily routines

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:20.250
when you're working on a manuscript?

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.683
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my writing process
is a very ordinary one.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.113
I really treat it like a job.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.146
You know, I have young girls, 9
and 13, and so, I mean, you know,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.220
I help get them together for school.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.553
I make breakfast.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:39.636
One of us will take them out to
the bus and then at about 8:30

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.003
or 8 o'clock or so I sit at
my desk and work 'till lunch.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.930
And lunch, as I said, with
someone else is very important.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:52.573
If I don't know that I'm
going to have a good lunch

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.913
or I don't know what's
gonna be there for lunch,

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.446
I have a lot of trouble
writing actually.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.526
[Laughter] So, I-- that's sort
of my, the beacon, you know,

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.603
it's pinging at the end
of that long morning.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:10.936
And then after lunch, you know, you
have a little bit of lunch coma.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:13.950
[ Laughter ]

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:15.123
&gt;&gt; So I rest a little bit, maybe
listen to some music, read,

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.776
and then work a couple of hours

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.220
until the girls come
home, and then it's over.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.133
But it's a, you know,
I'm a very slow writer.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.920
I don't know why that is, I wish
I could be like some other writers

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.790
who could just toss off a
thousand words in the morning or

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:41.110
and like them but I just can't do
that, so it's pretty painstaking.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.580
And I must say it's difficult
work, it's very difficult work.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.636
And I always distrust people

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.646
who say it's not difficult work
especially my students who say that.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.580
Yes?

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.113
&gt;&gt; I saw that you are
an English major.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.196
And with your story of your father,
I wonder if he approved of that.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.830
And when did you first know that
you wanted to be a writer as a way

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.066
of making your living, and
when did you started thinking

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.736
of yourself really as a writer?

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.013
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't-- it took me
a long time to think of really

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:22.323
to accept the fact that this
is really what I wanna do

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.323
for a living, you know.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.790
And obviously, I quit
my job because I thought

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:29.056
that I should give myself
a chance at doing so.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:32.170
But well before that in
high school, you know,

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.210
I had some great English teachers

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.676
and I always love books,
I always love reading.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.530
I hang out with the
library a lot as a kid.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.926
And you know, if you are someone
who's, you know, who loves to read,

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:50.913
at some point, I think you wonder,
well, could I give this experience

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.200
to someone else, you know, could
I crop this language and story,

00:15:59.290 --> 00:15:59.916
create these characters,
and you just wonder that.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.130
And you know I started
doing a little bit of that

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.096
in high school and
really enjoying it.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.436
But you know, part of my background,
because my folks are, you know,

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.936
we're all immigrants and we didn't
really have a safety net gear,

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.643
we didn't have any other relatives.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.413
And you know my parents sent me
into these nice expensive schools,

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.683
I never thought that it would
actually be something I did

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.030
for a living.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:28.363
And it, you know, it wasn't, you
know, my parents didn't come here

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.560
to have their son become
an artist or writer, right.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.556
It's honorable, but it obviously
it's not something that's bankable.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.043
So, I think it took me just a
long time to just abuse myself

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.726
for that notion that, you
know, that I could do this and

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.760
or that I could-- I should try

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.886
to honor what I really
did want to do, yeah.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.263
&gt;&gt; So, when did you actually really
think of yourself as a writer?

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.030
&gt;&gt; Probably after my
first novel is published.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.150
And then I thought, you know, and
regardless of what people thought

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.390
of it, I thought, you
know, I did absolutely--

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.333
I didn't enjoy the process

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:10.633
because as I said writing
is sometimes tortuous,

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.096
but I got a lot of, you know, that
sense of fulfillment out of that.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.770
Yeah.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.370
&gt;&gt; I was wondering, I'm an
International Studies major,

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.173
and a lot of times Korean-Americans
are referred to as a model minority,

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.463
and that they go to grade
schools like Yale and then--

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.763
&gt;&gt; It does for no good, though--

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.163
&gt;&gt; -- such as yourself.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:38.630
[ Laughter ]

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.040
&gt;&gt; And I was wondering about perhaps
maybe Korean nationals would look

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.353
at your life and feel
envious or seem--

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.193
I mean it seems like
you've time and articulate,

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:51.383
that you've had this
really ideal life.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.050
And I'm wondering how they
feel about you writing

00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:00.603
about this incredible suffering,
just like Korean national suffering.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.813
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know yet.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.506
The book has not appeared
in Korea yet, this book,

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.926
so I don't know yet how they feel.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:09.226
But you know, I think
it's a myth too.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:11.193
I mean I think a lot of
Korean-Americans and I know

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.206
that 'cause I get lots of
notices from philanthropic groups

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.026
about Korean-Americans were
struggling, and you know.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.743
So, I think that's a myth about
Korean-American's doing so well

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.456
and all of us doing so well.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.190
And then of course, you know,
it's, like anything else,

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.776
you know, everyone's different.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.110
And what seems well, like
that someone is doing well

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.710
in the outside might actually
not be, you know, so great, so.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.876
&gt;&gt; Nationals would be receptive to
an American telling their story--

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.086
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.556
Maybe. I don't know, I hope so.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.243
&gt;&gt; Anyong-haseyo.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.376
Would you compare or how would
you compare your fiction with that

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.526
of Richard Kim who wrote "The
Martyred" and "The Innocent"?

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.560
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, those
are wonderful novels.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.450
I think my fiction is perhaps more
interested in its own language more

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.343
than Mr. Kim's books were.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.086
He's the beauty of his
language, is a kind of spareness.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.713
And it's often a directness
that is kind of startling,

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.173
and I think that's what's
wonderful about his writing.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:40.313
I think my books, in this book maybe
less so than my previous three tend

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.753
to be a little conscious of
their own storytelling modes.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.910
So, I think they much more
are about their own language

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.930
and also just strictly
and discreetly that story.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.060
&gt;&gt; Hi. Can you tell me who
your favorite writers are

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.950
and how they may have helped
you find your own writing voice?

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.323
&gt;&gt; I have so many favorite writers.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:14.656
You know, I-- but when-- I suppose
I could mention a few when I was say

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.056
in 7th and 8th and 9th grade,
you know, when I was really--

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.150
and maybe there are
more particularly books

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:25.483
than anything else, and I mentioned
those a couple minutes ago.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.403
You know, James Joyce's collection,
the Dubliners I thought was

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.663
such a beautiful collection and
I didn't-- up until that point,

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.510
I hadn't had a real
sensitivity to language

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.293
in a prose fiction than I did then.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.593
Some of the Ernest Hemingway's
stories particularly some of his

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.226
in the collection "In Our Time",
the little vignettes of wartime,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:55.710
and I thought those are really
harrowing in, but you know,

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.793
they had a beautiful spark to them.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.986
So those are some writers that--
you know, I'd always been attracted

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:08.473
to writers that, you know,
when you're reading them

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.633
or you're reading a particular
work where you feel it's almost not

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:16.703
that you're not even holding
a book anymore, you know,

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:18.756
that something has-- something else
has happened that you have this,

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.316
you know, very corporal
bodily somatic experience.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.040
And all the intellectual
stuff is there.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.140
All the symbolic and
spiritual stuff is there.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.286
But ultimately, it's a physical
thing, because you know,

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:36.726
'cause it's an emotional thing.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.526
And those are certain moments
that, yeah, that I felt that.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.230
&gt;&gt; How are you?

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.230
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.763
&gt;&gt; You mentioned before you
worked with the writing on

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.296
and researching the comfort
women, and I used to live in Seoul

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.030
where I was involved in the
Reparations Movement on behalf

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.313
of the comfort women, and I think
it's really a powerful issue.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:55.933
And I was wondering if you
could speak to your role

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.263
in either researching or using
writing as a tool of empowerment

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.466
on behalf of women who
experienced sexual slavery.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.056
&gt;&gt; Well, I-- for that book,
that book novel is called

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:10.303
"A Gesture Life," and I did do
a lot of research for that book.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.370
And one of the great
moments of research

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.643
in my writing experience has been--

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.403
was going over to Seoul and
meeting with, I would say,

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:20.853
about a dozen of the women survivors
who were living in a house together

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.463
and the house was donated to
them by some Buddhist monks.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.430
&gt;&gt; The Nanometi [phonetic]?

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.896
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this was probably
1995 or so that I went over there,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.310
pretty early on in all
the hub all about it

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.583
after it was revealed
that this had happened.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.590
And it was a great day, you know.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:46.880
And those are some of the
moments that, you know,

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.676
where research really just comes
alive and is vital, you know,

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.316
and just sitting with these
women and seeing their faces

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.010
and seeing all their
differences, you know,

00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:59.970
that they were individuals.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:00.700
You know, they're not
just all victims, right?

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.040
And things were perpetrated on them,

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:06.283
but they had all this
different histories.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.563
And you know psychologies.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.670
And that was very instructive.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:14.910
You know, I had to remember
that I wasn't writing history.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.380
You know, I'm writing a novel,
which is entirely a different thing.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.296
And I think that's why
novels are important still.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.996
I hope. I mean, you know,
history is one thing,

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.920
and it's important to know.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.453
But a novel can give you
an intimate secret history

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.093
that maybe no one wants to look
at and that isn't always so patent

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.910
or black and white,
maybe isn't even all

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.263
that glorious, but it's very human.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:43.970


00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.030
&gt;&gt; Is it on?

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.423
How do you manage when you're
writing about war and children dying

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:51.903
and things that are very difficult.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.296
How do you manage everyday to go
back and forth between the world

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.143
that you're creating that's so sad
and tragic and then, I don't know,

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:00.646
taking your kids to soccer
practice or something like that.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.636
&gt;&gt; That's a good question, you
know, sometimes it was hard.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.393
You know, sometimes you need
something called Pinot noir.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.560
[ Laughter ]

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:14.630
[ Applause ]

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:17.690
&gt;&gt; Sometimes.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.756
But you know, it is kinda hard.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:22.650
This, you know, this book,
unlike my previous three,

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.183
I did have a little bit

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.350
of difficulty transitioning
back and forth.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.883
You know, I'd come
downstairs and my life with--

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:36.283
I was just sort of sit there, and
my wife would say, "What happened?"

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:37.940
I'll say, I don't know
what happened.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.073
I can't, you know, I just,
I don't know what happened.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.540
So--

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.006
&gt;&gt; Does it make it difficult
in the morning sometimes

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.206
to go back to that world?

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.006
&gt;&gt; Yeah, every morning, I
tell you, every morning is,

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.540
and I remember reading
this about John Updike,

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.740
he said that every morning
he looked at the paper

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.140
and make all these excuses
why he wouldn't go upstairs,

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:57.463
and I know exactly
that feeling, you know,

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:01.996
I read every word of the paper.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.160
[ Laughter ]

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:05.686
&gt;&gt; Because it, you know, 'cause
you know you're gonna like get

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.760
into stuff and that not just-- not
that it's just difficult or unhappy

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.493
or sad, but that you kinda have
to really work it, you know.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.320
It's so frustrating sometimes.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.840


00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.056
Thank you for your question.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:26.830
&gt;&gt; Do you feel like you've been
labeled as an Asian-American author

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:34.250
and all these restrict what
your subject matter will be

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.383
and what you can write about?

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.513
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't think it--
it doesn't restrict me.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.833
I think I hope one of things I
worry about is that, one, you know,

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.623
say one of you would see
my name on this book, say,

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:50.950
and just naturally think that's sort

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.216
of a foreign name,
and I don't, you know.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:55.996
Not that your races do anything, but
that you might just literally say,

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.303
you know what, it doesn't
speak to me in this certain,

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:01.593
I don't know way, and
that you might assume also

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.893
that it's really a book only for
Asian-Americans or Korean-Americans.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.940
And you know, that's something

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.073
that I absolutely don't--
wouldn't want to have.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.553
I mean I would want Korean-Americans
or Asian-Americans to look

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.006
at my work and really be moved
by it and think, yes, you know,

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:22.480
he's connected with something there.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.613
But if a non-Asian person, you know,
were to read my books and think,

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:29.683
you know, I want them to
have the same feelings.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.996
So it's more about reader
expectations than what limits.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.040
I'm not limited because, you
know, I mean that's why I write.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.600
I mean writing is about
liberty in the end.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.320
&gt;&gt; You know, I just want to
say I do feel bonded to you

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.533
by your name and by your ethnicity.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:47.870
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:50.910
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:52.573
&gt;&gt; I love to read books
about people who come

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.646
from different cultures
and countries.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.763
And I've read a great many
by Chinese-American writers

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:06.783
but there haven't been very
many of the Korean-Americans.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800
Except for--

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.666
&gt;&gt; Actually there have been.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:10.866
&gt;&gt; Well, that I'm not aware of.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.200
There may have been some
that are not as well known.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.733
So, I just wanted to say, I'm
very happy that you're writing

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:20.026
because I'm interested in learning
more about the Korean culture.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:24.540
There's also a new book out called
"The Calligrapher's Daughter"

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.766
by Eugenia Kim, and that gives
another picture of life growing

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.686
up in Korea that was
very interesting.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.480
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480
