Speaker 2:          00:01:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       These fucking social media people, have you ever like,

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       there's nothing, I don't know. I didn't know where to begin with this. If I see one more fucking fat, miserable loser was wearing a tee shirt that has some sort of self help, advice to me, like they've reached the Mecca of peace and happiness. It's just like, Ooh, is that fucking tee shirt for you? As is it for me? You know, I just saw this, this fucking miserable look in person sitting down in the airport, you know, tens and tens and tens of fucking pounds overweight eating shit food with a tee shirt that says love yourself. You know what I mean? And all of this fucking crap. Now will you pat people on the back because they're fucking up their lives, but they still feel good about, you know what? I like who I am. I'm not saying you shouldn't like who you are, but I mean, you gotta look at yourself in the mirror at some point. It just be like, dude, the fuck are we doing here?

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       not saying I'm perfect. I'm not a perfect person, right? But I'm not, you know, sitting around here like calling myself a hero, you know, based off of all my fucking shortcomings,

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       Hollywood puts pressure. [inaudible] is that Hollywood. Hollywood gives people what they want. All right? You fucking cons. So sick of everybody blaming this innocent town we hear in all he would happen to be some of the, the most, uh, dependable, loyal, honest human beings you ever get to, mate. Yeah. I couldn't even get through without laughing. Whatever. Fuck you this car. This time we'll give you whatever the fuck you. Bye. Okay. And you've been looking at fucking abs and big tits since the second they had moving pictures. So I didn't want to fucking hear it. These fucking assholes,

Speaker 3:          00:04:08       you know.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       Then I liked those other people, the fucking fat guys with the, uh, with the tough guy. Shit on this shirt, you know? Do I look like I give a shit? You know, that's no, no you don't. Yeah, I don't. I, I, I would believe that you don't give a shit about anything. All right. With you fucking fungus riddled toenails while wearing your little fucking flip flops. Oh my God. Do you ever see people that their toe nails, they look like fucking petrified wood and they're literally walking around just, you know, I guess living their best life but making you look at them. I swear to God, man. I saw somebody in airport recently that had a, these flip flops that also had like this toenail flap on it. Joe Is really excited about, I hear stomping feet. That can only mean one thing.

Speaker 3:          00:05:02       Oh, hey buddy, how you doing?

Speaker 1:          00:05:08       Daddy's in here making a fool of himself running in here. Come on. How big are you getting? Oh, come on. Come on buddy. Do what your mom says. Trust me. I've tried it the other way. It doesn't work. All right. The money morning podcast has been previously interrupted. Oh, somebody is tired. Fly By. Oh, you want to say hi? Let me give her a hug. Hang on, I'll get any pause. All right. I'm back. Crisis averted. The fuck was I talking about how great people are in Hollywood? How we are, you know, there's a couple of bad apples. I'm not going to lie to you if there's a few people out here, you know, I might be one of those people who knows, you know? Um, anyways, what was I talking about? Dog Gone It. Ah, Jesus Christ. They're just interrupted Christ and fucked up my whole flow.

Speaker 2:          00:06:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       I Dunno what I was talking. Who gives a shit, right? What do I pitch? Stop and go back and fucking try and listen to it. Um, anyways.

Speaker 2:          00:06:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:33       I have no idea what I was talking about. Let me plow ahead here. As I always do, I swear to God, this fucking house, I swear to God, this fucking house, if it's not one thing, it's another. Every time I get I get something fixed. Something else breaks. You know what I mean? This kid be what? Owning a house is like. I just, I had to bond out. There's gotta be some sort of fucking lemon law. I'm fucking, it's fucking believable. What are those people? They have a lawyer on retainer that just means a constantly getting in fucking trouble. So they're just constantly paying the fucking guy. I should have a plumber on retainer. I don't know what that means. What the fuck does that mean? It just sounds cool. I have a lawyer on retainer.

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       Oh my God. Oh my God. Give me an idea. What the Fuck my dad does

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       that has got I, I still cannot get over the fact that an adult said that to another adult. Do you have any idea what the fuck my dad does? You know, it's like, it's you like your there and the other guys there. You guys are facing off with each other and then the fucking other du grabs her by the throat, throws him down to the ground and then he stands up and all he has is, you're fucked. You're fucked. And I evidently, he walks away to go get his dad. The kids in his twenties, Dad, what's the matter? Is that 35 year old across the street picking on you again, Sean.

Speaker 2:          00:08:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       Um, anyways, I went down to a comic con all freckles who's done nothing but make fun of comic con, um, forever. I went down there on Thursday because, uh, Vince and all the guys at better call Saul were nice enough to ask me to mediate. Is that the word? Basically host the panel, the better call Saul, uh, to promote their season premiere August 6th on AMC, um, season four premiere. And uh, and after that, the 10 year, um, breaking bad reunion 10 years since their first episode debuted, I would think 2008. And, uh, I went down there and there was all these people dressed like superheroes. Most people are not dressed up, but there's enough people that dressed up that it was cool. And I went down there and I gotta tell you I've really liked those fucking nerds man. They were really cool people. I only teased him one time cause I was saying something that was a spoiler and I was like, hey spoiler alerts, everybody saw it last season of better call Saul.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       You saw what happened in the last episode and this dude down front was like, yeah, I didn't see it. And I was like, all right, well a stick a couple of light safers in your ear because I have to fucking read this show. Something like that. And everybody left. Everybody had a good time with it. I wasn't sure if you know the self sabotage NB wanted to walk out and open with I, you doin you fucking nerds. But I just didn't want to bring them back to high school. I figured I was in their Dojo. I'm going to be polite. You know what I mean, is fun as it is to do what that fucking guy on Fox News did that one time when he went on that show with Barbara Walters, you know, remember that half the fucking crew of them walked off the stage. I can't remember anybody's fucking names anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:10:03       Anyways, I was down there and I had a great time and I flew a with my instructor down there and an our 44. It's the first time I've flown. I hadn't flown since the end of May, you know, it was overseas, uh, you know, doing gigs and celebrating my birthday probably far too long, admittedly. And then the last week of June, I, you know, at the beginning of July had to get caught up with all the work that I lost. I missed, I mean, sorry. And uh, I flew and a, I did all right man, you know, little rusty at first and then all fucking came back and I had my best f landing.

Speaker 2:          00:10:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:39       I've ever had as far as uh, you know, not having to look at my instruments too much and just feeling, just failing it, being common. One with the fucking machine man, uh, was getting dark out and we came back to Burbank and we will listen to the 80s, which is just the information that's updated every hour for the airport. You have to listen to it and some computer voice, you know, we're in Scarborough tow driver, a girl, your wire up information night gave, okay, so then you get on with Burbank Tower, like Burbank Tower, helicopter, Blah Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah. [inaudible] Elica at fucking Hollywood reservoir, a requested full stop at Atlantic with information Yankee. So they know you got the latest information. Then they tell you what to do. A, there was a bunch of traffic coming in. So they told us to hold over old Maca, which is his fucking hunk of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       Macy's off the one seventies that they're finally redoing and he just fucking orbit over there to all the big boys go in and then they say, you know, helicopter Blah Blah, blah, cleared for landing runway eight west of Delta eight so that you just say all that shit back. So I said all that shit back. I come in, they got the uh, the fucking whatever they would call, you know, those, those fucking, the power lines there. She that chop your head off. I flew over the tower like you're supposed to, not over the wires. And then I was coming in at the right speed because it was a jet behind me. Um, but I was a little too high, so I just banked it really hard using my gs to make the fucking helicopter heavier. Don't ask me how physics. Right. And then it fucking came down.

Speaker 1:          00:12:13       I was going to come down to like 600 feet permitted, which as long as I'm moving forward is fine. But as I slowed down, I got it down to 300 commercial fucking landing right in the fucking glidepath right in the numbers and fucking banged a left on delta. 8:00 AM I instructor goes, that's the best lesson that you've ever done. The of becoming one with the helicopter. And I turned around and my wife's in the back end. Her headphones weren't working and she didn't hear it. And you know what? I hate to say it. So it was like, it never happened. And it was literally sitting there like a five year old talking to my mom going, dia, did you hear that? Did you? And she was like, wow, you know, there's a part of me that actually thinks she did here, you know, but to keep me in fucking line to keep me, keep chasing the fucking carrot. She acted like she didn't hear it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       So anyways, um, moving along, I want to thank everybody on uh, uh, the casts of breaking bad and better call Saul for doing the heavy lifting and telling the stories and all that. I mean I was having like a, you know, nightmares about hosting that and meet turning into the real version of Chris Farley, you know, that that character, he would do a Paul Mccartney, remember you and John Lennon you guys wrote to the white album? Uh, yes Chris. Yes, I do. Yeah, that was awesome. Like I was worried that I was going to be doing that. I'm not going to say there wasn't a couple moments of that, but, uh, you know, the whole time I was up there I was like, why didn't they get Jimmy Kimmel to do this? That was my first fucking thought. Cause I remember he did. Um, he did the, uh, when they had the final episode and in La they did this thing at the Hollywood forever cemetery and they showed the, uh, the final episode.

Speaker 1:          00:14:08       You could sit outside and fucking with all these other breaking bad fans. It was really a fucking awesome night. And Kimmel hosted it and he did a great job. So I imagine the reason why he didn't do it was because he had to host his own show and uh, yeah, that makes sense. Right. He had the host is talk show tapes at five and that was going to be from three to five 30 down in San Diego. Oh, there we go. Hey you go. That's why all freckles got called up from the mind, uh, for a cup of coffee, speaking a cut and called up from the minors and a cup of coffee and all that. I'm back into watching the Red Sox, uh, Bradley's paying attention, man. I'd started with me trying, like using, listening to baseball as a way to not flip out and traffic and um, you know, and just settling in to just not, I just stopped fighting the city just like, yeah, man, this is going to be a lot of traffic.

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       There's going to be a lot of people doing things that I'm not going to like and I just need to just, I'm just gonna sit there and watch it happen and just sort of inch along as I listened to five innings of a baseball game and go maybe three quarters of a mile. That's what I'm going to do. And that's what I've been doing. And I just listened to the red sox games and, um, the Red Sox, I'll tell you too, they're on fire. I was worried that the all star break was going to slow them down. Date one 10 out of 11. Um, I'm sorry, they won 11 out of that 10 11. They won 11 out of 12. That's right, because he went 10 and all than they lost one and then they won a ripple for the all star game. I know. I sound like the fucking Raymond.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       And then we just took two or three from the Tigers. So we went 13 out of the last 15. Uh, and the Yankees just keep winning too. Um, but I gotta tell you, I watched a little bit of the Astros who have been watching those guys. I still think they're the team to be. Um, they had Verlander, they got a great picture of staff and they, they got the bats, they get the whole fucking thing and they want it last year and nobody's really talking about and everybody's all excited for fucking Yankees, red sox and uh, this is what I think. All right. Yankees bullpens, socks that's going to come back and bite him in the ass. And, uh, Chris sale is our guy and

Speaker 1:          00:16:35       you know, as much as I love David Price, you know, he had a really rough outing against the Yankees in New York and a him cursing out Dennis Eckersley. I Dunno, I don't know that that guy was like, oh, that's a hall of fame a man. You don't curse out a fucking hall of Famer. So I'm worried that that guy is a little, uh, you know, what, are you a little shaky between the, uh, the, is there little Odell Beckham there? Right. You know, I dunno. I hope he is because if he isn't, we got to beast. He is a beast. But I'm just worried that when he went down in New York and all those people had buy a fucking kind of imploded rather than being like, I'm going to ruin that fat mantated singing fucking jackass, Yankee Fan, they still do that roll call thing. It's like Jesus Christ. I always feel like a musical is going to break out after that. Um, yeah, they do have a lot of that and then they do the Ymca thing. I mean it's just, you know, and every time you think that's the worst thing than sing sweet Caroline. It's just, I don't know what has happened to both of those franchises.

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       It's so weird how so much shit just got nicer. But people are so much meaner in a way.

Speaker 2:          00:18:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       You know? Thank you. Go to New York City, like fucking Yankee store. I went to a game in 1983 there, the whole family went down there and it was like taking your fucking Louise would day game and as you got to New York, there was literally cars just burned out on the side of the fucking highway. And I don't mean in the middle of nowhere on some side road on the side of the highway, like burn to the fucking ground. I remember that was one of the things when Giuliani got an office, so it was one of the first things he did was he got those things off of the highway. It was such a bad fucking look for New York or maybe it was a good look because it was warning terror, terrorists, tourists about what they were about to experience. But um, I don't know. Everybody was getting Giuliani credit. Who is the head, the chief of police there that he fired along the way so he'd get all the credit. Oh, Bill, do you always have to be a con? Yeah, I do. Julie. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:19:04       the fees

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       chief of Foley's fired. Let's see who this guys come on. Come on. Slow Internet A's bill as the slowest Internet in Los Angeles.

Speaker 4:          00:19:20       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       It's still fucking gone. Um, and now man, I like, I don't even know. I don't even know like a sporting event. They used to always be like an element of, hey, keep your head on a fucking swivel in Jesus Christ. You have no idea where you're going to see that people acted like fucking animals. There was fights in the stands and all that type of shit. I'm not saying obviously that I wanted to go back to that, but somewhere along the line like it just became like, it's like, it's just weird. It's like you go into a Chucky cheese, um, it's still loading by the way. Still loading. That's probably cause I typed in Giuliani and something negative that, that's my guess. I'm going to go with the whole conspiracy theory here. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       yeah. Anyways, I don't know. He go to sporting events now. It's like every time there's a stoppage of play, then something happens up on the fucking flat screen. Everybody just stares at it with their mouth hanging open. And I really think that that's like this thing. So people like don't fight and behave themselves. You know, you know, you get that camera on your flat screen TV and all those fucking nerds at the best buy sit there watching you jerking off to the fucking Charlie's angels on me TV, whatever you're doing. Right. But you know, in between those times when they're waiting for you to fuck your wife or whatever those fucking nerd perverts I doing down there that for some reason is not fucking forced.

Speaker 3:          00:20:49       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:20:51       You got all this fucking me too shit happening. And meanwhile these fucking nerds are watching you in your living room. It's, I'm not making this shit up. Like they'd gotten busted doing it. I don't know why they admitted to it. They were like, are you doing that? They're like, oh, you know, we're not going to say we're not.

Speaker 3:          00:21:12       Um, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:21:16       Anyways. Yeah, they just sit there fucking, I mean, if you're gonna, if you're gonna go after the, the perfect. Okay. Giuliani renews ties with police chief. He ousted in 1995 William Jay Brandon left the New York City, New York City police commissioner with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the two men. Yeah, that's the guy. From what I've heard, I granted this might've been people that hated Giuliani, which God knows a lot of people do.

Speaker 3:          00:21:49       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       This might be bullshit, but I don't know what it was. This coming from. This is the New York Times. All right, so they hate Giuliani. Alright. The two men, Rudolph Giuliani and his former Police Commissioner, William j Bratton had not spoken to each other in 10 years. This is from 10 years ago. This was written when they had crossed paths, a social GAM. They exchanged a little more than I see nods, but time, tragedy and presidential campaign has started to change all of that.

Speaker 3:          00:22:16       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       all right. I don't even what the fuck it is. I think that was the guy that really turned it around. That started on the road where it's now like, it's weird. It's like, uh, my father in law seven came down and you standing in Brooklyn because gee, wow, this is like a, it's like a theme park. You know, it's like people ride bicycles along the river and all the steps. It's sort of like a, uh, it's sort of like if you have money, it's become this utopia.

Speaker 3:          00:22:50       There's something, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       When does the pendulum swing back? That's what I want to know. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       Because I imagine in the 70s when New York almost went bankrupt, there was a bunch of old people. When this place was, was your dream or add,

Speaker 3:          00:23:11       what was that? Grandma. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       Back when whites were only allowed to play baseball back when hippo was walking the earth.

Speaker 3:          00:23:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       Well, I suppose yo change weren't right, but uh, you're a good wave. Your door unlocked. Um, that is the thing, man. Anytime you say good old days, there's always some fucked up shit going on, right? I don't, yeah. Built, yeah. That, that really wasn't anything deep. I didn't say it was.

Speaker 3:          00:23:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:44       All right. So I've been doing lately a Speyside, not boozing. I'll tell you right now, all fucking, uh, oh freckles here. I haven't drank all this month. It's been great, man. It's really been great. I'm still fucking tired though, having a kid, you still tired? But, um, um, but like I remember one day waking up when I was on the road anticipating a hangover and not having one and I was like, wow, that's pretty awesome. You know, I'm trying to eat well, thinking of talking to a nutritionist, you know what I'm saying? I got to get the answers to the test here rather than listen to fucking, it'd be Tom, Dick and Harry. You know, Dean del Ray knows what the fuck he's talking about, but I'm getting bored with the Diet. I got to add on this shit and uh, want to add some vegan meals, you know, you know, not because I want to go Vegan, just because I know if you eat them then you know, your stomach is flatter.

Speaker 1:          00:24:47       Just give my body a break from, you know, the ballgame, you know, skirt steaks and all of that shit. You know. Um, I saw this thing the other day. I said, he just, you don't even know who the fuck the belief. Like one of the things, you know, when you look at Vegetarians and you look at Vegan people, uh, you know, there's an astounding level of fleshy fat people that don't eat meat, you know what I mean? And they'll eat French fries because it's made from potatoes and they're a vegetarian, but it's fried and they'll say, you know, potatoes on Good Friday. Anyways, I far as I know, I'm actually even say that. And I don't want to be all opera here and get people to stop eating potatoes and then the whole fucking potato farm farming industry sues me here at the Monday morning podcast. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:25:33       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:34       but there's just a lot, you know, like fucking, just all carbohydrates and shit and they just stay away from me. Uh, I think a lot of people love animals, but they hate reading is what I've sort of learned from looking at Vegetarians and Vegan people, you know, so they don't eat meat, but then they don't really know what the fuck it is they're doing. But the people that do take the time to do it, right? Like nobody who lived in this house for a hundred fucking years. Evidentaly took the time to do something. Right. Do it. Fuck it, friend. To face it, didn't it?

Speaker 5:          00:26:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       Fuck it in a permit. Fuck it. Somebody licensed. Fuck all of that. What did they do? They just fucking lived here. They had a problem. They asked a friend. And I think a lot of vegans and vegetarians do that. They fucking talk to people rather than reading. And that's what I do because it's easier. It's easier than sitting down and actually doing the fucking work. So, you know, I see that, you know, like can anybody, it's Gundy your fucking head. Can anybody tell you whether having an egg is good for you? A bad. At this point,

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       eggs had been good, bad, good. And now they're starting to be bad again. While people who are saying they're good or fucking, you know that Duke, and it is like the rubber match, the rubber game, whatever the fuck it's called. Right? Um, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna talk to a nutritionist and I'm gonna, I'm gonna, you know, try to read up on it, but it's, it's really dry. And if you actually look up shit on becoming a vegetarian or, or, or eating a little like that, like a Vegan or something, it's just Hatfields and McCoys McCoy. It's between the fucking meat eaters to carnivores and the vegetarian people. And there's a lot of money at stake, no pun intended. Sorry about that. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:27:37       so I, I think like the big farming cattle, fucking people, you know, they're trying to have all this shit come up first and then all the hit the tree hugging like, hey man, like, you know, trees are alive, man. Those fucking people are trying to say that, you know, eating meat is, is like, like I saw this thing right where they were saying that this guy was trying to say that like animals get protein from eating plants and when you eat an animal it's an indirect protein because she should've just gone directly to the plant and it's like both then explain tigers and they're fucking, you know, Mister Universe physiques as far as I know, which is, I don't know shit. So I should shut up right now in Google. What a tigers eat. What do tigers eat?

Speaker 2:          00:28:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:39       Meet only one of, they're always in a bad mood. I can't even take a shit Siberian. The species died. Ordinary consists about 50% wild boar meat. Doesn't that sound delicious? If they cannot get their paws on some wild boar, they've been known to eat elk, deer in the legs. They're like, wait, what did we fuck with me? For me? I didn't do nothing. And sometimes even bears, oh my God, what size? Jesus Christ. That's a big thing in Asia, Huh? Putting like a bear in a tiger in a fucking cage. And just filming it. If large sources of meat are not readily available, Siberian tigers will eat rabbits, fish and any rodents they can get to.

Speaker 2:          00:29:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       Let's see. Okay, well there's no meat in that do to, and that's the first thing I saw. Do Tigers eat plants?

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       What do tigers eat? Siberia and the species side consists of still this, uh, tiger's diet, eating tigers eat a variety of prey ranging in size from termites to elephant calves. All that would break my heart to see a baby elephant get killed. However, an integral component of the Diet, Laura, are large body pray weighing 45 pounds or larger, such as Moose d. What did we fucking me Moose and bear? Where the fuck are those things? I thought they would feel that most were only over here. Deer species, pigs, cows, horses, buffaloes and goats. Yeah. Well they have a different digestive system of evidently, cause if you just fucking eat that, that space, they're basically on the Atkins Diet, right? Yeah. He's much fucking back in as you want tigers looking at you like, yeah. I realized that. I realized that. Um, too. Anyways, I'm going to try to fucking, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:30:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:47       I Dunno, I'm gonna talk to a nutritionist. Somebody read all this shit that I'm supposed to read and maybe try to get them to tell me some bow pill. And you really going to buy books on nutrition like you're gonna fucking read them today. A lot of pictures. Um, anyways, I should probably read some advertising. I don't feel like fucking doing that. Hey, I'm almost like halfway through this season, six of a 77 sunset strip. Um, and evidently see, I, as I said, season six, you gotta watch it. It's on a 4:00 AM on BTBY. Just take the fucking thing. I want to get more people to watch it because I'm worried because I found out that they started broadcasting all the episodes back in November and I missed the first five seasons and we're getting towards the end here of season six because they didn't do a full season. They got canceled like three quarters of the way through. Um, and I'd like to see the original ones because I'd like to see what La look back then. You know, hopefully they do some exterior's, although I know most of it was formed on the backlot filmed on the backlog in Warner brothers. Um, but, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:32:00       I'm loving this season so I'm worried that the other one's going to be a little hokey cause I guess a lot of people didn't like seasoned six. First of all, they fired the whole fucking cast as I butchered. Sorry. Um, but I also didn't realize that they made Efram Zimbalist juniors character a lot more surly and uh, but I'm loving them. So now I'm worried that I saw the season six first. And if I go back and look at the others, I'm not going to like the show the same with the other people cause I get you just get used to how the guy behaves, you know. But some of the lines, man, some of the shit that people say on there, here's some mix in like, you know, women are, are, are uh, are talking about how behave around them. You know, like in some of the shit that they say, it's like Jesus Christ. I mean, I'm sure that guy's out there, but what the fuck, you know, sunset season six of psalm 77 sunset strip. They sounds like what some of these women and describing is some of the shit I heard them say guys saying to women on that show pipe down, shut up.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       Not to mention after f from tries to bang his fucking secretary tried to look up or dress one ups. I'm just sitting like this guy would get me to and so fucking fast and have his full head of hair spinning. Right. And then my favorite one ever favorite one ever is that mentioned on another podcast is when east sat down in um, this episode with the actor that ended up playing the professor or Gilligan's island. Sorry, I'm talking through yards right now. The accident played the professor on Gilligan's island and the guy was three drinks in and, and Av firms meeting him. It's the middle of the day and the guy orders his fourth drink and a afro goes, you've got a pretty active available for lunchtime. You on the sauce. That is the one thing also that I love about that show. It makes you feel better about drinking and smoking cause uh, that from Zimbalist almost made 90.

Speaker 2:          00:34:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       And there's barely a scene. He's not smoking a cigarette and he's really smoking it too. And that's just on the tape that they use. So who knows? I'm all right with that. Should I read a little bit of advertising? Yeah. Why don't I do that 77 sunset strip. Um, oh Jesus. Here we go. There's somebody new mint, mobile, mobile [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:42:25       Uh, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       one of the best drummers I've ever seen to be honest with you. And I had no idea that he could sing and play guitar, but he did a cover of Richie, uh, um, I got him saber. Is it Richie havens? Let me make sure I have this right. Uh, fuck yeah, let me yes, I was correct. Richie havens does a song called freedom and um, he did a cover version of that that then goes into something else that is fucking incredible. Uh, I tweeted out the video and we'll have a link to it on the MM podcast. Um, Jesus Christ. Do you know, I like watching how talented that guy is. I don't even know what the fuck I'm even doing in this businessman. Incredible, incredible monster talent. Uh, check it out. And I already, as a solo album coming up, people were alluding to it.

Um, all right, let's check out some, uh, am I going to read some stories? I know. You know what I'm actually going to do. I actually came across this foot. Could think it says news is bad for you. Okay. This is from something the guardian.com says news is bad for you and giving up reading it will make you happier. All right, now I'll tell you right now, I didn't need this fucking article to tell me this. I just realized that I figured it out after I went down a rabbit hole of fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:43:57       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       you know, conspiracy theory, you guys remember that? People listen to the podcast 10 years ago. I mean, I was fucking, I was, yeah, I was missed, you know, chem trail guy, you know, I was that guy saying you got to shut down the Federal Reserve and I had no solution to do like what would what you would do after that, you know, I'm sure people that are well read on it had the solution, but I didn't. So I was just walking around freaking people out. I was a cunt basically. Um, so anyways, it says news is bad for your health. So I just stopped watching the shit.

Speaker 3:          00:44:27       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       I'm just banking on the, that there's going to be some smart people with a good heart that, that, uh, that are gonna lead us out of this fucking mess because I don't have any solutions. All right. I go on stage, I jump around like a monkey and I make you laugh. Okay. That's my lane. And it's a rock used to say no. Your role in shut your mouth. So I'm staying over there. I tried to watch the news. I try, I can't, you know, it's the weirdest thing going from Obama to Trump going from Obama where all they did was lick his balls for eight years and then they go to Trump and it's just like, all they do is shit on the guy in the entire fucking time. And they're both kind of doing, you know what? The foreign policy, the same fucking shit, although I don't, Trump is like a fucking lunatic.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       You know what I mean? I, you know, I heard, I was on the Howard stern show and he went on this fucking rant about Russia. It was just not talking about the fucking people just talking about, you know, uh, of laddy daddy over there. He goes, I'm sick of people fucking talking about Russia. You know, like, like they, they're not that bad. He's like, did they fucking, you know, they kill gay people. They kill reporters just for having a difference of opinion in the, and he's right. He's fucking right. Um, I dunno, I once that his, his, his fucking wife wore that coat when he was going to go visit those kids, that, that she was going to go visit those kids that they had stuck in cages and she wore a jacket that said, I don't really care to you and then try it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       Oh. Then had to do with fake news. It's just like, it's literally like listening to a toddler that ally and I, God bless you, if you can still watch that and try and stay politically active because, I don't know, it's just too fucking depressing. I can't fucking deal with it. So I choose not to watch. And the last presidency, you know, I just, I just, it was, I, I couldn't fucking, you know, I had hope and then I was just like, oh, this is going to be more of the saying, oh, bankers don't go to jail. Oh yeah. If, yeah. Insurance companies could do whatever they, whatever they fucking want. And uh, yeah. We're not going to constructively criticize our foreign policy and we're just going to stay the fucking course and shut down the government every fucking August for a week. And our solution is always going to be the say, well, what if we raise the debt? Right? You know? And then meanwhile, everything that his wife did was just considered like angelic. And it's just, it was the whole fucking thing was annoying.

Speaker 1:          00:47:10       That was like when he was in office was like watching a fucking award show. Everybody's just walking around, blowing each other, talking about how fucking brilliant they are. And then this, we went from an awards show to a fucking train wreck. I honestly don't know how people have the stomach to pay attention. Like you're, you're a whole other level tough mentally than I am. So anyways, here's, here's this whole fucking article here says, news is bad for you and giving up reading it will make you happier. All in the past few decades, the fortune fortunate among us have recognized the hazards of living with an over abundance of food, parentheses, obesity, and diabetes. And having started to change and have started to change your dies, but most of us do not yet understand that news is to the mind what sugar is to the body. News is easy to digest.

Speaker 1:          00:48:00       The media feeds a small bites of trivial matter tidbits that don't really concern our lives and don't require thinking. That's why we experience almost no saturation. Unlike reading a book or a long magazine, articles which require thinking, we can swallow limitless quantities of news flashes, which are bright colored candies for the mind. Today, we have reached the same point in relation to the information that we faced 20 years ago in regard to food. We're beginning to recognize how toxic news can be. I agree with all of this, but everybody can't stop paying attention or else, you know, somebody has to pay attention, right? Somebody's gotta be like, you need, you can't put it on cruise control. So I don't know if I hundred percent agree with this, I just know I'm not going to be the Gandy that leads us out of this. You don't? So as long as I know that.

Speaker 6:          00:48:51       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:51       I mean I will, abuse can be content. The listen to Howard in the morning and then I listened to fucking baseball at night. That's what the fuck I do. I don't pretend to know things. All right. News misleads all my God. What? Take the falling event. A car drives over a bridge and the bridge collapses. What does, what does a news media focus on the car, the person in the car where he came from, where you plan to go, how he was he transitioning? How did, he didn't say that. How we experienced the crash parentheses if he survived. But that is all irrelevant. What's relevant? The structural stability of the bridge. That's the underlying risks that has been Larkey and could lurk and other bridges. All they get to that after they go painstakingly through the horror of the end of that man's life or life altering injuries and then they get to his family and they're all crying and all of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:48       Um, you know, as much as a moron, as as I am, I always turn that shit off. You know, like out here, we had a hostage situation. At a trader Joe's and um, the people I was with were just watching it and watching, watching. It's like, like just out of curiosity, what are you going to do with this guy just runs out in such shooting people in the fucking head. Like, you want to watch this? These people in the store are fucking terrified. This is the worst fucking moment of their life. All right? The news eventually is going to tell you what happened and they're going to give you an edited version so you don't have to see people's brains getting blown out, you know, and why, you know, they live, he had like the were crying and all that shit. And then I found on the end, you know, some poor woman died was, it was fucking terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:50:33       The one, I'm just going to sit at home watching it for hours, ordering food, you know, going online. Are they tweeting from there or what's going on? Then all these fucking assholes on Youtube, not youtube on Twitter or these social media if are going to go on and say the obvious, oh my God, this is so bad. I'm like freaking out right now. I love that. Oh, is that what you're doing? Are you freaking out of the safety, your own home? Why don't you make this about yourself? Your Fuck God. Jesus. Social Media, I bet is people's, a lot of shit that says that's depressing too. But you know what? Podcasts actually feed the soul. I believe I'm part of the problem. News misleads bill Burmis leads. Uh, anyways, plowing ahead. We are not rational enough to be exposed to the press and see this guy same.

Speaker 1:          00:51:23       We're all dumb. Watching an airplane crash on television is going to change your attitude toward that risk regardless of its real probability. If you think you can compensate with the strength of your own inner con contemplation, you are wrong. I think the subtext of this is you dumb fuck bankers in economists who have powerful incentives to compensate for news born hazards have shown that they can not the only solution cut yourself off from the news consumption entirely. News is irrelevant of the approximately 10,000 news stories you have read in the last 12 months. Name one that because you consumed it allowed you to make a better decision about the serious matter affecting your life, your career and your business. Well, I would say anything about the environment.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       You know Jesus gas guys chip off the old block here. Paint with a broad brush. The point is the consumption of news is irrelevant to you, but people find it very difficult to recognize what's relevant. It's much easier to recognize what's new. All right. I think we get the point here. News has no explanatory power news items or bubbles popping on the surface of a deeper world who that's deep. That's something got fucking progressive rock band like a line in the song. Um, in 74 I imagine will accumulate facts that help you understand the world. Sadly no, the relationship is inverted. The important stories are non stories. I would agree with that slow, powerful movement that develop a load journalists radar but have a transforming effect. The more news factoids you digest, the less of the big picture you will understand. Maybe this way everybody's showing each other news is toxic to your body.

Speaker 1:          00:53:09       This is, I'll just read the headlines here. News increases cognitive errors. News inhibits thinking. News works like a drug. News waste time and news makes us passive. Well, that worked with me. News kills creativity. Uh, well there you go. Jesus Christ. That's pretty negative, Huh? Let's get to some positive shit. I gotta I gotta fucking note from a possible visit to dove, Ron, Vic Bravo Rove. Nick though, Bro, Croatia, my friend. Uh, while you're checking where the hell I'm contacting you from, uh, let me jump you with invitation. Invitation to my country. Slash. City. I run brewery and we are in debt at the moment. So don't expect this is money. Interesting invitation. This is opportunity for you to check out crazy side of Buckland's and getting hours and hours of future material. By the way, you're funny. Well, thank you sir. Uh, that read like a fucking ransom note from eastern Europe and I would be lying to you if I wasn't a little afraid to go to your bar.

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       I need a couple of those in there. You know, while you're checking where, oh, he got the hell. I'm contacting you from letting me jump in with an invitation that be jumping with invitation. Uh, you, you fucking talk like Ivan Drago. Um, listen buddy, I'm going to try to get as close to done Bruv nick as I possibly can. I wish you bar was making more money. Uh, and I'd love to go in there and help you out with your fucking monthly rent. Buy Booze and my face off. But I don't, I can tell you I don't think I'm gonna make it there. Uh, eastern European tour. Jesus Christ. If this is all I'm getting, this is all east eastern Europe where Eastern European tour, dear Billy Bald Burger. Oh, come on now. That was feeling I was feeling good about myself. Uh, I'm a huge fan of your comedy and F is for family is my favorite thing on next flicks.

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       Well, thank you very much. Therefore, I am very excited that you were thinking of visiting Prague, Czech Republic comedy scene in Prague is pretty much nonexistent. Oh, Gigi. So I'm sure you would kill with your knock, knock jokes. Um, if you are interested, pint of beer cost between one to $2 and it's delicious. You also have to try traditional alcohol drink slip Bovis it's made from distilled plums and has about 51% of alcohol. Okay, I'm in. You can visit the Czech hockey hall of fame or you could go to cr mayor or play some second division hockey. Oh, that would be cool as shit. I'm probably only gonna be there for a night. I think this is going to be a a bunch of one nighters here. A while back, you mentioned you saw the movie anthropoid about a checklist of Akian paratroopers assassinating high ranking German Nazi official.

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       I loved that movie. The movie ends with the final shootout in the church. You can actually go to the crips of the church and see the bullet holes from the injury incident. I'm fucking doing that. I hope you decide to come and share your Moroccan wisdom with us savages. Thanks. And Go make love to your lovely wife. Oh, thank you. Bless you. Go Fuck your wife. You fucking ready it. Prick Eastern European. Tori. Hey Bill. I've just wanted to say that I know a lot of people waiting for you to come to Poland. Oh Great. I guess your agents already figured out that Warsaw's seems the most logical place to do your show as it's the biggest city in the capitol. It's located somewhat in the middle of the country, so most of the people from outside boards, so like me, will be able to come and see you live.

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       I'm 100% sure you'll sell out all of the tickets. Plus Warsaw is a great place to visit because of its history and of course all the cool stuff going on there. I guess people from the states think you'll see white bears and trams and horse drawn carts in the street, but that's not the case. I didn't think that. I just thought I'd see four people trying to screw in a light bulb. Sorry. Just like everywhere else. We've got hipsters in Starbucks, moderately fat, lazy fucks in shopping malls and generally people wasting their lives on social media. Yeah, yeah. That's, that's a reoccurring thing. Anyway, my friends and I can't wait for your show. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Yeah. Everybody's staring at their phones is a big thing and I do that all the time. Uh, persistent colds. You may have walking pneumonia, go see a doctor when you get back to la. I need a doctor. Some soft tires and Nazi symbolism. I love this guy. This guy's just, he's just doing the whole gamut, isn't he? Um, running the gamut. Hey, let's look that up. Let's see what the fuck that means. How does that expression come about? All right. Run the gamut. Origin meaning the entire range. The word Gamet traces its origins to the Middle Ages in a system for designating musical notes around the turn of the second millennium.

Speaker 1:          00:58:10       But fuck you mean the second millennium? I thought this was the second millennium. 2000, right? Isn't a millennium a thousand years. I'm an evil monk. Developed a system. Jesus fill I, you know, just gets to the point like, I try to be informed. Thank you. The second you going to bring up a fucking monk around the turn of the second millennium, Guido of our, our Xo. A medieval monk.

Speaker 5:          00:58:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       Developed a system of Psalm Ization. I designating musical notes by syllable names. While today we are familiar with the Sung syllables do re Mi fa. So La ti back in Guido's time, he died in 10 50. They had a hex tonic scales six note and he used the symbol earth re me fa, Sol and La and the represented the lowest note. Oh, it's be far. So at La and uh, I can't, I can't, that's why I drums and tell jokes. Uh, ut what represents the lowest tone recognized in music theory at that time. The second g below middle c. What the fuck? I don't give a fuck about Wayne. So what is the gamut? The range of notes. Okay. Building on this denotation detonation, I dunno. Gamut eventually came to mean the whole musical scale. Oh, so you're running the whole fucking scale. Okay. Jesus Christ. Alright. Hey Belton soft tires and Nazi symbolism by the way. Hey Bill, I think I can answer both of your questions from Thursdays podcast. I'm in law school and a motor sport fanatic. So the questions, these questions are right in my wheelhouse.

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       All right. [inaudible] you were in law school. What, so you know about Nazi symbolism? Do you prosecute hate crimes? I hope a number one. Why the soft tires in Moto GP? Uh, principally you, you're right. I know the tires to grade towards the end of the race. So it makes sense to use harder ones to get consistent performance. Especially now that's slightly sliding. The bike is the quickest way around the track. How the fuck you learn how to do that is crazy. I mean, I've seen people do that in cars, you know, drifting. But you know, you're on four wheels. Like the level of balancing scale though, be ability become one with the Macheda judge on their all with a work of art and Germany. Lorenzo used a soft front tire while Marcus took the hard one. Uh, for the rears. Lorenzo was on a medium tire in Marquez on the soft.

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       Marcus is a special driver and tends to get a better feeling for the bike with the hard tire. Um, the sidewalls, some simply don't wobble around too much. Lorenzo's bet was to use the superior pace of the soft tire, more grip to build enough of an advantage to win. This is fascinating. Mark has meanwhile expected a tight field and wanted to nurses tires while keeping with the pack. Thus having enough tire left for the last lab and a final attack for a wind, which is exactly what he did. Simply put the drivers have to decide between an early pace advantage and therefore superior track position was soft tires and the consistency of the hards add, add changing conditions, different writing styles and bikes to that. And you'll see how hard it is to pick up a winning package. Well, my thing is, is there a way for him to know what Mark Marcus is going to be running considering he's the best writer out there as far as I can tell, no disrespect to Jorge Lorenzo. I know he's one of the couple of times, but um, the championship, I believe he's won two of them. Um, no matter what tire you're going to have, you're not going to open up this

Speaker 3:          01:02:08       like

Speaker 1:          01:02:10       insurmountable lead.

Speaker 1:          01:02:13       So I just think eventually that soft tire is going to fucking wear out. And then mark has his behind. He's going to overtake you and then he then can ride hard for the first time in the race. It beat the shit out of those tires. But by the time they get fucked up in the race is going to be over before that happens. I don't know. But thanks for that. That is, that is fastened. Cause everybody says you watch Reishi, she's blind people driving around, driving around track, driving around in circle stock, car racing. You're like, do you need to know? Go turn left. Um, yeah, that's all he needs to know. Band Nazi symbolism. Um, I'm enrolled in one of the best school. I love how people are too dumb to understand racing and then they sit there and they shit on it. Uh, I'm enrolled in one of the best law schools in Germany over here displaying Nazi symbolism is punishable with up to five years in prison in the context of the whole legal system.

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       It's quite an unusual article of the law usually. This is amazing. So you, cause you're a lawyer in Germany, usually the political background of an opinion is irrelevant to the criminal repercussions to avoid discrimination. Usually objective factors are used instead of political ones. It was discussed whether it banning and punishing Nazi sympathetics displays is constitutional. It is an infringement on the freedom of speech. Yes, it is. Um, and also let you know who the Nazis, ah, uh, the one argument that won in court was this, this was the historic significance in Germany. Uh, the constitution with, by the way, I'm loving all these, these letters from around the world. This is fucking incredible. If I could just get some women to write it. I know I'm off putting ladies. But you know, that kind of gives you an opportunity to put me in my place, which is one of my favorite things.

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       You hear when my wife's on here, she shits all over me. I love it. Giggling like a schoolgirl. The constitution was put into place in 1949 while most cities still look like downtown Baghdad, circa 2004 a and when the ovens of Auswitch had just cooled down, Jesus, uh, the content of the con constitution is an answer to all this shit that went down between 1933 and 1945. Yeah. Because most of those lunatics died or were put to death. And then some more rational people were like, hey, yeah, let's try to prevent that happen. And again, I look at the city. Yeah. This is amazing. You can see all the way to the other city because there's no cities left. Um, anyways. Um, so the constitution is the answer to, that's really, I know you don't see a lot about Germany other than 1933 to 1945 or the show shit about, you know, World War One, but they don't show about the steps that they took afterwards to ensure that this wasn't going to happen again.

Speaker 1:          01:05:06       Uh, I'm sure there's a nice book on it that I could sit down and read if I wasn't such a moron. And he was denying support of that regime is part of the constitution is inherent character. I agree with that. The problem, it doesn't change anything. It's symbolism. We can now point at our laws and tell other countries, see we learned and what do the neonazis do? They use fucking code, which is not forbidden, such as 88, I guess that means Heil Hitler or Hkn K R Z shirts, which in German is recognize is saying Hakan Kreutz which equals swastika. I swear to God, those fuckers parody the run DMC logo with HKN space R Z shirts. I had no idea. Wow, thanks for the podcast. They keep me laughing during exams. Looking forward to your German European tour, you freckle con, you know, that's gotta be the most fascinating Shit I've heard about Germany since, you know, the same shit that they show a zillion times on, um, on the history channel.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       Me obviously you got to show that. So, you know, hopefully that never happens again. Um, but they should probably shine a light on this to know that that is going down. I Dunno. It's hard, man. I, I believe looked like the Nazis. They kind of like a fucking think I used to do a bit on this. They're kind of like a band that had a bunch of hits like fucking 40 years ago and now they're coming back and it's just, you know, there's no original members. They don't have the magic. Any wishes it's over. It's over. It's, it's uh, you know, it's like, uh, you know, some, some bands it's just their name becomes toxic after awhile, you know. Although sometimes they're so bad that they come back and people love him again. I don't know, it's probably a bad analogy, but that's pretty frightening that that shit's going down, that people still like, you know, I dunno, I've never really been to a Holocaust museum. It's just, I just don't think I could handle it. You know, knowing that people are capable of that level of fucking evil. Just literally separating, you know, it's Shit and slavery the Shit at the board to separate parents from their children to sit there and fucking do that.

Speaker 1:          01:07:34       I don't, I don't give anybody a pass. Even the fucking kid down there like, this is my job. Quit your fucking job. I'm not fucking doing this.

Speaker 1:          01:07:45       Like, when do you, when is that Kid's screaming, crying voice gonna leave your fucking head for the rest of your life. Oh my God. Especially now having a kid and no one like how much they need. Like my daughter just came in, she was like whining and all that. For whatever reasons she wanted to hug me, you know? I don't know why, but they need just to take that away from a kid at just, it's fucking, you know, over some, I don't know that this guy, you know, there's gotta be another way. Right. Anyways, uh, you sent my to the hospital. The fuck are you talking about? Can I legally read this without getting

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       all right? Hey, Billy broke killer. My brother and I went to your show early years, your early show in Minneapolis a couple of weeks ago. And as we were leaving, he was complaining about his back and shoulder hurting being the Douche. I am. I assumed he was whining about the uncomfortable seats. So the next few days he started coughing and hearing a rattle in his chest. Yeah. Okay. We'll go to the doctor. He went to the doc and as we were cautioned, it turns out at some point during your set, his right lung made like the Falcons and Superbowl 51 collapsed. Well, if that's not from laughing, that was like, you know, you went there. Yeah. This is probably everything he did up until that point. Um, he spent, I would love to take credit for any joke being funny enough to make somebody lung collapse, but I think you're, uh, thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:09:12       Uh, yeah. You're looking at the asset of the problem there, buddy. He spent the next six days in the hospital and had to get a tube stuck through his rib cage, like Carl weathers, destinies, death scene in Predator. Then they hope that shit up to a dustbuster sucked out the air that was outside of his lung and sold the whole shot. That's fascinating. He finally got out of the hospital and is doing fine, but I just thought you'd appreciate knowing you're at the level where your comedy caused someone's Oregon to explode like the Goddamn deathstar keep this up and you'll be well on your way to fixing the overpopulation problem anyways. Can't wait for you to get come back to Minnesota so he can finish the job and get his left lung. Hope all is well with the family. Thinks. Ah, I'm glad you guys came out and I'm glad your brother's doing all right.

Speaker 1:          01:10:00       Um, all right. I think that's the, uh, I think that's the podcast here, uh, for this week. Um, all right. I think there was a formula one race today. I'm taping this Sunday night. I got to sit down and watch that, but I got so much shit to do. Um, is that it is, do I have anything? Oh yeah. This weekend I'm going to be with Nate Kraig and Houston. All right. Houston, Texas in July as a bald, redheaded male. And then I'm going to be in Dallas. I didn't know how many shows I'm fucking doing here. Let me check it out here. All right, so here's the deal. Thursday I got a show at revention music center in Texas. Friday I have a show at prevention music center in Houston, Texas. There's still tickets to Thursday, Friday sold out. And then I got two shows in, uh, the pavilion up in Dallas at the Toyota music factory.

Speaker 1:          01:11:05       Um, also I added a show right before the rough and rowdy in Rochester, New York, right outside of Buffalo, which I haven't been to in a Zillion, um, Rochester, former home of the Rochester royals that then became the Cincinnati royals than the Kansas City Slash Omaha kings than the Kansas City kings. And then the Sacramento Kings. Hey Bill, why would they, Kansas City and Omaha King spoke cause they used to split their home games between both those cities. Seeing which town gave a fuck more. Kansas City didn't have any college football. Omaha did. While I guess it's the Lincoln, Nebraska, right? Where is the University of Nebraska? I only went to a fucking game out there. I always forget what it had said and then they became the Sacramento Kings. I'm into that shit. I'm going to pass tissues. You want to do a couple of cool ones? All right.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       Here's a good one. Kansas City Scouts, NHL team moved to Colorado, became the Colorado Rockies and then moved to New Jersey, became the New Jersey devils. Okay. I can't do all your homework for you, but I can do some of it. All right. The original Washington senators, 1901 to 1960 they left and became the Minnesota twins and then the senators came back briefly in Washington, almost like they retain the name like the Cleveland browns and it was a second incarnation of the fucking Washington senators and they also failed and then they moved to Texas and became the Texas Rangers. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:12:46       You want to hit some more? What else do I go? All right. The New York Yankees. Who were they originally? The Baltimore Orioles. 1901 to 1902 then they became the New York islanders, 1903 to 1912 then they became the New York Yankees, 1913 to present now the Baltimore Oil Oreos. I knew they were the old Saint Louis Browns, but I didn't realize they were the first, they were the Milwaukee brewers in 1901 then they will then that Saint Louis browns in 1902 to 1953 and from 1954 till now they became the Oreos. All right, that's it. Ken, I want to talk to you guys anymore about this. What the Oakland A's, is that, is that, is that what you were asking about? Well, they were the Philadelphia athletics in 1901 to 1954 then the Kansas City athletics to 1955 in 1967 and then they will, the became the Oakland A's 1968 to 1986 and then the Oakland, Oakland Athletics 1987 to present.

Speaker 1:          01:13:46       I don't know what that means as far as I'm concerned. They've been the Oakland A's or the athletics and 68 but I, that's what this fucking thing said to me. You know, and you know, I learned about all of this shit. A lot of teams have passed through Kansas City started there, have gone through there, and then they just fucking, you know, Kansas City Scouts, Kansas City kings, Kansas City athletics. They've had a lot of people come and go, you know, and there's only one solution that I can think of. There's a lot of constant Kansas City. All right, go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you on Thursday.
