00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.330
Okay, what I'd like you to do for

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.910
this quiz is, implement the hash_str function. Now,

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.400
remember, the previous version of this used hashlib

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.310
and MD5. Now, I want you to use HMAC

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.760
and our secret instead. We're not going to

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.820
have to change our make_secure_val and check_secure_val functions, it's

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.190
just going to get a little bit more secure.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.050
So let's go ahead and give that a try.
