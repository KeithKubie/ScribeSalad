00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:06.169
Every rose has it’s thorn, only the good
die young, slow and steady wins the race,

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:08.100
and what you see is what you get.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.870
Except that in reality several varieties of
roses do not have thorns, both the good and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.520
the bad, on occasion, tragically die young,
fast and steady beats slow and steady every

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.680
time, and what you see is…well…

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.800
Our perception, or how we order the cacophonous
chaos of our environment, is heavily influenced

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.710
-- biased, even -- by our own expectations,
experiences, moods, and even cultural norms.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.109
And we can be pretty good at fooling ourselves.

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.010
In the last two lessons we’ve learned how
we see shapes and colors, hear sounds, and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.210
smell and taste the world’s chemical concoctions.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.210
But our senses mean little without our brain’s
ability to organize and translate that data

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.499
into meaningful perceptions.

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:55.609
Without perception, your mother’s face is
just a combination of shapes.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.499
Without the ability to interpret scent, we
couldn’t differentiate the smell of toast

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:00.499
from a grease fire.

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:04.720
Our perception is the process that allows
us to make meaning out of our senses, and

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.659
experience the world around us.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.460
It’s what makes life understandable, but
also it means that, sometimes, what you see

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.770
is not actually what you get.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.090
So that was awesome, right?

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:29.079
Upside down, I look like me; right side up,
I looked like some kind of terrifying monster.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.400
Your brain isn’t used to upside-down faces,
so it’s basically just doing its best to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400
put the pieces together.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.880
But it knows exactly what a right-side up
face should look like, AND THAT IS NOT IT!

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.620
Just one of thousands of examples proving
that your brain does all the work of perception

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.060
and your eyes, really, are just feeding raw
data.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.530
It’s IMPORTANT data, but it isn’t actually
what we see.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.940
What we see is the realm of the mind, not
the eye.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.210
What kind of bird do you see?

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.049
A duck, right?

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.899
But if I said what kind of mammal do you see,
a bunny probably would have popped out at

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.899
you.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.539
Now you should be seeing both of them popping
back and forth, but likely your brain wants

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.820
to perceive the image related to whichever
cue you first heard, or whichever image is

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.930
more familiar to you.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.850
By cueing “mammal” or “bird,” I influenced
your expectations, and you saw what I wanted

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.990
you to see.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.210
Pretty cool.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.080
Your expectations are just one factor in your
perceptual set.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.660
- The psychological factors that determine
how you perceive your environment.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.080
Sometimes seeing is believing, but perceptual
set theory teaches us that believing is also

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.080
seeing.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.070
Context is another factor in your perceptual
set.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.440
If the duck-bunny thing was pictured with
Easter eggs all around it, you’d think bunny

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.440
right away.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.700
Which is kinda weird, considering that of
ducks and bunnies, one is actually much more

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.410
likely to be near an egg.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.780
It’s not the bunny.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.940
And that’s an example of how culture is
also an important part of our perceptual set.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.710
As much as our perceptions are affected by
context and expectations, they’re also swayed

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.490
by our emotions and motivations.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.680
People will say a hill is more steep if they’re
listening to Emo by themselves, than if they’re

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.370
listening to power-pop and walking with a
friend.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.280
Most of the time, your personal perceptual
set leads you to reasonable conclusions.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.930
But sets can also be misleading or even harmful.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.110
They’re the basis of tons of entertaining
optical illusions.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.270
These two tables, for example, are the same
size, but the positions of their legs make

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.580
that impossible for you to believe until I
lay them over each other.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.250
And while all the fooling our visual perception
can be fun, it also helps us understand how

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.250
it works.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.340
Our minds are given a tremendous amount of
information, especially through the eyes,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.500
and we need to make quick work of it.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.650
Turning marks on a paper into words.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.970
Blobby lumps into the face of a friend.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.700
Seeing depth, color, movement and contrast.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.020
Being able to pick out an object from all
of the other clutter around it seems so simple.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.550
But we’ve come to discover that it is quite
complicated.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.360
So complicated that we have a name for it.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360
Form Perception.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.230
Take a neat little dynamic called the figure-ground
relationship -- it’s how we organize and

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.290
simplify whatever scene we’re looking at
into the main objects, or figures, and the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.620
surroundings, or ground, that they stand out
against.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.960
The classic “faces or vases” illusion
is an example.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.710
Is two faces against a white background?

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.310
Or a vase against a black background?

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.680
If you look long enough you’ll see that
the relationship between the object and its

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.090
surroundings flip back and forth, continually
reversing.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.870
Sometimes white is the figure and black is
the ground… that figure-ground dynamic though,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.870
is always there.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.150
The concept applies to non-visual fields,
as well.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.560
Say you’re at a party, holding up the wall,
and creeping on your crush across the room,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.820
trying to casually listen in on what they’re
saying.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.660
As the focus of your attention, that voice
becomes the figure, while all the other voices

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.010
jabbering about sports and beer pong and Sherlock
and everything that DOESN’T HAVE TO DO WITH

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.390
THAT ONE BEAUTIFUL PERSON -- all becomes the
ground.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.240
Now that your mind has distinguished figure
from ground, it has to perceive that form

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.430
as something meaningful.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.380
Like, for one, that large shape on the couch
is a person, and further, that person isn’t

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.970
just any person, but the specific, unique
person of your dreams.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.470
One way our minds shuffle all of these stimuli
into something coherent is by following rules

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.170
of grouping, like organizing things by proximity,
continuity, or closure.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.660
The rule of proximity, for instance, simply
states that we like to group nearby figures

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.660
together.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.730
So, instead of seeing a random garble of partygoers,
we tend to mentally connect people standing

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.730
next to each other.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.889
Like, there’s the hockey team over there,
and the debate team over there, and then you

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:15.889
got the band geeks.

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:16.900
Why are all these people at the same party?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.050
We’re also drawn to organize our world with
attention to continuity--perceiving smooth,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.550
continuous patterns and often ignoring broken
ones.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.700
We also like closure, and not just after a
breakup.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.730
Visually, we want to fill in gaps, to create
whole objects, so here we see an illusory

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.370
triangle breaking the completion of these
circles on left.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.090
But just add the little lines to close-off
the circles, and you stop seeing the triangle.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.889
Form perception obviously is crucial to making
sense of the world -- or, y’know, a moderately

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.050
interesting party.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.900
But imagine trying to navigate the world without
depth perception.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.400
As you gaze upon your one true love, the image
hits your retina in two dimensions, yet somehow

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.460
you’re still able to see the full three-dimensional
gloriousness of their form.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.590
You can thank your depth perception for that.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.240
Depth perception is what helps us estimate
an object’s distance and full shape.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.870
In this case, a nice shape that is currently
too far away from you.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.680
It is at least partially innate.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680
Even most babies have it.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.080
We’re able to perceive depth by using both
binocular and monocular visual cues.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.560
Binocular cues, as the name gives away, require
the use of both eyes.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.330
Because your eyes are about 2.5 inches apart,
your retinas receive ever-so-slightly different

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.330
images.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.760
You know, camera one, camera two.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.360
So when you’re looking with both eyes, your
brain compares these two images to help judge

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.360
distance.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.120
The closer the object, the greater the difference
between the two images, also known as their

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.120
retinal disparity.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.430
Retinal disparity is pretty easy to see, you
just hold your fingers up and then you look

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.700
past them, and suddenly you have four instead
of two fingers.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.560
But because those left and right eye images
vary only slightly, retinal disparity doesn’t

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.310
help much when it comes to judging far-off
distances.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.930
For that we look to our monocular cues to
help us determine the scale and distance of

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.930
an object.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.230
These are things like relative size and height,
linear perspective, texture gradient, and

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.380
interposition.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.320
Relative size allows you to determine that
your crush is not supporting a tiny, newborn

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.510
chihuahua on their shoulder, but rather there’s
a full-grown chihuahua behind them in the

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.510
back of the room.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.150
In the absence of a chihuahua or like object,
you can also judge distances using your linear

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.150
perspective.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.680
If you’ve ever made a perspective drawing
in art class you’ll remember that parallel

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.960
lines appear to meet as they move into the
distance, just like the tiled floor.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.550
The sharper the angle of convergence and the
closer the lines together, the greater the

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.550
distance will seem.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.900
And if you’ve ever looked out at a mountain
range or a Bob Ross painting, you’ll understand

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.780
texture gradient as the cue that makes the
first ridge appear all rocky and textured.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.180
But as your eye follows the ridges into the
distance, they become less detailed.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.760
And finally, our interposition, or overlap
cue, tells us that when one object, like this

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.930
oaf here, blocks our view of something else,
your crush, we perceive it as being closer.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.610
And in this case, especially annoying.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.460
So, all of these perceptual concepts can be
demonstrated with a fixed image, but of course,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.650
life involves a lot of movement.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.210
At least if you’re doing it right.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.940
We use motion perception to infer speed and
direction of a moving object.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.460
Like, your brain gauges motion based partly
on the idea that shrinking objects are retreating,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.370
and enlarging objects are approaching.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.590
The thing is, your brain is easily tricked
when it comes to motion.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.389
For instance, large objects appear to move
much more slowly than small ones going the

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:15.389
same speed.

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:19.670
And in addition to organizing things by form,
depth, and motion, our perception of the world

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.990
also requires consistency, or as psychologists
call it, constancy.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.650
Perceptual constancy is what allows us to
continue to recognize an object regardless

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:33.019
of its distance, viewing angle, motion, or
illumination, even as it might appear to change

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:35.709
color, size, shape, and brightness depending
on the conditions.

00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:40.469
Like, we know what a chihuahua is whether
it looks like this, this, this, or this.

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:43.599
In the end, though, your perception isn’t
just about funky optical illusions, it’s

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:49.079
about how you understand the world and your
place in it--both physically and psychologically.

00:08:49.079 --> 00:08:53.300
Your sensory organs pull in the world’s
raw data, which is disassembled into little

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.700
bits of information, and then reassembled
in your brain to form your own model of the

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.700
world.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.269
It’s like your senses are just collecting
a bunch of legos, and your brain can build,

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:08.529
and rebuild, whatever it perceives - a party,
your crush, a duck, or a chihuahua.

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:12.129
In other words, your brain constructs your
perceptions.

00:09:12.129 --> 00:09:15.240
And if you were correctly constructing your
perceptions this lesson, you learned what

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.519
forms your perceptual set; how form perception
works; and the many visual cues that influence

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:21.519
your depth perception.
