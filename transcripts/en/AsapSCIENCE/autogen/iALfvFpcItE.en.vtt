00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
 Many of us suffered from anxiety symptoms 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.500
 Whether they are testing or applying for a new job 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.080
 But some people find it difficult to stop worrying 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.320
 Even in situations that seem normal, leaving a lasting impact on 

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:14.700
 Their quality of life, what happens? 

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:17.785
 Why are they so worried? Nearly seven million people 

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:20.425
 They have generalized disorder, which means 

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:25.000
 That they are over-anxious most days, for at least six months 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 This includes disturbances of sleep, muscle cramps and cramps 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.240
 Panic episodes may also occur, but their nature varies where they come from 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.860
 In sudden and short periods of excessive fear that leads to 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.200
 Severe physical reactions such as accelerated heartbeat, shortness of breath, and dizziness 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.120
 In fact, anyone who is suffering from a panic attack, whether he has a disorder or not 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.940
 There may be no specific reason for this panic attack 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.520
 Although we do not fully understand it, anxiety is partly caused by the amjadala and the hypothalamus, which are responsible for the rotation of cortisol and adrenalin in the body 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.720
 Genetically, 40 percent of patients with generalized disorder have a relative with the same disease 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.100
 Which means I am the levels of these hormones you have associated with your genes 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.960
 Your surroundings may be another factor 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.100
 Some disorders are associated with traumatic experiences in childhood 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.800
 The levels of neutron transmitters such as GABA, serotonin, and dopamine have changed 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.880
 Be another reason. Responsible serotonin hormone 

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:17.535
 About the sense of well-being and happiness 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.900
 Works by moving between Neuron and another inside the brain through a difference called "synaps" 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.140
 Any unused serotonin is returned to the original Neuron by a special carrier 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.940
 But those with some anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.780
 It has been suggested that a mutation in these vectors doubles the size of serotonin yield 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.680
 Before arriving at the future Neurons 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.680
 Which results in a decrease in the amount of the difference "Synapse", and ultimately to affect the emotions 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.140
 This was the reason for the use of drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.160
 In cases of these anxieties so that serotonin is prevented from returning to the original neuron 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.860
 Also, many anxiety disorders show an excessive reaction in the amygdala and the gray environment "periaqueductal gray area" 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.075
 Resulting in negative effects not only on the brain 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 But even on our bodies. In a study of nearly 300 people for five years 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.480
 Those with an overactive amygdala were more likely to develop heart disease 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.160
 Because the amygdala stimulates the production of white blood cells 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.980
 In the bone marrow leading 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.515
 To inflate affects the 

00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:17.885
 Arterial heart artery 

00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:20.355
 If you have a fear of a phobia, this is a form of anxiety disorder 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.340
 But as many fears help us survive 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.245
 Such as the fear of spiders or highlands has been suggested that 

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.235
 These fears may be stored in DNA and inherited 

00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:32.065
 When mice are electrocuted after exposure to the smell of a fruit 

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:35.225
 They quickly learn to fear that smell 

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:37.575
 But exciting new generations of mice 

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:40.445
 Also afraid of the same smells of those fruits. 

00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:43.665
 Although the new mice were not subjected to electric shock, it turned out that 

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:47.100
 Because of the strong reaction of the electric shock in the brain's receptors 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.605
 Make new generations more sensitive to the same smells 

00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:52.620
 In a manner that suggests that receptors are in the operating mode for those that are odors 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.980
 These odors are associated with some cases of fear (phobia) 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.300
 For treatment, cognitive behavior therapy helps 

00:02:57.305 --> 00:02:59.820
 To recognize ideas that stimulate feelings 

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:02.435
 Affecting the disposition is aimed at 

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:05.525
 Change these thoughts to wrestle anxiety 

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:09.380
 On the other hand, drugs such as SRIs and SNRIS 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.940
 They are used to prevent serotonin or norepryphrine absorption 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.475
 But may produce side effects and sometimes 

00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:17.415
 Affect negatively with long use 

00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:20.405
 Benzodiazepines are also used to help sleep 

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:25.140
 Muscle relaxation is also associated with dementia at large generations 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.200
 It is necessary to know that the basis of nervous and chemical anxiety is very complex 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.600
 The news of someone who is calm will not come with any result 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.355
 So we decided to make another video and explained what we were doing 

00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:39.355
 In order to overcome anxiety some tips and tricks that 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.000
