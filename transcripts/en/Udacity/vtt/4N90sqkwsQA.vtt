We just saw how we can reuse code and
classes through inheritance.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.500
But this is only part
of a bigger picture.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.520
Inheritance allows us to express higher
level relationships between classes.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.655
For example, if a dog class inherits
from an animal class then a dog

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:18.345
is an animal, in the sense that it
inherits all the features of an animal.

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:21.775
It will be this kind of higher level
logic that will help you build bigger

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:23.625
and better applications
as you move forward.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.105
See you in the next session.
