00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.670
NARRATOR: In 2017, more than 37%
of adults in the U.S.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.040
got a flu shot.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.040
Roughly 80,000 died from
the virus in the US.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.540
But in 1918, there
was no flu shot,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.040
and at least 50 million
people died around the world.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.210
That flu was known
as the Spanish Flu,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.790
and it is the second
deadliest plague in history,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.580
after, well, "the"
Plague in the 1300s.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.750
So how exactly did
a flu virus cause

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.750
such massive death and
destruction across the world?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.420
Well it helps to pinpoint
where it started, except we

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.500
can't, not with 100% certainty.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.920
It could have been the disease
stricken trenches of World War

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.580
I. Or maybe the Shanxi
Province of China, where

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.330
the outbreak of a
respiratory disease in 1917

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.920
may have actually
been the flu virus.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.250
Or maybe even Camp Funston,
a military base in Kansas

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.830
where 48 soldiers died
of flu-like symptoms

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.920
right before an outbreak.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.080
What we do know for
sure is that the Spanish

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.750
Flu didn't start in Spain.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.420
So then why is it
called the Spanish Flu?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.460
Well, the flu broke out during
World War I. Neither the allied

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.960
nor central powers wanted
to admit to additional loss

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.580
of life during a conflict
that hinged on who had more

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.040
manpower, so all the
nations involved in the war

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.040
limited reports of the outbreak.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.040
In the US, some people were even
afraid that reporting the flu

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.880
might violate the
"Sedition Act of 1918,"

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.880
a law that prohibited
disloyal language

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.540
about the government
and any action

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.790
against the
prosecution of the war.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.790
But Spain wasn't in World
War I. And since they

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.960
had no reason to hide
anything, they reported

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.620
their flu-related deaths.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.880
Even the King of Spain,
Alfonso XIII got the disease,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.790
but ultimately survived.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.120
So with the spotlight on Spain,
US and European news outlets

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.670
nicknamed it the Spanish Flu.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.170
But the flu was spreading
well outside of Spain.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.920
And with a large scale of
infections going unreported,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.460
no one was prepared
for the deadly pandemic

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.000
it would become.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.460
Today, we know the flu
is a highly contagious

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.000
viral infection that
spreads to the nose, throat,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670
and sometimes the lungs.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.830
Symptoms, such as fever, nausea,
aches, and a sore throat,

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.330
are all standard.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.920
It's a terrible possibly
fatal disease that confines

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.250
the afflicted to bed for days.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.000
But the 1918 Flu was worse.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.750
Dark spots would
appear on the body

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.330
before the skin turned
blue from a lack of oxygen

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.830
in their blood.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.330
And patients would bleed
from their noses and ears,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.040
as they suffocated on
their own blood and fluids.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.960
In 1918, at Camp Funston,
US army doctor Roy Grist

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.500
remarked, "It is only
a matter of a few hours

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.670
then until death comes, and it
is simply a struggle for air

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.210
until they suffocate.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.960
It is horrible."

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.710
The outbreak at Camp Funston
affected more than 1,000

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.380
soldiers and killed 47.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.040
But those 1,000 were
part of 1 million

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.210
soldiers throughout
Kansas who were all

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.960
in contact with one another.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.460
Those soldiers were then sent
overseas in the spring of 1918,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.380
carrying flu microbes that
would spread faster than the war

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.040
itself.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.790
In the fall of that same year,
a second wave of flu cases

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.210
started spreading across
the US, hitting both

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.460
military and civilian centers.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.380
Doctors had never before
seen such a deadly strain

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.920
of influenza.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.710
To make matters worse,
knowledge of viruses at the time

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.920
was limited, since
microscopes of the day

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.250
were not powerful
enough to see them.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.500
People began
blaming the Germans,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.420
claiming they were
spreading poison clouds

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.670
or that Bayer, which was
a German owned company,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.580
had infected their aspirin.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.580
As the flu spread in America,
even public health officials

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.750
began to lie about
the state of things,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.540
like Philadelphia's public
health director Wilmer Krusen,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.420
who, in September of 1918,
declared, "no concern whatever

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.920
is felt," after a
Navy ship from Boston

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.040
arrived with
infected passengers.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.580
The next day, two sailors died.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.380
The day after that, 14.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.210
There was little to be done to
stop the spread of the virus.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.710
Doctors had no way to create
a vaccine, antiviral drugs,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.380
or even antibiotics for
secondary infections,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.620
like pneumonia.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.620
Instead, most prevention
efforts focused

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.960
on quarantine and
personal hygiene.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.710
Schools, churches, and other
public gathering spaces

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.620
were shut down in many cities.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.750
In San Francisco,
they went so far as

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.250
to fine people $5 who didn't
wear protective masks,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.040
dubbing them "mask slackers."

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.540
And in the end,
after only one year,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.750
the death toll was catastrophic.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.710
To put things in perspective,
more than 16 million people

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.080
died in World War I.
The Spanish Flu killed

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.750
at least 50 million people.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.670
And some believe the number
may be closer to 100 million.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.000
In the US alone, 675,000
people will die from the flu.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.460
That's more American deaths
than American soldiers

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.620
who died in World
War I. It's more

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.620
than all the deaths
of American soldiers

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.290
in the 20th century combined.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.670
And in October of
1918, 195,000 Americans

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.000
died, making it the deadliest
month in US history.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Death was so prevalent
between the war and flu

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.670
that life expectancy in
the US dropped by 12 years.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.500
Even Woodrow Wilson was
affected by the Spanish Flu,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.750
having collapsed during the
Versaille Peace Conference

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.880
with flu-like symptoms.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.500
The outbreak of Spanish Flu is
what spurred the development

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.380
of a vaccine, although
scientists didn't even

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.500
isolate the influenza
virus for study

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.380
until 1933, 15 years later.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.460
The first flu vaccine
was developed in 1938

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.830
and was later given to US
soldiers in World War II.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.330
After the war, it
was finally used

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.290
to treat the American public.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.620
