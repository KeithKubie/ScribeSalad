00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.299
You will have to keep your eyes open for these
Easter Eggs that we will be showing you from

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.469
some of your favorite Disney films.

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.839
With almost sixty animated films produced
since 1937 Walt Disney Studios has hidden

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.930
Easter eggs throughout their films driving
fans crazy for years.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.000
Finding every Easter egg in every film is
almost impossible but we are trying our best

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.190
to spot each and every one of them for you.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:41.940
When you see an Easter egg that you haven’t
seen before hit that like button so we know.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.780
Make sure to subscribe to Screen Rant for
more awesome videos like this one as we ask

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.780
the question, Did You Ever Notice These 10
Disney Easter Eggs?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.780
Tangled

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.360
The film Tangled have some fun hidden references
to other Disney films in it but there is only

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.300
one scene that has three.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.190
As Flynn and Rapunzel look through a book,
numerous other books are scattered around

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.290
the floor and shelves.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.760
There are three books in there that tell the
story of another Disney princess including

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.360
Snow White and the Seven Drawfs, Sleeping
Beauty and the final book being Mulan.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.740
No wonder Rapunzel knows how to be a great
Princess, she read up on the art of grace

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.360
and adventure.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360
Frozen

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.680
Since you have watched our other Screen Rant
videos you probably already know that Rapunzel

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.400
and Flynn from the movie Tangled are in the
film Frozen.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.590
But have you been able to spot another Disney
princess that made her way to Elsa’s coronation.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.600
Princess Tiana form The Princess and the Frog
made the journey to Elsa’s castle but the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.480
real question is, who is that guy with her?

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.250
Because it doesn’t look like Prince Naveen
to us, what do you think?

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.720
You have some explaining to do Princess Tiana.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.720
Zootopia

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.920
This one brings back nostalgia for all of
us that are Jim Henson fans.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.229
In 1978 Jim Henson released a television special
called Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.909
since Disney acquired The Muppets from The
Henson Company in 2004 it is appropriate for

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.360
a Henson Easter Egg.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.700
When Lt. Judy Hopps uses a soda bottle as
a magnifying glass she spots Emmitt Otterton

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.680
who wears a Christmas sweater and is a direct
link to Emmet Otter from Henson’s beloved

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.329
Christmas special.

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.709
What a great way to salute a talented man.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.050
Finding Nemo

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.450
When Nigel flies into the dentist office carrying
Marlin and Dory he causes quite the ruckus.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.719
So much that the little girl in the dentist
chair can’t be calmed down by the mobile

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.299
hanging on the ceiling above her.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.230
If that mobile looks familiar to you it’s
because it can be seen in the first Monsters,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.230
Inc. movie.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.340
This is another connection that helps to prove
the theory that every Pixar film is connected.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:52.709
So don’t flush that theory down the drain
just yet, it might just be true.

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.709
Up

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.169
In the 2009 film, Up one of the best scenes
of the film is when the house takes flight

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.459
for the first time.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.959
The onlookers in the film gaze with amazement
just like we did the first time we saw it

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:04.969
in theaters.

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.079
In one room a little girl plays with her toys
as the balloons lift the house in the window

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.079
behind her.

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.400
There are obviously two Easter eggs right
in front of our faces, the Luxo ball from

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.810
Pixar’s first animated short and Lotso Huggin
Bear from Toy Story 3.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.169
But look at the toy plane in the little girl’s
hand, does it look familiar?

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:27.069
It’s the same plane that helped Buzz fly
in the original Toy Story.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.900
101 Dalmatians

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.739
In the film 101 Dalmatians the puppies watch
a western film on the television screen.

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.379
Fast forward almost five decades later and
you can see the same western in another Disney

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.199
film but this time a short film released by
Pixar.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.439
In the short, Day &amp; Night watch the drive-in
theater closely and you can see the same cowboy

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:46.439
on the same horse.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.430
We know stock footage can get expensive and
reusing footage is cast efficient but we’re

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.019
pretty sure Disney can afford it.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.019
Wreck-It Ralph

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.889
When Ralph walks through the station between
arcade games you see numerous characters from

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.430
famous arcade games.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.129
Including Sonic the Hedgehog and if you are
a Mario fan you might have noticed Princesses

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.260
Rosalina And Daisy.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.680
There is one Easter egg from the Disney film,
Meet the Robinsons.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.959
Tiny the Tyrannosaurus walks right behind
Ralph and if you look even closer you can

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.730
see Blinky, Inky and Pinky.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.109
They aren’t alone though, there are numerous
game cameos in this scene, which ones did

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.180
you spot?

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.169
Big Hero 6

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.460
When Hiro goes to the police station to recruit
the help of police officers, the officer behind

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.509
the desk is not very enthusiastic.

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.520
He doesn’t seem interested in Hiro’s story
but he does have some interesting items on

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.759
and around his desk.

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.150
Besides the wanted photo of Prince Hans from
Frozen on a bulletin board behind him there

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.289
are a few other photos of interest.

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.310
On his desk are photos of Esther and Bolt
from the animated film, Bolt.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.669
Esther was a guard in the film Bolt so maybe
she’s a relative of Officer Gerson or they

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.650
went to the same academy.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.860
Toy Story 3

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.360
Toy Story 3 is blanketed with numerous Cars
Easter Eggs, so many that we could do an entire

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.660
video on just those Easter Eggs but there
is only one with a character that moos.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.319
When Buzz meets a fellow sci-fi toy, right
behind them is a tractor from the film Cars.

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.569
We’re a little upset that the tractor doesn’t
tip over and moo but we can always go back

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:26.490
and watch that Cars scene over and over again
because we do that on a regular basis anyways.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.490
Inside Out

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.990
It would seem that Riley Andersen is a fan
of the movie Up, because her memories are

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.020
filled with scenes from the film.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.240
When Joy visits the long term memories storage
there are numerous memory orbs with scenes

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.949
from the movie Up in there.

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.569
Those memories have to be from a movie and
not from real life because it shows the Fredricksen’s

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.880
as a young couple and as an older couple.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.599
We had to turn the movie inside out to find
those hidden gems but we are glad we did.

00:05:52.599 --> 00:06:03.140
There you have ten 10 Disney Easter Eggs that
you might have never noticed, let us know

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:09.080
which ones we missed and don’t forget to
