00:00:01.896 --> 00:00:04.450
MALE SPEAKER: I'm very happy.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.940
I've been working on this
for several months now.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.200
So I'm very happy that
it worked out for Gregory

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.580
to come and speak to you today
here as part of our mindfulness

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.080
week.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.930
He has a book, same name as
his talk, "Insight Dialogue,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.270
The Interpersonal
Path to Freedom."

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.990
I guess the last
thing I would just say

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.160
is it's great to have a
personal mindfulness practice.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.370
But I think it's important what
impact it has in your life,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.120
and what can have more
impact on your life

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120
than your relationships?

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.200
That's why I think
it's so important,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.425
this work that Gregory is doing
with interpersonal practice

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:41.050
of mindfulness.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.330
So I'm very excited to
hear what he has to say.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.075
Now, I'll turn it
over to Gregory.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.190
GREGORY KRAMER: So
thanks for coming.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.850
Thanks for all the
work to work this out.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.400
A lot of behind
the scenes stuff.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.800
So there's a lot of
talk about mindfulness

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.920
and all kinds of practices,
a lot of exploration

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.340
of how to do it.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.190
Actually, I will be speaking
about practicing mindfulness

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.920
and other qualities
interpersonally,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.120
and what the values
are of that, how

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.380
you do it, that kind of thing.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.800
But the place that I want to
start is more fundamental.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.470
It's why, why we
practice mindfulness.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.360
And then specifically, why
interpersonal mindfulness

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.210
begins to fall out of that.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.970
And then, we can
look at the practice

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.820
because now we have a sense
of why are we doing it, right?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.080
So we're oriented.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:05.330
And the story begins,
actually, in this

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.370
what you might
call the human gift

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.910
or the human dilemma, which
is this incredible sensitivity

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.080
of the organism.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.390
Just pure, straight
out sensitivity.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.610
So I'm talking about
the eyes and the light

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.810
touching the eyes.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.760
If you're in a dark room
and there's just one photon,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.840
it can be detected.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.080
That's incredible, right?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.890
And then, in addition to that,
of course, all the specifics

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.040
of color and shade, the
subtlety of a visual capacity

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.040
is astonishing.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.350
Likewise, with sound, if you
go into in anechoic chamber,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.600
you'll still hear lots
of stuff because you'll

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.150
be hearing your own
bloodstream, your own heart.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.870
You'll actually hear the
blood moving through the body.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:10.550
And very slight changes,
even in the face of a sound,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.990
an acoustic signal, and
you'll hear differences there.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.870
Millisecond changes, and you'll
hear rhythmic differences.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.750
Spectral changes, and very
slight changes in loudness.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.270
The astonishing
sensitivity of the ear

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.700
is-- we just sit around hearing.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.310
I mean, right now,
you're hearing me.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.520
And as you're hearing me, you're
hearing the output of this body

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.550
and all of the muscle changes,
all of the movement of the air

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.170
is wiggling your eardrum.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.749
So as I'm speaking, I'm
wiggling your head, right?

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:53.790
You know what I'm saying?

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.570
It's very intimate.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.180
But until you understand
the sensitivity

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.810
of this thing, this
body thing, you

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.040
can't understand the
complexity of being human.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.260
And then mindfulness
is like-- it

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.270
doesn't have its
real purpose if we

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.600
don't understand the purpose.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.300
Likewise the skin, just
the touch, the temperature.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.810
I was once in you know
the invisible man exhibit

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.690
where various plastics
were injected into cadavers

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.120
to reveal different organ
systems, circulatory systems,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.110
nervous systems, and so on?

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.420
And get rid of everything
else so you can just see that?

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.940
You look at just the nervous
system, just the nerve endings

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.900
through the body.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.880
And it's a cloud.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.360
There's nerves that go to
every part of the body.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.610
And they branch, and
they collect, finally

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.330
up the spinal cord to
the brain, and so on.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.250
The data gathering that this
body is doing from the outside

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.310
and from the inside, gut
feeling, is incredible.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.680
And molecules touch the
nose, touch the tongue.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.160
So all these different
ways of being in contact

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.030
with the world,
and this is exactly

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:32.540
the basis of how we
experience this life, right?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:40.180
So this sensitivity is an
essential starting point.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.670
Would that it were that
simple but it's not.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.570
Because all of this
data gathering,

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.890
all of these astonishing sensors
that material scientists could

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.445
only dream of reduplicating
that kind of sensitivity

00:05:56.445 --> 00:06:01.340
all goes into, of
course, not just

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.545
the neural system,
not just the brain,

00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:08.910
but the whole hormonal system,
all the cells, the whole body.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.950
It's processing this stuff.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.760
So what we call perception,
sensation and perception,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:21.670
object formation,
is equally nuanced.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.910
And from the time
that we're born,

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.840
we're constantly developing,
what is this world?

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.830
What is this world?

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.430
Where am I?

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.670
And it's remarkable that
we're able to decode somehow

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.360
this flood of
information coming in.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.320
The sensory information,
it's not just signals.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.550
It's the processing
of those signals

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.280
to say, oh, there's a desk.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.060
There's a person.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.340
There's a tree, and so on.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.480
And would that it were
even just that simple.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.950
It goes on from there.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.300
But look at what
happens with just,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:14.220
let's say, just take something
like body contact, right?

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.580
So it's built in as
a biochemical fact,

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:27.200
a biological fact, that
certain things are experienced

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.840
as pleasant and certain
as unpleasant because it's

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.700
how we're conditioned
for survival.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.790
We need food.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.030
We need oxygen.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:40.000
Absence of oxygen, unpleasant,
seriously unpleasant, right?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.880
But what about the
presence of sugar?

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.740
The presence of sufficient
warmth on a cold day,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.460
or sufficient
coolness on a hot day?

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.390
So if you take that to
the extreme, of course,

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.500
one would die of the heat, or
die of the cold, and so on.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.010
But even just the moment
by moment contact,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.060
there's this pleasant,
unpleasant going

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:13.110
on with these incredible,
sensitive systems.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.130
Now, that's what's
driving the system, right?

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:24.800
That's where-- if you just
picture us as some sort of kelp

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.290
waving in the sea, where's
the nutrients that we want?

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.366
And of course, we're
always going for the sugar.

00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:34.490
We're going for the warmth.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.740
We're going for the softness.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.179
We're going for
the food and so on.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.400
We're going for the sex later,
but I'll get to that later.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:49.180
So this coupling, this intimate
coupling with our environment

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.590
is a basic fact.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:02.750
Now, the yeast, for
example, is also

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.000
coupled with its environment.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.140
And where there's
sugar, it somehow

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.730
gets itself towards the
sugar to be able to survive.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.740
Sugar, ah!

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.840
Nothing.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.604
Sugar, nothing, sugar,
nothing, and then it dies.

00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:22.270
And that's life.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.360
That's life as a yeast-- sugar,
nothing, sugar, nothing, sugar,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.700
nothing, death.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.770
So OK, very well and good.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.320
But now, you get
more complex systems.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.710
You've built up from the yeast
to multi-celled organisms.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:46.500
And there begins to
be this brain, which

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.440
is really quite incredible.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.960
So we have not just sugar,
nothing, sugar, nothing,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.320
we have I prefer this or this.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.790
The pleasures that I go for.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:06.100
I have a certain
background, conditioning.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:11.160
And so I can actually not only
sugar, nothing, sugar, nothing,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.040
but it can be I like
a lot of sunshine.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.400
Or I like the color
blue, or whatever.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.850
And we go through life
trying to get that.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.990
So this sensory urge,
this sensory urge

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.390
is really pushing us.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.170
And one of the unique
things about humans

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:39.200
is that this cortex is
getting thicker and thicker

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.550
and convoluted.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.780
So there's more of it.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.610
And the neural
networks interacting

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:52.630
with the whole hormonal
system created this organism

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.100
for processing all this data.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.400
So now, we also have mobility.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.830
So there's all the
muscular stuff.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.530
So we can go towards
the sugar and away

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.570
from the loud noise or the
dog poop or whatever it is.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:12.390
We have this constant
moving in the environment

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.330
towards and away from
pleasant and unpleasant.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.080
We're still intimately coupled.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:24.260
We're still this sensor
array and processing system

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.380
intimately coupled
with the environment

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.560
and moving away and
towards all of the things

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.270
that we begin to
prefer culturally

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.920
by how we were raised in
our families, and so on.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.020
So I want this kind of car.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.190
I want that kind of car.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.650
I want this kind of house.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.430
I want safety and so on.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:52.380
So not only is it sugar or
whatever it happens to be.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.380
You might like lemons,
so we could say sour.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.430
But let's just say sugar to keep
it consistent with the yeast.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:02.420
Sugar, nothing, but
is it really nothing?

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.490
It's a yearning now.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.000
When do I get the next sugar?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.880
Because now, there's memory.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.560
And now, there's thought.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.030
And now, there's all kinds
of baggage around what we get

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.660
and what we don't get.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:23.330
So sugar, will I ever
get any more sugar?

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:28.350
Sugar, kind of stress,
sugar, stress, sugar,

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.030
stress, then you die.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.980
It's a fact.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.090
That's how we go through life.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:46.650
And some of us have caviar,
suffering, Maserati, suffering,

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.930
death.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:53.220
And some of us have pineapple,
suffering, banana, suffering,

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.110
death.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.600
But it's the same basic pattern.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.200
And the organism is
dedicated to what it can get

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.980
and moved by these sensory
urges for pleasure.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:12.980
It's also not that simple.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:18.770
Because it's perhaps one
of the salient features,

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:25.850
some would argue the unique
feature of human beings

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:30.260
that there is this
developed sense

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.170
of who I am, a sense of self.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:39.130
So what's happening is all of
those perceptions of objects,

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.990
of what is seen, all
of those preferences,

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:49.740
and in fact living in the
miasma of the tension that's

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.880
formed with all this sugar,
suffering, sugar, suffering,

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.960
all that stress,
all that wanting,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:03.150
all that fear keeps the whole
nervous system and hormonal

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.100
system in a very
high state of alert.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.940
And then, we sleep
enough, barely.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.620
And then, we're back in
this high state of alert.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.160
And all of that stress
and all of that memory

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.800
and all of those particular
perceptions and preferences--

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:32.720
actually, the consistency
of that, the steady pressure

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.460
of that begins to
be identified as me.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.900
I am this person.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.650
I am this entity.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.980
I sense me moving
through the world.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.870
And as I move through the
world, the way I know I'm here

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:58.160
is from these body tensions,
mostly, and then the pleasures

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.130
that stimulate me.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.430
So it might be a
pleasant kind of tension.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.110
Or it might be an
unpleasant tension.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.150
Someone yells at me,
or I hurt myself,

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:12.550
or I have some fear because
there's an animal coming at me.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.140
But it feels like me running
away from that animal.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.350
It feels like me
eating that pineapple.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:25.680
And so the me at the center
now has this whole strategy

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.929
it makes up to get the
pleasures, to think

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:30.470
about the next
pleasures-- because we

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.420
have this powerful
mental capacity.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.600
Well, we can project
forward, right?

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.990
And that's me
projecting forward.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.450
So I'm going to get this.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.920
I'm going to live this way.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.060
I'm going to get a house.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.230
I'm going to get a
nice sofa for my house.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.900
I'm going to get a TV this big.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.380
I'm going to get
this kind of car.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.290
And that's all me.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.890
It could be the yeast and the
sugar, but it couldn't be.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.890
Because you don't have
that constructing capacity.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.150
The yeast doesn't.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.490
We do.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:05.030
So we're constructing.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.920
And we're constructing a self.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.960
We're constructing a life.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.090
And the life is this being,
this sensitive organism

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.200
getting and avoiding
and using our mobility,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.310
using this high
intelligence to move about,

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.760
guided by this sensitivity.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.080
And there you have it.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:35.170
So this self now, this me that
wants to get and keep away also

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.500
has to survive.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.410
It's a big deal to stay alive.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.080
And there's all kinds of
ways that this body mind

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.050
is configured to
try to stay alive.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.660
And it's a huge effort.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.090
And it's the effort
of food, but it's also

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.810
the effort of the
mind, keeping busy,

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.260
having a sense of meaning.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:07.670
All the things that we do to
orient that when we lose them,

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:12.349
there's actually depression,
insanity, and so on that

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.990
comes about when
there's no sense

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.310
of orienting framework,
no direction.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.170
So this is really
life and death.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.859
But we don't
necessarily distinguish

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.690
whether it's the
death of the body

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.089
or the death of the
psychological self.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:32.750
At the deepest level, this level
where the whole body feels it,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.050
the whole body feels
that sadness and fear,

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:40.110
that's also facing death.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:48.110
And it gets even more complex.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.630
In fact, this is perhaps one
of the biggest multipliers

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:57.880
of the whole formula that
I've just put out there.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:07.750
As humans evolved as
a species, a key point

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:13.470
that differentiated and
enable their survival was

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:19.610
what's called eusociality,
the development

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:24.660
of the intrinsic relationality
that has us cooperating

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:30.000
together to survive
in a world where

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.750
many of the other large
creatures are faster, stronger,

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:39.690
and where the
environment itself is

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:44.290
changing and very
difficult to live in.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.220
And by cooperation,
we could survive.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:53.690
In fact, by cooperation, humans
became the dominant species

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.410
on the planet.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:00.063
We are the top of the food
chain in this ecosystem.

00:19:00.063 --> 00:19:03.304
How did that happen?

00:19:03.304 --> 00:19:08.180
It didn't happen by
hundreds of thousands

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.440
or even billions of
individuals being

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.250
really capable and really smart.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:19.050
It came because we
could work together.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.120
A corporation is people
working together.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.650
Farmers is people
working together.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:28.440
Any specialization at all
is people working together.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.700
Money is people
working together.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.740
The legal system,
all culture, it's

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.200
all people working together.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.590
Intellectual knowledge,
language, everything.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:47.559
Everything that we identify
as the stuff of my life,

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:48.350
I mean look around.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.670
We wouldn't have
these desks if they

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.182
hadn't been made by
the manufacturer where

00:19:54.182 --> 00:19:56.390
human beings were working,
because we don't have time

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:57.120
to make desks.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.460
We're busy making
whatever, search engines

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.050
or anything else.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.200
But not only that,
the materials used

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.140
in this, the plastics, and the
history, intellectual history,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.160
the scientific history
behind developing plastics,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.790
and where they get the resins to
make these plastics, all of it,

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.560
is people cooperating to
make Formica or something.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:25.280
Let alone if you're
wearing gold, gold mining.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.350
You're not mining the gold.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.960
If you're eating a banana,
you're not growing the bananas.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.710
If you're using some app,
maybe you made the app,

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.580
maybe you didn't.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:45.200
But the whole culture is made
possible by this cooperation,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.330
but at a much more
fundamental level.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.860
Getting back down to
this environmental,

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.900
kind of the intimacy with
experience, families.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.420
You wouldn't survive
if you weren't

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:02.630
cared for by your mother
and probably your father.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.880
And the development of
families and groups of families

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:11.020
around a campfire, and families
or people working together,

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:17.610
small warrior bands could always
defeat the individual fighter.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.510
So if you have a
culture or society

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.900
of people who could work
together to fight together,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.070
then that genetic material
is going to pass along.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.550
But in order to fight together,
you have to communicate well.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:33.580
You go over here, I'll go
over here, stuff like that.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.350
But you also have to be able to
read their minds, their faces.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.270
What is safe?

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.220
Just with your mother and with
your father, when am I OK,

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.200
when am I not OK?

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:51.300
So built in to this social
edifice, this cultural edifice

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.310
that I was just talking about,
all the way at the bottom

00:21:55.310 --> 00:22:01.240
is this intimate
reading of other people.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.565
Where you look in the eyes,
and you know something.

00:22:03.565 --> 00:22:04.640
You touch something.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.670
You're doing that
right now with me.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.750
You're reading me,
and you're reading me

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:16.120
with all the sensitivity
that you grew up with, built

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:23.940
on the sensitivity of those
eyes, and this mind, your mind,

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.430
saying, who is this guy?

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.410
You can sense it?

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:28.370
You can see.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:29.430
Do I trust this?

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.630
Do I trust this person?

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.660
Is what's being said
reasonable with the intellect?

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:40.480
That everything I'm saying is
also through reading my face

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.840
and hearing my voice.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:48.400
Because this is what the
sensory systems were bred to do.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.040
It's in your genetics to
be able to read, am I safe?

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.930
That incredible
sensitivity now, combined

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:04.550
with all the other sensitivities
we were talking about,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:12.480
also creates a field for
desire and fear, right?

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.770
So now, the pleasures,
it's not just

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:19.980
sugar, suffering, sugar,
suffering, or cappuccino,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.910
suffering, right?

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:27.350
It's also seeing
the other person,

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:33.450
receiving and being seen by
the other person, or not.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:38.120
So then something
like loneliness.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.560
Loneliness is adaptive.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.820
From the standpoint of the
survival of the species,

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:49.370
loneliness, the pain of
loneliness, is adaptive.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:55.040
Because if you leave the
tribe, you're off on your own,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.820
the tribe gets weaker, and
you probably won't survive.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:05.360
So that sense of being
separate and outside,

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:11.040
actually, there's sensitive
systems through the eye

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:17.110
and the ear and the body that
say, oh, wow, something's

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.670
wrong here.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:19.940
This hurts.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.710
It's unpleasant.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.810
So there you are.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.870
Now, let's go back to the yeast.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:29.050
Unpleasant, need sugar,
only the sugar is the tribe.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.550
The sugar is my mother.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.010
The sugar is my friend.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.240
The sugar is my partner.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.970
So we're seeking that contact.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.310
And so now, we have
not only a craving

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:45.070
for what is sweet or
warm or something.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.830
We have a craving for the
other, the other person.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:57.110
And the urges in our lives drive
us towards that nourishment

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.870
and away from where
it's scary, right?

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.780
Which is also adaptive,
because maybe it was unsafe.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.560
But even where it's
not necessarily

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.890
threatening to
the physical body,

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.710
but to the emotional body.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:18.010
I'll just remind you that at
the level of the organism,

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:19.840
it's about survival.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.240
It's not as though
when someone's

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.620
really angry and aggressive that
you think that they're actually

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.270
going to murder you.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:35.240
But the urge to get away and the
feeling of contraction and fear

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.740
is happening as far as
this body mind knows

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.850
at the level of survival.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.470
There's a whole flush
of the hormonal systems

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.990
that say, get out.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.010
Get out is get out.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.290
Then, it's a matter of degree.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:05.740
So the urging to, for example,
exist and be seen by others

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:14.830
is a hunger that, just like
the urge to breathe and to eat,

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:21.740
rests in this wish not only
for pleasure, but for survival,

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.870
for existence.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.270
Because when you see me, I am.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:30.040
Because this sense of me came
up from the moment I was born.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.600
Let's say you're my mother.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.300
In that moment of
contact with my mother,

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.120
I began to feel like me.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.960
All my neural systems
weave together,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.440
I get this sense of me.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.405
Safety, ah!

00:26:43.405 --> 00:26:45.706
I can let go.

00:26:45.706 --> 00:26:46.620
And that's OK.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.120
So now, let's look at
this sensitive organism.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.460
And we can talk
about mindfulness

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.220
in a meaningful way.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.970
So here, we have the sensitivity
to the physical environment,

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:04.470
the touching of the eye,
the touching of the ear,

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.690
touching on the skin, and so on.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.280
The touching now
also of the mind,

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.520
all the thoughts
when they come up.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:22.240
And when what is seen or
heard is another human being,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:28.270
then there is actually the
recruitment of neural systems

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:32.000
that have evolved
to be sensitive

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.980
to other human beings.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:39.980
And they, too, are feeding
into this whole assessment

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.740
of how I am in the world.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.630
Am I getting what
I want and staying

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.010
away from what I don't want?

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.770
And I'm driven by that.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:54.880
And the sugar, suffering,
sugar, suffering pattern,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.160
at all of its levels, the level
not just of sensual pleasure,

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:07.350
but of survival and of
safety has worked together

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:12.580
with this astonishing intellect
and these incredibly complex

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.770
social systems that we
have built together,

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.310
patterns and layers
on top of layers,

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:23.430
on top of layers,
where multiples of us

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:29.130
are creating social systems with
all these aspects of pleasure

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.330
and safety and so on.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:39.880
And so it's sugar, suffering,
and now the suffering

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.930
is this urging, this
urging for these pleasures,

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.460
urging for survival,
and just urging

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.460
to get out because
it's too much.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.570
It's just too much
because of the sensitivity

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.400
we've described.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.860
It's like, how do
you turn that off?

00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:01.480
So we find ways to get out,
whether it's alcohol and drugs,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.370
or just losing
ourselves in media,

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:08.520
all kinds of ways of dulling
the sensitivity, right?

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.290
So we have all of
this complexity.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:16.340
And that tension,
that sense of me,

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:22.680
that teeming, teeming
sense of, what now?

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.370
What now?

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.160
That's the dilemma.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.750
And that's where mindfulness
and other practices

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.270
can make a difference.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.080
Because all of
this is happening,

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.980
all of this construction
of the self,

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.030
this reaction to
sensory, reaction

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.220
to the interpersonal
contacts and so on,

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.960
is all happening
moment by moment.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.300
And we're completely
ignorant of it.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:57.760
And we're driven by these urges
to get and to get away from

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.550
and to gain safety and so on.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.390
And we don't even know it.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:14.830
We're automatons in our own
fabricated sensory social

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.700
miasma.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.080
We're just, wow, right?

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:26.260
That ignorance is what
allows it to keep going.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.750
That's why there's
so much stress,

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.162
because we don't see that
there's so much stress.

00:30:32.162 --> 00:30:34.120
And the reason we don't
see why there's so much

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.000
stress is because there's
so much stress, right?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.300
We don't take the time to look.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.980
The surface of the
sea is so turbulent we

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:43.910
can't see underneath.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.030
So we stay in that
kind of ignorance,

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:58.580
and sugar, suffering, sugar,
suffering, sugar, suffering,

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.350
and then we die.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:07.840
But what if, what if,
we could wake up in it?

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.620
It doesn't have to be that way.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.005
Is that the only
script that's possible?

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:25.740
So at essence, mindfulness
asks, what do I keep in mind?

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.520
That's what mindful
means, right?

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.560
It's like remembering something,
holding something in mind.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.720
What can I keep
in mind that will

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.470
help me wake up to how
things actually are, not just

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.460
my running around
in the rat cage

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:44.390
of my constructing process,
worried about how to perform,

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:50.940
or how to get out, or the
usual life, just life?

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.930
Is he going to like me?

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:52.929
Is she going to like me?

00:31:52.929 --> 00:31:54.370
Am I going to get a raise?

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.200
Is my car going to work?

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.350
Will I ever get that
Maserati, and will I

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.750
ever eat caviar all day?

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:01.629
You know, that's it.

00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:02.920
Can we do any better than that?

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:22.950
So the power of mindfulness, of
holding in mind something like,

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.577
let's say this question,
what's going on right now?

00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:28.410
Let's say that's what
we're holding in mind.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:29.900
It's like a question.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.670
What is my experience right now?

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.940
You understand?

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:39.900
So any time that I remember
to ask that question,

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:44.930
maybe I can begin
to see a little bit,

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:52.440
or remember to even look at
this turbulent surface of moment

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.580
by moment experience.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.820
Maybe it's still turbulent.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.810
But I begin to look.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:05.590
So the first affordance
of mindfulness

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:06.600
is going to be what?

00:33:09.507 --> 00:33:10.840
Knowing that there's turbulence.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.840
It's not going to be
all sweet and light.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.860
You're going to see the
mind as it actually is,

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:24.050
not how you want it to be.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.980
So that can be pretty
discouraging, right?

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.820
I mean, wow, I
think I'll go back

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.670
to being deluded,
ignorant, and dizzy-minded.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:37.990
At least I didn't know
that it was so bad!

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.754
But there's a lot of problems
with that, aside from the fact

00:33:41.754 --> 00:33:44.170
that sugar, suffering, sugar,
suffering, and then you die,

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.250
and it's all kind
of meaningless.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:52.410
But there's also a lot of
self-obsession in our suffering

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:56.010
and self-involvement
in our world.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.090
And yet, there's these
altruistic impulses

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:03.000
that are built into the
organism just as much

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.420
as this selfish urge to
survive and get pleasure.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:14.480
Because like I said, the social
evolution of the human species

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.420
was dependent upon
the development

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.310
of love and compassion.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:21.730
So that's also built in.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.150
So not only does
mindfulness open up

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.730
a look at what's
going on, and you

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.384
get to see the, oh my god,
I'm always self-obsessed.

00:34:28.384 --> 00:34:29.550
When am I going to get this?

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:30.110
Am I safe?

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.500
And all this kind of stuff.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.469
But you begin to see, oh.

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:34.760
There is this friendliness.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.510
There's this care.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:39.800
When I see your tenderness,
my heart vibrates.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.909
It does.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.480
And that's quite sweet.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.520
And that's part
of the deal, too.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:51.900
And so now, we begin to open
up to a moment by moment

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:58.360
experience in a way
that the road isn't just

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.280
going to be set by habit.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.430
It's a major change.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:05.590
It's a big, big change.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:17.180
If there's already some
kind of internal assurance

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:21.870
that mindfulness
is a useful thing,

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.880
like you go to look at a
video about mindfulness

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.060
because you heard it's a good
thing, or you came to this talk

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:34.550
because you're already convinced
that mindfulness is useful,

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:39.430
then perhaps you have come
to see that when you actually

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:44.945
go to practice, that very
often, the mind wanders off.

00:35:44.945 --> 00:35:48.585
But that's sort of built
in to the experience

00:35:48.585 --> 00:35:53.406
of even a short session,
literally even one minute,

00:35:53.406 --> 00:35:56.720
of mindfulness meditation.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.520
OK, so we'll stop.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.510
You say, what's your
mind doing right now?

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.940
And you can feel the
engine revving, right?

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.080
It's just like that
Ferrari of an engine

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.370
saying, give me
something to do, please!

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.210
You know, because that's it.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:21.580
We've got this power, this
convoluted, cortical power

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:27.430
built into this hormonal engine.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:28.575
Give me something to do.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.140
And that's what we're facing.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.760
So even a minute of
consistent remember

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.260
to notice what is happening
now is challenging,

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:47.120
let alone getting still
enough to see down

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.550
into each moment
of sensory contact,

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.390
social contact, and so on.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.350
So it's difficult.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:58.040
So there's all kinds of
practices, all kinds of tricks.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.850
Your one minute mindfulness,
your three minute mindfulness,

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.770
mindfulness at the
desk, mindfulness

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:06.460
while eating, mindful walking.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.510
There's all kinds of
practices and all kinds

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.710
of things you can try.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:19.170
I'm going to suggest just
very specifically and bluntly

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:27.650
that opening the
practice of mindfulness

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:35.400
beyond the isolated self unit is
an important and powerful thing

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.499
to do.

00:37:37.499 --> 00:37:39.290
So that's what I'm
going to talk about now.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.030
When we are practicing
mindfulness alone,

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:53.390
we have the great
benefit of simplicity.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:57.180
For example, if your practice
is one of closing the eyes

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:03.630
and just meditating and watching
the mind, watching the breath,

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:09.520
it's simple, and there's
not so much sensory input.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.400
Maybe the mind can calm down.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.750
The body can calm down.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:17.330
And there's always this
problem that we just

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:22.110
mentioned of all that horsepower
of the body mind system,

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.630
not knowing how to calm down.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:27.510
But gradually, this
has been trained.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.260
We begin to settle.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:35.350
But even as that
process gets stronger,

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:42.610
as you're able to sit, let's
say, longer, more calmly,

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:49.420
that very simplicity is both the
most profound gift of practice

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.460
because, ah, enough
of the world for now!

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.380
Just let me rest.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:13.460
But at the same time, when the
emergent stories of your mind

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.630
come forward, you know
how they hook you?

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.030
Have you practiced enough
watching your own mind

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.070
to know how you get hooked
by the next thought,

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:24.310
the next image?

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:28.300
Once you're hooked, how
do you get unhooked?

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.940
Your a self-contained system.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.900
There's nothing
else theoretically

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.890
coming in that's going
to help you get hooked.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.190
But now, let's say
I'm sitting with you.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.060
And you with me.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.660
And we have this agreement,
and this agreement

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:48.090
is, let's practice
mindfulness together.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:51.340
Let's enhance and
develop the ability

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.830
to remain in this
present moment.

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:57.780
I'll remind you,
and you remind me.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.860
So here we are.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.600
And we talk about
something, something

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.990
that has us looking at
moment by moment experience,

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.790
like let's say sensation
or thoughts or something.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:09.650
It doesn't matter the
practice right now.

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:15.440
But the point is because
I'm in front of you,

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:21.310
if I go off and start thinking
about my next vacation skiing

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:23.260
or something like
that, and you're

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:27.430
sitting there talking to
me, aside from being rude,

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.490
isn't it obvious
that I'm not present?

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:36.050
Or if you're talking to me, and
you completely wander and go

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:39.160
all over the place and
you're not alert and present,

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.080
I'm going to notice
that you're not present.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.450
You're going to begin to
notice that you're not present.

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.290
Just because I'm
here, not because I've

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.990
said anything or done
anything to you, just

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:55.750
the fact that there's someone
outside the system that says,

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:56.660
are you awake?

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.700
But when you tap
into-- when practice

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.850
gets more specific and stronger,
because insight dialogue

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:08.250
is actually quite a
specific practice.

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:12.660
When practice gets
specific and stronger,

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:19.430
then it's actually opening up
the pause that, in that moment,

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.840
all of those sensitivities
developed over millions

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:28.130
of years, me to
you and you to me,

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:33.690
now those sensitivities
are in play saying,

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.620
am I aware right now?

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.900
Are you aware right now?

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:43.060
And so that's
actually activated.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:48.550
So rather than being with you,
and that being a distraction,

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:52.160
all of a sudden, it is riveting.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:59.610
It's riveting to be in
that vibrating moment

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:04.430
where this sensitivity
is not denied.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.010
It's not pushed away.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.350
It's not fearful.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.190
But it's also not
grab [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.500
It's like, I'm not
being with you just

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.680
to have, let's say, the pleasure
of looking at someone lovely,

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.840
or that because
you're entertaining

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.670
me or something like that.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:25.250
I'm with you in the bare fact
of alertness, of sensitivity.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:30.680
And when my mind goes off
of that, you notice it.

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.120
If I start-- you
know what I mean?

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.956
You just get it.

00:42:35.956 --> 00:42:37.390
You get it, oh, wow.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:38.540
There is this moment.

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.590
We can locate this moment.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:46.550
We can touch this moment
and remind each other

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:48.275
with a refinement
that's astonishing.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:55.790
So now, we have this
doorway into the practice

00:42:55.790 --> 00:43:01.350
of mindfulness that
recruits this power

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:05.220
rather than be thrown off by it.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.400
Big difference,
because think about it.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:14.230
Isn't social contact
usually where

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:18.050
your mindfulness is weakest?

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:23.400
You can be totally great
chilling out on the cushion.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.440
You get up, you go
into your meeting,

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:32.910
or you go to your family,
or whatever, gone, right?

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:39.390
Because it takes such powerful
cognitive resources to engage

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:40.590
socially.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:47.640
And then, you become the
main self, you inhabit that,

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.300
and you're gone, basically.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.360
You're in the
fabricating process

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.770
of where is my pleasure?

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:54.820
Where's my safety?

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.290
Where's my stimulation?

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:57.520
And there you go.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.220
Then, you're just
back in the game.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.640
But when there's
intentionality as there

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:08.200
is in insight dialogue that says
we are gathered specifically

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:15.440
to cultivate
mindfulness and calm,

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.210
then you have set a
very different frame.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:26.000
And you've recruited the same
power that would draw you out

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.350
to bring you into the moment
with strength and endurance.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:38.720
So to foster that, there are
specific meditation guidelines.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.170
Pause is one of them.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.180
Pause is the first one.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.750
It's about mindfulness.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:48.380
It's about interrupting
the stream of habit.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:53.160
Relax is receiving,
accepting, allowing

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.990
what's happening in
the present moment.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:01.330
Then this guideline, open, is
establishing the mindfulness

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:06.970
both internally and externally
on the other and both.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.700
So you become
aware relationally.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:14.930
It opens out from
just this self unit.

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:19.450
And then, trust
emergence is pointing us

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.550
towards in that
moment where we're

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:25.770
both established
in awareness, there

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:31.070
is this attuning to
the impermanence,

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:34.780
attuning to the flow of
the flux of experience.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.500
And that's something
one learns to do.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.693
One can cultivate that
quality of adaptability.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.000
And then, speaking and
listening, speaking the truth,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.450
listening deeply, are
actually developed over time

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:55.090
as meditation
practices where there's

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:58.060
not only the
mindfulness of speech,

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:03.480
but internal
sensitivity to find out

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.710
what is true that I would speak.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:09.720
It's quite a delicate,
beautiful process.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.300
And listening deeply.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:16.260
Again, yes, there's mindfulness
as its basis, for sure.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:22.150
But it also has kind
of a receptivity

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:25.295
to experience to the
other, and a recognition

00:46:25.295 --> 00:46:28.090
that you're listening
musically just

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.480
as you're listening
linguistically.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.470
And you're listening just
with your whole sense

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.480
of being in that
moment of relationship.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:42.180
And what I've been seeing,
because I teach these retreats,

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:46.100
I teach insight dialogue
retreats all over the world.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.590
If you do this intensively
and you interleave

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.480
this insight dialogue practice
with silent meditation

00:46:52.480 --> 00:47:03.660
practice, the power of the
stilling, calming quality

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.420
and the refinement of
individual meditation

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.630
can help cut through
this entanglement

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:12.130
that we were talking about.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:18.410
And then, you can move into
the relational practice that

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:23.370
in some ways accelerates those
qualities of mindfulness,

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:28.460
concentration,
investigation, energy,

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:32.770
to really penetrate, what
is this entanglement?

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.090
Can I be free?

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.650
Is any kind of freedom possible?

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:40.150
Or is there only this
conditioned sugar, suffering,

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:43.640
death kind of cycle?

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:48.650
And what I've seen with
literally thousands

00:47:48.650 --> 00:48:00.490
of meditators is that the
depth of insight possible

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:07.240
is astonishing, really, to
me, anyway, very beautiful.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:14.980
And it's very much fitting
with the maps of insight,

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:21.070
the maps of human development
that are understood and known

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:24.580
over thousands of years in
traditional, contemplative

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:25.800
systems.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.770
Because my background is
as a Buddhist teacher.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:33.020
All my teachers were monks and
nuns in the Buddhist tradition.

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.160
And I have a lot of
training and a lot

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.700
of knowledge in that tradition.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.390
And that's mostly what I teach.

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:46.690
But it's understanding it as
a deeply human practice built

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:51.590
on this human entanglement and
this possibility for freedom.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:59.750
If you aim in that way for
either individual mindfulness

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:03.220
practice or relational
mindfulness practice,

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:08.435
if you aim for the
disentanglement, all

00:49:08.435 --> 00:49:11.910
of the other benefits
of mindfulness that

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:18.070
are so desired,
they come for free.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:23.050
Being more relaxed, being
more creative in your work.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.090
With relational
practice especially,

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:27.330
being able to work
well with others,

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:31.280
being sensitive
relationally, being skillful

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.295
in your relationships,
skillful in your speech.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:41.960
Those all come for free if you
focus on the disentangling,

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.130
because that's the
bigger problem,

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:47.640
and that's the core problem.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:50:02.850
And as a result, getting a
sense of this deeper potential,

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:05.800
both of, again, individual
mindfulness practice

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.170
or relational
mindfulness practice

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:10.580
would be really
helpful thing, I think,

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:18.725
for all of us who are involved
in the mindfulness activities

00:50:18.725 --> 00:50:23.620
that are so much needed
and growing in this world.

00:50:26.875 --> 00:50:29.310
So I'll leave you with that.

00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:45.340
And I guess just close
by saying the movement

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:50.900
of the mind towards
peacefulness,

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:58.000
towards kind of
freedom, is ultimately

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
not just a selfish endeavor.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.620
It really changes who
we are with other people

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.500
and how we act in the world.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:11.090
If we can invite that
directly into our practice

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:15.090
and realize that to
practice mindfulness

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:19.770
is to practice compassion,
to be sensitive to others,

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:24.240
it is to develop in
our own body minds

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:29.490
this capacity for loving
kindness for care,

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:32.060
if we don't see
that as separate,

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:35.940
then we can see we can
practice all the time.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.390
So thank you.

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:42.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:45.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: How do you stay
in mindfulness all the time?

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.080
Like, it's easy
to get distracted.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.830
But I know that
throughout practice, still

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:53.290
our mind is sometimes we can't
control it floating around.

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:55.910
So I'm just curious,
how's your day to day

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:58.185
like to stay mindful?

00:51:58.185 --> 00:51:59.660
And do you meditate
in the morning

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:02.316
to get better mindfulness?

00:52:02.316 --> 00:52:03.900
GREGORY KRAMER:
This is where I'm

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.680
really glad I laid
the groundwork.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.030
We have this question, how do
you stay mindful all the time?

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:10.890
Remember, the whole
first part of the talk I

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:13.420
was describing the tangle?

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:18.540
So we have to realize that this
human situation is complicated,

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.440
and that it's not easy.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.180
So you really want to come in
with patience and compassion

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.640
for yourself and diligence.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:32.240
Just steady, step by
step, remembering,

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.530
remembering, remembering,
how to remember.

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:38.140
Well, you could put
a band on your wrist

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:42.820
like Van was suggesting
at the beginning.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.160
And you can have
all sorts of tricks.

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.280
But yeah, you
really need to shift

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:52.580
the basic neural
hormonal subsystems

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.660
in a significant way.

00:52:54.660 --> 00:53:02.530
And for me, a nice, longer
meditation time, especially

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:06.650
in the morning, for example,
really is important.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:10.980
Because if you can
just for a moment

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:15.880
step out of the system of
fabrication, then you remember.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:20.230
Oh right, there is a
difference, just that much.

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.750
And then the rest of the
day, you might be in it.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:25.690
But you know you're in it.

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:27.020
That's a big difference.

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:30.680
Then, the heart
begins to yearn to not

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.900
be a slave of that system.

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.330
And that yearning
is your motivation.

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:39.800
That kind of fire says, oh, boy!

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.040
I thought this was really OK,
being totally tense and totally

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.660
driven by hunger all the time.

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.210
It was like, that was OK!

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:48.440
Now, I don't think it's OK.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.550
Something like that.

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:50.570
And you begin to change.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.020
Say, I want to be awake.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.920
I really want to be awake
because it's less suffering.

00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:02.190
And lo and behold, I'm kinder,
I'm smarter, a lot smarter.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:05.610
So you begin to have the
carrot and the stick that's

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:08.580
moving you forward.

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:11.850
Also, if you can ever
get off on a retreat--

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:13.570
I know it's hard to
do with a busy life.

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:16.040
But if you can ever get away
for a couple of days or a week

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:18.970
or something to go
deep into practice,

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:23.800
then you touch a
quality of experience

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:30.880
that is really different than
the mundane, entangled way

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.920
of being.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.080
It's really different.

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.240
And you say, oh!

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.420
That's what we're talking about.

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.310
And then again, you
get the inspiration.

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:43.100
You have a sense of
direction that mind

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.470
is intending in a certain.

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:48.660
And then, you get practices.

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.212
Who are your friends?

00:54:50.212 --> 00:54:51.420
Who are you hanging out with?

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.670
You don't have to answer this.

00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:54.100
Don't worry.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.652
I mean, who are you
hanging out with?

00:54:55.652 --> 00:54:57.110
Are you hanging
out with people who

00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:00.530
don't care about that,
or are, let's say,

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:02.980
getting either
intoxicated or who

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:06.630
feed on high level distraction?

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.260
Because that just
feels like life?

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.410
Well then, you're going
to fall into that.

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:13.790
So those kinds of
social decisions

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:15.600
make a big difference, actually.

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:21.220
It's not a popular thing to say,
but I believe it to be true.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:24.040
MAKE SPEAKER: So just to prevent
this from being misinterpret,

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:27.590
I'll mention this is coming
from a partner dance background.

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:31.290
I'm curious what place
you see for physicality

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:33.930
in your system of
developing active listing

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.907
and awareness of other people.

00:55:35.907 --> 00:55:37.490
GREGORY KRAMER:
You're asking, and you

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:40.399
have a particular interest from
the partner dance, you said?

00:55:40.399 --> 00:55:41.440
MAKE SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.940
GREGORY KRAMER: No,
no, that's good.

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:46.590
I just want to name that
because there are so many

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:53.630
skillful ways, skillful
doorways into being more awake.

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:58.470
My particular background
has me inclining

00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:03.960
to these meditative
practices that

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.930
are either in silent
meditation, look

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.950
very much like regular
silent meditation,

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:10.110
because it is, right?

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:13.670
And in dialogic
meditation, of course

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.650
if you're introducing
speaking and listening,

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:19.520
it's already from a Buddhist
standpoint quite radical.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:24.440
But then what you talk about
is the lived human experience

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.860
according to a framework
that says, look over here.

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.310
Tell me what you see.

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:31.130
And let's talk about that.

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:32.510
So it's guided.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.410
And that's skillful.

00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:36.760
You have all kinds
of movement systems

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:43.550
from Chi Gong to yoga to dance
that engage the physical body

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:47.430
in incredibly skillful
ways, ways that,

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:51.770
in the case of partnered stuff,
really create a communications

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:53.640
channel.

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.180
I would just turn it back.

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:57.740
And then you could answer
the question yourself.

00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:00.300
How is the development
of mindfulness involved?

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:02.430
So you get that
there's an energy.

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:04.680
You get that there's
some sense of inquiry,

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.310
and maybe calming, tranquility.

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:10.650
But is there are
also the, hm, what's

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:13.770
going on right now
question being asked?

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:15.340
I'm not saying
there is or isn't.

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:19.260
But that's what I
would ask, yeah.

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:22.610
That's all I have to say.

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:25.120
Within inside dialogue
retreats, there

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.640
are various periods of
movement and so on to bring

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:34.460
the life to the body to bring
ease and comfort to the body

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.570
and so on.

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:41.770
But it's not as nuanced and
skillful as a lot of other body

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:44.388
based practices.

00:57:44.388 --> 00:57:48.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm pretty
new to studying and trying

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:50.010
to practice mindfulness.

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.080
And a question that
keeps coming up for me

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.490
is that I see here a
lot of people talking

00:57:56.490 --> 00:58:01.380
about mindfulness in a way
that's just very accepting

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:05.970
of everything and everyone with
this compassion, which is good.

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:10.150
But how does mindfulness
come into play

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:12.820
when there is an actual
danger, or you actually

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:16.590
do need to get away from people
or situations that are actually

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:19.120
harmful?

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.350
Is that wrong to do that?

00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:29.170
Some people have this
sense like, no, nothing

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:30.070
is good or bad.

00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:32.980
And everything is just this
base level happy all the time.

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:36.410
And I don't think that's
truly what mindfulness is.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:38.860
But I think that's where a
lot of people want to take it.

00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:39.270
GREGORY KRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:40.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:44.120
And it's just
actually staying away.

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.250
But boundaries are
actually important

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:49.370
in interpersonal relationships.

00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:52.156
And how does mindfulness
play into that?

00:58:52.156 --> 00:58:53.780
GREGORY KRAMER: I
would put what you're

00:58:53.780 --> 00:59:00.610
asking in a context of ethics.

00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:05.220
So am I causing harm?

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.580
Are others causing harm to me?

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:11.820
And so that's a starting
point for saying, for example,

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:14.390
there are boundaries.

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:17.120
How are those established?

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.820
How do we treat each other
with care and respect?

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.104
And if someone isn't treating
us with care and respect, what

00:59:23.104 --> 00:59:24.020
are we supposed to do?

00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.815
Just ignore that and
everything's groovy,

00:59:27.815 --> 00:59:29.950
no problem?

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:35.690
That's not very wise because
harm can be done in this world.

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:38.020
That's not news.

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:42.116
And harm could be anywhere
from the obvious physical harm

00:59:42.116 --> 00:59:44.685
to emotional abuse and beyond.

00:59:47.714 --> 00:59:55.610
So there's the standpoint
of the practice

00:59:55.610 --> 01:00:02.010
the subtlety of development
of mindfulness and so on

01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:05.380
that requires safety.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:10.650
And in the case of a group
or a retreat or something,

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.070
it's up to the
person who's convened

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.010
that or the entity
that's convened

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:19.120
that to really
guard that safety.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.330
And as a teacher,
I can tell you I

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:23.420
take that as a
very high priority.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.010
And I would imagine
that any group

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:29.440
you would do, for example
here, would be really cared

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.120
for in that way
and watched over.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.980
However, out in the
world where there's not

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.420
necessarily a
contract being held

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:49.150
to for interpersonal
safety and so on,

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:52.400
I would not put
that in the context

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.320
of a formal practice
of mindfulness.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:01:00.170
That's where your mindfulness
is going to come to serve you.

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:01.710
So am I safe?

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:04.530
And you know what's
going on in the mind.

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:06.430
You know what's
going on in the body.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:10.150
And you can touch
down into that sense

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:15.860
of being ill at ease of
being violated or potentially

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.880
violated in some way.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.690
And then you say,
this isn't safe.

01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:21.490
You get up.

01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:23.580
You walk out.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:29.350
But all in all, the
notion of, let's say,

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:31.820
mindfulness practices
or spiritual practices

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:37.510
or what have you as being
like, everything's groovy,

01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:46.240
is a gross distortion of what
being awake really points to.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.320
Because being awake is
being awake to actuality.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:57.450
And there is a tremendous
amount of degraded,

01:01:57.450 --> 01:02:00.580
let's say, activity
in this world.

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:04.560
And even subtly,
power differentials,

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.300
racial discrimination.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:11.305
All kinds of things that
make for a lack of safety.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.430
And certainly in
interpersonal practices,

01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:20.830
you also have all the
potential sexual nuances,

01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:25.090
if partners who might be
attracted to each other,

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:28.820
whether it's male male,
female female, or male female,

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:29.760
however it goes.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:41.580
There's the potential for a
kind of unwise way of engagement

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:46.040
that's based on urges for
pleasure, and confusion,

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.832
and basically objectifying
the other person.

01:02:50.832 --> 01:02:52.582
And then if that person
happens to be you,

01:02:52.582 --> 01:02:56.130
it's absolutely not OK.

01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:57.860
And that's to be known.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.250
That's to be spoken.

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:04.950
So yeah, I don't know if
I answered your question.

01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:08.320
But I hope it at least
dispels any notion

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.860
of the kind of
practices I'm talking

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.430
about as being
everything's groovy

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:17.075
all the time kinds of attitudes.

01:03:19.365 --> 01:03:20.240
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.880
I guess other than
just dispelling

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.320
that notion, how
does mindfulness help

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.740
with I guess
interpersonal conflict,

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:39.700
where it's not just necessarily
to get away from something

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:44.360
that's actually unsafe, but in
terms of just people who are

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.040
not necessarily part of your
retreat or something like that,

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.280
you're dealing with the
world, conflict with people.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.630
How does mindfulness
help with that?

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:55.960
Or just one example.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.310
I'm sure there's many.

01:03:57.310 --> 01:04:06.280
GREGORY KRAMER: Well, Jesus
said, wherever two or more

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.220
are gathered, there
am I among them.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:09.880
That's great.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.070
That's beautiful.

01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:12.840
I have a little twist on that.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:18.350
Wherever two or more are
gathered, it gets complicated.

01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:18.970
Right?

01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:20.020
And that's just true.

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:24.180
And if there's more, it
gets more complicated.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:28.560
So if you just look at--
I'll get to your question

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.170
more exactly.

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:31.630
But we have to again
deal with the basics.

01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:36.270
You're taking the most complex
thing in the known universe,

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:42.400
which is the human body mind,
and you're putting two of them

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.290
together.

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:45.790
Whoa!

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:48.880
All these sensor arrays
are going like crazy,

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.840
and all the neural networks
are vibrating all internally

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.850
within one systems.

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:55.170
It's like, who am I?

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:55.680
Where am I?

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.270
Am I safe?

01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:58.530
I have to accomplish my stuff!

01:04:58.530 --> 01:04:59.310
You're in my way!

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:00.160
Get out of my way!

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.660
And then comes abuse
back and forth,

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:05.300
unkindness, or
maybe it's not even

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.460
unkindness intended
to be unkind.

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.580
It's just like, I've
got a job to do.

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:11.110
What's with you?

01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:14.600
You should have had that
on my desk, whatever.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.210
But what it is, it's
just this system

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:19.940
internally incredibly agitated.

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.480
This one maybe
was less agitated,

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:25.380
but now it's getting really
agitated as this one.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:32.390
So now you have these two
incredible, sensitive organisms

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:34.300
interacting.

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:41.250
So the first thing is to say,
am I right and this guy wrong?

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.390
Am I wrong and this guy right?

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:44.110
Stuff like that.

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:46.270
Maybe, maybe not.

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:47.770
What am I feeling?

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:48.600
Am I safe?

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.730
Am I not safe?

01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:53.330
What is he or she feeling?

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:54.910
Is there pain?

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:56.700
Is there aggression?

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.190
What's going on?

01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:03.180
And so now, the sensor
arrays, all that data

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:07.520
coming in moving through
not just perception,

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.410
but all of our memories,
all of our conditioning

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:12.230
is what's acting.

01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:17.330
Are we reacting
completely slavishly

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:18.840
based on that conditioning?

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:24.110
Or is there in that
moment mindfulness

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:28.220
of how I actually feel,
what's actually happening,

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:30.220
how this person
might be, and so on?

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.150
It's very difficult sometimes.

01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:36.360
Because when the
emotional stuff comes in,

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.500
it hijacks the attention.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:46.330
And we move into the internal
loops of our concerns

01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:48.900
about safety or getting
something done or getting out

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.810
there, whatever.

01:06:51.810 --> 01:07:02.680
So mindfulness opens up a
choice at such a moment.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.385
Do I pause?

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:11.530
Do I actually try to
down regulate and assess?

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:16.820
And can I be open to this,
not open like spill my guts,

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:20.310
but can I be sensitive to
how this person's doing?

01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:22.050
Do I fall into judgment?

01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:26.690
Do I fall into my
rightness and my stance?

01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:32.120
Because who knows, you may
have some baggage, too.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:38.050
And a level of skill that comes
out of that kind of activity,

01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:43.240
rather than whatever you were
conditioned to just shoot out

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.410
at that moment.

01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:48.190
And then, the system resonates
as you go back and forth

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:53.240
with this other person towards
anger, delusion, and so.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:08:00.100
So it's possible to cut
that feedback system.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.454
And that's a big step forward.

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.720
If you're asking
me how, then that's

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.800
a matter of-- then that is a
significant matter of practice

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.930
and developing the ability to
not be carried away, to pause,

01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:19.640
and to skillfully
observe the body mind.

01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:29.660
And have the intentions
for tolerance, also.

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:32.120
You know how much
you're suffering, right?

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.580
How much are they suffering?

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:37.220
Life is hard for everyone.

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:41.090
That's hard to remember
when it's hard for you.

01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:46.290
But maybe that's the better
time to actually remember, also.

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:49.356
Thanks, good question.

01:08:49.356 --> 01:08:50.689
VAN: Thank you so much, Gregory.

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:51.720
GREGORY KRAMER: Thank you, Van.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.370
Thank you, everybody,
for listening.

01:08:53.370 --> 01:08:56.452
It was nice to be with you.

01:08:56.452 --> 01:08:59.870
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:02.560
So if you want to find out
more about this practice,

about the retreats,
about online practices,

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:10.819
