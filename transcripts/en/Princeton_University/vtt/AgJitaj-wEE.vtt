00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.500
SILAS RIENER: The work of Merce Cunningham spanned over
fifty years of dance repertory that he created.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.300
SILAS RIENER: It looks more like a collage of different
pieces that Merce choreographed, that I have

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.710
selected particularly for the Princeton students;
which comprises dance repertory from the 1960's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.450
to the 2000's in Merce's work. And that's
what I've done both for the Princeton Art

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.200
Museum Event on February 14th and the Spring
Dance

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.200
Festival.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.729
ASAWARI SODHI: Talking to a lot of my friends about the Merce
Cunningham work, just because things like

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.860
digitally generated movements, that's something
you don't encounter every day.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.439
AJ BRANNUM: In a way, you have to unlearn what you already
know in order to do this successfully. I don't

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.650
know, it always seems easier to start from
scratch than to have to really blow everything

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.970
apart, reassembling things in ways you'd never
expect.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.479
SILAS RIENER: Even if you're coming out of the hinge to
go down, which is fine with me, go from here

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.030
to the next thing and that, I think, will
give you the stability, yes, exactly.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.079
TESS BERHNARD: One of the great things about working with
Silas, pretty much in my dance experience

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.579
most dance teachers are retired performers.
Silas is so much in his prime, fresh out of

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.740
the Cunningham Company, and can really demonstrate
this work that he was performing just last

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.710
year or the year before. It's really different
than any other teacher I've ever had.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.149
SILAS RIENER: There's going to be audience all the way around
at the museum. There's no proscenium, there's

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.560
no lights...

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.270
COLBY HYLAND: Silas definitely took a lot of time explaining
each step, and how he took Merce's original

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.599
notes, how he transitioned from each movement
and the timing...it's so intricate, and

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.540
I think it's really amazing how he transformed
that and set it all on us, who, a lot of us

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.980
I don't think have ever done it before.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.319
AJ BRANNUM: The end of February is the Spring Dance Festival.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.489
COLBY HYLAND: We're performing February 22nd to the 24th
at the Berlind Theater.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.400
AJ BRANNUM: So the Cunningham piece will be in this. There'll
also be works by Mark Morris, Zvi Gotheiner,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.410
Karole Armitage, Laura Peterson... it's a
lot of good stuff.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.480
SILAS RIENER: To feel comfortable, in addition to feeling
like I have something now to offer back to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.319
the university community at large, feels really
special.
