00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
this practice this is and this was the
 

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.820 align:start position:0%
this practice this is and this was the

shown outside of the community this was
 

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.020 align:start position:0%
shown outside of the community this was

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:39.030 align:start position:0%
at the new school and so one of the
 

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.730 align:start position:0%
at the new school and so one of the

things that was quite interesting to me
 

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.350 align:start position:0%
things that was quite interesting to me
was<00:22:40.920><c> to</c><00:22:41.070><c> think</c><00:22:41.160><c> about</c><00:22:41.370><c> well</c><00:22:41.520><c> how</c><00:22:41.670><c> can</c><00:22:41.730><c> this</c><00:22:41.910><c> be</c>

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
was to think about well how can this be
 

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
was to think about well how can this be

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:45.090 align:start position:0%
another sort of space and so you know
 

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.670 align:start position:0%
another sort of space and so you know
who<00:22:45.300><c> are</c><00:22:45.480><c> the</c><00:22:45.660><c> audiences</c><00:22:46.200><c> and</c><00:22:46.320><c> who</c><00:22:46.470><c> are</c><00:22:46.560><c> the</c>

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
who are the audiences and who are the
 

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.410 align:start position:0%
who are the audiences and who are the

00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
the opening was someone asked me what
 

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.350 align:start position:0%
the opening was someone asked me what

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
the eventual goal of this project was
 

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.820 align:start position:0%
the eventual goal of this project was

and I realized that really quite simply
and<00:23:04.980><c> I</c><00:23:05.070><c> think</c><00:23:05.280><c> my</c><00:23:05.580><c> answer</c><00:23:05.820><c> sort</c><00:23:06.180><c> of</c><00:23:06.240><c> surprised</c>

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:06.570 align:start position:0%
and I think my answer sort of surprised
 

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
and I think my answer sort of surprised
her<00:23:06.720><c> I</c><00:23:06.810><c> said</c><00:23:06.990><c> well</c><00:23:07.170><c> actually</c><00:23:07.470><c> that</c><00:23:07.980><c> it's</c>

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
experience of it was often much more sad
 

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.730 align:start position:0%
experience of it was often much more sad
and<00:41:58.010><c> and</c><00:41:59.599><c> that</c><00:42:00.599><c> community</c><00:42:01.170><c> is</c><00:42:01.380><c> very</c>

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
and and that community is very
 

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.859 align:start position:0%
and and that community is very

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:06.210 align:start position:0%
to put yourself first before others and
 

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:08.990 align:start position:0%

so<00:42:07.109><c> that</c><00:42:07.529><c> interview</c><00:42:08.160><c> would</c><00:42:08.279><c> be</c>

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
so that interview would be
 

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.630 align:start position:0%
so that interview would be

they're like but we saw it on TV and you
 

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.540 align:start position:0%
they're like but we saw it on TV and you

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:20.550 align:start position:0%
did and so they were in and so then they
 

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.099 align:start position:0%
did and so they were in and so then they
just<00:42:20.580><c> shut</c><00:42:20.970><c> up</c><00:42:21.119><c> because</c><00:42:21.359><c> they</c><00:42:21.570><c> didn't</c><00:42:21.840><c> want</c><00:42:22.050><c> to</c>

00:42:22.099 --> 00:42:22.109 align:start position:0%
just shut up because they didn't want to

show<00:42:22.290><c> their</c><00:42:22.470><c> stories</c><00:42:23.119><c> so</c><00:42:24.119><c> I</c><00:42:25.280><c> was</c><00:42:26.280><c> thinking</c>

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:26.670 align:start position:0%
show their stories so I was thinking
 

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.460 align:start position:0%
show their stories so I was thinking
about<00:42:26.790><c> stories</c><00:42:27.480><c> being</c><00:42:27.780><c> the</c><00:42:27.930><c> first</c><00:42:28.200><c> way</c><00:42:28.440><c> that</c>

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:28.470 align:start position:0%
about stories being the first way that
 

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.710 align:start position:0%
about stories being the first way that
we<00:42:28.650><c> can</c><00:42:28.830><c> own</c><00:42:28.980><c> our</c><00:42:29.010><c> own</c><00:42:29.310><c> experience</c><00:42:30.150><c> of</c><00:42:30.420><c> these</c>

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
we can own our own experience of these
 

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
we can own our own experience of these
kinds<00:42:31.050><c> of</c><00:42:31.109><c> events</c><00:42:31.560><c> and</c><00:42:31.790><c> so</c><00:42:32.790><c> I</c><00:42:34.070><c> decided</c><00:42:35.070><c> to</c>

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:35.250 align:start position:0%
kinds of events and so I decided to

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:37.470 align:start position:0%
create this project voices of 9/11 and
 

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.500 align:start position:0%
create this project voices of 9/11 and
