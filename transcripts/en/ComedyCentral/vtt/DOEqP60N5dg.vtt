I'm here at VidCon.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:04.304 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
I'm gonna ask some people
some hypothetical questions.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.538 line:0%
They're gonna tell me
what they woulda did.

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.573
I'm gonna tell them
what I woulda did.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.775
This is What I Woulda Did.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.010
- Stop.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.878
You're too old for
this, I'm sorry.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:13.146
- You say I'm too old for this?

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.314
- Yup.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:15.448
- Can I speak to
your supervisor?

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.816
- I'm the supervisor.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.286
- I guess we'll be
going somewhere else.

If you're friend disappeared,

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.426 line:0%
what would you take
from his house first?

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.927
- Probably the dog, Bubba.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:28.962
- Oh, you'd go get his dog?

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.196
- Yeah, 'cause I live with him.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.898
So, it's like, I
raised it too, so.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.200 align:start size:88% position:13%
- If my friend
disappeared, first thing

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.003
I'm getting from the house,
is I'm getting the computer,

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.372
and I'm deleting erry-thing.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.640
'Cause that's my friend.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.941
I know my friend.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.176
Any of them.

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:46.579 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
What would you do if
someone gets too excited

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.715 line:0%
while you're telling
them sex information?

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.583
- Like, a little like,
you could tell, like it

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.918 align:start size:84% position:16%
starts to pop?
- Excited, just oop.

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.186
- I would assume
that that person

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.854
would probably be
mortified, so I

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.689
wouldn't call attention to it.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.957
Eyes up here.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.793
- What I woulda did,
I would just start

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.062 align:start size:84% position:16%
talkin' about worst
case scenario penises.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.296
- Oh.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.564
- You know, you
know what I mean?

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.932
Like, when like, if
they have something,

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.367 align:start size:94% position:6%
and like, start
describing like, "Now with

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.968
"chlamydia, what
happens is, if you

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.071
"let it go on for 19 years."

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.307 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
What would you do if you
found a unicorn pony?

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.243 line:0%
- How thick are the
legs of this pony?

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.379
I think I'd, if I could ride it,

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
but I would need to look
at the legs closely.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.283
- Oh, you're gon' get in there,

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:24.317
you're gonna, if he lets
you, you know what I mean?

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:25.151
Or if he, she--

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.086
- Now, are you, milk it?

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.020
- What are you grabbing there?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.954
- That's just the legs, I think.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.122
I think I'm grabbing the legs.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.757
- You're milking a unicorn pony.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.560
- Do you think the
milk would be good?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.095
- It's like Skittle milk.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.764 align:start size:94% position:6%
Have you ever, have you
ever put Skittles in milk?

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.733 line:0%
- What would you do if
you spoke in Autotune,

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.203 line:0%
but rapped and sung
in a normal voice?

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:45.271
- I would probably
do a lot of texting.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.439
(Chris laughs)

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.007
Or you know. (laughs)

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.276
- Do you think people would
think you're in The Matrix?

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.678
- In the Ma-, well, (laughs).

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.048
I'm tryin' to get the connection

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.282
from the voice to The Matrix.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.851 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't know,
it's computer stuff.

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.353 line:0%
What would you do if you
start laughing too hard

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:01.921 line:0%
at a joke told by a non-friend?

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:04.457 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know, that one dude on the
side who just keep laughing

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.658 align:start size:75% position:25%
too hard, like?
- Yeah.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:06.693 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, you gotta
start roasting him.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:07.527
- Yeah yeah, yeah yeah.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:08.795
- Whatchu laughin' at?

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.797 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You gotta have this
hand, right here.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:11.898
- I gotta?

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:12.699 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah it's
- Whatchu laughin' at?

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.100
- It's fired down.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.901
It's what--

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.069
- You do?

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.137 align:start size:84% position:16%
We always say,
"(beep) outta here,"

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.138
and then you come up.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.240
I don't know you.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.841
But them sneaks, though.

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.276
And then you go away.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.544 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So you're establishing.
- I'm already hurt.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:25.512
- You're establishing
territory, you gotta,

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:26.779
no, I get it.
- Oh, yeah.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.381
You gotta flare up, you
gotta chest out on 'em.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.017 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Chest out, arm up.
- You're a compound roaster.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:34.254
- What would you do
if in your videos,

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.822
you couldn't add
a dramatic noise?

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.257
(dramatic horns)

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:39.125 line:0%
What do you do if
the government gave

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.495 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
black people reparations,
but it was literally,

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.930
three acres and a mule?

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.398
- Well I would build a house.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:47.033
- [Chris] You would build
a house on your acres.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.868
- I would start my own compound,

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.737
and I would start preparing
for the end of the world.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:51.905
- Okay, because you know if they

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.139 align:start size:84% position:16%
gave back the
reparations, things--

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.607 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Things are already
down the drain.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.875 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like, it's already, we're
already going there.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:57.243 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The Space Force
done launched, baby.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.778
- Yeah.

00:02:58.778 --> 00:02:59.512
- Listen, in this video,
we're gonna find one gem.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.647
It's all edited.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.649 align:start size:84% position:16%
They call me,
fix-it-in-post Chris.
