[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.650
ROMAN NURIK: Hello, and welcome
to Android Design in

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.780
Action, the third episode
of this awesome show.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.755
I'm Roman Nurik, your host.

00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:17.420
I'm broadcasting live
from New York City.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.220
And we're joined to my right
by Nick Butcher, coming in

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.615
live from London.

00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:24.450
NICK BUTCHER: Hello.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.750
And welcome back from
your holiday, Roman.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.190
I hope you enjoyed the shore.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.530
ROMAN NURIK: Thank you.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.120
Thank you, Nick.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.340
It was quite an awesome
holiday.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.970
We actually went to San
Diego, which was nice.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.730
And I caught up on the
show that you and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.940
Adam did last week.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.240
It was quite good.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.840
Very good job.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.220
NICK BUTCHER: Thank you.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.100
ROMAN NURIK: So those of you
that this is I guess your

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.450
first time watching, Android
Design in Action is a show

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.840
where we basically look at some
of the apps that were

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.630
previously reviewed in the
Friday App Clinic broadcast

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.020
from Mountain View.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.340
And we take a look at them in
more detail visually, kind of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.560
more from a design standpoint.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.650
And we also re-imagine
them, give them a

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.580
makeover if you will.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.820
So today, we're going to look
at a few camera apps,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.690
specifically Camera Zoom
FX and Glimmr.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.360
So let's just get right into
it and start with our first

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.830
app, Camera Zoom FX.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.680
So Camera Zoom FX is basically
a camera replacement that

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.200
gives you tons and tons of
additional features.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.030
It gives you special effects,
things like overlays, things

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.400
like borders, hipster filters.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.950
If you can see here, there's
that FX button.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.360
And it also gives you a bunch
of customizable settings for

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.210
your camera like zoom and flash
and things like that.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.570
It also lets you customize the
type of camera you use.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.720
So you can use--

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.400
or the type of shutter,
I guess.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.570
You could use a single shot.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.710
You could use kind
of a time lapse.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.020
You could use an interval or a
countdown, things like that.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.050
So we had a couple of comments
on this app, a couple of

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.680
visual comments.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.570
And I'll start it.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.830
And Nick will jump in as well.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.470
I guess the first couple of
comments that I had visually

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.580
are basically there's a lot
of controls on the screen.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.220
And you can see that there's
some controls on the left and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.310
some controls on the right.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.770
And there doesn't seem to be a
strong order or purpose for

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.760
the placement of
these controls.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.090
The other thing you can't really
see here, but a lot of

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.180
the assets were blurry.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.560
And they weren't optimized
for XHDPI devices.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.660
And this is something that
we see pretty often.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.370
And it's something that's very
easy to fix normally.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.750
And there's really also a
mixed bag of styling.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.870
There's these faux-3D
skeuomorphic

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.330
elements on the right.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.660
There's these gradient custom 3D
elements on the top right.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.520
And then on the left, you
have flatter icons.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.000
So the styling was really
interspersed.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.220
There's different kinds
of styles throughout.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.080
So that was one thing that we
wanted to look into changing.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.660
And you'll see in the next
couple of screens as we review

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.530
those that there are also
different styles for the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.030
different pop-ups and dialogs
that come up.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.910
Also, you'll notice
that there's the--

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.430
actually, Nick, do you want to
say anything about these three

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.310
little dots on the top right?

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.470
NICK BUTCHER: The
button of shame.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.040
ROMAN NURIK: The button
of shame.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.660
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so this is
for developers who haven't yet

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.040
optimized their application to
run on devices with software

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.920
navigation keys.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.500
And so you get this
emulated button.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.860
And it's kind of ugly, and
kind of hard to hit, and

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.660
doesn't really offer the best
experience for your users.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.100
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.920
And any other thoughts on
Camera Zoom FX, Nick, or

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.365
should we jump into
the redesign?

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:56.740
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I think the
two major things for me

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.070
was the inconsistent styling,
which wasn't really the

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.380
Android Holo type theme that
you would expect perhaps,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.650
coupled with just some clarity
about what the iconography

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.850
meant and how to actually
use the app.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.800
We found that if you just look
at the screen, it isn't too

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.150
intuitive how to go about it.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.300
So let's see what
we do with it.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.630
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.860
So let's look at the redesign.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.400
And you can see here that most
of the placement, I guess, the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.570
general placement, having
controls on the left and the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.980
right of the screen, we kept.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.740
But we did do a couple
things differently.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.660
And let me talk through all
those individual points.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.230
So the first thing is that we
wanted to simplify the mental

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.020
model for users.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.990
We basically put camera
and camera-related

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.610
settings on the right.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.460
So all on the right, you see
things like focus, change the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.580
camera from front to
back, take a photo,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.990
settings, and then zoom.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.390
And then on the left,
we just put effects.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.250
So everything that is kind of
the special sauce of this app,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.550
the effects and the cool things
you can do to your

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.060
photos, we put on the left.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.470
So it simplifies the
model for users.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.280
The other thing that we did, and
you'll see this later on,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.820
is that we combined the settings
here, this shutter

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.310
type setting, with other camera
settings that were, I

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.870
think, under this button.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.220
We combined that into a single
affordance here.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.800
And we'll see an example
of that in a bit.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.970
The other thing I wanted to
point out is that we made the

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.160
actual shutter button larger.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.740
And this is actually coming
from feedback that Ian

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.930
mentioned in the App
Clinic last week.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.570
Basically, if you place
something very close to a

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.340
system button like the Home
button, users are very likely

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.510
to hit that button
accidentally.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.130
And so here, what we did was
we made the camera button

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.260
larger both horizontally and
vertically so the tap target

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
is much more obvious.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.560
We also put a lights out mode
so that you hide the Home

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.030
button, the Back button, and the
Recent button so that it

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.740
doesn't crowd your vision.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.720
And another thing I'll mention
is that we used more standard

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.200
iconography throughout,
and a standard style.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:24.370
We used a Holo dark style on a
semi-transparent action bar.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.150
So you'll see here that
a lot of these icons

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.640
are more common icons.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.450
I do want to point out that
some of these icons are

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.230
actually from androidicons.com
by Guenther Beyer.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.050
And we mentioned Guenther's
work on the first

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.540
episode of the show.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.300
So a lot of these icons are
from there as well.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.000
So thanks, Guenther.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.990
The last thing I want to mention
is I guess about--

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.500
actually, there's
a caveat here.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.330
You'll notice that there's these
not really action bars.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.660
There are these control bars on
the left and the right And

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.415
they're semi-transparent.

00:06:57.415 --> 00:07:00.420
Now, if you've developed a
camera app before, you may

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.120
think, oh, it's not always
the case that I can get a

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.060
full-screen picture,
a full-screen view.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.970
So in those cases when you don't
have a full-screen view,

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.180
there are a couple of options.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.760
You can do letter boxing.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.670
You can also choose to make
either the left or the right

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.990
control bar fully black instead
of semi-transparent.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.640
And there's lots of other
options that you could do.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.310
And I think in a very fancy
case, you could even start

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.440
mirroring the edges of the
screen or mirroring the edges

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.990
of the preview around the
borders, things like that.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.300
OK, so that's the design
at a glance.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.370
Nick, do you have any
comments on the

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.030
difference between the two?

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.190
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I
instantly loved the

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.040
improvements on the shutter
button because you've managed

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.830
to marry the visual identity
of the application.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.700
And so if you go to this
application's listing on the

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.760
Play Store, it has these
colorful elements, which

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.100
you've picked out in
the shutter button

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.990
really, really nicely.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.800
And I'm also a big fan of using
the overlay style, the

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.590
semi-transparent button bars as
well because it makes you

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.540
feel like the picture
is getting the whole

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.930
window, which is--

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:06.560
it's a camera app.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.120
This is what it's all about,
taking photos.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.080
So I love the way that we've
extended that photo to fill

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.200
the edges where possible.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.562
So that's two of my
favorite elements.

00:08:14.562 --> 00:08:16.680
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and like I
mentioned before, one of the

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.450
hardest things is getting
a photo to fill.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.680
I actually don't know about Ice
Cream Sandwich or Jelly

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.220
Bean, if we have this.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.210
But one option is, if you can,
maybe even crop the image that

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.780
you don't see the top
and the bottom.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.970
There's lots of different
options.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.520
But that's just, as somebody
that's worked on a camera

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.700
before, it's definitely
something that comes up.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.690
It is difficult to do.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.740
But if you can do it, your app
can look really great.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.820
So let's move on to
the next screen.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.100
In this next screen, you'll
notice that we moved some of

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.040
these deeper, nested
effects pop-ups.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.050
Again, we moved the effects from
the right to the left to

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.690
simplify the model for users.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.680
We moved this panel
to the left.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:09.640
And so when you select this
Edit control, you see

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.916
basically this secondary set
of controls to its right.

00:09:12.916 --> 00:09:15.730
And in the original app, there's
actually a third set.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.280
So you could imagine having
three sets here.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.650
And at that point, you're really
thinking more about the

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.910
controls and finding the thing
you want than the photo.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.480
So maybe potentially overlaying
on top of the

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.580
photo may be OK.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.760
But we didn't go too much in
depth there because at that

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.110
point, it's really up to
the developer what

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.700
they want to do.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.090
And I just want to, in the
interest of time, switch over

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.960
to this screen.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.030
And this is where you basically

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.670
select a shutter type.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.390
So you can go from a normal
to a timer to--

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.160
I actually don't know what
a collage does--

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.790
stable shot.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.670
Lots of different shutter
types, and

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.390
that's really awesome.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.740
This is a pretty unique feature
that it has all these

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.470
different types.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.860
But again, we decided to move
that into settings.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.660
So basically, you touch
Settings, and then, touch

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.120
Normal Shutter Type and select
which one you want.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.320
You could probably even improve
that flow faster by

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.960
having a special widget at
the top, maybe one that

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.710
horizontally scrolls.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.620
But that's just one way to
do things like that.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.940
And the reason we did this was
to really just simplify,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.650
again, really simplify this
fairly complex app so that any

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.480
types of settings related to
camera go into one place.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.310
Nick, any parting thoughts
for Cameras Zoom FX?

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.100
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I love what
you've done with this.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.520
I think it's a very powerful app
that lets you do a lot of

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.520
different things with images.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.570
But having its custom UI means
it's quite hard to take in all

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.260
those different options
that you can do.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.400
So I think using things like the
standard design language,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.240
the Holo icons and standard
controls like spinners, really

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.140
makes it much quicker to pause
and understand what's going on

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.730
in the app and really get down
to the functionality of what

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.644
you want to use.

00:10:58.644 --> 00:11:00.260
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.240
OK, so let's move on
to the next app.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.860
And the next app is Glimmr.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.040
So I'll let Nick go ahead
and jump into

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.298
his thoughts on Glimmr.

00:11:11.298 --> 00:11:14.080
ROMAN NURIK: So basically, the
app Glimmr is an application

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.670
for letting you access
photos on Flickr, the

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.220
photo-sharing website.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.770
It's quite a new app
on the market.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.470
And some people might be
surprised to see us addressing

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.840
it on Android Design in Action
because, overall, I actually

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.440
really like it.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.610
It's a really nice app.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.730
It's using a lot of the Holo
design language, things like

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.490
horizontal swiping and
so on are present.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:38.390
But as with any Android design
project, there's one aspect

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.350
which you have to consider,
which I don't think they've

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:45.210
really addressed too well, and
that is designing for all

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.520
different device varieties
out there.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.725
So I've actually taken this from
a different standpoint

00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:51.170
than usual.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.730
And we've run this on a 10-inch
device on a tablet and

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.000
looked at how it comes out and
then decided to apply more

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.430
Android design philosophy on how
we could improve things.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.950
So moving to the third screen
here, if you can make it out,

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.390
this is the first thing you're
presented with when the user

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.540
installs the application.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.420
It's a log-on screen.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.770
It's quite sparse, minimally,
extremely sparse.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.310
It just says, "Welcome to
Glimmr," and a Log-On button.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.300
And I think this is a real
missed opportunity.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.140
When a user installs your
application, they don't always

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.200
know exactly what it does
or how high quality is.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.950
And you've got a very
short amount of

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.370
time to impress them.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.830
In fact, if the first thing
you show them is a sparse

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.490
screen with a button forcing
them to log in, it's almost

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.630
like you're throwing your
hand upward and

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.900
showing a stop sign.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.940
And I'm sure there'll be a drop
off here where a number

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.830
of users just don't even press
it there and carry on, which

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.215
would be a shame, because
they'll be missing out on a

00:12:43.215 --> 00:12:44.880
great application.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.720
So what we've done
here is we--

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.340
if you want to go
to the redesign.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.530
ROMAN NURIK: Yup.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.680
NICK BUTCHER: We've made content
come to the fore and

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.750
offered a different experience
when you load in.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.950
So Flickr is about
photos, right?

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.160
It's all about sharing photos.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.380
So the first thing you see when
you launch this app, in

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:05.250
my opinion, should be some
rich, rich imagery.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.600
Flickr exposes a feed called
interestingness, which shows

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.520
some great imagery.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.900
So what we've done here
is we've pulled out

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:11.860
some images from that.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.780
And this is the first
thing you now see.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.540
So instantly, it's engaging.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.270
It speaks to what this
app is all about.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.660
It's all about beautiful
photographs.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.010
And what's more, it offers some
functionality now without

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:23.680
logging in.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.450
So there's a strong call to
action there to log in today

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.090
with your Flickr account.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.410
But alternatively, you've got a
little hint there saying you

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.750
can touch a photo.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.360
And this'll take you right into
the core of the app, say,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.450
viewing photos and seeing
comments on the photos.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.180
So straight away, we're
not logging in.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.670
We're exposing more content
to the users.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.460
And also, we hope you'll agree
it looks a little bit better

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.540
at taking advantage of the
extra screen real estate

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.390
available to you on this
larger device.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:50.860
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.835
The one thing I want to point
out here, Nick, is Nick did

00:13:53.835 --> 00:13:55.660
the design for this app.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.790
And one of the things that
instantly makes your app look

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.410
better-- and we've done this in
past episodes of the show--

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:06.940
is just using different weights
of Roboto, different

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.460
fonts in that family.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.626
So in this case, Nick, you've
used Roboto thin, is it?

00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:14.232
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, Roboto
Thin and then Regular.

00:14:14.232 --> 00:14:16.560
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, so using
Roboto Thin is--

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.340
I just want to point out,
it's really great for

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.940
really large type.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.340
So if you have something like
an initial screen that says

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.520
"Welcome," or you want to
display a nice, big piece of

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:35.050
text, especially on a tablet
for like 48, even 64, 72

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:40.588
scale-independent pixel sizes,
Roboto Thin is really awesome.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:41.520
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.490
ROMAN NURIK: So let's move
on to the next screen.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.750
And this is the screen where--

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.950
actually, Nick, you want
to talk about it?

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.540
It's the Sets screen.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.450
Is that right?

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:51.830
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.560
So once you get into the app,
once you've logged in with

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.410
your Flickr account, it offers
different views on your data.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.870
So you can see your photos,
your sets, which is

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.940
collections of your photos,
folders, if you will, as well

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.270
as seeing groups and things
from your contacts.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.690
So I've pulled out the Sets
screen here because, as you

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:14.310
can see, on the tablet, you
get these horizontal,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:18.530
full-width images which just
really don't scale up too well

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.350
to a larger device.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.160
So we've look at that.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.850
And we've applied a different
kind of layout to really take

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.920
advantage of the real estate
available to you.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.060
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, so I've
just moved over to the

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.950
redesign screen.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.160
I just want to also point out
regarding those full-width

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.505
widgets, basically any time you
have anything that's full

00:15:40.505 --> 00:15:42.640
width on a tablet,
you have to think

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.050
twice about it, basically.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.660
Because that's just a lot of
space, not even for lines of

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.280
text, but even photos.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.630
Photos are very, very rich.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.780
But when you have such an
awkward aspect ratio, like

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:59.640
fixed height in a full-width
row, you don't really get as

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.240
much out of it.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.150
So yeah, Nick, do you want to
talk about the redesign?

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.380
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.300
There's a few things
we've done here.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.270
Firstly, we've switched over to
a dark theme as well, as we

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.790
showed on the log-on screen.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.130
The thinking here is really
that, as we said before, we

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.820
want this to be all about the
photos, all about the imagery.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.325
And having a darker background
really lets those images stand

00:16:21.325 --> 00:16:23.190
out, really makes them pop.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.950
So that's the reasoning for
switching over to the fully

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.520
dark rather than the light theme
or the dark action bars

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.400
as we saw before.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.245
I've also moved away from the
horizontal swiping tabs, the

00:16:34.245 --> 00:16:38.590
swipey tabs, because that very
long gesture on a tablet

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.900
device is a bit hard.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.000
It isn't as intuitive
like switching

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.050
between pages of content.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.780
And by pulling the tabs out
right into the action bar

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.880
where we have more space now
in this size, it gives you

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.620
instant access to switch between
these four major views

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.900
of your data.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:56.755
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:16:56.755 --> 00:16:58.060
NICK BUTCHER: So the other thing
we've obviously done

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.640
there is we've gone to a grid
view to make better use of the

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.630
real estate and switched
it up from vertical

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.690
to horizontal scrolling.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.040
So as you can see, the images
are going off to the right, so

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.440
you can scroll horizontally
and see more.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.290
This screen's quite heavy, I
guess, influenced by the

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.490
standard Android gallery and
applications like Google+.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:23.589
But we really hope we've
captured the spirit of Flickr

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:25.730
and married it with a really
rich viewing environment.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.790
Some of the minor details that
you'll want to call out as

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.090
well is we de-emphasized some
of the visual information.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.910
I found using the Glimmr
application that there was a

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.060
lot of information jumping out
at you, competing for my

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.990
attention from the photos.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.510
So, for example, if you look at
the visual treatment of an

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:46.160
individual set here, like a
folder, we've made it 90%

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.510
almost about the picture.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.340
And then there's a very
small callout saying

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.440
the name of the set.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.520
And then less important,
secondary importance, we

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.680
de-emphasized the number
of photos in the set.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:02.200
So we've used this relative size
and weight of text and

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.315
color to show the relative
importance of

00:18:05.315 --> 00:18:06.130
the information there.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.900
So I think this really makes
the photos stand out.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.090
And then, if you really want to
know how many photos, it's

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.782
easily accessible.

00:18:11.782 --> 00:18:13.575
But it doesn't compete
for your attention.

00:18:13.575 --> 00:18:15.870
ROMAN NURIK: Two things I just
want to call out specifically

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:20.170
that I like about the changes
here, Nick, is just in terms

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:24.850
of padding and font treatment
or text treatment, you've

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.050
given the text, like
in this case Waves.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.240
That's the title of the set.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.770
You've given it slightly more
padding around the top,

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.940
bottom, and especially
the left.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.610
And using either 4, 8, or
16 DPS of padding is

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.270
usually a good idea.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.070
And I think that just helps
clean it up a bit.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:45.530
In the current version of the
app, you'll notice that these

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.020
text labels-- and it's
very hard to see.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:47.810
I apologize for that.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:53.740
But these text labels, they're
scrunched over to the side and

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.520
squeezed by the top and
bottom borders of that

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.070
semi-transparent black box.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.190
So giving it some more spacing
just helps bring it out ever

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.140
so slightly so that it's
a little more legible.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.920
So let's look at the
last screen.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.780
And this is the photo
detail screen.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.480
Basically, when you
touch a photo, you

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.060
jump into this screen.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.080
And there, it's basically a
full-screen photo and gives

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.160
you a couple of actions
at the top.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.330
Nick, do you want to jump
into your analysis?

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:22.550
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.040
You can probably skip on to
the next slide as well.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.540
It's quite a simple
screen, really.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.370
It's showing you a photo.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.090
But there's a few things which
I wanted to change about the

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.120
screen, really.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.510
Firstly, I changed over to using
an overlay action bar.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.220
I hope it comes out in
the screenshot here.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.490
So that's basically, I wanted
the screen to be

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.480
all about the picture.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.540
I didn't want to border
at the top.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.270
I wanted it to feel like
the photo was the

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.290
most important thing.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.560
If you've used the application
as well, you can tap on the

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.450
main picture, and it'll
hide the action bar.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.890
But it actually has a slightly
jarring animation where it

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.845
readjusts the size
of the image just

00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:56.170
doing a layout pass.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.170
And so using an overlay
action bar will negate

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.625
that issue as well.

00:20:01.625 --> 00:20:03.770
The other thing is if you look
at the title of the photo,

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.140
it's kind of burned onto
the photo in the image.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.565
Even if you go into the viewing
mode where you hide

00:20:10.565 --> 00:20:13.120
the action bar, this title is
still going to hide the image.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.930
So I've changed that and removed
the Glimmr name from

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:17.705
the action bar.

00:20:17.705 --> 00:20:19.650
Because I think by this point,
you're using the app, you've

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:20.570
got the icon.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:21.900
You know which application
you're in.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:27.330
And just replaced the title with
the photo title there.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.090
ROMAN NURIK: I think providing
that sense of place of where

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.730
you are, that's really what that
part of the action bar is

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.080
for, to tell you not only where
you can go and what you

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.820
can do, but where you are.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:46.650
And so the action bar does
have a built-in title and

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.100
subtitle feature.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:54.040
But in this case, Nick has
chosen to use a custom title

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:58.870
area that highlights that it's
a certain photo by the author

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.850
of the photo.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:02.760
So let's move on.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.350
Sorry, go on.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.680
NICK BUTCHER: The only last
minor thing is I cleaned up

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.070
the iconography in the
action bar as well.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.950
I feel like the functions
it's offering here, like

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.300
favoriting, sharing, is all
quite common iconography.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.950
So I felt like it cleaned it
up having it as just icon

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.870
rather than icon and text
because you still have the

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.500
long press to get a tool tip
as well if you don't quite

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.710
understand what's going on.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.990
But I just felt like it removed
all those distractions

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.220
away from the photo and
just simplified it.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.750
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.660
So let's look at the other
facet of this screen--

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.240
comments.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.750
Do you want to talk
about that, Nick?

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.230
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.070
Lastly, tapping on the comments
button or the

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.300
information button lets these
pop-ups which overlay the

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.360
photo obscuring it.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.636
And I decided just
to give that a

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:45.410
little bit of a treatment.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:46.960
I wanted to carry on
that theme that

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.875
content is king here.

00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:48.900
It's all about the photograph.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.540
So I went for an overlay
style again.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.450
So I hope it comes out.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.610
This is supposed to be a
semi-transparent pop-up box

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.690
that comes up.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:56.770
And it's almost like
a toggle mode.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.500
So you can see here when you hit
the comment button, this

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.510
panel will pop up.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.330
And the idea here is
that will stay up.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.615
So as you keep on horizontally
swiping to the next photos in

00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:09.090
the set, that'll stay up, and
it'll just switch over.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.560
Similarly, if you hit the Info
icon next to it, the idea is

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.770
it'll occupy the same space.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.000
You could have the fun animation
of it, perhaps

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.330
rotating around, showing
you some

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.520
information about the photo.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.800
And what we've done here is I
feel like having this overlay

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.510
information rather than that
obscuring pop-up, it really

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.310
takes better advantage of the
screen real estate available

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.280
on the tablet because you can
still see a large amount of

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.500
the image, which is what this
is all about, and then get

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.672
your comments experience
as well.

00:22:35.672 --> 00:22:36.890
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, awesome.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.540
I especially like just
the treatment of

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.190
comments and text.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.280
So basically, within the
comment, you have the author,

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.790
the comment author.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.470
And there's lots of different
things you can do to make text

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.810
seem clickable or touchable
or interactive.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:57.530
Basically, having it stand out,
giving it some color is

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.450
one sign, one indication.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.730
But another thing you can do is
you could potentially use

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:02.730
underlines.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.840
You could also just have, if you
choose, instead of having

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.890
the quick contacts, you can have
the profile icon actually

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.170
jump you there as well if you
decide that quick contacts

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.550
isn't for you.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.445
NICK BUTCHER: If the author's
watching, this is also a

00:23:17.445 --> 00:23:19.380
subtle hint that this
application, it already in the

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.830
background checks
for new photos

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.170
from your Flickr friends.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.100
I've love for them to implement
a contact sync

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:29.210
adapter so that it joins up
between contacts and the

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.430
Flickr profile so that you can
use these quick contact badges

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.030
to quickly pivot from your other
applications into their

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.210
Flickr profile and so
on and so forth.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.160
I love it when applications
integrate like that.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.550
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, basically any
time you have any sort of

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.860
social app, you should do
things like contacts

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.800
integration.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.340
You should do things like social
stream API integration.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.920
That really helps you
integrate even

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.870
further into the OS.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:55.020
So let's move on from the
redesign of Glimmr to a new

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.390
section of Android Design in
Action, Android Design News.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.450
And you guys did cover
this last week.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:06.060
But we do want to help promote
some of the awesome work

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.180
that's been done in
the community.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.390
And so this is a section that
we're hoping to do potentially

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.640
every week for the show.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.060
And so let's start with
Android Design News.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.510
And the first bit of news--

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.650
actually, Nick, do you want
to start with the

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.540
first bit of news?

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.970
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so I just
wanted to highlight an

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:28.057
excellent library of assets
which Cyril Motier of Green

00:24:28.057 --> 00:24:30.770
Droid fame has opened sourced
to the community.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.970
He's made some map markers for
making map pins, which are

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.490
very true in nature to
Google Maps style.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.590
So these don't actually ship
with our Maps SDK, so these

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.700
are some great assets to getting
you bootstrapped and

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.760
customizing from there.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.380
So thanks very much, Cyril,
for sharing these.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.110
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, absolutely,
thank you, Cyril.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.920
The next one is from
Smashing Magazine.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.810
And Smashing Magazine, for those
of you who aren't aware,

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.610
it's a magazine that's dedicated
to teaching the

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:03.670
world basically about different
aspects of design

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:04.840
and also implementation.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.930
So if you're a web developer or
an Android developer or web

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.360
designer or an Android designer,
the Smashing

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.640
Magazine is a great
blog to follow.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.020
They often highlight some of the
best stuff that's going on

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.420
in the industry.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.450
In this case, what they've done
is they've highlighted

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.060
some mobile sketching
templates.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.800
And they've actually released
mobile sketching templates for

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.130
Android, iOS, Windows.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.370
I believe it's also
tablet and phone.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:33.410
So if you're interested in doing
some sort of real-world

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.700
sketching with real pen or real
paper, pencil and paper,

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.196
then this is definitely
something you should go ahead

00:25:38.196 --> 00:25:39.280
and download.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.200
NICK BUTCHER: That's what I
used when I was doing the

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.960
sketches of Glimmr.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.410
ROMAN NURIK: Nice, awesome.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.690
Next is a similar kit from
Taylor Ling, who's one of the

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.880
awesome community folks that's
creating free, downloadable

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.610
assets for the rest of us.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.150
It's a GUI sketching kit,
basically, very similar to the

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.580
previous kit.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.100
But it's from Taylor.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.156
And thoughts, Nick?

00:26:04.156 --> 00:26:05.180
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I
think this is nice.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.990
I found the photo in Smashing
Magazine maybe slightly

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.770
heavyweight.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.880
And I found myself--

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.670
it was clearer using Taylor's
ones there.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:14.610
They're not quite so heavy.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:17.010
So your sketch actually stands
out over the frame, rather

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.020
than the Smashing one.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.255
So take a look at them
both and see which

00:26:19.255 --> 00:26:21.198
ones work for you.

00:26:21.198 --> 00:26:23.850
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome, OK.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.060
In other news, Android
Niceties--

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.550
is that how you pronounce
it, niceties?

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.870
I think it's niceties.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:29.550
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.340
ROMAN NURIK: So Android
Niceties, which is a blog, I

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.100
guess a Tumblr, blog, slash--

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.810
it's a media outlet,
I suppose--

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.600
that highlights awesome design
work in the world of Android,

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.220
celebrates its first birthday.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.860
I think this blog highlights
some of the most awesome stuff

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.610
that's coming out of
the community.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.010
You should all try to follow
it if you're interested in

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.970
seeing examples of some of
this stuff in action.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:55.490
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.260
Happy Birthday, Haberdash.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.710
I'm probably murdering
their name.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.780
It's probably easier to say
your name on Twitter.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.240
So keep up the good work.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.551
We love you, Rob.

00:27:04.551 --> 00:27:06.350
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.160
And I think this is lastly.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.780
Yeah, lastly, Nick, do you want
to talk about Marie's

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.270
awesome redesign
of Rich's app?

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.030
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.310
I think inspired by that some
of the comments from the App

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:23.120
Clinic and some of Roman's
redesigns from last week,

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.470
Marie has joined in the spirit
of the redesign movement and

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:30.130
has applied the Holo treatments
to the Ultimate

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.230
Stopwatch application by our
colleague Rich Hyndman.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.800
So she shared all the assets
and everything.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.680
So it's a great example of
taking a before and after

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.160
shot, like we've done.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.540
So do check it out
at the link.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.780
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, I especially
love the work that

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.240
she's done with taking something
like a stopwatch and

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.070
making it tablet friendly.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:52.370
One of the things that folks
sometimes have trouble with is

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:56.060
imagining, is my app really
useful on a tablet?

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.720
Does it make any sense
on a tablet?

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.450
And in general, the answer is
yes, because it's just--

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:05.120
when a user has both a tablet
and a phone, they'll expect

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.700
that when they jump to their
tablet, the version of the

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.210
Google Play Store on their
device that they see on a

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.490
tablet is basically going
to be the same

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:14.550
thing on the phone.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.060
So if they happen to love your
app on the phone and it's just

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.810
not available on a tablet, or it
doesn't look very good, or

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:25.000
it's not really optimized for
a tablet, they're going to

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.970
think twice about using
your app next time.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.480
They may use a competitor's
app on a tablet.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:35.270
So in this case, Marie's just
taken a step in taking

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.340
something that really is
more like a square

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.000
thing, like a stopwatch.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.920
A clock is really
a square thing.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.390
What do you put on
the sides of it?

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.750
There's a lot of white space.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:51.200
And she's taken that and merged
different parts of the

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.880
phone app into a single screen
so that you have a dashboard

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.520
of your different stopwatches.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.850
NICK BUTCHER: She also is
thoroughly aware of the

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:01.620
Fragments APIs.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.290
It's a great way of showing
how to do designs for the

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.680
Fragment way of thinking
as well.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.811
So check it out.

00:29:07.811 --> 00:29:12.440
ROMAN NURIK: OK, so that's all
we have for the show today.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.570
Tune in next week where we will
cover, I believe, travel

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.520
planning apps.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.260
We'll have to see what the
guys in the App Clinic go

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.640
through, which apps
they review.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.470
So we'll take a crack at some
of those and review them, or

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.570
actually redesign some of the
screens from those apps.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.140
So thanks for tuning in.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.632
As always, I'm Roman Nurik.

00:29:33.632 --> 00:29:37.230
And with me here today was
Nick Butcher from London.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.060
And thanks, and hope to
see you next week.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.260
NICK BUTCHER: Bye!

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:47.167
