00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.120
Contrary to popular belief, space isn’t
actually “cold” per se, at least not in

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.730
the way often depicted in movies.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.480
Space is just mostly empty and all that nothing
doesn’t have a temperature.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.180
For example, if you were in space without
a space suit, the two ways you’d lose heat

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.980
are just via evaporation of moisture on your
skin, in your mouth, etc, and then much slower

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.500
via radiating heat away, which would take
a really long time.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.980
In fact, if you were in direct sunlight at
around the Earth’s orbit distance from the

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.510
Sun (1 AU), you’d find yourself overheating
pretty quickly, likely with severe sunburns

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.210
within a few minutes.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.140
This all brings us to the topic of today-
if space isn’t cold, why did the astronauts

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.699
on Apollo 13 get so cold in their ship?

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.880
And when things did get chilly, why didn’t
they just put on their space suits to warm

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.880
up?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.159
To begin with, somewhat counterintuitively,
the reason their ship got so cold so fast

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.000
is precisely because it’s troublesome to
get rid of heat on a space craft.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.550
With all the equipment on aboard the ship
generating heat, as well as extra heat absorbed

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.300
when the ship is in direct sunlight, this
would normally see the astronauts baking inside

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.300
the craft.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.220
To get around the problem, the ships were
specifically designed to radiate heat away

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.570
very quickly to compensate.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.530
Just in case this cooling happened too quickly,
for instance when not in direct sunlight helping

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.240
to heat things up, the ship was also equipped
with heaters to keep the astronauts comfortable.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.110
Thus, during the Apollo 13 mission when all
the equipment was off and they couldn’t

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.570
spare power to run the heaters, they were
left with a ship designed to radiate heat

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.390
away relatively quickly, even when in sunlight,
but nothing but their own bodies and sunlight

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.569
generating heat.

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.020
The net effect was that it got really cold
inside the command module and LM.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.080
This brings up the logical follow up question-
when it got cold, why didn’t they just use

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.770
their space suits to keep warm?

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.610
In search of a definitive answer, we discovered
a variety of speculative explanations online,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.920
many of which get surprisingly technical and
ultra specific, despite that nobody was using

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.690
a definitive source and were simply speculating.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.750
Further, nowhere in any Apollo 13 transcripts
we read does the idea of the astronauts in

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.450
question donning their space suits to keep
warm ever have appeared to have been suggested

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.450
or brought up, despite the cold.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.170
Unsatisfied with going with speculative explanations,
we eventually resorted to mailing a letter

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.470
to Fred Haise to get a more definitive answer,
with, unfortunately no response.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.380
Unwilling to give up, we continued to dig
and finally managed to track down a May of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.640
1970 LIFE magazine article in which all three
astronauts gave their account of what happened

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.250
during the Apollo 13 mission.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.640
A fascinating read, most notable to the topic
at hand in that article is the following from

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.800
Jim Lovell concerning the cold, which finally
gave us the definitive answer we were looking

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800
for:

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.090
Eventually it dawned on me that somehow we
all had to get some sleep, and we tried to

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.400
work out a watch system.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.850
We weren’t very successful.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.880
Besides the inside of the Odyssey kept getting
colder and colder.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.480
It eventually got down pretty close to freezing
point, and it was just impossible to sleep

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.480
in there.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.410
Fred and I even put on our heavy lunar boots.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.730
Jack didn’t have any, so he put on extra
long johns.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.840
When you were moving around the cold wasn’t
so bad, but when you were sitting still it

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.840
was unbearable.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.540
So the three of us spent more and more of
our time together in Aquarius, which was designed

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.890
to be flown by two men- standing up, at that.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.330
There wasn’t really sleeping space for two
men there, let alone three, so we just huddled

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.300
in there, trying to keep warm and doze off
by turns.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.350
We didn’t get any sleep in the true sense
of the word.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.920
We considered putting on our heavy space suits,
but the suits were so builky that they would

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.940
compromise our maneuverability in an emergency
situation, and when you put on the suit you

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.580
were bound to perspire a lot.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.290
Soon you would be all wet and cold too, an
invitation to pneumonia.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.440
It’s also noteworthy here that in a separate
interview, NASA engineer and man in charge

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.170
of the spacecraft warning system during Apollo
13, Jerry Woodfill, stated that nobody on

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.550
the ground was terribly concerned about the
astronauts being cold or getting hypothermia.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.040
With what they were wearing and the temperature
inside the spacecraft, they were cold, but

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.890
not critically so, and everyone had much bigger
problems to deal with.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.270
You see, as you might have already gleaned
from the previous passage by Lovell, it turns

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.019
out the otherwise phenomenal Apollo 13 film
took some liberties and it was not, in fact,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.519
ever cold enough to do something like tap
frozen hot dogs against the wall.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.750
In fact, according to that same LIFE magazine
article, Jack Swigert stated, “Aquarius

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.870
was a nice, warm 50 degrees.”

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.949
He further went on to state that “It was
38 degrees in [the Odyssey] before reentry.”

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.740
To translate for the rest of the world, that
means it was about 10 degrees Celsius in Aquarius

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.199
and about 3.8 degrees Celsius in the Odyssey.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.729
Cold, particularly in the Odyssey, but with
what they were wearing, not unbearably so

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.389
for two of the three crew members, especially
when spending as much time as possible in

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.620
the Aquarius.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.189
As for the third, Fred Haise did have a lot
of trouble with the cold, likely due to a

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.639
fever owing to his urinary tract infection.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.770
He stated in his own account in that LIFE
magazine interview:

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.520
I’ve been a lot colder before but I’ve
never been so cold for so long…

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.870
The last 12 hours before renentry were particularly
bone chilling.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.620
During this period, I had to go up into the
command module.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.740
It took me four hours back in the LM before
I stopped shivering…

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.249
Because of the cold, during the last two nights
I slept in the tunnel between the two vehicles

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.060
with my head in the LM and with the string
of my sleeping bag wound around the latch

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.270
handle of the LM hatch so that I wouldn’t
float around.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:06:35.219
Speaking of space suits

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:45.559
and Hollywood myths, in 
movies you’ll often see humans exposed to

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:50.740
the near vacuum of space doing things like
suddenly exploding, instantly freezing in

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.720
the supposedly extreme “cold” of space,
etc.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.030
But, in fact, so long as you don’t try to
hold your breath, which would result in your

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.779
lungs rupturing and thus pretty well guaranteed
that the incident will be fatal, what will

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:04.909
actually happen is you’ll remain conscious
for about 10-15 seconds.

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:09.419
After that, you’ll be fine as long as you’re
placed back in a pressurized environment within

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:10.490
about 90 seconds.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.110
It’s even possible that some might be able
to survive as much as 3 minutes, as chimpanzees

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.460
are capable of this in such an environment
without lasting detrimental effect.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.300

and how we know these numbers, check out our
