1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,490
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,900
What I think is interesting is that
the continual buyers along that

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:10,680
technological path is towards profit.
You know,

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:15,600
when we see those machines,
the end point is always how do we make,

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,100
how do we maximize profit?

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,210
There is no like the influence
of how do we do what's right.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,240
That's that sort of a a person like
a sort of a general effort call.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,300
Uh, what do I want to say? Sort
of code is not being introduced.

9
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:33,630
There is no regulation. Like,
you know, ultimately, you know,

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,370
ultimately people will create the
warrior monkeys or the most profitable

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,780
machines people because the
counter argument isn't being made.

12
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:45,540
No one is like what I'm saying now
it's making it there. There's just,

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:50,360
there's no union of uh, you know,
there's no sort of clear opinion of,

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,050
hang on a minute, where
could we be going? No,

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,060
there is no body or ideology that's
able to oppose the relentless march of

16
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,680
capitalism. I'm not sort of like
a flower. Capitalism is bad.

17
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:05,310
Here I am promoting a book using or
an iPhone or you know what I mean?

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,220
We're all swimming in it.
Right?

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,290
But what I'm saying is that if we
acknowledge there are transcendent realms,

20
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,860
there is information and data that exists
beyond what we're able to receive with

21
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:20,580
our senses. How are we going to
incorporate that in the way we organize?

22
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,500
Cause otherwise this off the magnetism,

23
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,110
the Paul the g force of
what's most profitable,

24
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,240
what's going to continue to suit the uh,

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,290
requirements of the
powerful that will always,

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,330
the bias will always
fall in that direction.

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,930
And it seems like where that's heading
is certain kinds of ecological disaster,

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,360
certain kinds of economic inequality,
certain kinds of conflict, you know,

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,510
and like we're not, one of them
are, they're simple. Uh, uh,

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,860
experiments that I apply is, you know, if
we're, you know, if when people say, oh,

31
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:49,200
what's wrong with the world
world's I fucked all this polarity,

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,560
I sometimes think, well who is
benefiting from how it is now? Are there,

33
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,660
is anyone benefiting?
Are there any groups,

34
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:59,130
institutions or individuals for whom
this current state is beneficial?

35
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,990
And if the answer to that question is yes,

36
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,840
then look at who those institutions are.

37
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,850
And they are most likely to a degree
involved in establishing and maintaining

38
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:11,020
these systems. And there are, you know,

39
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,430
institutions and individuals
and organizations that
this works just fine for

40
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,010
they just capitalizing on it or are they
organizing it and is a normal part of

41
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:25,510
the way human beings operate with
this constant desire for innovation,

42
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:29,130
constant desire for improvement.
We always want to push further. No,

43
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:30,370
no one's comfortable where they are.

44
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:32,050
They will always want
to be in a better place.

45
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,090
And this is almost like it's
built into capitalism, right?

46
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:37,570
I agree that this materialism,

47
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:41,680
which is built into capitalism also is
what fuels innovation because you want

48
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:44,500
the newest iPhone so they have to
design it and build it and make it,

49
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,330
and when new things come out,

50
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:49,570
like this new robot that apparently
you're gonna hundred models,

51
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:53,680
whatever that means. What that is
is this is they're going to sell it.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,350
So there's like,
it's fueling innovation.

53
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,650
Someone else will come along and compete
with Boston dynamics. Then there'll be,

54
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,420
there'll be innovation wars.
If these innovation wars
weren't in place right now,

55
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,930
our phones would look nothing like
the iPhone 10 it just wouldn't,

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,760
it wouldn't look like the
Esx it would look like,

57
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,370
who knows where it would look like.
But there would be no,

58
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,490
no incentive for them to compete against
all these Samsung devices and Huawei

59
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,740
devices and all that stuff
is fueling this innovation.

60
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:22,360
But it's all being fueled by capitalism.

61
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,050
You're quite right that that is the
innovation is one of the benefits of the

62
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,860
maintaining this system.

63
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,070
But it seems to me that we are excluding
other factors like that that recur

64
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,400
throughout human cultures.

65
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,220
We all have an idea of fairness of justice
and yeah, I don't want some clunky,

66
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,630
weird sort of eastern bloc
phone made out of gray plastic.

67
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,820
Only one button on it. Yeah.
But like we have to I suppose,

68
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,850
examine as a society and as individuals
what is important to us now where I

69
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,360
think, you know, we've talked,

70
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:01,500
touched several times upon the fact that
as an individual you're more likely to

71
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:04,670
bias yourself towards
negative information online.

72
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,460
You know like we do have a degree
of individual power and individual

73
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:13,200
responsibility and I feel like if enough
people awaken to the possibility of

74
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:18,090
different narratives that the capitalist
idea of innovation and success and

75
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,380
progress that that all of these words can
be examined. What do you mean progress?

76
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,650
That assumes a teleology,
a purpose, a destination.

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,190
If all time is happening at once,
if space is infinite,

78
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,750
like you know that bit of yours of light
unit to try and fathom for a moment the

79
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:38,040
limitlessness that were existing within,
then all these things are constructs.

80
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,740
This is a construct and it
is good to have technology,

81
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,920
but it's possible to like at points in
times of crisis such as what it feels

82
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:48,390
like we're at now. Now though
that people have said, oh,

83
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:51,780
we always feel that every generation
thinks that they're the one because they

84
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:55,010
know their own impending death is
coming and they narrativize that into

85
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,930
something social and global regardless.

86
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,410
There's got to be a time where we start
to introduce different ideas into our

87
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:04,980
systems. It seems like there's room for
that now because we do live in a toe,

88
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,110
a truly global culture that there is the
possibility for mono lifts to introduce

89
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,710
new innovation and there is nothing
that can oppose it or regulate it.

90
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,600
We started to see this kind of breakdown,

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,840
so I'm interested in how we can
individually prepare ourselves to organize

92
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:26,571
society differently to be able to overcome
pretty superficial differences like,

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,510
oh you go hunting and I don't go hunt in.
We ain't really gives a fuck.

94
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,010
They start talking about how we can
organize a size where people who go on and

95
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:37,260
it'll don't go hunting can live
peacefully in different ways.

96
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:41,190
Not entirely governed by a small cabal.
You know,

97
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:43,590
and I'm sure plat power
is more complex than that,

98
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,300
that seem to be hugely biasing the
direction of this so called program.

99
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,170
I think you answered your own previous
questions when you're talking about

100
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:54,140
whether or not you can be spiritual
and funny and like what are you doing?

101
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:56,060
Can you carve that path out for yourself?

102
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,330
That what you're there by explaining
that would influence people would give

103
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,560
people a perspective that
allows them to say, yeah,

104
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:06,020
like why are we doing this and
what is the purpose of this?

105
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:10,460
And if enough people hear those words
and have that perspective introduced to

106
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:13,490
them, it'll change the way
they interact with the world.

107
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,740
And that changes the world.
It really does.

108
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,540
And that's one of the more powerful
things about discussions when someone like

109
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,090
you says something like that and it
resonates with people and they start

110
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,390
thinking like, why am I living like
this? Like what if I'm only have,

111
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,850
if I really do only have 50 years to live,

112
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,920
why am I living these 50 years in some
really unproductive bullshit way that's

113
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:37,670
not satisfying at all? Cause I just
want a bigger house. Like what is it?

114
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:42,650
Do I want a faster car? Do I want
to have expensive piece of jewelry?

115
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:43,460
Like what is,

116
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,660
what is the purpose of this path that
I'm on now versus a path that I could be

117
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:48,290
on?

118
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,290
And what is the real conflict that we
all experienced between each other?

119
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,960
Is it? How much of it is due
to a lack of communication?

120
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:59,840
How much of is due to a lack of
real listening and understanding.
