00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.550
To start the new width goes here.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.390
The new height goes right here.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.380
And I type the device
pixel ratio in right here.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.230
For the user agent string I simply
pasted into the box right here.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.110
And then I got this message
that I needed to reload.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.940
And ta da,
I've got my view port set correctly
