00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.480
after?

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:16.170
Guiness World RecordAccording to Guinness
World Records, the de-facto authority on world

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.400
record breaking, this is one of the most common
questions they’re asked alongside “What

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.560
record is broken the most often?” (the heaviest
object lifted with glue according to them)

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.520
and “Who holds the most Guinness World Records
record titles?”

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.725
(Ashrita Furman with 125 records at last count).

00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:32.029
Since we’ve also gotten this question a
few times from readers over the years, we

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.449
figured it’s high time we looked into the
answer.

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.280
In regards to records involving comically
giant food, as of 2011, Guinness has a policy

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.109
in place that all giant food or records involving
large amounts of food, such as most pizzas

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:53.210
made in 24 hours (7,539 by a team of Domino’s
employees in Queensland in 2012), must be

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.920
either donated, consumed or sold for consumption
for the record to be recognised as official.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.100
This stipulation was put in place for a number
of reasons, but was mostly added to prevent

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.630
such a large amount of food going to waste,
something Guinness was being criticised for

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.710
encouraging.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.439
Guinness allows those attempting records to
choose between selling or donating giant food

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:20.369
in acknowledgement of the fact that such records
often require a considerable amount of money

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.079
and the option of selling it allows some of
that money to be recouped.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.260
A second, and perhaps less obvious, reason
for this particular stipulation is that it

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.310
means the food produced, whatever it may be,
has to be edible, making it much harder to

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.460
break some of these giant food records.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.289
For example, when a company called Juicys
Outlaw Grill attempted to create a record

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:47.229
breaking 770 pound burger in 2011, their initial
attempt failed when they were unable to cook

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.070
the 600 pound beef patty they’d made all
the way through– meaning the entire burger

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.899
could not be eaten and thus, they were unable
to fulfill all of Guinness’ stipulations

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.289
to a satisfactory degree, even though they
technically did make a 770 pound burger.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.330
The company did eventually succeed at breaking
the world record and now holds the record

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.480
for selling the largest commercially available
hamburger in the world.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480
The price?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.870
A mere $5000 dollars for over one million
calories of burgery goodness, give or take

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.720
depending on the fat content.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.880
And if you’re curious, a typical beef cow
yields about 450 pounds or about 200 kg of

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.880
usable meat.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.600
So this world record attempt was essentially
about one and a third cows worth of meat or

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.610
about 6000 McDonald’s hamburgers.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.190
A further stipulation of creating giant food
for a world record attempt is that it must

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.640
generally resemble the original foodstuff
it is based on.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.900
For example, a stipulation of creating a giant
popsicle is that the final product must be

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.160
able to stand upright like a regular popsicle
without falling apart.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.050
This is a rule the company Snapple were unable
to abide by when they attempted to create

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.470
a record breaking 35,000 pound stick of frozen
goo in 2005 and inexplicably tried to erect

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.400
it in the middle of New York in June…

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.980
Despite careful preparation before hand and
keeping the giant popsicle frozen during transport

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.700
to its final destination, the kiwi-strawberry
popsicle melted before it could be propped

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.880
up, resulting in thousands of litres of pink,
sugary liquid shutting off several lanes of

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.370
traffic while a bemused fire crew used hoses
to wash it down into the sewers.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.010
Presumably the rats and other such creatures
appreciated Snapple’s efforts, even if they

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.730
didn’t get the world record.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.260
Perhaps next time they should think about
doing it in December.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.810
Of course, because Guinness isn’t always
invited along to giant food cook-offs, there’s

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.480
nothing to really stop companies or individuals
that create giant food from throwing it away

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.510
after the attempt is complete; it’s just
that if they do, the most recognisable world

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.160
record recording entity won’t give them
a plaque acknowledging their achievement.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.960
This means the group in question won’t get
near the publicity, which is generally the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.720
point of these sorts of things.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.800
On top of that, if they aren’t making the
food item edible, they just completely wasted

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.240
their money on the raw ingredients for no
good reason.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.370
Needless to say, officials from Guinness are
often invited to such events and, even when

00:04:11.370 --> 00:05:03.789
not, the food item is generally meant to be
eaten after.
