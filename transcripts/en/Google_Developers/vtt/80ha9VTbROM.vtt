LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to
Google Developers Weekly

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.954
for October 21, 2013.

00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:09.870
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.536
of what's happening in the world
of Google Developers on the set

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:13.510
and off.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.790
Last week, millions of
Canadians dreamed about hockey

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.390
while celebrating Thanksgiving.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.260
Entrepreneurs globally dreamed
about hockey stick growth,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.710
when revenue takes off
at an exponential rate.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.370
Alex Moore of Baydin joined
Don Dodge in our studio,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.380
explaining how you can grow
through focus user acquisition,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.820
and do it quite
well as a company,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.509
even without seeing the
proverbial hockey stick.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.740
From Seattle, Francesc Campoy
Flores and Brian Dorsey

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.300
talk about their
experience with Go

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.970
and why Python programmers
should consider the language

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.200
Brian also talks about
what surprised him,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.060
giving some thoughts and
recommendations for Pythonistas

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.250
interested in learning about Go.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.150
Felipe Hoffa, a regular
mention here on GDL weekly,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.670
invited Aleem Mawani,
the founder of Streak,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.167
to review the latest big
query announcements, and shows

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:57.000
the multiple ways that
Streak leverages data

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.750
that they stream into BigQuery.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.200
Now they can instantly
analyze their App Engine logs

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.940
for debugging and
performance analysis.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.840
Next, from our New
York City office,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.920
YouTube's Jeff Posnick does more
than tell you about new stuff.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.730
He takes on common
issues developers

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.490
face when running YouTube
Analytics API reports,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.970
sharing resources to help
you keep your programs

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.230
and statistics running smoothly.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.739
And your websites and mobile
apps have a need for speed.

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:23.280
Our Chrome Team partnered with
The New York Times to help you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.510
tune up performance.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.300
Engineers from the Times,
Forecast I/O, and Google

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.180
showed tips to bring smoother
scrolling and animation, faster

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.650
load times, and
the app experience

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.790
that both you and
your users love.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.990
And if you've heard about the
Wallet Object API Mihai Enescu

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.690
is your guide to
getting started.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.490
The first episode in a
new series on this API

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.390

your Wallet Objects accounts,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.210
including both OS2 Service

is back with another episode
of What In the World.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.520
This week talks about great
ways to restructure KML data

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.200
so it looks great

Alex tells us how he
found angel investors

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.090
in balanced investment, revenue,
user acquisition, and feature

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.070
development.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.660
We also get a tip on how to
make limited server capacity

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.940
work for you.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.400
