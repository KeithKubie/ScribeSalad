00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:13.450
The man was an Australian by the name of Albert
Ernest Clifford “Cliff” Young, who decided

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.340
to take up running as a sport at the age of
57.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.009
The competition was the Westfield run, which
is an ultra-marathon that takes place in Australia.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.400
The race is 543.7 miles long (875 km) and
is run from Sydney to Melbourne.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.220
What’s even more impressive than a 61 year
old potato and sheep farmer even being able

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.950
to complete such a race in the allotted time
is that, he not only won, but shattered the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.460
world record for that distance, beating it
by over two days.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.551
Young showed up at the event on April 27,
1983 wearing overalls and gumboots, though

00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:50.510
he later used ten pairs of shoes during the
event.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.760
His running style, like his attire, was also
very unconventional, being more of a shuffle

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.810
than a run.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.610
In the beginning, the other runners easily
took the lead with Young and his slow shuffling

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.090
style lagging behind.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.620
However, unlike the other runners, Young didn’t
plan on sleeping much throughout the event.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.220
Most runners planned a schedule of about 18
hours running / 6 hours sleeping.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.084
Young, however, didn’t feel sleep was necessary
because, in his youth, he’d herded about

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:13.084
2000 sheep on a 2000 acre farm (about 3.12
square miles).

00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:14.084
Occasionally that would mean rounding them
up by literally chasing them around for two

00:01:14.084 --> 00:01:15.084
or three days straight with no sleep and constant
running.

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:16.084
In his own words:

00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:17.360
“See, I grew up on a farm where we couldn’t
afford horses or four wheel drives, and the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.290
whole time I was growing up– until about
four years ago when we finally made some money

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.460
and got a four wheeler– whenever the storms
would roll in, I’d have to go out and round

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.460
up the sheep.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.500
We had 2,000 head, and we have 2,000 acres.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.940
Sometimes I would have to run those sheep
for two or three days.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.880
It took a long time, but I’d catch them.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.010
I believe I can run this race; it’s only
two more days.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.010
Five days.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.350
I’ve run sheep for three.”

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.140
Indeed, after the race, Young told the press
he kept himself motivated and focused by imagining

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.950
there was a storm coming and he was just rounding
up sheep before it came.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.130
He did, however, sleep some during the race.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.030
On the first day, he fell and injured his
shoulder and decided to take some rest.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.520
However, due to one of his crew members not
wearing his contacts when he set the alarm

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.390
to wake Young up, Young ended up only sleeping
two hours the first night and was up and running

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.390
after that.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.349
In the end, he completed the 543.7 mile long
ultra-marathon in just five days, fifteen

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.999
hours, and four minutes, while only sleeping
for a little over 12 hours during that span.

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.620
When he won, Young earned a grand prize for
the event of $10,000.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.799
Young lived on a modest income of around $2000
per year and didn’t feel he needed any more

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.499
money than that, so rather than keeping the
winnings for himself, he split the money with

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.360
certain others in the race and his support
crew.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.260
After the presentation of the prize, his legs
gave out and he had to be carried off the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.260
stage.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.379
A bed was then setup for him at the shopping
center which was the destination of the race

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.689
and he slept there for just five hours, followed
by eating three plates of eggs and toast and

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.390
spending the following day giving interviews.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.669
Young again competed in the race in 1984,
but due to injuring his left knee a couple

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.400
weeks before the race and displacing his hip
during the race, he couldn’t keep up with

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.660
the front of the pack, led by 28 year old
now legendary ultra-marathoner Yiannis Kouros.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.249
Despite both of these injuries, Young still
managed to finish seventh out of the nine

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.330
who ultimately were able to complete the event.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.040
He entered the competition for the third time
the following year, but was forced to dropout

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.900
due to pleurisy (inflammation of the lung
tissue) and pneumonia.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.430
He spent a week in the hospital following
this before being allowed to go home.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.279
As a courtesy, Westfield hired a car to drive
him all the way back to Colac after he was

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.590
released from the hospital.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.659
Even though he was 61 at the time, Young still
lived at home with his mother and was reportedly

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.180
still a virgin to boot.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.590
This changed pretty quickly, though.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.239
While he didn’t use his new celebrity status
for much monetary gain, he did receive the

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.349
benefit of finding a wife, Mary Howell, a
woman under half his age.

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.379
She later became his crew manager, though
this backfired on him in the 1984 race when

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.799
her inexperience caused the crew to lose him
at one point, resulting in a long stretch

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.970
where he had no water or food.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.890
This compounded on the knee and hip injury
to contribute to his inability to keep up

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.290
with the leaders that year.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.749
Young’s first race wasn’t actually the
Westfield run, but an attempt a year earlier

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:57.849
to break Siggy Bauer’s world record of 1,000
miles in 11 days and 23 hours.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.669
He failed in his bid though, quitting after
500 miles and stating that he and his support

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.999
staff had been grossly inexperienced for attempting
something like that, which resulted in them

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:08.169
being unprepared for what was needed.

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:12.749
While he didn’t manage the 1000 mile record
at the age of 60, at the age of 76, he did

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:17.600
attempt to break Ron Grant’s record in running
around Australia, which is about a 10,000

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.750
mile run.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.970
He attempted this to try to raise money for
homeless children.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.750
Somewhat humorously, his failed attempt in
this case was not because of him, but because

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.409
the one and only member of his support staff
became severely ill.

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.740
Before this happened, though, Young had managed
to cover a little over 4,000 miles of the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.789
run.

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.670
About a year after this failed attempt to
run around Australia, Young began having health

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.960
problems that lasted about five years and
ultimately resulted in his death at the age

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.569
of 81 from cancer on November 2, 2003.

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.780
Remarkably, all six of Young’s brothers
and sisters were still alive when he died,

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.030
even though they all themselves were quite
old: Anne, 85; Helen, 83; Margaret, 79; Barry

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.290
77; Eunice, 75; and Sid, 73.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.350
As one of his sisters stated upon his death:
“He is the first of us to go, but then he

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.780
was always on the go.”

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.289
Ultra-marathons take place nearly everywhere
on Earth, including Antarctica.

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.669
The biggest one held in Antarctica is actually
part of a larger “Four Deserts” race.

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.009
The event begins in Atacama Crossing in Chile,
which is among the driest places on Earth,

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.830
comprising mostly of salt lakes, volcanoes,
and sand dunes.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.030
Not only is the desert brutal, but it is at
an altitude of 8000 feet.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.750
The next stage of the race is in Gobi, China.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.479
This is among the hottest places in China
and the race covers sand dunes, dangerous

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.360
water crossings, and steep hills.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.930
The third stage of the race is in the Sahara
desert, in Egypt.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.650
The daytime temperature during this stage
can reach 122 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.690
The fourth and final stage of this race is
in Antarctica.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.199
The temperatures here are often below 0 degrees
Fahrenheit and the course and time of events

00:05:48.199 --> 00:06:05.550
varies greatly from day to day based on environmental
conditions.
