00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.040
&gt;&gt; So what's being done to resolve this massive
global issue?

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.850
Well, there are people trying to do their
best.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:32.660
So a lot of small little, local charities
working in their communities

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.040
across Ethiopia or Cameroon or Ghana, and
these are generally women's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.110
charities looking at empowerment of women.
Some of the larger charities are also working

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.060
on this.
And doing, again, what they can to have an

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.430
impact on communities.
And certainly bodies like UNICEF do have strategies,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.400
have come up with
their ideas for solutions.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.800
So it's not just been ignored.
This is the UNICEF-coordinated strategy to

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.140
abandon FGM in one
generation.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.820
This is what the UN is saying it can do.
We can eliminate it.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.369
We can abandon it in one generation.
But we're not.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.700
This has been studied to death and what we
need to do now is get on and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.210
do some implementation.
Eliminating FGM, this a statement that goes

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.350
across all of the UN
agencies.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.220
All saying they're committed to eliminating
it.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.200
What we need is a global push to commit to
these 3 million girls and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.040
say enough is enough.
We've done the strategies, we've done the

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.149
talking, now we're going to
do something.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.170
