1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,383
Okay.

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,600
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:07,000
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,450
ahhh

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,710
I'm just checking in on you. How's it
going? How are you? How's your week going?

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,940
Oh, that's wonderful.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,560
Now I know a lot of you guys last Monday
were very upset with me when I was

8
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:27,580
speaking in code and you just couldn't,
you know about my European tour.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,750
You're like, well, wait a minute.

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,970
It rhymes with Burundian mingle and
well, where the hell would that be?

11
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:37,510
I'm not some sort of sleuth.
I can't figure that stuff out.

12
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:41,440
I got to start breaking down code.
This isn't what I signed up for.

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:46,020
I signed up to listen to a angry
half a Leprechaun, you know,

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,880
bitch above getting a
sunburn. Um, all right,

well I can actually announce some dates.

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,600
I don't know why I can
announce all of them.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,790
I don't know what the
big fucking secret is.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,460
It's not like I'm going to go over
there to start spying on you. Uh,

three dates in Ireland too,

54
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,900
and I got a something in
Amsterdam. I think that'll be it.

55
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,190
Nice little 10 day fucking run
there. Go over there. You know,

56
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,980
stare at you pasty constancy.
Where my freckles came from.

57
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:43,510
That's what I'm doing. Oh, I
can't wait. I cannot fucking wait.

58
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,860
You know we are knee deep neck
deep into writing this season.

59
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,950
We've got the table right here and
a couple of hours for episode five,

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,660
episode five. Um, then we do six, seven,

61
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,150
eight and June and then
nine and 10 in July.

62
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:03,151
And then we fucking edit
them for the next 10 months,

63
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,600
not even 10 months, whatever.

64
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,150
For the next six months we'll be adding
in all this fucking shit and we'll

65
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:11,380
basically have them and then they'll come
out may of next year and you guys will

66
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:15,100
sit down with a six pack of beer and
you'll burn through them in about three

67
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:19,150
hours and then be like, wait a fucks.
The next one. And you know what?

68
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:21,130
We'll make you some more cause
we're having a great time,

69
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:23,020
but I'm not gonna lie to you. Um,

70
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,610
it has become my life and I don't
know what the fuck's going on at all.

71
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,360
I know that Donald Trump
was here yesterday.

72
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm having a rally down
in fucking Anaheim. Um,

73
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,300
which I thought was pretty perfect for
him to be heading down towards Orange

74
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,800
County with whatever the fuck it is on
his head to talk to a bunch of people

75
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:49,110
that, you know, whatever the
fuck they did to their face.

76
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,870
You know, I swear to God, Hollywood
gets such, gets so much shit for like,

77
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:57,000
you know, like everybody out
here has plastic surgery.

78
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:01,020
I'm not saying they don't, but I'm
at least it's decent. Jesus Christ,

79
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:04,950
you go down to fucking Orange County
with all those real housewives and those

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,160
white Bruce Jenner looking
dudes. You know what I mean?

81
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:12,810
Remember Bruce was still Bruce, remember
when Caitlin was still Bruce and uh,

82
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,450
the dude had his eyes done, you
know, and the nose and all that.

83
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:17,950
They all had like those fucking, I
think at that bit about that my act,

84
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,560
they gavel have that Bruce Jenner eyes
and I used to, I thought it was bullshit.

85
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:23,394
I was, you know,

86
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,730
okay.

87
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,080
You know,

88
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,980
when my wife would watch
the real housewives of a
housewives of Orange County,

89
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,740
I'd be like, all right. They pick
the six biggest psycho couples.

90
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:36,340
They could find people down
here, don't look like this.

91
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:39,280
And then I went down to Irvine and I was
playing the Improv and I walked around

92
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:43,930
the mall and I was like, wait a minute,
wait a minute. These fucking people,

93
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,340
they, I don't know what
they're doing out here.

94
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,200
I think when you get into warmer client
climates and people who have to wear

95
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:53,380
less clothes, they really start
doing the plastic surgery shit.

96
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,740
You know what I mean? All you
guys in those winter climates,

97
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:01,610
you can in your puffy
coats, you know, sport coat,

98
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,680
buttoned down shirt. I'll
never forget that one.

99
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:06,590
I used to work in a warehouse when I
was a young lad. Full head of hair,

100
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,450
fucking abs, the whole thing.
Half as many freckles, you know,

101
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,810
sunny outlook on life. Oh,
it was a long time ago.

102
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,440
I remember once a year we'd have the
company picnic and all these fucking suits

103
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:22,670
who looked like they were in at least
halfway decent shape. They'd showed up.

104
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,990
They show up a tee shirts
and Holy Shit, Jesus Christ,

105
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:30,560
the fucking rolls just
fucking spilling up.

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,350
Pushing out the fucking
t-shirts. It was horrific.

107
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,520
I just remember looking
at these people going,

108
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,880
this guys weren't in
the company this time.

109
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,790
I'm taking orders from this tub of
shit. And they could feel it too.

110
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,410
They could feel it. Um,

111
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,420
they felt the eyes looking at them.
Shame. You could shame people.

112
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,400
Could fetch shame people back in
88 89. Not Anymore. Not Anymore.

113
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,050
Now I'm now I'm the problem. Right. It's
not their fucking 8,000 calories a day.

114
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,020
You know, it's what happened
to them when they was six.

115
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,580
That's why they're eating fucking ice
cream with candy bars in it. I'm sorry.

116
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,790
Anyways, let's plow ahead here. Yes.

117
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,750
So I have absolutely no idea what
the fuck is going on at anywhere,

118
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,830
at any time. Anything. All I know
is I'm in a fucking writers room.

119
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,100
Not Evidently meet me in St Louis.

120
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:22,130
Louie meet me at the fair.

121
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,930
Evidently my Saint Louis Blues loss
last night, you know, they came back,

122
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:30,320
they tied it up, four
games, two games to two.

123
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,130
And that's the last game I saw cause I've
been stuck in this fucking room and I

124
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:38,870
forgot to tape the last couple
of times. Um, you know, cause we,

125
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:39,350
you know,

126
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,710
we had one every once in a while you
just have a fucking a story and you're

127
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:46,670
trying to do it. Everybody's got 15,000
notes. You know, this isn't tracking,

128
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:51,560
it's not on the page. I don't think
we earned this. What's the motivation?

129
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,970
You've got to raise the stakes. And
for those of you not in the business,

130
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:59,570
that means you're not going to see
anybody you love for the next 48 hours.

131
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,330
So I missed everything. Evidently,
according to people on Twitter,

132
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:07,760
the sharks gave the blues,
the old right there,

133
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,830
Fred and game five and six
sit down and shut the fuck up.

134
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,810
My condolences to blues fans.
Um, I know you wanted more,

135
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:20,420
but a great season. You know,
you beat the fucking blues,

136
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,730
you beat the fucking stars and then
you lost the fucking sharks. All right.

137
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,570
And I believe it was meatloaf
who said two out of three. Sorry.

138
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,410
Um, yeah, that's fucking brutal, man.

139
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,130
Especially when you get that deep into
the playoffs and then it's just fucking

140
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:39,530
over. And then you just sit there
and like, now what do I do? Well,

141
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:41,270
you live in St Louis. This is what you do.

142
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:45,230
You go to a cardinals game and you watch
the rams pack up and leave your city,

143
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,980
and this is what you should do.

144
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:52,370
Rather than crying in your
fucking Peyton Manning,

145
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,830
partially owned beer, um,

146
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,650
what you should do is, uh,

147
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,920
you guys ought to fucking talk to the
Arizona cardinals, tell them to come back.

148
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,320
You know? I mean, that's what I would
do. Oh, what's your belt now? I wouldn't,

149
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,430
I wouldn't even know how to begin.

150
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,590
I wouldn't know how to begin to go
about doing something like that.

151
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:12,710
Okay.

152
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,500
Yeah. I mean, I would have no idea how to,

153
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,930
I have no idea how to go about anything.
I'm one of those fucking guys. You,

154
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,300
you should do. He should fucking
do this. So, yeah. How do you,

155
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:23,300
how do you do that? And I'm
like, I'm like Donald Trump,

156
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,960
except I'm not running
for president. You know,

157
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,390
build a fucking wall
between here and Mexico.

158
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,680
I'm gonna make Mexico pay for it. Oh
yeah. How are you gonna do that, Donald?

159
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,360
Ah, the fucking guy. Can you
fucking believe that, that, I mean,

160
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,860
it's fun. It's, it's

161
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,493
okay.

162
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,970
Ben and Hillary Clinton.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,640
I cannot believe people are going to
fucking vote for either one of them.

164
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:50,720
I just cannot fucking believe
it on fucker believable.

165
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,910
They'll vote for Hillary Clinton.

166
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:56,060
They'll put her in fucking office
and then bitch, that nothing changed.

167
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,320
How many fucking times? Remember
that? [inaudible] we're gonna fucking,

168
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,440
we got a new guy. We got hope. It's
going to end the war. Close down.

169
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:08,910
Guantanamo Bay. It's nothing
fucking chair. Nothing JJ.

170
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,260
It's exact fucking SAPE dig. And
he got this fucking jerk off.

171
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,450
Who's just, all he just says is, no
matter what, you bring up a Donald,

172
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:23,830
what's up with your shirt? This is the
best shirt. I have the best shirts.

173
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,340
I'll have the best shirts
of any president ever.

174
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:32,080
And there's a fucking zillion people
losing their fucking minds going,

175
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:36,490
this guy, this guy's going
to turn it around. I guess.

176
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:39,970
He said the other day, he took a
physical, he's 69 years old and he said,

177
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:44,020
the doctor said he had the, I have, he
said, I had the, I have the best body,

178
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:49,240
the best body of any 69 year old he's
ever seen. Like how do you not see like,

179
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,680
you know what he's like, remember
that guy who wrote the twist Karma?

180
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,820
Let's do the twist, right? And
then next summary comes out, hey,

181
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,990
write another set song.

182
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,630
A twist again like we did last
summer. It's the same fucking song.

183
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,960
The guy actually brief
reference back. Like, you know,

184
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:12,340
do you remember when
I wrote the same song?

185
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,590
It was a year ago. Um, the
fuck was that guy's name.

186
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,130
I know it wasn't Charlie
Pride Chubby checker.

187
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,940
You know what's worse about anytime
you bring up Chubby Checker,

188
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,270
then somebody always has to tell you
the story of how he got his name. Well,

189
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:33,010
you know, there was fats, dominoes.
They said fat Chubby, domino checker.

190
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,560
Yes. Everybody started that story.

191
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,760
We all saw Dick Clark tell that story
and then everybody told it in the fucking

192
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:43,570
bars. You can't. Um, anyways, so.

193
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,810
Oh, I haven't given you
guys the update on my side.

194
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,510
Uh Oh. Oh, oh.

195
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,933
Um,

196
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,480
I think I found the cure for it.

197
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,110
Okay.

198
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,190
I have not sat down for more
than fucking, I don't know,

199
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,760
six seconds for the last like 48 hours
and it seems to be doing wonders for me.

200
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,700
That's the hardest thing about
having Sciatic, either one.

201
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:16,210
I drive to the fucking
office and come back. Um,

202
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,490
I basically stand up in the writer's
room and when I'm sick of standing I just

203
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,330
lay down on the floor like one of
those fucking animals at the airport.

204
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,540
Some of the pictures you guys are
sending me to a fucking hilarious.

205
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,420
This guy sent me one with
this guy was like, you know,

206
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:34,900
they have the row of chairs. He
was sleeping underneath them,

207
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,830
like perpendicular to
them. So he had his legs,

208
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,720
his ass and his lower back were
underneath the chair laying on his front.

209
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,610
And then he was like holding onto like
his hooded sweatshirt that he was using

210
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:52,570
as a pillow. He had that all wrapped
with his head on the side, like a,

211
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,510
like a little kids sleeping
with a stuffed animal.

212
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,013
Um,

213
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,440
I mean, gee, like how long is
your flight been delayed that you,

214
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,790
you just lost that much?

215
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,213
I don't know.

216
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,300
Respect for yourself that you can fuck
in late. I mean, it was kitten who,

217
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:11,900
I mean, I get on a plane every once in
a while. It's a long fucking flight.

218
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,790
You know, you might kick your
shoes off, you got your socks on,

219
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,600
you keep your socks on top of your shoes.

220
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:19,370
You might do something
like that for a minute,

221
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:24,020
provided your feet don't fucking stink.
Provided you took a shower that day.

222
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,100
You got on some fucking fairly new
socks in a fairly new pair of sneakers.

223
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,870
There's nothing wrong with that.

224
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:33,170
But Jesus Christ and he started walking
around the fucking plane going into the

225
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:37,530
bathroom animals. So anyways,
anyways, let me, let me, uh,

226
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,020
let me get back to the sports
here. So the blues are knocked out.

227
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,220
The sharks have made
their first final, um,

228
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,230
the cavs kicked the fuck out of the, the,

229
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:54,380
the raptors as far as I know. And
I've only, you know, like I said,

230
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:59,381
I just watch highlights of this shit
dumb as fucking move was the raptors to

231
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:04,100
start doing the a wagon. The finger.
Why would you do that? You know,

232
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,790
hey, we're finally starting
to win here. Why don't we, uh,

233
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,130
piss off the calves and
get them more motivated?

234
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:14,270
They only have Lebron
fucking James, you know, um,

235
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,470
and OKC is in the process
of uh, raping the A.

236
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,443
Okay.

237
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,290
The fuck are they the California seals
who they playing golden state warriors.

238
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,910
Um, [inaudible]

239
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,070
Jesus Christ.

240
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,470
Okay.

241
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,350
I've missed all of it and I don't
know anybody on any fucking team.

242
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,180
I mean other than the
stars, I know those guys.

243
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,110
So I'm going to shut up about it,

244
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:39,910
but I am tonight I'm going to tape game
seven of the pens lightening and I'm

245
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,260
also going to take the a,

246
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:44,440
the OKC game cause I want to see if
they're going to close out the warriors.

247
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,683
Um,

248
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,360
and then, you know, you know, it's funny,

249
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,010
all you need to do is just
watch highlights and you could,

250
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,680
you could still host a show. You know,

251
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,630
I got to tell you right
now, formal clip on the,

252
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,220
whoever makes the finals in the
east, let's say Cleveland Winds,

253
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,820
I'll tell you from of
Cleveland Cavaliers. Oh,

254
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,580
you gotta be concerned with the
[inaudible] of Oklahoma City.

255
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:08,020
Consider the [inaudible] Hey
Peter Warriors, you know,

256
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,190
to perennial favor taught the worst. Um,

257
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,740
okay,

258
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,540
that's amazing. The shit
that they're doing out there.

259
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,340
I wish I was watching it and I didn't,

260
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:20,120
so I'm going to shut up about it all
right before it's any more excruciating to

261
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:22,640
all you cons out there. Um, yeah,

262
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:26,270
so we're sitting there out right in
the fucking show and there's all these

263
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,100
Goddamn fucking,

264
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,740
okay.

265
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,760
Like storm troopers driving up and
down the street. You ever see those,

266
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:38,220
those fucking lunatics, cops like this,

267
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,950
the riot gear. Once you know that,
you'd think you'd only see them.

268
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,330
Okay.

269
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,240
You'd think you'd only see them in
like countries where they have like a

270
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:47,074
dictator.

271
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,680
You know where the truck is driving down
the street and they're standing on the

272
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:55,550
outside of it, holding onto
it like just, just way,

273
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:59,390
way over the top. Like what the fuck?

274
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,390
I thought I lived in a
democracy. What the fuck is that?

275
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,190
They were driving over to like Jimmy
Kimmel because Trump was going to go over

276
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:11,090
there and say that he was the
greatest panel guest ever. Um,

277
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,310
yeah,

278
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,070
and they're fucking driving
over. They're like lunatics.

279
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,020
One of the biggest bullshit things ever
is that in this country you're allowed

280
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,770
to protest. It's such bullshit.
You're not, you show up to protest,

281
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,880
you stand in there with your sign and
then the cops come down and they beat the

282
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:30,340
shit out of you. That's
basically what happens.

283
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Or you file for a permit and they tell
you where you can protest and it's down

284
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:37,600
the street and, and up
over a fucking hill.

285
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,760
And if we even remotely raise your
voice, you get a Billy club to the face.

286
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,230
And that's pretty much every single
fucking country out there that considers

287
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:50,650
itself a democracy. Now, the ones
that have a fucking dictator,

288
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,710
you're not even allowed to do it.
They just come out and they shoot you.

289
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,300
So I guess, you know,
compared to getting shot,

290
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,080
okay,

291
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,390
it's fucking unbill I just
don't fucking get it. Why,

292
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,540
what is wrong with a bunch of
people chanting with signs?

293
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm not talking about the people start
jumping on cop cars cause those are the

294
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,670
guys that they always show.
But even if you don't do that,

295
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,190
they just come down and they
beat the fuck out of you. Um,

296
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:15,660
yeah,

297
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,450
I'd hate to have that job as a cop.

298
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,120
It's gotta be so weird driving down
there going like, wait a minute.

299
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:25,610
These are fellow Americans,
they're protesting.

300
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,960
This is the sign of a healthy
democracy. And then you've got your guy,

301
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,070
why not tell you

302
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:32,750
yeah,

303
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,220
to slam the club on their fucking
head. You know, you're gonna ask me.

304
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,110
Ha. Um,

305
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:40,560
okay.

306
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,430
But they had like all these
fucking trucks and shit.

307
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,350
They would just fly and up and
down the fucking street, you know,

308
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,550
and then they'll put it on the news and
be eight people that will flipping the

309
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,080
fuck out and that's all
they're going to show.

310
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:54,990
And then the other thousand that showed
up and would just show to stand in there

311
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,050
and they're all going to get defined
by them. You know, it works well.

312
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:59,610
I guess I'm doing that to the cops. Right?

313
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,860
Defining them by all the ones
that beat the fuck out of them.

314
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,111
That's what I like to do.

315
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:07,470
People I'd like to make a point and
then I like to just completely fucking

316
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:11,900
destroy everything that I said. You know

324
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,030
Um, let me do a little bit of fucking
reads here really quickly before I fucking

325
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,450
okay.

326
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,080
What do I get here? 1618 fucking
minutes. Sorry. I gotta get moving here.

327
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,990
All right, here we go. Zip
Recruiter. Oh, by the way,

328
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:55,410
I got to tell you this, I fucking,
I couldn't sleep last night, right?

329
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,920
So like four 50 in the
morning, I'm just, I'm gone.

330
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,010
I'm on Twitter and up for whatever
reason. I'm just fucking looking at shit.

331
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,820
And I put my phone on silence and I
turned all the volume down cause knee is

332
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,620
sleeping next to me and then there was a
video and I clicked on it and I thought

333
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:17,910
because everything was off that I could
just fucking watch it with the sound

334
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:21,900
down. You know, I was watching
all those things for people.

335
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,700
Somebody falls down and they
put it to a song, you know,

336
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,670
and there was somebody doing
like those fucking, you know,

337
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,050
a burnout spinning around and shit
and fucking slammed into this guy.

338
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,760
So I wanted to hear what song they
put it too. I ain't want to see that.

339
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,010
I just wanted the screen to be
bigger so I could fucking see it.

340
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:44,970
And I press play and it came on full blast

341
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,220
and my wife just goes, Jesus
Christ. But what the fuck?

342
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:52,500
I flipped out and I was
like, sorry, sorry, sorry.

343
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,920
And then she immediately went back to
sleep and then for another half hour,

344
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,980
you know, I'm still on the
phone cause I can't sleep.

345
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:02,370
And then I hit another one,
like an asshole wasn't thinking,

346
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,650
I just wanted to see what
happened to this person.

347
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,600
And she fucking sat up and she
literally did the Ralph Kramden,

348
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,110
she just goes out, ah,

349
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,300
pointed at the fucking door.

350
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,430
And I wanted to start laughing, but I
knew she was going to get mad at me.

351
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:23,530
And then she just went back
to sleep and I didn't leave.

352
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:27,310
But I'm waiting for her to wake up
so I can tell her that she did that.

353
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,390
Depending on how tired she is, you
know, cause she might be pissed at me,

354
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,550
might still be pissed
at me. You know what?

355
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,780
That's one of those later in the day,

356
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:37,600
once at the end of the day when she can
go to sleep, I'll fucking bring it up.

357

what is it about buying a mattress
that leaves you feeling violated?

380
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,210
Why would you bring up
mattress and violated?

Why would you say that in the
same sentence? Jesus Christ.

I have no idea. Let's read more copy and

405
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:59,420
Do they recycle it in a third
world like an old cell phone. Um,

406
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:03,590
if you do love your Hellickson
mattress, keep it and your dignity.

407
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,120
That's why everyone from GQ magazine
to Forbes are all talking about helix

408
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:12,530
sleep. Go to helic, sleep.com/birth
and get $50 off your order.

409
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,360
That's helix sleep.com/bar
hey helic sleep.com/bird.

410
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,720
That's h. E. L. I. X. All right.

411
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:23,690
How many more of these fucking
things I got here? All right, uh,

412
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,130
the next one. Score big. All right.

413
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,130
You're paying too much for tickets
between all the markups and last minute

414
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:35,000
convenient charges, even print and
home fees. Are you fucking kidding me?

415
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:39,020
Over here, you end up paying court
side prices for nosebleed seats.

416
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,850
Score big is here to change that.

417
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,510
Did you know that 40% of all
live event tickets go on sold?

418
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,170
And did you know there's a place
to get these seats at huge savings?

419
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:51,700
It's called ScoreBig.
Well then you bought them.

420
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,660
How did you get them to the fucking
team? Just gave them to you.

421
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,310
I really don't understand what that means.

422
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,510
Score bid works directly with your
favorite teams. Ah, that's how it works.

423
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:07,320
And artists to get their unsold seats
at unpublished prices only with score.

424
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,920
So that's when you know you're
fucking not selling any tickets.

425
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,370
When score big goes, hey, you want me
to take half the arena off your hands?

426
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,030
You non-selling cunt.
I'm only with score big.

427
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:21,710
Can you name a ticket price
and be guaranteed to payable
a below box office up

428
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:25,610

to your own Palette tastes.

461
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,320

our recommendations become even more
personalized with every bottle you rate.

, to make our all of our own wine.

465
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,740
Our $13 bottles would normally retail
for 20 bucks plus a more than $20,

466
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:39,670
I think is what they were
trying to say. They're a,

467
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,590
you choose the type and quantity of

cancellation fee. 100%

469
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,860
We partner with local artists to develop

470
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:56,940
art right now at club. Debbie, did
I tell you I can speak Spanish?

your first order when you go to club

472
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,580
Debbie, I wouldn't build a
wall.com/bar and it gets even better.

473
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,870
I know you all hate paying for shipping.
So club Debbie, I used to go to Yale,

474
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,830
will actually pay for your shipping
on orders of four bottles or more.

475
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,070
So take something off your to do
list. Just go to club, Debbie.

476
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:21,690
I never went to class.com/ [inaudible]
to get $20 off your first order.

477
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:26,430
Now that's club Debbie and weapons of
mass destruction.com/burn. All right,

478
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:30,000
that's it. And we're out. We're out. Um,

479
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,850
anyways, what the fuck can I finish on?

480
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,960
I really don't have anything
to finish on other than um,

481
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,470
am excited that we're doing the table.

482
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,700
Refer a number five next
week we write all week.

483
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,990
We don't have a table read and then
three weeks in a row we do episodes six,

484
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:49,590
seven, eight week of just
writing, no table read.

485
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,000
And then nine 10,

486
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,680
and then I'm fucking done in the writer's
room and maybe my fucking ass over

487
00:28:55,681 --> 00:29:00,570
here can fucking stop sending
electric jolts down my fucking leg

488
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,930
laying down in the room. Now Guy,

489
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:07,260
I feel like fucking like some
Howard Hughes without the money.

490
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,300
This fucking wolf man nails. You know,

491
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:14,880
I saw somebody the other day when I was
in the airport and they were playing

492
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:19,680
classical guitar. You know what
I mean? And it sounded beautiful.

493
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:22,100
But the only thing that sucks
about playing classical guitars,

494
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,660
you got to grow your nails
like a fucking wolf man.

495
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,060
You know we're on one of your hands and
it's all good when you're sitting down

496
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:34,980
playing guitar. But the second you
put your guitar down, you just,

497
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,900
it looks fucking gross.
I'm out of my mind.

498
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,620
And I guess that's no reason to stop.

499
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,780
There's a few instruments you always
have to pay the price for like trumpet

500
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,730
trumpets, one of them, you know?

501
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,540
Okay.

502
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,350
You start playing the trumpet. You get
that fucking Callus on you, on your,

503
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:53,860
on your lip. You know, it's one
of my favorite instruments ever.

504
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,990
I love the fucking trumpet,
but I would never play it,

505
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,930
play it because I W I wasn't
willing to pay the price.

506
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,180
And plus I knew I would only be okay
at it. Who wants to be okay with it?

507
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:07,000
Fucking trumpet. Callous.
I'm not this guy.

508
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,850
I'll tell you that right
now. Alright, now here we go.

509
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,340
I'm going to give you my
predictions for all the games,

510
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,010
sixes and sevens out there. And a,

511
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:18,880
you can take all of these predictions
to the bank and they won't give you shit

512
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:22,210
for them cause I haven't
watched any of these series. Um,

513
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,970
the goal of the, of the
Golden State Warriors will

514
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,703
when,

515
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,080
yeah,

516
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,230
the next thing I Willie, I
dunno, I didn't see the game.

517
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:38,780
All I know is everybody said the
exact same thing. I'll tell you,

518
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,430
this team is a lot longer and a lot
more towel to the near used to sing.

519
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:44,900
Everybody did a version of that.

520
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,310
I guess they're long and
they're talented and uh,

521
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,880
the warriors haven't seen anything like
this even though they played Oklahoma

522
00:30:52,881 --> 00:30:57,120
during the regular season, but I don't
think they were looking at them. Um,

523
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,090
all right. The uh,

524
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,350
Tampa Bay lightning will
win game seven tonight.

525
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,780
Alright. So I feel like I'm o for two
already. And what else? We got the calves.

526
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,110
Oh, the calves that went in, the next
one, that fucking series is over.

527
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,670
You don't fucking wag your finger and
fucking Lebron James face or any of his

528
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:22,400
teammates or Yeti your
fucking mind. You know,

529
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,100
all these fucking actors
running around, bulking up,

530
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:28,100
putting on their fucking underoos,
playing these superheroes, right?

531
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,640
And all these fucking nerds
going down to fucking check, uh,

532
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:37,460
who could fucking be when the hulk or
captain America. And what about Thor will,

533
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:40,220
he's got, he's stupid. He just
says a hat and a hammer, you know,

534
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,990
you cut his hair, his fucking hammer
breaks all his fucking bullshit, you know,

535
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,740
and then you got these fucking comic
con [inaudible] who actually dress like

536
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,860
superheroes for real and walk
around and try and stop crime.

537
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,690
You know what I mean? Cause they just
so want these superheroes to be real.

538
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:01,490
Whoa. Just go to a cavs game. You
stupid cunt and watch Lebron James.

539
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,580
Okay. Lebron James could grab Batman
and Robin in one fucking hand.

540
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,900
Throw him through a plate glass window
and he'd still get the end one if someone

541
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:14,660
was hanging off his
other fucking arm, okay.

542
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,290
Just go buy a ticket and sit
down like a fucking gentlemen.

543
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,950
Stop standing in line
with fucking 50 people.

544
00:32:21,951 --> 00:32:26,570
Dress like Chewbacca and an
and aqua man down in San Diego.

545
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:30,140
Whatever the fuck you go. Cause he can
sit down and talk to the cast of, uh,

546
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,310
I don't fucking one of those
goddamn shows. What does, what does,

547
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:37,760
what does that, what does a car? I
guess mine's a comic con show. Huh?

548
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:41,540
Now that I think about it. Jesus.
I hope they don't play that audio.

549
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:45,290
If we ever do that show, well maybe
they do. What are they going to do? Wow.

550
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,720
Throw some of their rough action
figures still in the box at me.

551
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,800
You know why it's worth more
if it's still in the box. A,

552
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:00,580
I can't say why I can't say, ah,

553
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,810
you know why it's fucking Weirdos.

554
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,450
Cause you know it hasn't been anywhere
disgusting. I'm happy red nose day.

555
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,170
What is this here? A people send me
this. Twitter is for kids. You red nose.

556
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:18,650
Fuck. Oh, somebody just told me what
the red nose thing is for. It goes,

557
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,780
it's for kids. Oh, is that what it's
for? It's for kids. All that explains it.

558
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,100
Yeah.

559
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,490
I don't know why I'm such a
Douche, but I fucking cannot stand.

560
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:35,970
I can't fucking stand when a bunch of
celebrities get behind a fucking cause and

561
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:41,650
there's a fucking ribbon or
a God damn nose and they,

562
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,230
I don't know why. I just, it drys.

563
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,590
I know it's a good cause behind the cars,

564
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,300
but I fucking hate it.

565
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,080
And then everybody's got to find their
own unique way to have the nose on their

566
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:57,040
face. How they're going to
fucking hold it. It's just, Ah,

567
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,210
it just drives me up the fucking wall
that in famous people telling me who to

568
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:05,170
vote for. Oh, you know what?
I didn't know who to vote for.

569
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,920
And then you told me. I mean,
I guess I bitch about it,

570
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,800
but I'm not telling you who to vote
for. I don't fucking know, like,

571
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:16,240
make a fucking 20 minute video. Here's
why you should vote for fucking Freddy.

572
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,390
Fuckface you know, we're
running out of water. Oh,

573
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,250
shut up. Um,

574
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,770
you know what's funny
about what I just said?

575
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:30,040
I could literally just stare in a mirror
and say that to myself in a lot of

576
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,230
ways. Right. I never tell
you constitute a vote for.

577
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:35,670
I just make fun of the people you do
vote forth. That's what I do. Hey,

578
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:39,790
you want some comb over orange haired
cunt? Why don't you just vote for me

579
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,380
instead of Donald Trump?
The fuck is wrong with you.

580
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,650
I have the greatest podcast ever.

581
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,210
Yeah.

582
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,310
Nobody tells us shit joke like me.

583
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,400
This club owner told me after
in 40 years of running a club,

584
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,050
he's never seen shit jokes.

585
00:34:58,051 --> 00:35:03,051
Like my shit jokes I'm speaking of which
I'm actually doing a bad fall for the

586
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:06,390
fuck you want to vote for. I don't give
a fuck. It's not gonna change anything.

587
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:09,180
We're a bunch of animals and we're doomed
to destroy each other. So, you know,

588
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:14,040
get yourself a dog and a hobby.
You know, find somebody you like,

589
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,980
treat them nice and a, that'd be great.

590
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,960
They'll stay with you and when
the whole thing goes down,

591
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:23,910
you'll have someone to
hug Jesus. Um, anyways,

592
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,280
that, that, that made me lose my
complete train of thought. Oh,

593
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:30,670
tonight to not tonight. Tonight.

594
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,980
Whoa. Um, what was Phil Colin's
thinking in the 80s? Jesus Christ.

595
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,530
He's such a great musician of the
worst fucking songs. After, after a

596
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,670
[inaudible], um, then all
of a sudden he was doing,

597
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:49,760
you can't hurry love after. You
can't hurry love. Then did that song

598
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,350
easy lover was decent.

599
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:54,690
Yeah.

600
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,460
And then it just went
off the fucking rails.

601
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:57,970
Yeah,

602
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:02,190
it's a studio. Yeah. That
one we'll use yelling at you,

603
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,133
you know,

604
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,250
telling us to think twice because it's
another day for you and me in paradise.

605
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:12,930
You know, when you see a homeless person,
it's like, hey, fuck head. You know,

606
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,060
the way I'm living compared
to the way you're living.

607
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:16,800
You don't need to look at a
homeless guy. Just look at me.

608
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,420
She feel lucky when you look at me.

609
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:22,680
You don't have to go all the way down to
that level. Do you? You fucking castle.

610
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,650
Um, tonight I'm going to be
down at the comedy still, uh,

611
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:32,520
doing a benefit for
kids. That's another one,

612
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,190
but I won't be wearing a red nose. Uh,

613
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,950
but I will be jumping around
like a fucking clown. This
is for a, you know what?

614
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:44,010
I don't know what it's for. It's for
sick kids in hospitals. I have no idea.

615
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,490
All I know is whoever put
it together. Um, I dunno.

616
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,990
I trust him. Steve Simone. I trust
the guy. So I figured, you know,

617
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,190
I figured it's on the up and
up. Who knows? I don't fucking,

618
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:59,940
I don't pretend to know things. Um, hey,

619
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,710
is anybody out there who listens to this?

620
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:05,040
Are you one of those fucking riot police
guys that rides on the outside of the

621
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:09,150
truck? And when you do it as much
as your adrenaline is going up,

622
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,850
do you ever just think of
how fucking ridiculous it is?

623
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,390
Yeah.

624
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:17,830
You know, like what are we doing here?
We got to get over to Jimmy Kimmel.

625
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,750
Donald Trump is there, um,
what's going to happen?

626
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,850
Uh, all right. I think, I think I
pissed off enough people with this one.

627
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,540
All right, good. Um, I have a great
weekend you cunts and I will talk to you

628
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,560
on Monday. And like I said, you can take
all of those predictions to the bank.

629
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,753
[inaudible] [inaudible]

630
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,270
hey, what's going on? It's Bill Barr.

631
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,770
Yeah. Isn't that exciting? It's the, uh,

632
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,580
it's the Monday morning
podcast. How are you?

633
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:21,850
Thanks for coming to my page and thank
you for listening and thank to is

634
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:24,710
Memorial Day. So here
we go. Something Nice.

635
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:27,800
Thank you to all the men and women who
are serving this country right now,

636
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:32,450
sweating their asses off
over there in Iraq. Uh,

637
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,590
I don't know what you supposed to say
today. Do you say Happy Memorial Day?

638
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:39,080
I don't think you do. That
doesn't seem a fitting.

639
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,970
I Dunno what I'm trying to see if there's
a memorial day parade out here in La

640
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,980
and if, if so, where would
it be? You know what I mean?

641
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,830
And the Memorial Day parade is a very, uh,

642
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,800
to serious things.

643
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:59,890
So I can't picture the parade going
down sunset honoring the fallen men and

644
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:05,210
women who have served this country as
the parade goes by the fucking saddle

645
00:40:05,211 --> 00:40:07,340
ranch. You know,

646
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,390
there's two whores watching some
shit head, right? A fake horse,

647
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,060
you know what I mean? I just don't
know where they would have it out here.

648
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:18,080
I'm really not up on the parades out
here in la since I moved out here.

649
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:22,490
I know they had the gay pride parade.
I know that's an Halloween. Um,

650
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,390
that one's always hilarious and confusing.

651
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,790
I've never understood the
gay pride parade. You know,

652
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:33,791
they spend fucking 51 weeks out
of the year trying to be like,

653
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:38,120
look, we're normal. We're
just born this way. Okay.

654
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,650
For the love of God. Stop tying US
defense posts in Wyoming. All right,

655
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,870
we're not against God. We're just wired
this way. You know, and then they,

656
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,410
they have the gay pride parade and
you'd think they'd come down the street,

657
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,310
you know, try and look a
little bit respectable.

658
00:40:55,311 --> 00:40:57,860
And what happens is everybody's coming
down the street with a Dick in their

659
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:02,120
hand. They got fucking, I
just don't get it. You know,

660
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,490
it's just the Goddamn free for all.

661
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,730
So fucking spectacle. I
definitely recommend seeing
it if you ever want to just,

662
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,983
uh,

663
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,470
if you ever wanted to see
what 300 would look like if a,

664
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,360
that's what it looks like.

665
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:25,361
It looks like that movie 300 wood
dildos cause everybody's shredded.

666
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,081
I don't know what gay,

667
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:30,020
why hasn't a gay guy put out
like a fucking exercise video?

668
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,110
You know what I mean?
It's always easy. These,

669
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:40,220
he's half a fat guys who
actually heterosexual and
now we standing on a beach,

670
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,690
nobody is more shredded dead
than those, those gay dudes.

671
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,590
I don't know what it is. Cause there
are their weights and those Dildos,

672
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,430
is that what it is?

673
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,650
Dod a fucking balloon to the wall
and you do pull ups or something. Oh,

674
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:58,970
speaking of that shit, I know a few
weeks ago I was talking about, you know,

675
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:02,990
wanting to get in shape
and uh, I actually, I, I,

676
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:06,980
you know some about that t 90 x system
and a couple people said it was bullshit

677
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:09,870
ever. The people said that they liked
it all. I know it was like, you know,

678
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,230
200 bucks in like 58 DVDs.

679
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,000
I was like a time life series, you
know, on how to get abs or something.

680
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,820
And it was just a, it was
too overwhelming. And I
go on the road too much.

681
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:23,000
So I found the solution. I, uh,

682
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,510
went online and I bought some, uh,

683
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:31,370
I bought rings, you know,
those rings, uh, Jim misuse.

684
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:36,800
I'm going to put up a channel bar today
and I swear to God by the end of the

685
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,520
year, I'm going to learn how to
do a fucking iron cross. And, uh,

686
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,150
I just watched that
gymnastic shit and I missed,

687
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:47,780
nobody is more shredded than those dudes.

688
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:51,290
And there's something I like about
being able to lift your own body weight.

689
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,850
You know what I mean? That we, you know,

690
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,880
if you can like climb
up a fucking building,

691
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:58,850
I think that's way better than
being able to bench press a car.

692
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,390
Maybe it depends on the situation
that you're in. You know,

693
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:06,260
some fat fucks sitting on your chest
going, what are you going to do? Well,

694
00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:09,020
what are you gonna do about it?
We're do, we're gonna do like,

695
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:13,040
I guess then if you could bench 400
pounds, that would be like a good thing.

696
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,270
But, uh, I don't know. House fire,

697
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,000
you being chased by somebody if you can
go up the fucking building like spider

698
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,970
man. I think that, I
think that that's, uh,

699
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,160
I have to think that that's always better.
That'd be a cool thing. Jesus Christ.

700
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:31,960
I can't get it out, Bill. I'm like, I
think, I think I did. They did that,

701
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,930
that you said you said you
wanted one spider. Um, yeah.

702
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:40,370
So see if I can get you the
website here. This is what this is.

703
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,020
This is what this podcast is becoming
is becoming me informing you on the

704
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:48,080
fucking whacked out shit
that I do. All right.

705
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:53,081
This is the training rings is where I
went to and the www.training rings.com and

706
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:00,230

able to do one of those muscle ups,

707
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:01,160
you know,

708
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,160
and I'm gonna start wearing really tight
tee shirts on a on stage and then I'll

709
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:10,370
be ready for the gay pride parade.
Look at that. I brought it full circle.

710
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,750
All right. All right. Before
I get into the podcast,

711
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,910
those of you who are new to my podcast,

712
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,440
I basically had to do one of these every
week and uh, people send me advice.

713
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,620
Sometimes people ask for me,
advice. People send me questions,

714
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,790
I try to ask for them, answer
them. I mean best of my ability.

715
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:34,320
Um, I dunno and you know, I don't read,

716
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,950
I just sorta start talking.
So don't really listen to me.

717
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,690
Just I hope I make you laugh at some
shit and I hype upcoming shit that I have

718
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:47,220
like this week. Um, May 24th,

719
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:51,600
I have a real busy week this
week, May 24th, um, the next,

720
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:56,760
um, installment of the uninformed show
with bill and Joe de Rosa, my radio show,

721
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,201
our radio show,

722
00:44:58,201 --> 00:45:01,710
me and Joe that we do on XM two o two
is going to be this Saturday night,

723
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,750
May 24th, uh,

724
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,550
on XM two o two from
9:00 PM to 12 midnight.

725
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,180
Uh, I'm going to be a Caroline's
comedy club this week,

726
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:14,460
but it's going to be weird.
I'm going to be there Thursday,

727
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,820
not on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

728
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,590
Why aren't you gonna be there
on, on Friday, Bill? Um,

729
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,460
because I have to fly back to la because
I'm doing stand up on an awards show.

730
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,800
Oh my God. Are you going to be
doing stand up at the Oscars?

731
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,500
Now I'm going to be doing
stand up at the, uh,

732
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,560
Spike TV awards show. I don't know.

733
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:44,460
I never heard of it either. But,
uh, Mexico, I dunno. I'm excited.

734
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,490
I never got to do an award show. So, uh,

735
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:50,070
I'll let you guys know
when and when that, uh,

736
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:55,590
when that's going to be and a usual
that that part of the podcast sucks.

737
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,800
Whenever I hide what I have
coming up, I don't know.

738
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:02,610
The whole thing starts to
grind to a halt. I Dunno.

739
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,200
And then I never have half the fucking
information. It's ridiculous. So, uh,

740
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:11,010
alright, before I get into my, my
rent for the week, um, I actually,

741
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,580
because it is memorial day and I used
to got a really cool email from somebody

742
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,190
who's over there. I don't know if
they're in the army or the marines.

743
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,670
I'm assuming it's one of those
two branches cause they're, uh,

744
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,690
they appear to be on the ground
over there. Um, it says, uh,

745
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:28,170
I hope to get back to the states that
come to see you sometime. A quick story.

746
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:32,670
And it was on a mission the other day and
I picked up the radio and called to my

747
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:36,290
lead truck and said, is
that tactile in your egg?

748
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,190
The other tactical commanders
said, it's asparagus.

749
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:44,040
It was a little bit of humor for us.
Good stuff. Talk to you later bill.

750
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:48,720
How fucking cool is that? Huh?
Somebody sucking over there and Falucia

751
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:54,960
sweeping out the houses or whatever
the hell you do. You know to what?

752
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:57,480
A couple of my jokes. I was
one of the coolest emails.

753
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:02,430
They have a god and a actually have
the name of the guy who sent me that.

754
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:05,400
So when you, when you get back safe,
I'm going to hook you up at a show.

755
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,280
All the rest of you
comes listening to this.

756
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:11,520
Don't start sending me emails pretending
that you're over there just so I can

757
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:15,180
give you a couple of free tickets next
time I play slap e's and fucking Omaha,

758
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:19,820
Nebraska. All right, that's bad
Karma. That's bad fucking Karma.

759
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,080
All right. All right.

760
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:25,080
Here's my fucking rant for the week or
right people and I'm going to try to

761
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:30,081
remain calm throughout this without
losing my shit because I think it's a very

762
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:33,010
important thing that a lot
of people are dealing with.

763
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:39,060
And I'd much rather try to
get the information out and
Amy's in a nice calm way.

764
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,140
That way my message will be heard and
I won't and I won't seem like a psycho.

765
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,760
All right.

766
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,710
Forget about the fact that I talked to
myself for half an hour if we become

767
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,680
these fucking texts. Okay.

768
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,740
So last week I was flying to
New York to do the HBO show,

769
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,700
a down and dirty with Jim Norton.
I was very excited to do it.

770
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:06,010
Anytime you get to do HBO as a
comedian is a big thing, a big,

771
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:11,230
big thing. You know, I was psyched to
see Jim, Jim's the first guy from my,

772
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:15,610
a graduating class of comedians to get
a high profile standup Gig like that.

773
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:19,870
So it was really cool. You know, I was
anticipating seeing him hosting the show.

774
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:21,540
Okay,

775
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,240
Yada, Yada, Yada. All that stuff. Okay.

776
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,220
I get a first class round trip tickets.

777
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:34,750
Fucking lax. No, don't swear. Don't
swear bill. Keep it nice. I, hi.

778
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:39,380
A first round. First class
round trip tickets. Okay.

779
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,070
Counting to 10 here from
lax to Newark. Okay.

780
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,950
I don't know if you guys
have flown first class.

781
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,430
I do it every once in a while
when I get get a fucking TV show.

782
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,420
I don't do it on a regular basis because
I did that for one month and I got an

783
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,180
$8,000 credit card bill
and I said, you know what?

784
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,830
I don't think coaches that bad.

785
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:04,530
So now I got a free round
trip. First Class ticket.

786
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,040
Did I make that point yet? I think I
did. So before I get off the plane,

787
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,980
I haven't eaten but I'm
thinking that doesn't matter.

788
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,650
I have a first class round tickets.

789
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:19,810
I am going to be wined and dined
from lax all the way to Newark,

790
00:49:19,811 --> 00:49:24,670
New Jersey. I'm going to
have fucking wine and dine.

791
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,610
That's what I'm going to have.
Probably get a foot massage, you know,

792
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,930
little hot towel, maybe a quick
little, how are you doing? You know,

793
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:37,530
first class and we sit there and look
down on the people as they're getting into

794
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:42,340
the back of the plane back. Like I'm
running some big successful business,

795
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,530
you know, so I get on the plane,
I'm starving. Oh boy. Oh boy,

796
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:52,490
I'm going to get something to
eat. Yeah, they hand me the menu.

797
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:57,410
Okay. And what is, I got two choices. I
can either get an omelet with potatoes,

798
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,753
some fruit.

799
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,450
Okay.

800
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,380
I like the muffin and some
orange juice or cereal

801
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,030
and I'm like wow, that's
sort of a limited menu.

802
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,660
Who the fuck would get cereal?
Go Gone with the, I'm like,

803
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,640
who the fuck wouldn't
get it on but a Vegan.

804
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,600
All right, you got me. But most, you know,

805
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,080
generally speaking everybody's
going to get the x.

806
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:27,890
So I go and I read the final line of
the menu and in parentheses it says,

807
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:32,330
please accept our apologies if
your selection is not available.

808
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,160
And I was like,

809
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:40,060
what the fuck is about to happen here?

810
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:41,740
Okay.

811
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:46,630
What do you mean please
accept our apologies if your
selection is not available.

812
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,940
This is first fucking class. Alright,
that shit happens back in coach,

813
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,480
when you sit in row 38 f you
know that may run out of eggs.

814
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:04,020
They run out of eggs in the back where
they got people's fucking stacked up like

815
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:09,190
cordwood. You know? Is that even
a word? A court quarter wood,

816
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:14,080
isn't it an amount of
wood? I don't fucking know.

817
00:51:14,081 --> 00:51:16,870
That's a question for you guys.
What is it? Is that a quarter wood?

818
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,900
I cleared land one day and I heard that,

819
00:51:18,901 --> 00:51:21,420
that expression and I just used
it and I know what the fuck it is.

820
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:24,340
They got people jam packed in the
back of the God damn airplane.

821
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,460
That's where you run out of x. You don't
run out of fucking eggs in first class.

822
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:31,870
See, I'm flipping out. Take it down bill.
Make sure your message is heard. Okay,

823
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:36,040
so I'm sitting there. They start
at the front of first class.

824
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,180
There's like five rows.

825
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:41,530
I'm in row four I'm doing the math and
they're going through and you know what?

826
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,530
Nobody's picking the
cereal. Of course the knock.

827
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:48,280
Why would you pick cereal when
you can get an Omelet? All right.

828
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,980
Needless to say, they get
to my row and they say,

829
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:57,450
what would you like Miss Tuber? And
I said, I would like the Omelet, sir.

830
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:01,580
And they say, Ooh, I'm sorry. Um,

831
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:06,650
we're out of eggs. And I go, what
do you mean you're outta eggs?

832
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:12,120
A yeah. Um, everybody ordered
eggs and EDA, we're out of eggs.

833
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,040
And I go, what do you have left
knowing full well what they had left.

834
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:21,270
And he goes, uh, we
have cereal and a Bagel.

835
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,050
And I looked at the guy and I said, dude,

836
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,070
I paid for a first class
ticket, which I didn't,

837
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,840
of course I didn't have got it for free,

838
00:52:30,841 --> 00:52:33,120
but I don't give a fuck or I
don't want to make a point here.

839
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:36,300
I got to go for big air. I said,
I paid for first class ticket,

840
00:52:36,301 --> 00:52:41,040
I'm not eating cereal. And the
guy was like, I know, I know. Um,

841
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,140
I know you're right. We don't think it's
right, but this is just how they do it.

842
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,710
And I'm like, what do you mean
this is how you do it? I go,

843
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,200
there's like 12 people here at
first-class. How do you run out of eggs?

844
00:52:53,201 --> 00:52:57,480
This is first class. I'm not eating
cereal. The guy goes well on,

845
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,710
on odd flights.

846
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,990
We start at the front of first class
and on evens we start at the back row of

847
00:53:03,991 --> 00:53:07,950
first class. It's like, dude,
it's fucking first class.

848
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:13,830
This shouldn't be a problem. I
want fucking x. And he's like,

849
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,750
I didn't say fucking, I go, I want x.

850
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:17,640
Okay.

851
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,760
And he's like, well, all we have is
serial. I'm sorry sir. And I just said,

852
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:23,870
you know what? I don't want anything,
right? Just start at piling.

853
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:29,250
So I'm sitting there fuming, the stomach
is growling. I got a six hour flight.

854
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,090
I'm starving to death in the widest
Goddamn airplane seat I've ever sat in my

855
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:36,840
life. So like two minutes
goes by and I swear to God,

856
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:41,190
the fucking flight attendant
comes back and he goes, um, a,

857
00:53:41,191 --> 00:53:45,150
I just talked to the pilot, the
captain of the airplane, and he said,

858
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:49,860
he already ate so you can have
his eggs. And I was like, what?

859
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,130
He goes, the pilots said you
can have his X. I'm like,

860
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:58,130
I don't want his fucking eggs.
I don't want his fucking X.

861
00:53:58,131 --> 00:54:01,520
I want my ex this as far as class.
This should be enough fucking x for me.

862
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,810
All right. And the God, he's
a pilot. He should get eggs,

863
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,680
fucking pancakes and waffles, whatever
the fuck he wants. I don't want that.

864
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:14,340
I don't want my pilot up
front fucking start, you know,

865
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,190
passing out all like edit and shit

866
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:23,680
cause he didn't get any
fucking eggs is ridiculous man.

867
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:27,220
I mean how much fucking money do you
have to mix? This is American Airlines,

868
00:54:27,221 --> 00:54:29,350
by the way. This is American Airlines.

869
00:54:29,351 --> 00:54:33,460
This is how fucking tight they are and
they're trying to blame it on these

870
00:54:33,461 --> 00:54:35,290
fucking fuel prices. Oh by the way,

871
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:40,150
I ended up taking the eggs because I was
so goddamn hungry and then I felt bad.

872
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:40,790
I'm sitting there reading,

873
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:44,440
I'm feeling guilty like I'm eating the
pilot's eggs and then another side I'm

874
00:54:44,441 --> 00:54:46,840
feeling like a sell out cause I'm thinking
like maybe they're thinking they're

875
00:54:46,841 --> 00:54:50,110
going to give me these eggs and I'm
not going to fucking fire off a goddamn

876
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,540
letter on their website, which I did.

877
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,310
It's fucking unreal.
American Airlines are.

878
00:54:58,311 --> 00:55:03,260
I did the biggest fucking cuts
of an airplane ever an airline.

879
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,480
Do you remember what I, I remixed this
song a few weeks ago. Remember that

880
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,600
for those of you who didn't,
that was my new thing,

881
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:17,040
cause I'm sick of these
goddamn corporations and
they're fucking, they're happy.

882
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:20,420
Jingles. Is this scrolling you
over every single day still?

883
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:23,760
I read mix this song. They don't
win a little something like that.

884
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:28,430
We're at kid, Eh, fuck you.

885
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:32,190
You Izzy. Yes. I did that as a joke

886
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:39,050
two weeks ago and I swear to God, I've
never been more right in my life either.

887
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,520
The next day I get off
the Goddamn plane bitch.

888
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:46,740
Then I find out they're going to charge
$15 for your first carry on that you

889
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:52,440
first started the first bag that you
check and they keep blaming it on fuel

890
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:53,274
prices.

891
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,540
How the price of fuel keeps going up
and I'm telling you right now as the

892
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:59,910
passenger, if you believe that shit,

893
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:05,350
I don't know what to tell you. They
make money off of misery. Okay?

894
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,020
Nine 11 they made money. Okay.

895
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,370
I'm sure is their expenses go
up 20% whatever. But you know,

896
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:15,940
they don't just raise a 20 they raise a
25 and that's the same thing with this

897
00:56:15,941 --> 00:56:20,520
fucking fuel. This is my question.

898
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:26,020
All right, who's going to start it? Okay.

899
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,770
I'm not starting it, but I swear to
God, if anybody out there starts it,

900
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,570
I'm going to follow. Okay.

901
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:36,571
There has to be some sort of fucking push
back because I don't know what's going

902
00:56:36,671 --> 00:56:40,120
on with these, these fucking, he's got
the incorporations that it used to be.

903
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:43,630
The customer's always right and somehow
my lifetime, it's going to, you know,

904
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:48,010
fuck you and your mother customer.
That's their vibe. You know,

905
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:52,600
when I went to fly back my round
trip, first class ticket, I show up,

906
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:54,160
my fucking flight is canceled.

907
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:00,060
And rather than flying first
class nonstop from Newark to lax,

908
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,400
I was now flying coach to Dallas and
then first-class from Dallas to lax and,

909
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:11,350
and there was no voucher. They're like,
yeah, we're not offering anything.

910
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:16,270
It's like six months ago I would've got
a blow job if you fucked me this bed.

911
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,690
And she's just like, Nah, Nah.
Then they're not offering anything.

912
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,960
You've got to call the one 800 number.
And then I called the one 800 number.

913
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,110
They're like, no, you have to talk
to the person that deck. I'm like,

914
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,640
can't I just talk to
the person at the desk?

915
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,030
And then they hung up cause I said cunt.

916
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:34,090
So then I had to call back and then
the end of it all they gave me was 150

917
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:38,900
bucks. Portugal by like one
third of a coach ticket. Well,

918
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,780
once again, I won't get any fucking eggs.

919
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:46,900
So all I'm asking is who's going to start
it? Who's going to start the fucking,

920
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,780
you know what we need?
We need like a fucking a,

921
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,820
what's Charles Bronson's name and
those death wish movies, Paul Kurzy.

922
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:59,230
We need a fucking the
airline version of that.

923
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,510
Jesus Christ. I mean,

924
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,870
who the fuck wants to pay $15 for
their first bag that they check?

925
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,960
Everybody knows that's
bullshit. Nobody wants to do it,

926
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,480
but we're all going to do it
because we're all just by ourselves.

927
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,140
Twisting in the wind. Okay? But
we all showed up the first day,

928
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,290
June 15th so that promotion,
whatever the fuck it is,

929
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,950
and you show up at the airport with angry
faces and torches like we're going to

930
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:25,600
go try to get Frankenstein guarantee and
none of us has to pay 15 bucks. Okay?

931
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,400
I'm not trying to sign a Ryan here.

932
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,520
I'm just saying somebody start
passing out the two by fours.

933
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,080
I'm done with it. All right?

934
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:39,490
I'm not going to lead it
because I procrastinate and
everybody knows, you know,

935
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,520
they always chop off the
head so the body falls. Okay?

936
00:58:42,521 --> 00:58:46,320
If I learned anything from the
1960s black, white male seam,

937
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:50,380
you fuck with the deal?
You have a convertible ride
in your future. All right?

938
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:55,140
But some good things do happen. So fuck,

939
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:59,830
I'm so pissed right now. If fucking
believe that the pilots eggs,

940
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,670
thankfully the piloted, can
you fucking believe that

941
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:08,140
30 years ago. But God damn
stewardesses, they didn't. It was,

942
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,610
first of all, they were all
hot. That's the one thing, okay?

943
00:59:12,611 --> 00:59:15,310
It was the God damn
glamorous job. All right?

944
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,650
He had a one in 10 chance of hooking
up with one of the hottie stewards as

945
00:59:19,651 --> 00:59:22,210
that's why people used to wear
suits. You want to look good.

946
00:59:22,211 --> 00:59:25,100
It was like a nightclub. Everyone
was boozing, people were smoking.

947
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,430
You having a Goddamn party and the
fucking sky. Here's the one for you.

948
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,980
You know what first-class used to be.

949
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,160
This is the greatest story I've
ever heard as far as the FirstClass.

950
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,460
This is what it used to be as compared
to my fucking wear out of eggs.

951
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:42,440
First Class experience. Pan-Am
Airlines. I'm dating myself here.

952
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,080
All right. Pan-Am when used to fly to, uh,

953
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:51,710
I think it was John F. Kennedy airport.
I read about this shit on the Internet,

954
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,260
right? So it's gotta be
true. Um, first of all,

955
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:57,440
the metlife building that's right above
grand central station used to be the

956
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:02,420
Pantheon building. So when you used
to fly first class to JFK airport,

957
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:05,170
you got off first class and you,

958
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,890
you didn't go to a fucking town car and
sit and goddamn traffic on the lie or

959
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:13,910
wherever the fuck you go to the midtown
tunnel and take an hour and a half,

960
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:15,620
which ruins the first class experience.

961
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:19,460
You got off the fucking
plane at JFK airport.

962
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:23,030
They put you on a
helicopter, swear to God.

963
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:26,900
They put you on a helicopter and they
flew you to the top of the Pan Am

964
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:29,150
building. You've got off drinks.

965
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:33,380
We're waiting probably more broads with
those scarves tied around their necks.

966
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:37,760
Like fucking Dick Cabin. You get
another blow job. Then you took the,

967
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:42,470
took fucking elevated down to
the first floor, jumped in a cab,

968
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:47,050
you went to your hotel pre herpes
pre-AIDS here's some kind of splits.

969
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,880
Have a good fucking time. All
right? That was first class.

970
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:53,840
Back then something happened
where the, the wind,

971
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,890
something happened with a wind tipped
over a helicopter and the blades went

972
01:00:57,891 --> 01:01:00,200
flying down to the street and
chop somebody in half. Okay,

973
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:03,740
but that's beside the point. I
really did happen by the way,

974
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,800
I forget who had shopped in half,
but he was a son of somebody.

975
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,770
Somebody obscurely famous, you know,

976
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:14,570
like the guy who invented like the
bookmarker or something. All right.

977
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:20,120
Jesus Christ. Some fucking winded after
that story. Um, which brings me to my,

978
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:23,720
uh, first bit of advice that
somebody gave me this week. Um,

979
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:28,430
bill taking naps can really help me out
when I get too negative and agitated.

980
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,760
But this can be hard for
you since you fly so much.

981
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,570
Running and lifting weights
also helps me out too. Well,

982
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:39,580
thank you for that
advice. Uh, I don't know.

983
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,120
I think the running and lifting weights
would help me out as you can tell with

984
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:48,800
my rage issues. But uh, taking naps,
I, I can't do it. Like, uh, I dunno.

985
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,890
My brain wakes me up. I don't
know how to shut it off.

986
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,160
So if anybody out there knows how
I can shut this fucking thing off.

987
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:02,600
All right. I'm really worked up here.
All right, here's a, here's some advice.

988
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,673
Somebody, this is how,

989
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,150
this is a question I get like every week
people will always give me this when

990
01:02:06,151 --> 01:02:10,850
they safety people say I'm funny,
how do I become a comedian? Um,

991
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,840
I must get asked this like 10
times a week. This is what you do.

992
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,990
Fight five minutes of Shit
that you think is funny.

993
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,130
Sign up for an open mic when
they call your name. Go up there.

994
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,120
Hang on for dear life. Spit out as
much of it as you can. Remember,

995
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,130
tape the set, go home, listen
to it. Keep the jokes at work.

996
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,271
Got,

997
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:36,750
get rid of the ones that didn't and then
write some more jokes to take place.

998
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:40,050
Take the place of the ones that didn't
work and then you sign up for another

999
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:43,530
open mic. You repeat the process
and you just keep doing that.

1000
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:46,650
And then eventually you build an act and
next thing you know you're a community

1001
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:51,270
flying first class to a dream TV
gig without any fucking eggs. Oh No,

1002
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:53,010
you get eggs, but we're going
to give you the guilt trip.

1003
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,280
You can have the pilot's egg. They'll
just sit up there and be hungry.

1004
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,440
What the fuck? All right.

1005
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,040
It's podcasts I'm sensing is
getting a little long here.

1006
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:04,860
Let me get onto the questions and I'll
get out of here and you guys can get on

1007
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:08,310
with your memorial days. Okay, Bill,

1008
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:11,630
question of a one you've always
seen dimension sports in your act.

1009
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,180
I was wondering if you were involved
in any fantasy sports leagues. No,

1010
01:03:15,181 --> 01:03:19,680
I am not fantasy sports
leagues and gates. I fucking,

1011
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:23,190
I can't stand them. They have
ruined sports. Talk in a bar.

1012
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,690
People are aren't like affiliated
with fucking teams anymore. You Bring,

1013
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,280
oh my God. You see the viking
swollen. They gave me CBCT. Really?

1014
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,000
Really? What else do you have on your
fantasy? Came. Huh? A girlfriend.

1015
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:41,550
Somebody who satisfies you sexually.
Uh, what else do you have a dream job?

1016
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:45,390
We not fucking walled in by a cubicle. No,

1017
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,140
I don't play fantasy sports
leagues. Actually know what,

1018
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:51,250
I don't really know much about them. I
find that sports takes up, they take,

1019
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:55,380
it picks up too much of my time
anyways, so I don't watch pregame.

1020
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:58,680
I'm not in fantasy sports
leagues. I don't watch post-games.

1021
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:04,010
I don't listen to any of those fucking
ranting raving lunatics that ESPN has

1022
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:09,150
now. Anybody on ESPN for some
reason listens to these things.

1023
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:12,270
Why is every show become two
people screaming at each other?

1024
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:18,290
And why do you guys hype things up to
such a ridiculous fucking level that it

1025
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:19,770
never, you know what I mean?

1026
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,760
Like I remember the Patriots
was six and now they're like,

1027
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:26,480
it's just the greatest team ever. Yeah,

1028
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:28,290
yeah. I guess they are. I mean,

1029
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,490
let's completely ignore the fact that the
cults were 13 and o two years earlier.

1030
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,770
Let's, let's declare them the Glitz,

1031
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:38,610
ask if they're the greatest team ever
when they're still fucking 20 games left

1032
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:43,350
in the season. You dumb cons.
All right. Um, number two, uh,

1033
01:04:43,351 --> 01:04:43,950
Bill,

1034
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:48,950
which end of your comedy crowds spectrum
do you prefer to put up with the

1035
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:51,960
douchebag Frat guys who drank so much?

1036
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,790
They decided to try and heckle you after
your show while you're signing cds.

1037
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,770
Oh yeah. I know who this is that
happened to me in Chicago. Okay. Um,

1038
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:06,030
or the older men who came to the show
with their wives that are afraid to laugh

1039
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:09,480
at your jokes cause they want
to get laid that night. Um,

1040
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:15,160
I definitely prefer that the older guys
who don't laugh cause he wanted to get

1041
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,760
laid by their wife that night.
Um, because if I pick up on it,

1042
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,690
it usually ends up being a, a much
funnier situation cause I can see,

1043
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,950
I can make the, the woman's somehow
feel guilty for doing what she's doing.

1044
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,250
I guess. I don't know, riff
on it. That's more fun.

1045
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:33,410
But as far as the guy
heckling you after the show,

1046
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:36,920
cause he didn't have the balls to do
it during the show was just sad and it

1047
01:05:36,921 --> 01:05:39,800
always makes me feel like that person
actually wanted to be a comedian.

1048
01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:43,430
They just never had the balls to do it.
And I'm watching the death of a dream.

1049
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,150
Um Wow. That was dark. Okay.

1050
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:52,210
Question number three is a he slash she
a bad comedian if they tried to talk to

1051
01:05:54,471 --> 01:05:57,620
the audience. I've noticed
in the last few years.

1052
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,760
The worst comics are the ones that
base their comedy comedy on. Hi,

1053
01:06:01,761 --> 01:06:05,270
where are you from so they
can goof on the audience.

1054
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:09,020
Oh wait a minute. Fucking seen
doubling so they can goof on.

1055
01:06:09,021 --> 01:06:12,920
The audience are the worst comics.
No, that wasn't me. That was him.

1056
01:06:12,921 --> 01:06:14,040
He wrote a bad sentence. Sick.

1057
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:18,110
Even the last time I saw you learn
southern California, the Improv,

1058
01:06:18,111 --> 01:06:21,710
the two people before you kept trying to
find ways to make fun of the people in

1059
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,260
the audience as a comic.

1060
01:06:24,261 --> 01:06:27,080
Do you think that this is a
sign that they are a bad comic?

1061
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,890
I would think it would turn everyone else
else off because they are too worried

1062
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:31,820
about being talked to.

1063
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:36,821
Next one time I was watching a taping of
Frazier in La and 90% of the people got

1064
01:06:37,611 --> 01:06:42,350
up because the comic in the stands
with us kept ripping on everyone.

1065
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,410
First of all, that's fucking hilarious.

1066
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:51,440
The guy doing the audience warm up was
in between takes of Frazier was just

1067
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:52,460
going, what do you guys,

1068
01:06:52,461 --> 01:06:56,990
a bunch of fucking Douche bags
and 90% of the crowd left.

1069
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,440
Um, I don't want to be
a contender, but, uh,

1070
01:07:00,441 --> 01:07:04,610
I dunno about 90% been
like, just like 30%.

1071
01:07:04,611 --> 01:07:08,510
I would think if 90% of the studio
audience walked out at some point,

1072
01:07:08,511 --> 01:07:12,050
somebody with a clipboard and a headset
woulda walked over to the comic and when

1073
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:15,410
would have been like, hey dude, why don't
you fucking tone it down a little bit?

1074
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:16,303
Okay.

1075
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:21,290
Kelsey Grammer's getting a little pissed
because 90% of the crowd has left.

1076
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:25,160
Can you stop calling?
Calling him con, you know,

1077
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,690
I know what you're saying though. Um,

1078
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,040
what do I think as far as
people working with the,

1079
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:33,020
on the audience? Yeah, I
definitely know what you mean.

1080
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,770
There's definitely guys who don't have
enough jokes. So then they go, hey,

1081
01:07:36,771 --> 01:07:39,230
where are you from? What do
you do? Little that job sucks.

1082
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,490
But then there's other guys I see fuck
with the crowd and they're brilliant at

1083
01:07:43,491 --> 01:07:45,710
it. Um, I would just basically say,

1084
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:51,040
if you don't have any material and
you suck at playing to the crowd,

1085
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,580
then yeah, you suck at it, then
you suck as a comic. Absolutely.

1086
01:07:55,581 --> 01:07:58,280
But if you're good at it
and that's your thing,

1087
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,790
I don't think there's anything
wrong with him. Jesus Christ.

1088
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,460
I answered that like
Hillary Clinton. Well,

1089
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:08,470
I think it could be a good thing
and a bad thing. Oh, whatever.

1090
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,050
Just fucking elect me. Um, all right.

1091
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,820
Has she given up yet? Jesus Christ.
She's like one of the fucking,

1092
01:08:16,821 --> 01:08:18,950
she just won't tap out. She's
like one of the Gracies.

1093
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:22,100
They got like a fucking arm bend all
back. I still think I'm doing good.

1094
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:26,290
I think I'm going to
win. I'll say something.

1095
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,010
That's the one thing I've
learned about this election.

1096
01:08:28,011 --> 01:08:32,930
I have learned that I completely
do not give a shit about race.

1097
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,680
I really don't. Black, white,
Puerto Rican. I don't give a fuck.

1098
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:40,940
If you make sense, I
will vote for you. Right.

1099
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,810
But my hatred of women,
whoo. It's fucking unreal.

1100
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:52,640
I don't hate women. It's just
that, that's fucking voice.

1101
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,350
Good Lord. And you know, they,
they got to bring it down.

1102
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,510
The problem is, is women,

1103
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:04,100
they raise their voice up cause they
tried to do what the guys do guys,

1104
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:06,830
when they raised their voice and
has a commanding sound to it.

1105
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:11,360
Women when they raise their voice up,
they sound like a fucking seagull.

1106
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:16,490
So what she needs to do is deliver
her speeches and a middle range,

1107
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:20,540
maybe even drop it down to a whisper
a little bit. And I swear to God,

1108
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:25,040
that's where the female voice has
power, medium voice to a whisper.

1109
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,760
It can make a Deckard. You
know, you'd pick sides. I Dunno,

1110
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:32,090
you're not thinking clearly you're gonna
fucking vote for, but when you, again,

1111
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:36,260
when you're fucking way up there, people
are not going to hear your message.

1112
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:42,470
I talk more shit on this fucking
thing. All right, the last question.

1113
01:09:42,471 --> 01:09:45,050
Here we go, then I'm going to get out
of here. Question number four. Bill,

1114
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:49,740
you spoke about us, uh, going home
with you. You know, hearing you,

1115
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,290
what all this is last week's podcast.

1116
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,020
When I parked my car in
the garage and all, yeah,

1117
01:09:54,021 --> 01:09:58,430
we heard you walk up the steps, close
the garage door, which made me think,

1118
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:03,170
uh, what's your take on stalkers?
Celebrity stockers, if you will?

1119
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:09,260
Uh, she like insulting me. They're
celebrity starkers if you will,

1120
01:10:09,261 --> 01:10:10,430
celebrity in quotes.

1121
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,430
God knows I love the eighties
doesn't count as being a celebrity,

1122
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:17,030
which it doesn't. You're right. Okay.
I'm celebrity stockers if you will.

1123
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:21,440
Have you ever had one? If you did, would
you be flattered or freak the fuck out?

1124
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,110
Uh, okay. Um, uh, no. Yeah.

1125
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,010
Obviously who the fuck wants to
be stopped? You know what I mean?

1126
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:31,790
I don't really, I mean,

1127
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:35,180
I wouldn't want to be stopped by
the hottest chick on the planet.

1128
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:39,650
That's how frightening stockers are.
Because no matter how good looking the a,

1129
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:44,520
they have that crazed, um,
I always think that, that,

1130
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:47,330
that fatal attraction, and
I'm not going to be ignored,

1131
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:51,470
Michael or whatever his fucking
character's name was a right,

1132
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:52,950
then you know what he should done when,

1133
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,430
whenever I see that movie
fatal attraction, she's like,

1134
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:58,700
I'm not going to be ignored. And she
sort of leans her head down a little bit.

1135
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:01,430
I always wanted him to just
hit her with like a fucking,

1136
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,790
just a right cross from a
fucked up angle. Like A,

1137
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:08,540
like Roy Jones member used to throw
the punches from those weird angles.

1138
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:12,290
Maybe do like that little rooster
hop and just fucking crack.

1139
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:17,460
You know, there, there's your
attention. Oh look at me.

1140
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:21,750
I'm like dice clay the end of
this fucking thing. Why am I here?

1141
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,530
It's just brutal. Why? Why am I lashing
out at women here in the end of this?

1142
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,740
This is, this is dumb. Okay. Uh,

1143
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,980
just cause I'm not going to vote for
Hillary Clinton doesn't mean I hate all

1144
01:11:31,981 --> 01:11:32,814
women.

1145
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,440
I just hate the sound of the
female voice in the high register.

1146
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:40,050
I think that that's what it is. Anyways,

1147
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:44,460
let me finish answering this question and
then I'll get the fuck outta here. Um,

1148
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,150
yeah, that is, that is my thing. Yet
stockers freaked me the fuck out. Um,

1149
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:53,170
I don't mind people who are really,
you know, who come out to the show.

1150
01:11:53,171 --> 01:11:55,710
I've had a couple of people come out to
show and made tee shirts and that kind

1151
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:59,400
of thing and they act a little zany.
That doesn't bug me. But you know,

1152
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,140
later on that night I don't, you know,

1153
01:12:01,141 --> 01:12:04,740
roll over in bed and all of a sudden
they're hovering outside my hotel window.

1154
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,240
Yeah, that would obviously
freak me out. Um, yeah,

1155
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:11,190
I don't think anybody finds
that flattering. Okay.

1156
01:12:11,191 --> 01:12:13,920
I'm taking a very serious tone now all
of a sudden and I'm starting to get

1157
01:12:13,921 --> 01:12:17,810
scared. Okay. You happy? That's what
your question did to me. Alright,

1158
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:22,680
I'm going to go put on my chin up
bar. Okay. That's what I'm doing.

1159
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:27,990
And I'm actually going to buy a piece
of rope down at the hardware store that

1160
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:31,860
I'm going to hang from the fucking thing
and I'm going to be able to fucking

1161
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:35,010
climb up that son of a bitch. And I
don't want you thinking we'll bill.

1162
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,180
It's the fucking, I mean what are you
gonna get? Like six feet of rope? No,

1163
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:41,610
this is what you do. You do get
that amount of rope. Put your fuck.

1164
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:43,380
You actually get more cause you
want to be able to tie it up,

1165
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:48,270
but you sit on the floor, okay? With
your legs, straight out l shape.

1166
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:50,190
And then you pull yourself
up just with the arms.

1167
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:52,050
And I'm telling you if
you can fucking do that.

1168
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,200
My goal is by November to fucking glue
10 nightstands and put them on top of

1169
01:12:58,201 --> 01:13:01,860
each other. And that's how I'm going
to end my shows. I need a hook people.

1170
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,880
Okay, I'm going to climb right up
the fucking thing right out the roof.

1171
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:11,420
Get on a helicopter by one of those old
pan-am ones and slide the fuck out of

1172
01:13:11,491 --> 01:13:13,410
the Gig. And that's how I'm going
to end it every fucking time.

1173
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:15,240
I'm gonna do a big dramatic way,

1174
01:13:15,241 --> 01:13:18,600
right as I go through the ceiling of a
funny bone. All right, and that's it.
