00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:05.639
So, it's $70
a day to rent a car.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:06.640
Totally doable.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.641
Do you wanna
insure the driver?

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.642
Yes.
Yes.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.643
Do you want to insure
against other cars?

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:10.644
Yes.
Yes.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.645
Potholes?

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.646
Yes.
Yes.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.881
Weather?
Yes
Yes.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:15.015
Trees?
Uh-huh.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.250
God?

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.551
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.754
Transition insurance for when I
pull the car around-- make sure

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.890
you get that last
one--I'm a terrible driver.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:24.224
Okay.
Sure.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:28.228
With all that,
it comes to $125.

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:29.763
Okay.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.532
License and credit
card, please.

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:36.336
Oh.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.005
You're under 25.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.406
That changes
things.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.586
That'll be $1,100.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.422
Oh... we're gonna need
one moment, please.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:56.790
Thank you so much.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.393
All right,
come 'ere, huddle up.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:03.664
Okay, so, we both know that I'm
25, but what Mary doesn't yet

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:06.066
know is that my
license is expired.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.302
We're gonna need to come up with
a plan in the next 20 seconds

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:11.138
inside this huddle, 'cause
when I created the huddle,

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.106
I thought by this
time I'd have a plan.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.107
I don't.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:16.443
I'm gonna keep--
Here's my license and the AMEX

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.979
should cover
insurance.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.647
This isn't a
sugar daddy thing.

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.750
This is just an old, established
"guy paying for his younger

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.919
friend he has sex
with" kind of thing,

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:28.555
so just get that right out
of your mind, you know?

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:29.556
(woman)
Well, you're
all set.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.091
There's only
one vehicle left.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.528
It doesn't have AC,
but it's really spacious.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.096
We'll take it.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.674
(brakes squeal)

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:57.918
Oh...okay.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.520
Gotta love that
transitions insurance.
