if the process of seeing differently is
 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.090
if the process of seeing differently is
the process of first and foremost having

the process of first and foremost having
awareness of the fact that everything

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510

to reveal your own assumptions to you is

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
to reveal your own assumptions to you is
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.880
to reveal your own assumptions to you is
not yourself it's usually someone else

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890
not yourself it's usually someone else
 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.620
not yourself it's usually someone else
hence the power of diversity the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
hence the power of diversity the
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.319
hence the power of diversity the
importance of diversity because not only

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:27.329
importance of diversity because not only
 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:28.999
importance of diversity because not only
does that diversity reveal your own

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009
does that diversity reveal your own
 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.790
does that diversity reveal your own
assumptions to you but it can also

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800
assumptions to you but it can also
 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.650
assumptions to you but it can also
complexify your assumptions right

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
complexify your assumptions right
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.960
complexify your assumptions right
because we know from complex systems

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970
because we know from complex systems
 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.380
because we know from complex systems
theory that the best solution is most

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.270
because of statistics so whereas a
simple search space is more adaptable

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
simple search space is more adaptable
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610
simple search space is more adaptable
it's more easily to adapt it's less

it's more easily to adapt it's less
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.760
it's more easily to adapt it's less
likely to contain the best solution so

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
likely to contain the best solution so
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.150
likely to contain the best solution so
what we really want is a diversity of

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160
what we really want is a diversity of
 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.520
what we really want is a diversity of
possibilities a diversity of assumptions

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530
possibilities a diversity of assumptions
 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.039

which diverse groups for instance enable
but also diverse experience so one of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
but also diverse experience so one of
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.539
but also diverse experience so one of
the best ways to diversify complexify

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
the best ways to diversify complexify
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.010
the best ways to diversify complexify
your search space your assumptions is

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020
your search space your assumptions is
 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.200
your search space your assumptions is
through experience and one of the great

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
through experience and one of the great
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.700
through experience and one of the great
ways to do that is actually through

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
ways to do that is actually through
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.669
ways to do that is actually through
technology so we think about technology

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679
technology so we think about technology
 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.429
technology so we think about technology
when most of our technologies are good

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
when most of our technologies are good
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.219
when most of our technologies are good
technologies but what defines a great

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
technologies but what defines a great
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.749
technologies but what defines a great
technology what is the transformative

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
technology what is the transformative
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.999
technology what is the transformative
technology the good technologies are the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
technology the good technologies are the
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.859
technology the good technologies are the
ones that enable us to do what we can

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
ones that enable us to do what we can
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.379
ones that enable us to do what we can
already do faster easier more efficient

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:36.389
already do faster easier more efficient
 

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:37.609
already do faster easier more efficient
and that's because so much of our

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
and that's because so much of our
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.069
and that's because so much of our
society focuses on efficiency it's about

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
society focuses on efficiency it's about
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.489
society focuses on efficiency it's about
maximizing performance right we're great

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499
maximizing performance right we're great
 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.349
maximizing performance right we're great
engineers but we're crap philosophers

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359
engineers but we're crap philosophers
 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.809
engineers but we're crap philosophers
right we're very good at making things

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819
right we're very good at making things
 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.109
right we're very good at making things
more efficient but that's only one side

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
more efficient but that's only one side
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.090
more efficient but that's only one side
of innovation we also need the other

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
of innovation we also need the other
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.590
of innovation we also need the other
side of innovation which is creativity

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
side of innovation which is creativity
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.029
side of innovation which is creativity
and so the best technologies are the

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039
and so the best technologies are the
 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.769
and so the best technologies are the
ones in my view that make the invisible

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:00.779
ones in my view that make the invisible
 

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:04.010
ones in my view that make the invisible
visible they enable us to see things

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
visible they enable us to see things
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.129
visible they enable us to see things
that we can never have seen before they

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:07.139
that we can never have seen before they
 

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:10.490
that we can never have seen before they
create assumptions they expand our space

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
create assumptions they expand our space
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.770
create assumptions they expand our space
of assumptions we typically think of

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
of assumptions we typically think of
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.610
of assumptions we typically think of

visual technologies but we can also

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510
visual technologies but we can also
 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.170
visual technologies but we can also
think of the telescope the microscope in

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180
think of the telescope the microscope in
 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.390
think of the telescope the microscope in
fact we can even think of the sale

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400
fact we can even think of the sale
 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.710
fact we can even think of the sale
so the sale was in one sense invented on

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720
so the sale was in one sense invented on
 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.390
so the sale was in one sense invented on
the Nile it's because the currents and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400
the Nile it's because the currents and
 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.430
the Nile it's because the currents and
the wind going off the directions so you

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440
the wind going off the directions so you
 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.290
the wind going off the directions so you
could sail up current and then you could

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300
could sail up current and then you could
 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.540
could sail up current and then you could
float back down but what the sail

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550
float back down but what the sail
 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.000
float back down but what the sail
enables to do was to travel which meant

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010
enables to do was to travel which meant
 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.520
enables to do was to travel which meant
we could see different Ecology's

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530
we could see different Ecology's
 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.520
we could see different Ecology's
different cultures which when approached

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530
different cultures which when approached
 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.760
different cultures which when approached
in an open way enabled us to not only

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770
in an open way enabled us to not only
 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.650
in an open way enabled us to not only
challenge but expand our assumptions

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660
challenge but expand our assumptions
 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.090
challenge but expand our assumptions
because we would have incorporated their

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100
because we would have incorporated their
 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.140
because we would have incorporated their
biases into our own so you could view it

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150
biases into our own so you could view it
 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.310
biases into our own so you could view it
in a different way the best

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320
in a different way the best
 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.290
in a different way the best
transformative technologies enable us to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300
transformative technologies enable us to
 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.229
transformative technologies enable us to
travel right but not just travel

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239
travel right but not just travel
 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.380
travel right but not just travel
physically travel in our minds so a book

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390
physically travel in our minds so a book
 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.479
physically travel in our minds so a book
writing this also leads on to things

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489
writing this also leads on to things
 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.030
writing this also leads on to things
like augmented reality and even virtual

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040
like augmented reality and even virtual
 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.160
like augmented reality and even virtual
reality so in our case we've actually

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170
reality so in our case we've actually
 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.690
reality so in our case we've actually
done experiments and created a whole

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700
done experiments and created a whole
 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.780
done experiments and created a whole
platform in augmented reality to see if

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790
platform in augmented reality to see if
 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.090
platform in augmented reality to see if
we can explore how the brain makes

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100
we can explore how the brain makes
 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.340
we can explore how the brain makes
meaning by engaging with a new layer in

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350
meaning by engaging with a new layer in
 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.250
meaning by engaging with a new layer in
the world not to replace the real world

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260
the world not to replace the real world
 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.280
the world not to replace the real world
but to expand it another example is the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290
but to expand it another example is the
 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.350
but to expand it another example is the
free space belt so what this was was a

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360
free space belt so what this was was a
 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.990
free space belt so what this was was a
belt that was in fact a belt right went

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000
belt that was in fact a belt right went
 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.789
belt that was in fact a belt right went
around your waist and affected what it

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799
around your waist and affected what it
 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.440
around your waist and affected what it
did is it vibrated in the direction of

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450
did is it vibrated in the direction of
 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.350
did is it vibrated in the direction of
North which effectively gave people the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360
North which effectively gave people the
 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.850
North which effectively gave people the
ability to see what they couldn't see

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860
ability to see what they couldn't see
 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.770
ability to see what they couldn't see
before they made the invisible visible

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780
before they made the invisible visible
 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.340
before they made the invisible visible
and what happened is that people would

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350
and what happened is that people would
 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.190
and what happened is that people would
consciously use make reference well

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200
consciously use make reference well
 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.349
consciously use make reference well
initially they just felt a vibration and

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359
initially they just felt a vibration and
 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.270
initially they just felt a vibration and
then they started incorporating it into

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280
then they started incorporating it into
 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.530
then they started incorporating it into
their movement into the navigation

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540
their movement into the navigation
 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.930
their movement into the navigation
consciously but he eventually became

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940
consciously but he eventually became
 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.390
consciously but he eventually became
unconscious to the point that when they

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400
unconscious to the point that when they
 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.979
unconscious to the point that when they
actually removed the belt they felt
