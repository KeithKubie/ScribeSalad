00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:04.670
 - [Michelle] What do
 you think Lou wants to

00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:05.471 size:88% position:44%
   talk to us about?

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:06.539
I cannot be in trouble.

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:07.440
 I can't be in trouble!

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:08.374
   - What would you
   be in trouble for?

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:10.610 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I don't know. The
other day I ate a donut.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.712 align:start position:0%
  - Why would you be in
  trouble for eating a donut?

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:13.780
  Was it Lou's donut?

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.448
   - No, maybe, I don't know.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.316 align:start position:0%
   The point is, I shouldn't
   have eaten the donut.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.352
  - Say you're in here
  for eating a donut.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.453
  Why would I be in here too?

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.455 align:start position:0%
   - Well, he's going to
   fire me for eating a donut

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:24.691
 and you're getting fired too.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.527
  - But why would I be
  getting fired too?

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.561
 I didn't eat a donut.

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:29.729
 I ate a bagel.

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:31.764
 You know what?

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.399
   Donuts and bagels
   are bread cousins.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:34.467 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - No, you're getting
  fired because

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.601
you're not good at selling cars.

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:38.137
  - I'm great at selling cars.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.272
I'm good at four things,

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.641
  smoking weed, playing bass,

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:45.178 align:start position:0%
 rationing enough barbecue
 sauce for each chicken nugget,

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.345 size:88% position:44%
   and selling cars.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:47.747
- Well I'm good at five things,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.316
counting calories, sumo squats,

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:52.151
   stopping the fast
   forward on the DVR

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.120 align:start size:88% position:13%
  right as the show's
  starting again,

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.656
 naming cats, and selling cars.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.257
- How is naming cats a strength?

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.092
- Easy.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.460
Secrets, Temple of Doom,

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.328
Bond James Bond, Basket,

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:03.429
 Secretary Madeleine Albright.

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:05.798 align:start position:0%
- Those are grea... -
[Michelle] Oh wait, Colin Meow.

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.100
  - Okay, that's good.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:07.567
  - He's a black cat.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.701
- Yeah.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.069 align:start size:88% position:13%
   - With white paws.
   - [Dan] Okay.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:11.437 size:88% position:44%
   - [Dan] those are
   great cat names

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.105 align:start position:0%
  but that doesn't mean you're
  better at selling cars

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.272
   than I am.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:15.274
  - I sell cars like
  you take bong hits.

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:18.111 align:start position:0%
  - You sell nine cars behind
  the trailer every day?

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.679
  - Okay, you take
  too many bong hits.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.614
  - There's only one
  way to settle this.

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:23.683
  - Oh, whoever sells
  car first is king.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.252
- Wouldn't you want to be queen?

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
   - No, because a queen
   still implies that there's

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:28.321
   like a man in power of you

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.355
  and I don't want (mumbles).

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:31.257 size:88% position:44%
   I'm king.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.824
  - You know you're
  going to die alone?

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:33.192 size:88% position:44%
   - Yeah, probably.

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:34.394
   Whoever sells a
   car first is king.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.030 align:start size:88% position:13%
   - Deal.
   - [Michelle] Deal.

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:41.301
 - That'll have to do.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.705
  No.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:46.639
- Okay.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.745
   (heavy instrumental beats)

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:55.447
  - That's a good deal, right?

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.617 size:88% position:44%
   You know, you get
   what I'm saying!

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.555
  This is a good car,
  you got a good deal.

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:03.623 size:88% position:44%
   You hear what I'm saying.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.125
 Okay, okay. Alright, you know.

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.361
 Well we, okay.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:09.562
Sorry for touching you.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:12.265
  - Power makes up for a lot.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.666
- How many kids you got?

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.634
- Three.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.236
 We actually just lost
 their father overseas.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.337
 - Oh, perfect.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.539
  - Excuse me?

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.307
  - Bald eagle's maybe
  your spirit animal.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.509
It's illegal to kill that bird.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.544
- Did you serve?

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.078
 - No, I was a busboy.

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:27.647
Oh, war.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.682 align:start size:88% position:13%
   - You're gonna
   walk away from me?

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.285
You trying to get me
to have a crush on you?

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.286
   Because it worked.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.687
   - You are a piece of shit.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.222
- Yeah.

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:38.824
 - Great, so with your credit,

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:40.526 align:start size:88% position:13%
 the car will basically
 be taken care of

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.662
  with these three
  payments we set up.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.231
  - How in the hell
  did you sell a car?

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:46.599
  It's only been half the day.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.068
- Great.

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:50.536
 So why don't you take
 this in the office,

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.837
 and Lou will get you
 set up with the title

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.139
   and the correct paperwork,

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:54.840 size:88% position:44%
   and you'll be good to go.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.109
   Thank you.

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.612
 Ha. I am king!

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:00.613
 In your face, peasant.

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.281
 In your face!

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:04.150
   - Wow, you're a mean king.

00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:07.086
Something didn't add up.

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.455
  That woman walked right onto
  the lot directly up to you,

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:11.257 align:start size:88% position:13%
  and you immediately
  sell her a car?

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.692
   - I'm very good at my job.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.460
  - What's up?

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:15.728
  - Fine, it's Judith.

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:17.430 align:start size:88% position:13%
 She's from my fitness
 fan fiction group.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:18.331 align:start size:88% position:13%
  She said she wanted
  to buy a car.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.465
  I said if she came in today,

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:21.033 align:start size:88% position:13%
   I'd work in my
   employee discount.

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.202
  - What the hell is
  fitness fan fiction?

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:24.537 size:88% position:44%
   - Oh, it's great.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.205 align:start position:0%
   It's classic love stories,
   but then we add in

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:29.141
 descriptions of workouts that
 the main characters are doing.

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:32.111 align:start position:0%
   Like for example, take
   the story of The Notebook,

00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:34.547 align:start position:0%
  amazing on its own, but then
  we add in the characters

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.183 align:start size:88% position:13%
  doing high-rep,
  low-weight workouts.

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.084
  It's great.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.285 size:88% position:44%
   I mean, The Porch Railing

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:42.388
essentially becomes-
- [Dan] Got it. Got it.

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.190 align:start position:0%
  - [Dan] What a terrible
  thing to do to storytelling,

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
   and I shouldn't count
   that as a legitimate sale,

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:51.430
 but I'm going to, because I
 feel terrible about your life.

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:53.032
- Aw, thank you.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.503
 And I'm really sorry I said
 you were bad at selling cars.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:58.571 size:88% position:44%
   - Thanks.

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:00.339
- And that I told the mechanics

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:02.541 align:start size:88% position:13%
  you have trouble
  getting an erection.

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:03.709
- What?

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:05.244
   - Let's go tell
   Lou the good news!

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:06.612 size:88% position:44%
   - Getting or maintaining?

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:08.447
- Both!

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.515
(grunts)

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:13.052 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You guys know why I
have you in here, right?

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:14.487
 - Listen, Lou.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.522
 I know we haven't been
 the most productive,

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:18.557 align:start position:0%
   but Michelle and I are
   really trying to motivate

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.393
  ourselves to sell more cars.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:21.494
   I promise.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:23.129
 (man chuckles)

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.698 align:start position:0%
 - That's great, Dan, but
 that's not why you're in here.

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:27.400
 See, a true test of character

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.168 align:start size:88% position:13%
  is how much someone
  can trust you,

00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:30.803 align:start size:88% position:13%
  and that's not an
  easy thing to build.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:31.704
Take Carl here.

00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:32.638 size:88% position:44%
   When he wandered in here,

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:35.074
he had the posture of a wet rat,

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:36.542
 and kind of smelled like one,

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:38.511 align:start position:0%
and I gotta be honest with you,
for the first couple months

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.146
  I thought about killing him,

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:43.115
   but, over time, he
   earned my trust.

00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:44.083
  He's loyal.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.352
He's like a police dog.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.554 align:start position:0%
 You know those dogs that they
 train to bite minorities?

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:50.523
  That's my boy, Carl.

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:51.691
  - I've always said
  that Carl does have

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.259
the brain capacity of an animal.

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:55.127
- That ain't the point, stoner!

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.697 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Which one of you
 assholes ate a donut?

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.399
I buy a two day supply
right down to the donut

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:01.534
 for calorie counting.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.069
Now who took my donuts?

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:05.538
- That's not technically
how you count calories.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:06.605
   It's done a little
   bit differently.

00:05:06.638 --> 00:05:08.207
   (mocking in a whiny pitch)

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.576 align:start position:0%
   - The point is, Michelle,
   that was my property,

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:11.644
   and it was stolen from me,

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.045
and if it happens again,

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:15.648 align:start size:88% position:13%
suspension from the
lot and paperwork duty.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:17.583
  Do we understand each other?

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:18.484
 - [Both] Yes.

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:19.452
- Good.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.187
Get your skinny white
fucking lazy millenial,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.589 align:start size:88% position:13%
fucking gluten-free
asses out of my office!

00:05:23.622 --> 00:05:25.591
  Okay? Good, get out.

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:30.563 size:88% position:44%
   - Notice how he
   didn't say bagel?

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:34.367 size:88% position:44%
   He said donut, so
   that was all you.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.802
 Hope it was worth it.

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:39.205 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Actually I felt
really guilty about it.

00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:44.644 align:start size:88% position:13%
  I feel guilty
  about this one too.

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.012
  (beat instrumental)
