Now that we've given you an overview and

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.320
established a strategic mindset,
we'll go through each LinkedIn section.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.710
Let's begin with the professional
profile picture.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.430
The picture though technically optional,
is highly recommended.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.460
It's your first chance to communicate
that you are friendly, likeable and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.770
trustworthy.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.010
It also helps ensure that you
are human and not a robot.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.380
A strong profile image
should look like you.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.020
It should be a recent photo that
reflects how you would look if you

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.670
showed up for an interview.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.680
That means keep the glasses, hair, and
make up consistent to your normal look.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.070
Secondly, you should keep
the focus in your face.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.630
Make sure that your image has your
face taking up about 60% of the frame.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.280
If you don't have a perfectly framed
picture, you can always crop it.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.090
Your photos should also show that you
are friendly and approachable, and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.880
be sure to select a photo that fits
with the industry's work culture.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.040
This means if your target job is formal,
wear business attire, or if you work at

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.660
the more casual environment,
work clothing that fits this vibe.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.310
Finally, keep the background simple.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.315
The focus should be on you, so
opt for muted or solid colours.
