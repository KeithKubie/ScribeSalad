00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:02.322
- [Voiceover] So we're told let f of x

00:00:02.322 --> 00:00:06.787
equal two x squared minus 18 over g of x

00:00:06.787 --> 00:00:08.851
where g of x is a polynomial.

00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:10.395
And then they tell us,
which of the following is

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:14.249
a possible graph of y is equal to f of x?

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.954
And they gave us four choices here.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:19.613
And like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:19.613 --> 00:00:20.890
and see if you could give a go at it.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.213
Look at our f of x

00:00:22.213 --> 00:00:24.368
and think about which of these graphs

00:00:24.368 --> 00:00:27.085
actually match up or could match up

00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:29.081
to that f of x?

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:31.287
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:32.959
And they don't give us
a lot of information.

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:35.002
They don't tell us anything
about the denominator

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.289
of this rational expression.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:38.868
They do tell us it's numerator.

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:41.445
And like we've seen before,
it's useful to factor

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:42.664
the numerator and see,

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:44.928
and what x values do
interesting things happen.

00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:46.541
And particular, at what x values

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:48.898
does the numerator equal zero?

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:51.243
So if we factor the numerator up here,

00:00:51.243 --> 00:00:53.367
we could rewrite f of x

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:56.444
as being equal to, let's see
we could factor out a two

00:00:56.444 --> 00:00:57.825
out of the numerator.

00:00:57.825 --> 00:01:01.540
So it's two times x squared minus nine.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.524
And that's all going to be over g of x.

00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:05.963
We don't know what the denominator is.

00:01:05.963 --> 00:01:08.285
We just know that it's a polynomial.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:09.334
Now see, here are the numerator

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:11.133
x squared minus nine.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.189
You might recognize that.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.803
It's a difference of squares

00:01:13.803 --> 00:01:15.486
so we can factor that further.

00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:17.257
So we still have that original two

00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:19.915
and it's going to be x plus three

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:22.423
times x minus three.

00:01:22.423 --> 00:01:23.920
We've seen that multiple times.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.778
If that looks unfamiliar to you,

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:27.124
I encourage you to watch the video

00:01:27.124 --> 00:01:30.004
on differences of squares
or factoring polynomials.

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:31.536
X squared minus nine is the same thing

00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:33.417
as x squared minus three squared.

00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:36.165
So it's x plus three times x minus three.

00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:40.835
And then all of that is still
going to be over g of x.

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:42.318
So the first thing that we might realize,

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.756
okay, when is our numerator equal zero?

00:01:44.756 --> 00:01:47.833
Well, when x is equal to negative three

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:49.632
or when x is equal to positive three.

00:01:49.632 --> 00:01:51.191
If x is equal to negative three,

00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:53.625
this expression is going to be zero.

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:55.420
If x is equal to positive three,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.382
this expression is equal to zero.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.785
So you might just say,
"Oh, maybe we have zeros

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:01.619
"at plus or minus three."

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.938
So maybe at x is maybe,

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:08.759
maybe f of negative three

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.001
is equal to zero

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.251
and f of positive three

00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:14.250
is equal to zero.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.743
Those values sure look they made

00:02:15.743 --> 00:02:17.380
the numerator equal to zero.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.760
And then we look at our choices.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.444
And when we look at our choices,

00:02:21.444 --> 00:02:25.278
this choice A does seem to have a zero

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:26.845
at positive three

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:28.865
but it doesn't have one at negative three.

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:31.164
It has a vertical asymptote
at negative three.

00:02:31.164 --> 00:02:34.289
So that seems a little bit confusing.

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:36.622
This choice B does have a zero

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:38.724
at positive three

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:41.289
but it has nothing going on here at,

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.541
or nothing interesting
on at negative three.

00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:44.842
It defines negative three.

00:02:44.842 --> 00:02:46.629
It doesn't even have a
vertical asymptote there.

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.821
So once again, this looks
a little bit perplexing.

00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:54.821
Choice C has a removable discontinuity

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:56.625
at positive three

00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:59.451
and then it has a vertical asymptote

00:02:59.451 --> 00:03:01.490
at negative two.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.070
So once again, this doesn't have anything

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.996
interesting going on at x
is equal to negative three.

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:07.795
So still a little perplexing.

00:03:07.795 --> 00:03:08.933
And this one has a zero

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:11.115
at positive six and negative six.

00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:13.507
So none of the choices had zeros

00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:16.513
at both x equals positive three

00:03:16.513 --> 00:03:17.906
and x equals negative three.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.427
So, what's going on?

00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:20.669
Well, what we need to realize is

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.608
just because something makes the numerator

00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:24.373
equal to zero doesn't mean

00:03:24.373 --> 00:03:27.507
that it's definitely going to
be a zero for that function.

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.132
And you might say,
"Well, how can that be?"

00:03:29.132 --> 00:03:31.152
Well, think about situations
in which those values

00:03:31.152 --> 00:03:33.753
would also make the
denominator equal to zero.

00:03:33.753 --> 00:03:36.771
So let me write out some
potential f of x is here.

00:03:36.771 --> 00:03:39.035
So we just know that g
of x is a polynomial.

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:41.426
So f of x could be, we know the numerator,

00:03:41.426 --> 00:03:43.307
two times x plus three

00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:47.261
times x minus three, over.

00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:48.837
Well, let's just say g of x is,

00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:50.079
I'm just gonna make up something,

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.656
g of x is equal to x plus one.

00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:54.514
Well, in this situation,
none of the values

00:03:54.514 --> 00:03:56.476
that make the numerator equal zero

00:03:56.476 --> 00:03:58.054
make the denominator equal zero.

00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:00.852
So this is a situation where
you would have two zeros

00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:02.535
at x equals positive three

00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:03.812
and x equals negative three.

00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:07.318
So this would be the two zeros.

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:10.975
Two zeros.

00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:13.738
And so let's look at
another similar situation.

00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:16.080
Let's look at a situation where f of x

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.518
is equal to, you know, the numerator,

00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:20.464
x plus three

00:04:20.464 --> 00:04:22.514
times x minus three.

00:04:22.514 --> 00:04:25.022
And let's say that we do have,

00:04:25.022 --> 00:04:26.821
let's say that one of those x values,

00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:28.040
positive or negative three,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.116
do make the denominator equal to zero.

00:04:31.116 --> 00:04:34.112
So let's say, x plus three

00:04:34.112 --> 00:04:36.898
and then, say times x plus one.

00:04:36.898 --> 00:04:40.380
Well, you see here, now since x plus three

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.714
is both the numerator and the denominator,

00:04:42.714 --> 00:04:43.956
you could divide x plus three

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:45.361
divided by x plus three.

00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:46.580
They cancel out.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.576
And here x equals negative three

00:04:48.576 --> 00:04:50.770
would be a removable discontinuity.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.449
So this would have zero

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.713
at x equals three

00:04:57.713 --> 00:05:02.496
and a removable discontinuity

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:06.152
at x equals negative three.

00:05:06.152 --> 00:05:09.465
And so those values that make
the numerator equal to zero

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:11.207
we now see it could be a zero

00:05:11.207 --> 00:05:14.492
or it could represent a
removable discontinuity.

00:05:14.492 --> 00:05:16.547
And here I just pick a
removable discontinuity

00:05:16.547 --> 00:05:17.476
be at negative three

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:19.089
or it could be the other way around

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:20.424
or it could be at both values.

00:05:20.424 --> 00:05:22.478
If this was x plus three
times x minus three

00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:24.951
over x plus three times x minus three,

00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:26.600
then you would have a
removable discontinuity

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.711
at both x is positive
three and negative three.

00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:31.092
And then you could go even further.

00:05:31.092 --> 00:05:33.159
F of x could look like this.

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.409
It could be two times x plus three

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.099
times x minus three over

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.060
x plus three squared

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.474
and I'll just make up some
other, another expression here,

00:05:46.474 --> 00:05:47.451
x plus one.

00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:48.751
So, what's going to happen here?

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:50.318
Even if you divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:05:50.318 --> 00:05:51.978
by x plus three, you're
still going to have

00:05:51.978 --> 00:05:54.254
one x plus three left
over the denominator.

00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:56.877
That could cancel with
one of the x plus threes

00:05:56.877 --> 00:05:58.793
but you're still going
to have an x plus three.

00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:02.148
And so in this case, you would
have a vertical asymptote.

00:06:02.148 --> 00:06:06.234
So in this case, you would have a zero

00:06:06.234 --> 00:06:07.871
at x is equal to three.

00:06:07.871 --> 00:06:11.861
And you would have a vertical asymptote.

00:06:11.861 --> 00:06:14.138
I'll just shorten it shorthand.

00:06:14.138 --> 00:06:15.573
You would have a vertical,
I'll just write that out,

00:06:15.573 --> 00:06:17.917
vertical asymptote

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:20.006
at x is equal to negative three.

00:06:20.006 --> 00:06:22.255
So these particular examples
that I just showed you

00:06:22.255 --> 00:06:24.055
showed you that any value that makes

00:06:24.055 --> 00:06:25.274
the numerator equals zero

00:06:25.274 --> 00:06:27.653
aren't necessarily zeros for the function.

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:29.058
They could be zeros.

00:06:29.058 --> 00:06:31.380
They could be removable discontinuities

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.377
or they could be vertical asymptotes.

00:06:33.377 --> 00:06:34.282
But they would all occur

00:06:34.282 --> 00:06:36.523
at x is equal to positive
or negative three.

00:06:36.523 --> 00:06:39.576
So if that lands, now let's
look at the choices again.

00:06:39.576 --> 00:06:43.418
So choice A has a zero at
x equals positive three

00:06:43.418 --> 00:06:47.122
and it has a vertical asymptote
at x equals negative three.

00:06:47.122 --> 00:06:51.020
So that's actually very
consistent with this

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.915
situation that I just described.

00:06:52.915 --> 00:06:56.494
So choice A actually
is looking pretty good.

00:06:56.494 --> 00:07:00.217
Choice B has a zero at x equals three

00:07:00.217 --> 00:07:03.084
but its vertical asymptote
looks like it's an x equals two

00:07:03.084 --> 00:07:04.426
and nothing interesting is happening

00:07:04.426 --> 00:07:06.191
at x equals negative three.

00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:08.791
So we could rule that out.

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:10.536
If I look at choice C,

00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:12.463
you have a removable discontinuity

00:07:12.463 --> 00:07:14.158
at x equals positive three

00:07:14.158 --> 00:07:16.225
which is completely possible.

00:07:16.225 --> 00:07:17.803
We've seen that situation where something

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:19.580
that makes the numerator equals zero

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.321
could be a removable discontinuity

00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:24.618
if you have that same
expression in the denominator.

00:07:24.618 --> 00:07:26.081
But then the vertical asymptote

00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:27.718
isn't that x equals negative three.

00:07:27.718 --> 00:07:29.343
It's an x equals negative two.

00:07:29.343 --> 00:07:30.318
So that rules it out.

00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:31.781
Once again, nothing interesting happening

00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:33.522
at x equals negative three.

00:07:33.522 --> 00:07:34.799
And here you have two zeros

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:36.715
but they're not at x equals
positive or negative three.

00:07:36.715 --> 00:07:38.340
They're x equals positive or negative six.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.239
We can definitely rule that one out.

00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:42.758
So we should feel pretty good about,
