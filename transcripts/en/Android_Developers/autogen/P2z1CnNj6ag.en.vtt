approach yeah so I think it's so what

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919
approach yeah so I think it's so what
 

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:49.860

sell subscriptions that's that's true
 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.839
sell subscriptions that's that's true
that's very simple but the way to sell

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:54.849
that's very simple but the way to sell
 

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.309
that's very simple but the way to sell
the subscription is probably much more

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319
the subscription is probably much more
 

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.870
the subscription is probably much more
complex than just looking at a

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:57.880
complex than just looking at a
 

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.420
complex than just looking at a
conversion rate as a KPI so we don't

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:00.430
conversion rate as a KPI so we don't
 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.029
conversion rate as a KPI so we don't
think what conversion is just one KPI we

00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039
think what conversion is just one KPI we
 

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:04.620
think what conversion is just one KPI we
think of about conversion as a user

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:04.630
think of about conversion as a user
 

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.409
think of about conversion as a user
journey which starts often in the App

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:07.419
journey which starts often in the App
 

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:09.600
journey which starts often in the App
Store and ends at the point where the

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:09.610

something I want to have like use on a
 

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:19.260
something I want to have like use on a
daily weekly basis so when we look in at

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:19.270
daily weekly basis so when we look in at
 

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.760
daily weekly basis so when we look in at
conversion or like the outcome of

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:20.770
conversion or like the outcome of
 

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.200
conversion or like the outcome of
conversion we think of this journey

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:22.210
conversion we think of this journey
 

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.120
conversion we think of this journey
there are a lot of small micro

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.130
there are a lot of small micro
 

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.010
there are a lot of small micro
conversions along the way and you can

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.020
conversions along the way and you can
 

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.379
conversions along the way and you can
optimize a lot of them with the goal of

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:28.389
optimize a lot of them with the goal of
 

00:08:28.389 --> 00:08:30.300
optimize a lot of them with the goal of
creating the outcome that is selling a

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.310
creating the outcome that is selling a

creating the outcome that is selling a
subscription so the way we approach this

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039
subscription so the way we approach this
 

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.430
subscription so the way we approach this
there are plenty of what we call proxy

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440
there are plenty of what we call proxy
 

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.149
there are plenty of what we call proxy
KPIs

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159
KPIs
 

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.730
KPIs
so we think that KPIs that happen very

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:38.740
so we think that KPIs that happen very
 

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.649
so we think that KPIs that happen very
early in the funnel for example or we

00:08:40.649 --> 00:08:40.659
early in the funnel for example or we
 

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.719
early in the funnel for example or we
say if this happens users much more

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:42.729
say if this happens users much more
 

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:44.819
say if this happens users much more
likely to convert afterwards the

00:08:44.819 --> 00:08:44.829
likely to convert afterwards the
 

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:46.110
likely to convert afterwards the
conversion is the outcome that we

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.120
conversion is the outcome that we
 

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.780
conversion is the outcome that we
measure the success based on but we will

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:48.790
measure the success based on but we will
 

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.300
measure the success based on but we will
we would not rather optimize for micro

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:51.310
we would not rather optimize for micro
 

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.800
we would not rather optimize for micro
conversions along the way which then

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:52.810
conversions along the way which then
 

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.350
conversions along the way which then
lead to subscription so for example one

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360
lead to subscription so for example one
 

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.510
lead to subscription so for example one
thing we try blinkers is that instead of

thing we try blinkers is that instead of
 

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.630
thing we try blinkers is that instead of
just looking at screens of lows that

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640
just looking at screens of lows that

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920
would directly to conversion we try to
 

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.950
would directly to conversion we try to

user experience to the upsell flow and
 

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.420

purchase decision and then optimize this
 

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.970
purchase decision and then optimize this
step by step and these optimizations in

step by step and these optimizations in
 

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.070
step by step and these optimizations in
the end lead up to a higher conversion

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:23.080
the end lead up to a higher conversion
 

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.800
the end lead up to a higher conversion
rate may be very interesting to

marketing teams and we actually tried to

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560
marketing teams and we actually tried to
 

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.290
marketing teams and we actually tried to
bring together the marketing team the

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:40.300
bring together the marketing team the
 

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.180

together and then prioritize experiments

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:46.270
together and then prioritize experiments
 

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.910
together and then prioritize experiments
together that would then lead to a

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920
together that would then lead to a
 

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.320
together that would then lead to a
higher conversion rate and also the

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:49.330
higher conversion rate and also the
 

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.780
higher conversion rate and also the
formal structure is then accordingly so

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:51.790
formal structure is then accordingly so
 

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.670

the numbers are slightly bigger but the

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:44.770
the numbers are slightly bigger but the

our architecture so the Micra we have a
micro service architecture so we have a

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:53.890
micro service architecture so we have a
 

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.650

should split the team and we were at

00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:13.369
should split the team and we were at

should split the team and we were at
this point where I said okay either we

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:14.689
this point where I said okay either we
 

00:14:14.689 --> 00:14:16.539
this point where I said okay either we
come like like we have to split the team

00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:16.549
come like like we have to split the team
 

00:14:16.549 --> 00:14:17.679
come like like we have to split the team
in a way and then we thought okay what's

00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:17.689
in a way and then we thought okay what's
 

00:14:17.689 --> 00:14:19.629
in a way and then we thought okay what's
the best way to split the team we said

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639
the best way to split the team we said
 

00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:21.460
the best way to split the team we said
okay let's organize the team around our

activation and retention so that was the
 

00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:28.389
activation and retention so that was the
main idea that like every team has a

00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399

reason is why it's very interesting
 

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.380
reason is why it's very interesting
because it changes it shows a change and

like changing one variable at a time and
 

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.190
like changing one variable at a time and
see what the outcome is but realized as

bigger experiments let's have just like

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:51.050
bigger experiments let's have just like
 

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.270
bigger experiments let's have just like
something that can really move the

something that can really move the
 

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.340
something that can really move the
needle and try more of those and we

variables in this experiment or we care
about is that the outcome for example

onboarding flow and as you can see there
a lot of things that changed the first

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200
a lot of things that changed the first
 

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.170
a lot of things that changed the first
thing is that the layout change the

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:09.180
thing is that the layout change the
 

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.030
thing is that the layout change the
pop-up changed the subscriptions between

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:11.040
pop-up changed the subscriptions between
 

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.300
pop-up changed the subscriptions between
how we from seller subscription so we we

how we from seller subscription so we we
 

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.730
how we from seller subscription so we we
promote them change but most importantly

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740
promote them change but most importantly
 

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.470
promote them change but most importantly
what changed was that we change from

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480
what changed was that we change from
 

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.650
what changed was that we change from

I'm not sure if I have to write words

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:28.770
I'm not sure if I have to write words
 

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.770
I'm not sure if I have to write words
for that but what Google Play offers you

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:30.780
for that but what Google Play offers you
 

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.110
for that but what Google Play offers you
is that a user can start this free trial

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120
is that a user can start this free trial
 

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.690
is that a user can start this free trial
for seven or thirty days but after the

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700
for seven or thirty days but after the
 

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.730
for seven or thirty days but after the
seven days or 30 days this subscription

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740
seven days or 30 days this subscription
 

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.900
seven days or 30 days this subscription
is automatically in turns in a

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:38.910
is automatically in turns in a
 

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.370
is automatically in turns in a
subscription if they don't cancel within

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380
subscription if they don't cancel within
 

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.560
subscription if they don't cancel within
the seven days so very similar to what

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:42.570
the seven days so very similar to what
 

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.850
the seven days so very similar to what
you know from Netflix for example when

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860
you know from Netflix for example when
 

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.220
you know from Netflix for example when
you subscribe for the first 30 days free

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:46.230
you subscribe for the first 30 days free
 

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.080
you subscribe for the first 30 days free
trial after 30 days if you didn't cut if

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.090
trial after 30 days if you didn't cut if
 

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.850
trial after 30 days if you didn't cut if
you didn't cancel you become subscriber

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:49.860
you didn't cancel you become subscriber
 

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.950
you didn't cancel you become subscriber
so we changed this more this model

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960
so we changed this more this model
 

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.720
so we changed this more this model
completely different for each file model

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:53.730
completely different for each file model
 

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.970
completely different for each file model
longer trial period

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980
longer trial period
 

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.260
longer trial period
it turns automatically we changed the UI

00:18:59.260 --> 00:18:59.270
it turns automatically we changed the UI
 

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.380
it turns automatically we changed the UI
and we saw one at 50% increase in leads

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:03.390
and we saw one at 50% increase in leads
 

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.840
and we saw one at 50% increase in leads
have v10 conversion rate and in average

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:05.850
have v10 conversion rate and in average
 

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.840
have v10 conversion rate and in average
revenue per user the thing is we can't

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:08.850
revenue per user the thing is we can't
 

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.490
revenue per user the thing is we can't
really tell you why that is what we like

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500
really tell you why that is what we like
 

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.840
really tell you why that is what we like
they're like love the things we change

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:11.850
they're like love the things we change
 

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.030
they're like love the things we change
but what we see it like really increased

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.040
but what we see it like really increased
 

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.630
but what we see it like really increased
the revenue so the takeaways from this

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640
the revenue so the takeaways from this
 

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.850
the revenue so the takeaways from this
is the one side obviously it was like a

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860
is the one side obviously it was like a
 

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.230
is the one side obviously it was like a
really large scale of purchases we

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240
really large scale of purchases we
 

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.600
really large scale of purchases we
tested here yet for us work really well

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:23.610
tested here yet for us work really well
 

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.380
tested here yet for us work really well
instead of just doing very incremental

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:26.390
instead of just doing very incremental
 

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.150
instead of just doing very incremental
optimization if you change the flow it

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160
optimization if you change the flow it
 

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.620
optimization if you change the flow it
can really change the mechanics of your

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:30.630
can really change the mechanics of your
 

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.970
can really change the mechanics of your
complete of your funnel completely if

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980
complete of your funnel completely if
 

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.790
complete of your funnel completely if
you look at the distribution curve so in

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:34.800
you look at the distribution curve so in
 

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.040
you look at the distribution curve so in
the past you see a lot of the day of the

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.050
the past you see a lot of the day of the
 

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.750
the past you see a lot of the day of the
purchase has happened after the first

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760
purchase has happened after the first
 

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.470
purchase has happened after the first
months actually

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480
months actually
 

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.330
months actually
so no most of the purchase is more than

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340
so no most of the purchase is more than
 

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.430
so no most of the purchase is more than
nearly 50% of the purchases happen in

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440
nearly 50% of the purchases happen in
 

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.200
nearly 50% of the purchases happen in
the first month actually most of the

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:45.210
the first month actually most of the
 

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.330
the first month actually most of the
purchases happen on the first day in the

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340
purchases happen on the first day in the
 

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.070
purchases happen on the first day in the
first session so most people start a

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080
first session so most people start a
 

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:49.760
first session so most people start a
free trial and

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:49.770
free trial and
 

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.920
free trial and
stick around and become a subscriber so

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:51.930
stick around and become a subscriber so
 

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.120
stick around and become a subscriber so
the whole funnel changed completely

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.130
the whole funnel changed completely
 

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.530
the whole funnel changed completely
which of course is a new challenge for

which of course is a new challenge for
marketing and for pro communication but

marketing and for pro communication but
 

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.570
marketing and for pro communication but
we know every new playing field what we

we know every new playing field what we

we know every new playing field what we
can optimize from so we dare to do a big

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960

you're bringing people pushing people to
 

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.080
you're bringing people pushing people to
add more stuff to the bag they're not

is you're reducing the chance for other

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:06.540
is you're reducing the chance for other

say basically when you do a test you

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:11.730
say basically when you do a test you
 

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.370
say basically when you do a test you
need to be very clear and what's the KPI

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380
need to be very clear and what's the KPI
 

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.320
need to be very clear and what's the KPI
on the test but you also need to have a

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:15.330
on the test but you also need to have a
 

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.000
on the test but you also need to have a
a clear view of what else is is

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.010
a clear view of what else is is
 

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.160
a clear view of what else is is
impacting the customer behavior all the

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.170
impacting the customer behavior all the
 

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:24.050
impacting the customer behavior all the
experience Wow okay that's a lot of

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:24.060
experience Wow okay that's a lot of
 

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.200
experience Wow okay that's a lot of
input very good so we're at the end of a

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:27.210
input very good so we're at the end of a
 

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.380

physical baguette three and four we did

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:30.390
physical baguette three and four we did
 

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.560
physical baguette three and four we did
three in four yeah we're at the end of

the of our of our time actually and I

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:35.310
the of our of our time actually and I
 

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:38.710
the of our of our time actually and I
think we should times up there is design

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720
think we should times up there is design
 

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.660
think we should times up there is design
perfect so there was a lot of input and

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:41.670
perfect so there was a lot of input and
 

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.180
perfect so there was a lot of input and
good examples obviously on on how to

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:44.190
good examples obviously on on how to
 

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.800
good examples obviously on on how to
optimize in your product we didn't get

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:45.810
optimize in your product we didn't get
 

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.000
optimize in your product we didn't get
to do around the product but there is a

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.010
to do around the product but there is a
 

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.350
to do around the product but there is a
lot of information on that as well

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360
lot of information on that as well
 

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.180

that's for me the main takeaway is look

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460
that's for me the main takeaway is look
 

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.640
that's for me the main takeaway is look
at it holistically don't look at one KPI

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:58.650
at it holistically don't look at one KPI
 

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.470
at it holistically don't look at one KPI
and don't may don't isolate keep you

and don't may don't isolate keep you
 

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.610
and don't may don't isolate keep you
guys from each other but look at it

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620
guys from each other but look at it
 

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.350
guys from each other but look at it
holistically and in a sustainable manner

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360
holistically and in a sustainable manner
 

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.900
holistically and in a sustainable manner
don't maximize short term for one single

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:05.910
don't maximize short term for one single
 

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.330
don't maximize short term for one single
KPI that's gonna then decrease other

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340
KPI that's gonna then decrease other

KPI that's gonna then decrease other
KPIs that you're not looking at so much

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:09.990
KPIs that you're not looking at so much
 

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.160
KPIs that you're not looking at so much
so that's my takeaway however I'm 100

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:13.170
