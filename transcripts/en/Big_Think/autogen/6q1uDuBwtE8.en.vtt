it's true the US military is a costly

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090
it's true the US military is a costly
 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.410
it's true the US military is a costly
enterprise it cost us more as a share of

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420
enterprise it cost us more as a share of
 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.030
enterprise it cost us more as a share of
our total output during the Cold War but

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040
our total output during the Cold War but
 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.040
our total output during the Cold War but
in absolute dollar terms we're spending

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.050
in absolute dollar terms we're spending
 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.530
in absolute dollar terms we're spending
about as much now as we spent during the

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540
about as much now as we spent during the
 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.960
about as much now as we spent during the
Cold War so the cost to maintain primacy

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970
Cold War so the cost to maintain primacy
 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.679
Cold War so the cost to maintain primacy
has remained relatively high and the

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689
has remained relatively high and the
 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.990
has remained relatively high and the
question is could we spend much more on

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000
question is could we spend much more on
 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.179
question is could we spend much more on
the military to cover some of the gaps

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189
the military to cover some of the gaps
 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.519
the military to cover some of the gaps
between what we asked our military to do

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529
between what we asked our military to do
 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.770
between what we asked our military to do
and the resources they have to carry out

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780
and the resources they have to carry out
 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.869
and the resources they have to carry out
those missions I think the answer is we

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879
those missions I think the answer is we
 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.459
those missions I think the answer is we
could spend more but it's not in our

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469
could spend more but it's not in our
 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.400
could spend more but it's not in our
interest to do so just spending more on

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410
interest to do so just spending more on
 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.400
interest to do so just spending more on
the military won't ensure that the

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410
the military won't ensure that the
 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.740
the military won't ensure that the
military for example will be able to

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750
military for example will be able to
 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.420
military for example will be able to
succeed in some of the conflicts that it

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430
succeed in some of the conflicts that it
 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.660
succeed in some of the conflicts that it
hasn't yet achieved decisive victory I

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670
hasn't yet achieved decisive victory I
 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.610
hasn't yet achieved decisive victory I
think it actually speaks to the limits

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620
think it actually speaks to the limits
 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.029
think it actually speaks to the limits
of military power that you can spend a

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039
of military power that you can spend a
 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.279
of military power that you can spend a
lot and you can have the most exquisite

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289
lot and you can have the most exquisite
 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.750
lot and you can have the most exquisite
military in the world which we

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760
military in the world which we
 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.170
military in the world which we
absolutely do and yet that same military

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180
absolutely do and yet that same military

and I think that really does speak that
 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.490
and I think that really does speak that
that just spending more money on the

that just spending more money on the
 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.770
that just spending more money on the
problem is not likely to solve the

problem it is likely to encourage us to
 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.420
problem it is likely to encourage us to
get more deeply involved in some

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430
get more deeply involved in some
 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.460
get more deeply involved in some

conflicts that might genuinely be
 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.820
conflicts that might genuinely be
intractable and that ultimately aren't

with global interests and with a large
and capable military it's really

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650
and capable military it's really
 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.249
and capable military it's really
important to define ahead of time when

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259
important to define ahead of time when
 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.249
important to define ahead of time when
that military will be used I use some

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259
that military will be used I use some

basic criteria they're consistent with

what are we asking our military to do

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920
what are we asking our military to do
 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.130
what are we asking our military to do
will the public support the mission even

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140
will the public support the mission even
 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.240
will the public support the mission even
if the mission gets difficult and costly

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250
if the mission gets difficult and costly
 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.979
if the mission gets difficult and costly
related how are we going to pay for it

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989
related how are we going to pay for it
 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.289
related how are we going to pay for it
will the war be paid for by for example

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299
will the war be paid for by for example
 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.080
will the war be paid for by for example
a war tax or will we

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
a war tax or will we
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.869
a war tax or will we
pay for it through debt like we did in

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879
pay for it through debt like we did in
 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.710
pay for it through debt like we did in
World War two those sorts of questions

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
World War two those sorts of questions
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.619
World War two those sorts of questions
are important to ask before we send our

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629
are important to ask before we send our
 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.780
are important to ask before we send our
military into harm's way and I think

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790
military into harm's way and I think
 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.850
military into harm's way and I think
that's an again the nature of the US

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860
that's an again the nature of the US
 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.850
that's an again the nature of the US
military because it exists and it is so

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
military because it exists and it is so
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.040
military because it exists and it is so
large and strong and in many places

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050
large and strong and in many places
 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.949
large and strong and in many places
simultaneously it's fairly easy for that

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959
simultaneously it's fairly easy for that
 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.140
simultaneously it's fairly easy for that
military to become involved in conflicts

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150
military to become involved in conflicts
 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.050
military to become involved in conflicts
before we ask any of those questions and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060
before we ask any of those questions and
 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.750
before we ask any of those questions and
so I think it's really important for the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
so I think it's really important for the
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.369
so I think it's really important for the
American people and for American

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379
American people and for American
 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.370
American people and for American
policymakers to keep in mind some basic

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380
policymakers to keep in mind some basic
 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.259
policymakers to keep in mind some basic
criteria for when we use force the last

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269
criteria for when we use force the last
 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.620
criteria for when we use force the last
point I'd make is that you know war is a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630
point I'd make is that you know war is a
 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.440
point I'd make is that you know war is a
perilous enterprise it involves the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
perilous enterprise it involves the
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.059
perilous enterprise it involves the
threat of violence and the destruction

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069
threat of violence and the destruction
 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.120
threat of violence and the destruction
of property and therefore we shouldn't

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130
of property and therefore we shouldn't
 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.830
of property and therefore we shouldn't
enter into it lightly and so I think

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840
enter into it lightly and so I think
 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.470
enter into it lightly and so I think
when I think of restraint and an

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
when I think of restraint and an
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.199
when I think of restraint and an
instinct of non-intervention it's more

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209
instinct of non-intervention it's more
 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.960
instinct of non-intervention it's more
about just a sort of skeptical eye it's

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970
about just a sort of skeptical eye it's
 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.569
about just a sort of skeptical eye it's
a sort of hesitant to use force

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579
a sort of hesitant to use force
 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.000
a sort of hesitant to use force
that doesn't mean never using force it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010
that doesn't mean never using force it
 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.190
that doesn't mean never using force it
means thinking through it very very

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200
means thinking through it very very
 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.610
means thinking through it very very
carefully before we do one of the great

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620
carefully before we do one of the great
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.860
carefully before we do one of the great
disservice --is we do to the military is

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
disservice --is we do to the military is
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.000
disservice --is we do to the military is
to expect the American people to support

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010
to expect the American people to support
 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.680
to expect the American people to support
it at all costs for any reason and not

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690
it at all costs for any reason and not
 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.670
it at all costs for any reason and not
expecting the American people to

expecting the American people to
 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.410
expecting the American people to
actually scrutinize the missions that we

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420
actually scrutinize the missions that we
 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.970
actually scrutinize the missions that we
ask the military to do in other words

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980
ask the military to do in other words
 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.460
ask the military to do in other words
the greatest service that we can do to

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470
the greatest service that we can do to
 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.990
the greatest service that we can do to
our veterans is to make sure that there

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000
our veterans is to make sure that there
 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.569
our veterans is to make sure that there
are relatively few of them those who are

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579
are relatively few of them those who are
 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.240
are relatively few of them those who are
who do go to war in defense of vital US

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250
who do go to war in defense of vital US
 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.460
who do go to war in defense of vital US
national security interests are doing so

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470
national security interests are doing so
 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.500
national security interests are doing so
for the right set of reasons it would

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510
for the right set of reasons it would
 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.720
for the right set of reasons it would
almost be unpatriotic it seems to me for

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730
almost be unpatriotic it seems to me for
 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.449
almost be unpatriotic it seems to me for
Americans to not think carefully about

without much debate and I think that

sense at that time the challenge however
is that these countries have become

problem with having too much reassurance
 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.580
problem with having too much reassurance
is it can lead to moral hazard it can

from going that route the fear was that

from going that route the fear was that
if many countries had nuclear weapons

if many countries had nuclear weapons

then the chances of their use would

then the chances of their use would

dramatically increase and a key part of

a key arguments that defenders of

a key arguments that defenders of

precisely that same reason and so I

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080
precisely that same reason and so I
