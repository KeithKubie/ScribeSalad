00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.000
We're here on a runway because for some reason
Brady has printed out the first 1,000,000

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.920
digits of Pi on a continuous mile long piece
of paper which we are going to very carefully

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.920
unravel today and go for a tour of a million
digits of Pi.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.439
So here's 3.14159 which - for a fun fact - that's
as far as I've memorised and then it carries

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:06.439
on and you've marked every 10 digits so there's
100,000 marker points so we won't get lost,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.040
we'll always know where we are in Pi. Where's
the Feynman Point? Is that seven hundred and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.400
something?

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.360
This the Feynman Point, six 9s, 999999, so
that won't be beaten... there is a string

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.400
of seven 3s, but that takes another 710,000
digits, so we'll be nearly three quarters

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.600
of the way down the mile of Pi before we find
a longer string of the same digit. And the

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.370
first one is in the first two metres. Absolutely
incredible!

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.880
BRADY: Do you want these? For that.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.600
HUGH: Bring the staple gun back.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.680
We've just hit 123 yards so we're long past
the familiar bits of Pi. So the whole 3.14159,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.240
that is a long time ago. You'd think anyone
who has memorised Pi, we're now in unfamiliar

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.370
territory, apart from one guy. What is the
world record for memorising Pi, so someone

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:23.370
recited over 125 yards of Pi, someone memorised
all the way to here and couldn't be bothered

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.899
to remember the next zero.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.400
BRADY: Not even a third.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:50.749
There is a run here of seven ascending digits,
there it goes, 0456789, that is the first

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:57.749
run of seven-digits that go up. Obviously
we're missing 1, 2 and 3, it would have been

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.609
nicer with them, but nowhere in the first
million digits do you get 0 to 9 in order.

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.080
HUGH: That's nearly three hours.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.800
BRADY: I found some heavy bases for cones,
I've got them in the back...

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.519
We're half a mile from the start, and the
trolley team, are they on the horizon? Okay,

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.679
Pi has just got a horizon.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.269
Okay, see that 4 there, it appears every now
and then, square number, kind of fun, but

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.989
then from here you go, wait there's no fours...
no four, no four, in fact there's no fours

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.760
until there, look at that, 157 digits and
there are no fours for that entire run. They've

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.430
just vanished. And that is the longest run
we will have in the first million digits that

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.350
has one digit completely missing.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.880
With a million decimal places of Pi each digit
should appear approximately 100,000 time each,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.440
that makes sense, but of course it's not exactly
even, some of them don't even make it. There

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.190
are not 100,000 zeroes, zero doesn't make
it. 1 doesn't make it. 6,7,8 all don't make

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:42.190
it. The champion though, is 5. There it is,
that there is the 100,000th 5.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.480
Okay we're four hours into this and we are
nearly at a million digits. So they've been

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.700
coming out a rate of a quarter of a million
digits and hour, which is approximately 4,167

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.290
digits a minute, and we're almost there.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.760
So you guys have done the hard work, do you
want to wind off the last of it. And a million

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.960
digits is there!

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.640
There!

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.200
Alright so that is, it's one, in case you
are wondering.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.400
So there you go, we have just, I mean I think
a token round of applause.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.780
APPLAUSE

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.920
So that is absolutely fantastic, and now the
very quick process of rolling it all back

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.420
up again before an aeroplane lands.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.160
BRADY: Believe it or not we printed all million
digits of Pi using about eight millilitres

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.140
of ink. There, that's what 8mL looks like.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.390
That's because of HP's clever thermal inkjet
technology combined with some very clever

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.720
people here at HSA Systems in Denmark.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.560
To see the whole story of how and why we made
this film, check out the links on the screen

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.430
and below in the video description. It also
includes extra footage from our day out on

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.640
the runway and more curious stuff about Pi
itself.
