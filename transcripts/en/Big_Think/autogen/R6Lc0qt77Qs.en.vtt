with being a kid there are programs for

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079
with being a kid there are programs for
 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.510
with being a kid there are programs for
a whole series of things in us the kid

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520
a whole series of things in us the kid
 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.250
a whole series of things in us the kid
may learn Chinese the kid may learn

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
may learn Chinese the kid may learn

Arabic but he's going to learn something
 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.360

and so the issue is what's in the in the

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370
and so the issue is what's in the in the
 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.760
and so the issue is what's in the in the
system and what's easy for us to learn

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770
system and what's easy for us to learn
 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.789
system and what's easy for us to learn
and it appears that some of the things

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799
and it appears that some of the things
 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.010
and it appears that some of the things
that we find easy to learn our tricky

there's the Natural Sciences and then

there's the Natural Sciences and then
there are the Social Sciences with the

that would be the conclusion but in fact

that would be the conclusion but in fact
 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.190
that would be the conclusion but in fact
social behavior is natural and we have

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200
social behavior is natural and we have

to make a proper connection and it puts
pressure on everybody and so in that

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930
pressure on everybody and so in that
 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.030
