NOR AISHAH SAIDINA AMIN: Since
the Industrial Revolution

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.770
began 250 years ago,
people have been

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.660
burning fossil fuels
like coal and oil

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.170
to generate electricity.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.370
Hi, I'm Professor Nor
Aisha Saidina Amin,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.170
professor of
chemical engineering,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.530
and a visiting fellow with
the MIT UTM Sustainable Cities

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.770
Program.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.800
My research is focused
on renewable energy,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.400
and today I am going
to talk about climate

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.690
change and renewable energy.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.340
The primary product of
burning of fossil fuels

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.300
is carbon dioxide.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.820
For centuries, the amount
of carbon dioxide emissions

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.980
in the atmosphere was
300 parts per million.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.480
But carbon dioxide have
increased dramatically

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.620
and reached an
unprecedented value

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.150
of about 400 parts per million.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.290
High levels of carbon
dioxide emissions

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.540
are linked to
climate change, which

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.420
has led to increasing
temperatures, melting glaciers,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.120
rising sea level, changing
rain and snow patterns,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.580
and also drought, floods,
and other extreme events.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.150
Climate change is
an important issue,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.410
and reducing carbon
emission is a challenge.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.490
In December 2015, world
leaders convened in Paris

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.430
to discuss the reduction of
carbon emissions and climate

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.600
change impacts at a United
Nations Global climate

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.300
conference.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:44.120
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.590
SPEAKER 1: There is no doubt
that the global climate change

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.675
agreement we seek must be
part of what Paris has become.

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:55.300
NOR AISHAH SAIDINA
AMIN: Even Hollywood

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.510
is taking a public
stand on this issue.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.750
SPEAKER 2: And the Oscar
goes to Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.050
[CHEERING]

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.800
LEONARDO DICAPRIO:
Climate change is real.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.190
It is happening right now.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.774
It is the most urgent threat
facing our entire species.

00:02:14.774 --> 00:02:16.440
NOR AISHAH SAIDINA
AMIN: One of the ways

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.870
to address climate
change is to replace

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.710
fossil fuels with renewable
energy for electricity

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.050
production.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.310
Carbon emissions from
renewable energy power plants

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.500
are much lower compared to those
that run with fossil fuels.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.860
According to the Energy
Information Administration,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.270
although there are plenty
of renewable resources

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.220
available on Earth, only 10%
of the world's energy output

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.180
is from renewable sources.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.310
Types of renewable
energy include

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.720
solar, geothermal,
wind, and biomass.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.970
There are many
lessons that can be

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.850
learned from Malaysia's success
with using renewable energy.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.710
Given Malaysia's
tropical biodiversity,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.520
conversion of biomass to
energy is a promising approach

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.572
to establishing sustainable
energy production.

00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:09.030
JOHN WOODLEY:
Malaysia will also be

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.510
an excellent example
where there is

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.670
plenty of agricultural waste.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.420
And it could be a
wonderful idea to try

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.730
to use that waste in a way which
brings a little bit of value

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.390
to your community, to the
country, but at the same time,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.779
can help us to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions.

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:28.570
NOR AISHAH SAIDINA
AMIN: Situated in Johor,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.210
the most southern state in
peninsula Malaysia, Iskandar,

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.030
Malaysia is a new
development region that

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.620
advocates low carbon emission.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.950
Most of its carbon
dioxide emission

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.140
are from the electricity
and heating sector.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.000
As documented in
their low carbon plan.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.030
Iskandar, Malaysia is
projected to be a sustainable

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.470
city by 2025 with only $18.9
million tons of carbon dioxide

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.430
emissions, a 40% reduction
from 2005 levels.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.280
How can this Iskandar,
Malaysia achieve this target?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.280
One of the methods
is to utilize waste

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.790
from the oil pump industry to
generate heat and electricity.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.870
Iskandar, Malaysia is easily
accessible to large areas

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.180
of oil palm plantation.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.350
The oil pump industry produces
waste such as empty fruit bunch

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.480
and palm oil mill effluent.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.400
Empty fruit bunch is the residue
you produced when palm fruit is

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.000
taken from a fresh fruit
bunch in the initial process

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.900
of a palm oil production.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.600
Palm oil mill effluent is
the voluminous liquid waste

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.240
that comes from the
sterilization and clarification

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.840
processes in milling oil palm.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.070
By utilizing waste,
carbon dioxide emissions

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.620
can be significantly
reduced and make the air

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.850
in the region cleaner
and healthier.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.600
One way to measure
carbon dioxide emissions

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.230
is to use an
integrated model that

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.830
takes into account direct
and indirect carbon dioxide

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.100
emissions.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.590
The concept of the
model used to probe

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.980
quite a systematic and
comprehensive carbon accounting

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.730
to evaluate carbon
performance, as well

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.260
as to determine the
potential carbon emission

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.754
reduction in the process.

00:05:18.754 --> 00:05:21.820
The model calculates carbon
dioxide emissions from three

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.560
by biomass power plants-- the
bio-xcell plant, Kulim group

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.580
plant, and Ronser biogas plant.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.230
Initially, carbon accounting
centers for each process

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.900
is divided into smaller units.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.450
Next, the total monthly
carbon emission equivalent

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.550
is determined, followed by
calculation of the carbon

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.890
dioxide emissions and
carbon emission index

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.710
across the carbon
performance indicators.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.490
Strategies for reduction
of carbon emissions

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.070
are then implemented.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.280
The five main
emission contributors

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.860
are identified as carbon
performance indicators.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.660
These are fuel, water, and
electricity consumption.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.720
And also waste water and
solid waste generation.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.030
Empty fruit bunch is
fed into Bio-Xcell Plant

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.990
to generate steam
and electricity.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.180
Empty fruit bunch is
shredded and then formed

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.490
as solid pellets.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.510
The pellets are used as
fuels for the boilers

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.990
to produce steam.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.100
The steam turbine then
generates electricity.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.010
Meanwhile, Kulim and Ronser
utilize palm oil mill effluent.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.850
The effluent is retained
in an anaerobic digester

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.580
to produce bio gas.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.480
The gas runs the turbine
to generate electricity.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.650
The total monthly
carbon dioxide emissions

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.920
before and after
the implementation

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.040
of the reductions strategies
are exhibited in figure one,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.660
showing a 27% emissions
reduction at Bio-Xcell,

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.920
15% at Kulim, and 41% at Ronser.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.750
Figure two compares the
carbon emission index

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.170
after implementing the
reduction strategies.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.940
In general, all
performance indicators

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.450
show reduced emissions
after innovative strategies

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.020
are implemented.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.520
In Bio-Xcell, the
carbon emission index

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.110
for fuel and water consumption
decreased significantly

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.540
after solid, empty fruit bunches
replaced the shredded ones.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.345
In addition, a reduction
of solid waste generation

00:07:28.345 --> 00:07:31.550
in runs of bio gas
was also registered

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.070
after water from the
effluent is recycled.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.910
Carbon dioxide emissions
can be easily predicted

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.790
using the income model.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.930
A power plant that utilizes
biomass contributes

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.470
less to climate change since
the carbon dioxide released

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.470
is absorbed by trees
through photosynthesis.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.530
The process is cyclical.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.560
The industry could
play a big role

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.600
in reducing carbon
dioxide emissions

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.620
by switching to renewable energy
for generating electricity.

NOR AISHAH SAIDINA AMIN:
Globally electricity generation

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.340
from renewables, and
particularly from biomass,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.490
is increasing.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.370
Biomass supplies such
as pump or mill effluent

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.200
is steady due to the number of
oil pump mills in the region

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.600
as stated by Dr. Azhar Aziz
of Gait Rungkai company.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.190
AZHAR AZIZ: I will say it's
very, very valuable Very

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:36.080
significantly valuable because
based on the number of palm oil

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.450
mills in the country,
as of 2014, there

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.190
are at least 480 mills in the
country, including [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:54.010
So from this huge number of oil
mills, there are [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.982
It's just a matter of how we
are going to maximize this.

00:08:58.982 --> 00:09:02.900
Because to me, it's not being
maximized in terms of effort

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.081
to reducing the carbon
emission in the country.

00:09:06.081 --> 00:09:08.080
NOR AISHAH SAIDINA AMIN:
The significant decline

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.940
in capital costs for

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.030
suggests that investment
in renewable energy

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.390
is economically viable.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.240
The utilization of
renewable energy waste

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.990
for re-powering power plants
could help realize Iskandar,

Malaysia's low carbon goals.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.140
Since biomass emits
less carbon dioxide

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.760
compared to fossil fuels,
the move to clean energy

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.580
could reduce the magnitude
of climate change risks.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.710
