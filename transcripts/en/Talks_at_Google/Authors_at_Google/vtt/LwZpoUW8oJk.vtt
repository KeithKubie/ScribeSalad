00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.081
SPEAKER: I now introduce
you to Rowen Somerville.

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:12.691
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.160
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: Thank
you very much, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.100
That was an amazing
introduction.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.460
You can stop me anytime--

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.120
really lovely.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.445
Can everyone hear me?

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:24.080
All right.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.790
Thank you very much
for having me--

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.750
just breathing for a moment.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.300
I'm in the heart of the beast at
the moment, the starry dynamo.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.960
Here we are at the
heart of Google.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.660
That's very exciting for me.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.140
I just wonder-- my
publisher is on holiday

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.600
at the moment with 14 teenagers,
and they're around 16 years

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.720
old.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.270
And he said to me, not one
of them has bought a book.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.980
It's incredible, isn't it?

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.930
I wonder if you're responsible.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.240
But that's not fair
at all, actually.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.280
But whether books
continue to exist

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.790
or don't, what will
remain is narrative.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.330
And I've been looking at talks,
like TED talks and Google

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.800
Talks, trying to get an idea
of what one is meant to do.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.780
And one thing they
tend to do is have

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.790
an argument like
there's something

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.740
that I'm going to
convince you of--

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
something that I'm going
to change your mind about.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.990
And that's not the way
it's going to be here.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.820
If there's any
ambition I have, it's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.630
simply to inspire a
few ideas and thoughts.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.030
And if there's any
ideology I have I

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.090
suppose it's against dualism--

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.860
against this or that--

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.850
right or wrong.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.330
I mean, particularly
in a context like this,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.580
this is a very difficult area--

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.650
Palestine, Israel--
Jews, Muslims--

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.910
Protestant, Catholic.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.010
I'm not talking about
Protestant, Catholic,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.630
but there's some
subject matters that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.920
just immediately close you down
and rise up the tribal hackles.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.470
And as a result of which
I've noticed that TED Talks,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.240
for instance, and
lots of other things,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.940
just avoid them for reasons
because people kick up fuss.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.210
But if there's any ideology I've
got, it's against easy dualism

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.010
because I spent
seven or eight years

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.420
of my life looking at history.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.370
I'm not a historian.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.140
I just went and asked everyone
I could find what happened.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.890
And the only thing I
can tell you for sure

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.900
is that history is
a messy business

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.630
the closer you get to it.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.700
But when I say
neither this nor that,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.650
it doesn't mean that I'm
going to eject-- live

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.590
in some sort of relativist
world, where oh, well, we

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.840
can't tell where reality
is, so everything's right.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.810
No, just put your
hand on your heart,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.060
and you will feel it beating.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.920
And surely, that's true.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.170
And mine's really beating
quite hard at the moment.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.670
But surely that's a truth--

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.690
your heart, my heart is
pumping oxygenated blood

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.220
through our bodies
and particularly

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.650
to the brain, which is
giving us this consciousness

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.030
to be able to understand.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.210
That's a truth I can hold on to.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.130
But to speak about this story--

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.280
because what I'm really
here is to tell you a story,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.030
and to the best of my
ability, it's true.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.730
And it begins in Tel Aviv
in 2001, June the 1st.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.360
Loads of young people are
standing outside a nightclub.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.105
And I mean young.

00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:19.990
They're teenagers.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.050
It's teen night outside.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.091
It's teen night at the nightclub
in the Dolphinarium in Tel

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:25.590
Aviv.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.450
It's a warm, beautiful night.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.430
They're all gathering
in order to get inside.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.000
And most of these
people are former--

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.240
they lived in-- they come
from the former Soviet Union.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.370
And their parents have emigrated
as a result of Israel's efforts

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.290
to bring more people with
some sort of Jewish connection

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.940
into Israel.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.020
And these are their
sons and daughters.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.800
And they are all
together on this night

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.310
to have a brilliant
night's dancing, kissing,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.840
who knows what will happen.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.630
There is one person there
who's a little bit older.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.920
He's 22.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.600
His name is Saeed Hotari.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.340
And he doesn't come--

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.550
he's not from the
former Soviet Union.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.640
He's from a place
14 kilometers away.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.980
He's never been to Tel
Aviv before that moment.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.940
He's looking around
with wonder, I imagine.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.641
And just before 11 o'clock, the
doors of the nightclub open.

00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:30.390
And most of the boys
are letting the girls

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.690
go in free because girls
get in free before 11:00.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.860
And at the point at which the
crowd is at its most dense,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.405
Saeed Hotari screams
the name of his god

00:04:42.405 --> 00:04:48.330
and sets off a bomb packed with
shrapnel and ball bearings,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.980
immediately killing 22 people--

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.350
23, if we include him--

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.630
and injuring hundreds.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.660
And the devastation
is appalling.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.910
And I've spent a long time
looking at the photographs

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.410
and whatever.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.550
And the only thing I can say is
that the cement area literally

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.350
runs with blood.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.180
This sets off what is called
a mass casualty incident.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.900
It's a sad reflection on
Israel's recent history--

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.270
Israel only has a
recent history--

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.940
that Israel's probably
better than any other country

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.310
in dealing with a mass
casualty incident.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.010
That's where emails go out.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.940
All the telephone
communications are cleared.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.260
Texts immediately go to doctors.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.080
Parking is cleared in areas.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.710
High school volunteers are
there to push trolleys around.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.270
It's amazingly organized.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.010
And all the nearby
hospitals are alerted.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.030
A man called [INAUDIBLE] is
the trauma specialist who's

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.330
in charge of the
nearest hospital.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.410
And he starts dealing with
the extraordinary number

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.880
of horribly injured
teenagers who were arriving.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.200
Now let's just look at
how they're injured--

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.990
blast.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.636
Blast is the modern
expression of warfare.

00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:10.760
At one stage, we were
throwing rocks at each other.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.040
We made weapons-- iron weapons,
bronze weapons, swords, arrows,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.350
muskets, rifles, guns.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.880
Today, it's basically blasts.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.700
Bullets aren't over, but
it's basically blasts.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.290
And the nature of
blasts is it has

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.020
a peculiar pattern of injury.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.380
Not to go into it too
much, but just so you hear

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.000
and understand a bit about
it, primary blast injury

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.960
is from the blast wave.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.370
And that will attack anything
with fluid in it-- your eyes,

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.030
your ears, digestive areas.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.700
It's very, very difficult
to deal with medically.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.620
Then the secondary
blast injury, that

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.510
accounts for 85% of blasts.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.190
That's all the
shrapnel or whatever.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.280
And it goes on and on.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.670
There's an air blast
that can blow things off.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.520
The injuries are
enormous and varied.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.380
And they need a large selection
of medical specialties, all at

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.880
once sometimes--

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.650
trauma specialists,
burn specialists--

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.940
I can hardly ever pronounce
it, but otolaryngologists--

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.680
ocular specialists.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.680
A large number of
different specialties

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.620
are all there, sometimes
on the same patient.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.620
And if we go-- another
of the hospitals nearby,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.130
there is a man, who I'm going
to focus on called Yaacov Lavie.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.690
And he's a cardiologist.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.850
He's a cardiac surgeon.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.430
And like so many Israelis, but
particularly a cardiac surgeon,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.860
he hasn't really looked at the
time at all the historical--

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.360
looked at the
political situation.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.040
He's just focused on
being a cardiac surgeon.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.470
He's a nice guy.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.130
He is very-- the word
pro-Palestinian isn't

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.089
quite right, but
he's very sympathetic

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:49.130
to the Palestinian cause.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.490
He's a left-winger, but he's
not involved in everything.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.980
Because one of the things
that isn't generally used

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.910
in post blasts--

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.780
what's generally not
needed is heart surgery.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.270
Heart surgery is pretty
much a peacetime activity

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.140
unless you get
something in your heart.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.550
And so he, who is used to
being the center of activity,

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.180
is sitting there with
his head in his hands

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.660
experiencing what he described
to me as rage because standing

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.160
there--

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.170
there are teenagers coming
in with battlefield injuries.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.056
And then just down
from where he is

00:08:27.056 --> 00:08:29.570
is a ward he's
responsible for, which

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.940
is full of all the
end-stage cardiac patients--

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.860
people waiting for
a heart transplant.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.580
Now I'm going to stop
with this horrific scene

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.059
that you can imagine across
four or five hospitals

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.450
around Tel Aviv, and let's
just go a few hours later

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.840
to Jerusalem.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.930
Jerusalem is only
40 kilometers away--

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.190
44 kilometers away.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.620
I mean, I thought when I went
to that part of the world,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.020
I imagined it would be much
bigger because of the sheer

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.240
concentration of
narratives-- let alone,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.380
the biblical ones I was given
growing up, but then all the--

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.470
[INAUDIBLE] it's tiny.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.600
It's the size of
Wales pretty much.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.580
There, in Jerusalem, let's see
a man called Mazen Joulani,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.650
He's a Palestinian.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.890
He lives in East Jerusalem.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.710
He's got absolutely nothing to
do with what happened the night

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:13.730
before.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.510
What he has to do with is his
three children, his wife, being

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.080
a pharmacist, trying
to live a normal life--

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.690
particularly difficult as a
Palestinian amidst the Second

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.870
Intifada in East Jerusalem.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.140
He wakes up, says goodbye
to his kids, goes to work,

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.820
has his whole day--
no doubt hearing

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.670
about that terrific bomb that
happened the night before.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.400
On his way back home,
he does the equivalent

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.200
of stopping off for a pint.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.100
He goes and has a cup of tea
with his mates at the cafe.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.991
Everyone goes in
to watch the news.

00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:47.990
Mazen Joulani has been
hearing the news all day.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.935
Maybe he sits outside.

00:09:48.935 --> 00:09:50.300
Maybe he's smoking a cigarette.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.760
Maybe he's drinking
a cup of tea.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.330
A car draws up,
and a man gets out.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.900
The witnesses say it
was an Israeli settler.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.347
He walks up to Mazen Joulani.

00:10:01.347 --> 00:10:02.930
He doesn't know him,
and he shoots him

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.670
in the neck as a random
reprisal for what

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.580
had happened the night before.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.170
A few hours later, Mazen Joulani
is lying in a hospital bed.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.100
His family's all around him.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.110
There's massive bandages
around his neck.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.660
But otherwise the heart monitor
is going beep, beep, beep,

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.530
beep, and he looks OK.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.960
And a doctor is telling
his family that he's dead,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.010
but his heart is beating.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.030
And the doctor's saying,
yeah, but he's brain dead.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:43.320
Outside the room is a
transplant coordinator.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.000
She has the exquisitely
difficult task

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.690
of going to the family
who, a few hours ago--

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.690
their son, their husband,
their father, their brother

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:54.950
was fine--

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.790
and asking for his heart.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.970
That's hard under
normal circumstances

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.730
if it happens in Dublin,
if it happens wherever.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.560
But there, in Jerusalem, in the
midst of the Second Intifada,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.270
where it was
culturally pressured

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.240
to not help the other
side on any level at all,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.150
it's very, very
difficult indeed.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.290
But the thing about a heart
transplant, as opposed

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.430
to, say, the kidney--

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.740
you can get the kidney out
of a recently dead person

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.910
no problem.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.910
A heart needs a
still-beating donor,

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.450
and that makes it very, very
rare because only about 2%

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:34.040
of deaths are going to be
brain damage deaths or deaths

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.350
that would allow a
still-beating donor.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.560
And then you've got to get
the heart when the person is

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.270
seemingly still alive.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.660
They are alive.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.960
I mean, until 1967
when the first heart

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.330
transplant was done,
the definition of life

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.872
was your beating heart.

00:11:48.872 --> 00:11:50.330
Just because your
brain's scrambled

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.450
doesn't mean that
you're not alive.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.830
I mean, a tree doesn't have
a brain, and it is alive.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.400
But what the transplant
coordinator said

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.270
was that she didn't
have anything to do.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:08.750
She went up, and Mazen's
mom said, take the heart.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.440
And she knew it was going to
an Israeli Jew, the tribe that,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.920
as far as she was concerned,
had killed her husband--

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.320
not all the Jews
everywhere but as far as--

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.729
within the context of her mind.

00:12:20.729 --> 00:12:22.520
But she said it doesn't
matter whether it's

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.020
a Christian, a Jew, or Muslim.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.520
It doesn't matter who it is.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.100
Just save someone else's life.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.076
So go back to Yaacov
Lavie, our cardiac surgeon.

00:12:31.076 --> 00:12:33.200
He's still sitting there
with his hand in his head.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.930
The phone rings.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.650
It's Tamara Ashkenazi, who is
the head of the transplant, who

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:41.180
goes, we've got a heart
for Yitzhak Cohen.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:46.280
Now Lavie got to know all the
people in the end-stage heart

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.170
unit because although Israel
has the ability, the know-how,

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.290
the technical surgical
expertise, incredibly

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.540
high standards of
medicine, and the money

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.070
to offer its citizens
heart transplants,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.930
there is an acute
shortage of hearts.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.110
One of the reasons is, because
as I was already describing,

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.790
they are rare.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.880
On the other reason, there
was the problem that about 10%

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.780
of the population could be
described as ultra orthodox.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.360
It's people with the
hats and the locks.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.190
And they want the hearts
if they need them.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.990
But also, religiously,
they say they

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.360
can't be donors, so that brings
down the percentage, as well.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.940
There's lots of
difficult things.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.850
And then in this
country, in the UK,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.900
in France, there's
a special thing.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.310
And if you had a
heart, and it didn't--

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.287
you couldn't find
anywhere for it to go,

00:13:35.287 --> 00:13:36.620
it would go to a nearby country.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.210
But Israel's nearby
countries are not

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.190
going to send them hearts.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.460
They're going to send them
shells, missiles, whatever.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.060
So there's an acute
shortage of hearts.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.540
And here is a man, Yitzhak
Cohen, who Lavie, the surgeon,

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.740
has got to know pretty well.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.320
And he's dying slowly.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:00.400
And he admitted to me
with his characteristic--

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.950
this is a wide
brush of a stroke,

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.860
but characteristic
Israeli bluntness.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.890
And he goes, yeah, I was looking
at the newspapers checking out

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.640
tragedies, wondering if there'd
be a heart for me before I die.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.020
He's got two kids.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.440
He knows which way he's going.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.510
He can hardly walk anymore.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.910
And what's he wanting?

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.500
It's not so bad.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.180
He just wants to survive.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.220
I mean, I think
it's 16th century,

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.860
the great philosopher
Spinoza tried to find--

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.470
is there anything that
links all living beings?

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.900
And he came up with
proposition seven.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.690
It pertains of an
organism to exist.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.770
We all want to exist, and that's
all Yitzhak Cohen wanted to do

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.860
was exist.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.900
And guess what?

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.370
His heart is there for him.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.060
Mazen Joulani's family
is giving his heart.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.820
And Lavie comes in,
and he goes, Cohen,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.050
I've got a heart for you.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.260
And immediately, this sets off
a whole set of different things

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.640
that kick in.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.460
He immediately tells his
family, stops eating.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.230
He gets prepped.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.480
And then another
group of surgeons

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.660
goes off to Jerusalem
to extract the heart--

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.195
a cardiectomy.

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.570
This is something
I've witnessed,

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.030
and it's a really harsh
thing to watch because there

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.820
is a patient at the beginning.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.320
And at the end,
they're lying there,

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.810
a corpse with their chest open
as if vultures had been there.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.610
But it's an amazing act
of generosity, to give.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.170
Anyway, what
happens from then on

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:27.690
is what is probably the
most dramatic medical thing

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.240
that I know of, which
is a heart transplant.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.280
So the one team goes off.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.970
Lavie is there with
Cohen, who is now sedated.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.030
And he's in constant
contact with the team

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.960
that's taking it out.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.910
They don't know that
the heart is good

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.150
until they actually open up
the chest and look at it.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.890
Is anyone really squeamish?

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.000
I have friends-- oh, you are.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.300
That was what I--

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.230
so I won't go into
too many details,

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.860
but you can tell it's really
good until you look at it.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:00.480
And then Lavie isn't going
to open up the chest of Cohen

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.230
until he knows it's worth doing.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.510
And then he'll prep.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.180
He'll attach Cohen's
diseased heart

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.730
to a heart bypass machine.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.680
But he won't take it out.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.840
And he'll get the call
saying the heart looks good.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.040
And then it zooms over.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.990
And he just waits for an hour.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.590
And there's just
one thing to do.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.090
He's not going to
snip out the heart

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.710
until he's got the
new one next to him

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.930
because there's no going
back at that stage.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.080
When he has the new one next
to him, he opens the box.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.560
He looks at it,
checks it, and then he

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.560
makes the five cuts on
the five great vessels--

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.960
if I can remember them--
superior vena cava,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.260
inferior vena cava,
aorta, pulmonary vein,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.380
pulmonary artery.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.870
I think that's five--

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.930
takes it out and puts
in the new heart.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.320
And then sews, sews, sews-- and
the last one being the aorta.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.090
And at a certain
point, then you release

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:55.980
the cross clamp
and blood fills in.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.940
Now just before he does that,
he's picked up the one heart.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.070
He's taken out the other one.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.609
And he has something like--

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.339
what do you call it--

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.300
a secular epiphany,
like a religious moment.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.040
And he just gets
on with his work,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.500
puts the heart, releases
the cross clamp.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.750
The heart fills with blood.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.250
And as occasionally happens,
it just starts on its own.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.140
And he seals up the patient.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.940
And Cohen's got a
healthy heart in him.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.820
And he walks out of
the operating theater

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.580
through the emergency
room still full

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.770
of horribly injured teenagers.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.417
And there are loads of press
because of the bomb and this,

00:17:37.417 --> 00:17:38.250
that, and the other.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.010
And they turn, and look at
him, and ask him for a comment.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.760
And he says, just
an hour ago, I had

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.830
the heart of an
Israeli Jew in one hand

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.890
and a heart of a Palestinian
Muslim in the other,

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.690
and there is no difference.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.860
Now that is what brought
me to this story.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.895
And I was making
documentaries at the time.

00:17:58.895 --> 00:18:01.140
I was sitting in a
horrible office in London.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.230
And I first heard
about the bomb.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.210
Now we hear about
bombs a lot, I mean,

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.210
so much so that we are
desensitized to them.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.340
Did you know that in
northern Syria on Wednesday

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.960
there was a bomb
in a marketplace

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.370
that killed 38 people--

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.210
worse than this one?

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.630
We just let it pass because
we can't survive that way.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.190
And I'd been that way--

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.427
Israelis or this and that.

00:18:21.427 --> 00:18:22.510
You just don't look at it.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.580
They're not my people.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.380
I'm just not going
to-- but something

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.500
about this one,
this bomb, got me,

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.875
maybe because I
was the age where

00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:30.400
I liked going to nightclubs.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.020
I was a DJ.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.670
I played records here and there.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.220
I could feel for those
people just waiting

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.860
to dance-- and just imagine
that terrible moment.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.430
And then when I heard about the
heart transplant the next day,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.080
it fell on me, as Larkin said--

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.890
as they say love does,
like an enormous yes,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.060
and it gripped me.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.040
And I'm not really telling
you the whole story.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:58.170
I'm missing out a key part,
which you brought up there.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.890
When I was a child, and I
opened the fridge in our family

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.090
house--

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.270
my three brothers and
sisters and my parents--

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.550
always on the top
shelf, generally, there

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.850
were human hearts
or bits of hearts.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.880
And my parents weren't
serial killers.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.440
They were cardiologists.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.500
And we take it for granted now.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.500
It used to be the case--

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.790
'50s, '60s-- that
the number one killer

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.510
of people in the developed
world was heart disease.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:33.540
That's what knocked you off, and
because of cardiologists like

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.090
my parents-- pioneering
cardiologists--

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.360
it isn't anymore.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:44.070
So just to give you a statistic,
I think 15% of children born

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:49.230
with heart defects in
the early '60s didn't--

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.750
only 15% made it
past into adulthood,

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:58.590
and now we're looking
at 90% to 95%.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.450
So that's a very
radical change--

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.700
usually living until 70.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.230
So that's what happened there.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.240
And when my mother,
whose patients were

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.130
generally children lost--

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.040
when she lost a child,
she'd go and get the heart.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.380
And she'd be with that
heart until she understood

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.170
why it had ceased to function.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.970
On the other side as well--

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.680
so there you've
got hearts going.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.050
All the conversations I
heard between my parents

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.260
were about aortic stenosis,
left ventricular thrombosis--

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.270
I grew up amongst that.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.050
I saw the hearts there.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.657
The surgeons were always
around the house smoking

00:20:31.657 --> 00:20:33.990
furiously because it was only
in the '70s they found out

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.100
it was bad.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.810
You know what they did when
they found out how bad it was?

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.310
All those people,
furious smokers,

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.750
they just stopped
like over night.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.090
My dad smoked his whole life--

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.815
read one article
in "The Lancet."

00:20:43.815 --> 00:20:46.290
He was like, this
isn't worth it.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.790
Yeah, so then on
that side, that was

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.040
why hearts were so key to me.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.510
On the other side,
our neighbor was

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.110
a very inspiring,
maybe even saintly,

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.730
man called Rabbi Gryn, who was
the head of the Reformed Jews

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.070
in London, and his
children were all our age.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.410
And so we were very
close on that side.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.600
And yet on the other side,
my father spoke Arabic.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.846
He was an Irishman
who learned Arabic.

00:21:08.846 --> 00:21:10.470
And my mother was
passionately involved

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.400
in the Palestinian cause.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.570
So there were Arabs around,
there were Jews around,

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:16.532
there were Muslims.

00:21:16.532 --> 00:21:18.240
People didn't know so
much, but I already

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.240
spoke 30 words of Arabic by
the time I was eight or nine.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.760
And, you know, I still hang
out in a dishdasha jellabiya

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.816
at home.

00:21:26.816 --> 00:21:28.440
So there were these
things so that when

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.670
I heard this news, you can
see why it gripped me so much

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.600
and became the focus of my
life, because this heart that

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.440
moved between a Palestinian
Muslim and an Israeli Jew,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.860
it felt like to me it
could maybe heal the world.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.500
And I just followed it.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.400
So I went to Israel.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.240
I went to West Bank.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.324
I spent a long time there.

00:21:49.324 --> 00:21:51.823
I spoke to all the people, who
were outside the Dolphinarium

00:21:51.823 --> 00:21:52.600
who I could find.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.450
I spoke to their brothers
and sisters, the parents.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.940
I spoke to everyone I could.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.680
I spent a long time there,
but there were two key things

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.760
that I needed to understand
that eluded me for a while.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.000
One was Saeed Hotari,
this young man.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.490
If you read all the
newspaper articles,

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:15.090
it said that he was a
fanatical Muslim, believed

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.860
in the whole virgins thing--

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.420
I mean, a load of
rubbish actually.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.930
But it was this idea of this
other, then, human person

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.640
who had done this.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.200
And he had done it for other--

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.850
fanatical reasons.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.200
And so, I wanted to understand.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.400
Is that who he was?

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.730
Was he a psychopath to be
able to do that appalling

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.730
thing in a bunch of teenagers?

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.740
So I needed to go and find
out, and meet his parents,

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.640
and meet everyone.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.290
Now if you're a foreign
correspondent, the way

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.350
you will do that-- a
proper journalist, which I

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.820
have never been, but I'm
always open to an offer

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.190
from a newspaper.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.440
What you do when you get to
somewhere like that is you

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.480
hire a fixer.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.920
And the fixer you pay $250,
$300, $400, $500 a day.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.830
And you tell them what you want,
and they get you the article.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.530
They get you the interview,
and you get your quotes,

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.540
and everything moves
forward happily.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.830
It's not what I wanted.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.980
I mean, this is an
act of terrorism.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.490
It comes from the Latin
terreur, I frighten.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.130
You know, without the
aspect of performance,

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.370
it's just a violent crime.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.950
And that aspect of
performance that comes in

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.530
is where the media
plays its part.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:32.740
Not very many
newspapers, TV shows,

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.220
clicks onto stories
have been done

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.740
through the cause of peace.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.731
Many of them are done through
the cause of fear and war.

00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:41.980
It's not that they're cynical.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.605
Everyone's just
getting through the day

00:23:43.605 --> 00:23:46.140
somehow for whatever
people are interested in.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.450
And this whole
performance activity I

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.060
wanted to get away from.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.440
There's a sort of pattern that
happens after a terrorist bomb,

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.020
or there was.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.270
The journalists
go to the victims,

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.720
who say what terrible--

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.050
there's such sadness and awful--

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.090
And then they go to those
family members who go,

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.430
my son or daughter is a martyr.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:06.390
And then they go to--

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.700
there's a whole
[INAUDIBLE] who goes this.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.556
I just wanted--

00:24:09.556 --> 00:24:10.680
I wasn't after information.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.270
I wanted a feeling type thing.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.890
And since I'd worked in "The
Big Breakfast," Channel Four's

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.430
breakfast program years
ago, which was a TV show,

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.320
my only contact
were the people who

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.950
worked on the Palestinian
version of "Sesame Street."

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.664
So I turn up, and I'm
there, and I'm chatting.

00:24:28.664 --> 00:24:30.580
They don't know me, but
they're really lovely.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.090
And then after-- they're
having their production meeting

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.484
and after the production
meeting I go and ask them.

00:24:35.484 --> 00:24:37.150
So they said, well,
how can we help you?

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.858
I said, look, I've
got this phone number.

00:24:38.858 --> 00:24:40.860
I think it's the father
of the suicide bomber.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.290
And I've been told I can't
call it under any circumstances

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.700
because he doesn't want
to hear an English voice.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.010
It's going to freak him out.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.290
So can anyone help me?

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.140
And they're all going, we
don't want any trouble.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.450
This was a Hamas thing.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:55.504
It's a dangerous area.

00:24:55.504 --> 00:24:56.670
Everything is peaceful here.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.680
But it turns like that.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.435
Is there any other
element to it?

00:25:00.435 --> 00:25:03.060
And I said, I'm not very
politically sophisticated.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.750
I have no idea.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.333
I'm just here.

00:25:04.333 --> 00:25:05.430
I came on the bus.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:08.280
I'm staying in the
hotel up there.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.200
You tell me.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.780
I just want to go and see him.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.492
So one of them goes,
[MUMBLING] come [MUMBLING]..

00:25:14.492 --> 00:25:15.450
They have a whole chat.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.330
And some young guy goes--
he goes, come outside.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.620
So we go outside.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.720
By the way, they're having their
production meeting in a bar.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.990
This is in Muslim Palestine.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.770
Everyone is drinking
points of Taybeh, a beer--

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.340
a Palestinian beer.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.820
It's just nothing is
what you expect in life.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.790
I'm not sure what
their backgrounds are.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.110
Anyway, we go outside.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.110
He makes the phone call.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.818
And he's talking.

00:25:37.818 --> 00:25:38.910
And he goes, it's OK.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.800
Tomorrow at 11:00, you meet him.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.720
So I have the address.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.430
He's written it down.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.138
I said, by the way,
why did they ask you?

00:25:45.138 --> 00:25:48.570
He said, everyone says I
speak Arabic beautifully.

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:50.520
And off he goes.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.880
So I have this-- so
I just go in a cab.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.090
And Qalqilya isn't the most
relaxed place in all this.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.980
And I've got no backing at all.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.170
I don't have a
newspaper behind me.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.910
I don't have anything behind me.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.120
And I don't know what
the situation is.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.570
So my cab drive,
for instance, he

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.747
says when I get in that
he knows where it is.

00:26:11.747 --> 00:26:13.830
And then we're driving
along, and he turns around.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.710
He goes, where?

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.000
And I said, I don't know.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.400
I've never been here before.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.022
And he's seeming really antsy.

00:26:21.022 --> 00:26:22.230
And I'm thinking, oh, my god.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.105
What's going on here?

00:26:23.105 --> 00:26:25.355
I was going to ask someone,
but there's no one around.

00:26:25.355 --> 00:26:27.330
And then we see a
car, and we stop it.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.760
And there's a black BMW,
and the guy gets out.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.570
And I'm thinking everyone--

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.572
what's going on here?

00:26:33.572 --> 00:26:34.530
And the guy has a chat.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.610
And we get in, and we drive.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:36.651
And then he turns around.

00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:38.060
The driver, again
he goes, where?

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.020
I said, well, didn't
that guy tell you?

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:40.859
He goes, where?

00:26:40.859 --> 00:26:41.400
I don't know.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:41.900
Go.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.060
I leave you.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.130
And everything is
getting a bit weird.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.790
And he seems very
anxious not to be there.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.890
So I called the father
of the suicide bomber.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.480
His name was Saeed
Hotari, the boy.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.270
And his father's Abu
Hotari, father of Hotari.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.080
And I passed it to
the taxi driver.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.370
And they have a 10-minute chat.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.570
And then he puts down the
phone and goes, where?

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.154
Eventually, I remember that
we passed two people standing.

00:27:09.154 --> 00:27:10.570
And they were the
only two people.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.510
And we're driving back
there, and we get--

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.850
and it's Abu Hotari
who is standing there.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.816
And this guy just wants
to get paid and leave.

00:27:17.816 --> 00:27:19.440
So I don't know if
their 10-minute chat

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.990
is driving around the block
while we sharpen the knives.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:27.790
I don't know what the scenario
is at all-- or, more likely,

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.210
his wife is cooking
his favorite lunch.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.860
He's got a guitar practice.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.750
He can't wait to
get this job-- you

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.900
don't know in this whole thing
because one thing's for sure.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.820
I meet him.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:44.040
We have an extraordinary
few hours together,

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.730
about five or six hours.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.440
They're not that easy because
no one speaks English.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.310
He's asked me where I
bought my translator.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.200
Every decent journalist
brings a translator.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.430
I've just taken
whatever lead I've got,

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.060
and I've arrived hoping
someone would speak English.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.430
And when he says,
where's your translator?

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.934
I lie like a child, and I go,
sorry, I thought you had one.

00:28:03.934 --> 00:28:05.600
Like, you know, it's
like the kid, who's

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.380
meant to have done his
homework, and the teacher goes,

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.400
where's your homework?

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.290
And the kid's showing
him a blank page going,

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.880
but it was there, sir!

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.010
Anyway, we managed to
get someone to turn up,

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.630
but I spend hours in
a room with Hotari

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.720
and a guy with a scar from
here right across here--

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.294
not an injury that's done
in a domestic accident

00:28:24.294 --> 00:28:25.710
in any way, and
not something that

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.540
makes me feel very at home.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.332
And in the middle of the
time when we're just waiting,

00:28:30.332 --> 00:28:32.790
I suddenly think, oh, my god,
I've got to turn off the Find

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:37.920
my iPad app on my iPad in case
the Israeli secret services

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.070
send a drone to get
revenge on these people.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.180
I don't know what's
going on here.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.690
And then at one
point, the door opens.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.940
And there are women in the
kitchen who never come out.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.460
And a little toddler comes out.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.210
And the toddler's
really making everything

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.957
feel better, taking all
my dirty laundry out,

00:28:53.957 --> 00:28:55.665
which is really
embarrassing because it's

00:28:55.665 --> 00:28:57.780
a super clean culture.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.270
Everyone's really nice--

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.450
And then I go [LAUGHS].

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.511
I want to show what
a nice guy I am.

00:29:02.511 --> 00:29:03.010
Oh, yeah.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.290
What's his name?

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.420
And Hotari goes, Osama.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.034
And I say, oh,
that's really funny.

00:29:08.034 --> 00:29:09.700
I think he's making
a joke or something.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.260
He's going, no,
that is his name.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.380
It's not a joke at all.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.980
But actually, as
time goes on, we

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.290
end up having a really
good communication.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.140
And I find two
important things out.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.190
One, his son was
not particularly

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.550
religiously committed.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.780
Two, he was also--

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.800
his father complained about
the fact that he was in no way

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.380
interested in the struggle.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.270
He wasn't even
interested, his father

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.840
said, in Palestinian liberation.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.730
So I said, so what
actually is causing this?

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.810
Well, it's another
whole long story

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.640
what the cause is and longer
than I can go into here.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.110
But what was true for sure
is that the picture of him

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:56.850
was not accurate--

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.800
that we had received
in the press-- be it,

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.850
"The Washington Post," "The
New York Times," "The BBC."

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:06.030
We were given an incorrect
thing because it's too difficult

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.056
what the reality is.

00:30:07.056 --> 00:30:09.180
And I'm not going to go
into the reality right now,

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.930
but we could, in questions,
if you wanted to.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.310
The second thing that I
really wanted to go into,

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.060
that I really needed to know--

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.160
I was obsessed with
speaking to the guy who

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:24.860
had received the Palestinian
heart, Yitzhak Cohen.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.806
Every time I tried
to find him, no one

00:30:26.806 --> 00:30:27.930
could tell me where he was.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.810
And normally things
were available.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.810
And then when I spoke to the
surgeon again, and said, look,

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.310
I really want to
find Cohen, he said

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.018
he doesn't want to
speak about it at all.

00:30:36.018 --> 00:30:38.480
He's just trying to lead
his life and get on with it.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.760
And I said, but maybe you
could call him up for me.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.650
And he's going, no, he
doesn't want to speak.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.715
And then I pulled
my parent card out.

00:30:45.715 --> 00:30:47.340
I was, by the way,
my mom is so-and-so,

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.140
and my dad is so-and-so.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.973
And he goes, really,
the cardiologist there?

00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:51.830
[MUMBLING] I was
going, please call.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:54.219
All he can say is he can say no.

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:55.760
And he goes, he's
not going to do it.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.390
And I said, Yaacov, you
put the heart in his chest.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.140
He's going to do
whatever you ask him.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:03.980
And he did.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.610
He said, fine.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:05.110
Go on.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.850
And so, I was on my
way to go and see

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:09.770
Cohen, this man who had
the Palestinian heart.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.830
And I suppose it was sort
of romantic and hippy-dippy

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:13.630
because--

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:14.420
I don't know--

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.880
I've looked at a lot of
heart transplant stories.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.600
And I've also been at
a heart transplant.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.780
And there's a lot of
chat about organ memory.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.720
Are you familiar with this?

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.030
The idea that when you
transplant an organ,

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.860
its memories come with it.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:32.170
And there was a
man in the US who

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.580
is 57 years old,
blue collar worker,

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.710
from a completely white area.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.260
He knew that he'd
received the heart

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.720
of a young African-American
guy who had

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.940
been killed in a gang shootout.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.470
That's what he knew.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.840
But when he got the
heart, he suddenly

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.670
became obsessed with
classical music.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.450
He became utterly obsessed
with classical music.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.720
How was he to know that the
young African-American guy was

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.110
a violinist on his way
to violin practice, who

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:03.500
gets shot by a random
bullet from some maniacs

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.687
200 yards down the road?

00:32:04.687 --> 00:32:06.770
Those sorts of things--
and there's lots of them--

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.230
made me think about
organ memory maybe being

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:13.050
truer than you might expect.

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.010
But then I also met [INAUDIBLE],,
one of the great heart surgeon

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.510
surgeons.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.690
He said it's total rubbish.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.790
He said after a
heart transplant,

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.400
you get very strong
immunosuppressant drugs.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.400
They have a
psychotropic side effect

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.290
that changes your personality.

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.540
But then I asked a woman
called Susan Vosloo.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.290
She's probably done more heart
transplants than [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:34.610
And she said, oh, I don't know.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.560
I believe it a bit.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.160
And she told me this story
about a patient of hers

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.340
who was an incredibly shy girl
who received the heart she

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.350
didn't know of a model.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.300
And she said afterwards
she would walk around

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.950
like she was beautiful.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:51.080
And she said, look, I saw
that with my own eyes.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.580
And then her husband, who was
in the background, [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:58.970
says, yeah, but Susan, you read
the astrology charts, yeah?

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:02.940
So what I mean is there's
no way of knowing,

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.600
but I was filled with, like,
a sense of what would happen.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.616
And when I-- I'm going to
have to wrap up quickly.

00:33:10.616 --> 00:33:12.740
I've got another 20 minutes
to go, but we kind of--

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.740
when I did see him,
he played super

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.180
nice about how wonderful it is.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.190
I have the heart of
a Palestinian in me,

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.726
and it's all great and lovely.

00:33:20.726 --> 00:33:22.100
And everything's
lovely, and he's

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:26.060
a really nice man but sick
and struggling with all that.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.440
And a classic Sabra, it's like
an Israeli word for someone--

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.430
Sabra is a fruit with a
hard outside, spiky outside,

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:34.750
and really soft inside.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.650
And that was what he
would totally direct.

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:38.691
But then at a certain
point I was about to leave,

00:33:38.691 --> 00:33:43.190
and he goes, so
who's hiring you?

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.970
Which paper?

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.260
I said, I'm not a
journalist-- no paper.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.126
What are you doing?

00:33:47.126 --> 00:33:48.500
I said, well, I'm
writing a book.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.370
So who is buying the book?

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:51.530
And I said, well, no one.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.370
And he goes, so it's a hobby.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:58.080
And it was too
close to the truth.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.540
It's like, oh no, I'm a writer.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.310
And I go, well no,
it's not a hobby, but--

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.390
No, it's a hobby.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.070
You get paid.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.650
It's real.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.510
You know, it's a hobby.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.310
And as soon as he
said this, he's

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.860
kind of let down his guard.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.290
And I really wished
I'd left before then

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:16.340
because at some point
he said to me, this guy,

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.580
I'm fine with the Palestinians
who are here, but most of them

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.920
just want to kill Jews.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.159
And I said, what?

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:26.980
The Arabs, they just
want to kill Jews.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.396
And the Palestinians
who are here,

00:34:28.396 --> 00:34:29.570
they're OK, but you know--

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.900
And I said, but you've got
a Palestinian heart beating

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.993
in your body.

00:34:32.993 --> 00:34:35.780
He's going, it's a pump.

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.010
They didn't know it
was going to a Jew.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.790
And I left.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.239
And it felt like my whole
world was falling apart.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.520
And when we get to
the happy event--

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.949
we don't have time for the
happy event unfortunately.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:50.840
I went and saw my mom.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.870
And my mom showed
me a photograph

00:34:53.870 --> 00:35:01.125
of a newspaper clipping of
her in 1967 as a cardiologist.

00:35:01.125 --> 00:35:02.000
And she's got a baby.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.600
And it says, first heart
transplant in Britain.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.100
And I was going, oh wow, is
that the baby who got the heart?

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.000
And she goes, no.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.159
I said, so what's
wrong with the baby?

00:35:10.159 --> 00:35:12.450
She said the baby eats too
much, generally very greedy.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:15.510
But the baby is you.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.290
I'm holding you outside
the first heart transplant.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:23.190
And this led me to
a whole other life

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.830
where I started looking at the
first heart transplant that

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:27.371
ever happened, that
I'm going to have

00:35:27.371 --> 00:35:31.080
to be very quick with, which
was in Apartheid, South Africa.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.770
Christiaan Barnard
transplanted a heart

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:38.730
into a woman called Denise
Darvall into a man called

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:39.870
Phil Washkansky.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.780
But what's less known
is that before that, he

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.990
was about to transplant a heart
from another man who was black.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.730
And the Apartheid authorities
said, no, you can't do this.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:54.770
Because Apartheid, or Apartheid,
what does it actually mean

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.100
is separateness.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.104
It was a legal
representation of racism.

00:36:00.104 --> 00:36:01.520
And in order for
it to exist there

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.020
had to be an absolute provable
difference between the races.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.890
And so he wasn't
allowed to do it.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:14.010
It's fine to do cross-gender,
not fine to cross race.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.640
But once he'd done that,
the first heart transplant,

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.830
he became the most
famous man in the world.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.290
And nothing could stop him.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.280
And so, his second transplant
was between a black man

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.690
and a white man.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:31.260
And suddenly, you had this
fellow, Phil Blaiberg,

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.270
with a black heart--

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.890
a heart from a black man.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.050
And for the first
time that heart

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.462
was allowed to sit on
a whites-only bench.

00:36:39.462 --> 00:36:41.920
For the first time, that heart
was allowed to go somewhere.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.950
And what does that really mean?

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.720
We're moving into the symbolic.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:52.140
There was a corrosive symbol of
the power of the ridiculousness

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.980
of any ideology,
especially Apartheid,

00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.270
that sought to show one race
was different from another

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.740
in such a way.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.800
And I suppose that
when it comes down

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.370
to it, what we're left with is
there are no easy solutions.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:11.910
The lovely graceful symbol,
that I had sort of fell apart

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.820
in some ways, but it
sort of sticks as well--

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.040
the act of mercy of
giving the heart--

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.080
the fact that the heart can
go from one to the other--

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.860
the fact that all these
divisions are created.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.559
They're not as
essential as that be--

00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:26.100
I'm going to have
to stop now in case

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.410
you're not going to
have time for questions.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.909
If there are no
questions, I could go on.

00:37:30.909 --> 00:37:32.700
SPEAKER: I'll ask the
first question or two

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.440
before we organize into
the audience questions.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.290
So you've described
your initial reaction

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:40.900
to seeing the reports
of the bombing

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:45.000
and your own background.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.060
When you decided that
you needed to know more

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.240
and to research this, what
was the reaction of, like,

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.457
your publicist or your family?

00:37:53.457 --> 00:37:54.790
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: My publisher--

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:57.720
I mean, my agent told me that
I shouldn't write that book

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.020
because it would have--

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.370
it wouldn't be
commercially viable.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:05.280
It was too difficult
and complicated an area.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.000
And the reality of trying
to publish this book--

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.810
it's not that easy to get a
book that's critical of Israel,

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:15.000
in any form, published
in the United States.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:26.060
The book, I sincerely hope it's
balanced, but it wasn't saying,

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.620
oh, this is a great
idea for your--

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.790
SPEAKER: OK, they
weren't very encouraging.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:30.790
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: And
reality's played that out.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.280
SPEAKER: Yeah, OK.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.250
You're described, in
some of your interviews,

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.830
as being maybe a little bit
naive when you're asking

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:39.360
certain questions of people.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.000
And as you've just
shared with our audience

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.290
you weren't particularly
politically knowledgeable.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.475
Do you think that
naivety served you?

00:38:49.475 --> 00:38:50.850
Maybe you wouldn't
have done this

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.726
if you hadn't felt
being like that?

00:38:52.726 --> 00:38:54.600
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: Well,
I don't think naivety

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.040
ever really serves you.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.320
I think that--

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.900
I thought I went with
no preconceptions.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.900
One of the things I realized
when I got to Israel

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.750
is that I was a little
bit anti-Israelic.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:08.520
I certainly have never
been anti-Semitic,

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.728
but I realized when I was
in Israel for a few weeks--

00:39:10.728 --> 00:39:11.730
like, hold on a minute.

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.850
And if you are anti-Israeli,
you're against that kid over

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.230
there and that
grandma over there,

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:18.730
and it's no better than--

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.900
it's no more acceptable
than being anti-Irish.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.290
And so then-- because we
hear so many critical things,

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:26.490
and it doesn't help anyone.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.270
There isn't a single
Palestinian, who is wise,

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.810
who wants you to
be anti-Israelic.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.810
SPEAKER: OK, so you became
aware of your biases?

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:36.284
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: I became
aware of my own rubbish.

00:39:36.284 --> 00:39:37.075
SPEAKER: All right.

00:39:37.075 --> 00:39:37.574
Good.

00:39:37.574 --> 00:39:40.090
So I'll ask one more question
before we go to the audience.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:41.722
And if you do have
a question, hang on

00:39:41.722 --> 00:39:43.180
till we've got a
microphone to you.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.560
You've got my one or
one over here, I think.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.690
So the opening
chapter of "Beats,"

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.530
that you described
in lots of detail,

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:58.330
the teenagers and the young
security guard that are there--

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.540
how much of what
you share with us

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.230
is based on interviews with
their family or their surviving

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:08.127
friends, and how much of it
is your imagination-- like,

00:40:08.127 --> 00:40:09.960
the point of view that
you share that they--

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.939
their point of view?

00:40:10.939 --> 00:40:12.980
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: The
opening chapter of the book

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.260
was the hardest one to
research because this

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.900
describes the teenagers
just before the bomb.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.710
And what I did do was make sure
that nothing I said-- if they

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.710
were having a conversation
about something,

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.210
it was because
someone had told me

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:27.555
they'd been talking about that.

00:40:27.555 --> 00:40:29.180
Where I mentioned
that someone had just

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.210
had an argument with her
dad about her hot pants,

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.830
it's because that happened.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:35.311
Even the fluorescent colored--

00:40:35.311 --> 00:40:37.310
SPEAKER: The nail varnish
that the grandmother--

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.540
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: --the
dreams, everything,

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.700
because for me that
part of the chapter

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.650
was the most important
because I wanted

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:44.960
it to be a memorial
to these people,

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.290
not as victims but as the
young humans that they

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:50.300
were, with their
life stolen off them.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.430
And I still, to this
day, can't talk about it

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.220
without almost
crying because I've

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.070
got so close to them, and their
families, and all those people.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.570
And it's worth
saying one thing that

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:01.010
isn't part of your question.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:05.180
The aim of this bomb was to make
all those former Soviet Union

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.967
people feel that they
weren't welcome in Israel--

00:41:07.967 --> 00:41:09.050
that this wasn't for them.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.210
Actually what it did
was it wedded them

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.220
to the country in a
much stronger way,

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.190
and it helped create
the war that we see now.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:18.400
It wasn't useful.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.480
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.150
Have we any questions?

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:25.070
Oh, the front row, we
have our first question.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:25.660
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.659
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: Hello.

00:41:26.659 --> 00:41:29.640
AUDIENCE: And thank you for
the talk-- really interesting.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.750
So my question was actually
about the way things

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.800
are portrayed in journalism.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.240
So you said that the way the
suicide bomber was written

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.800
about in the media
was not really

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.450
an accurate picture of reality.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:45.311
And I mean, I find that as
well when we read in the news

00:41:45.311 --> 00:41:47.810
that sometimes you're not really
sure what to really believe

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.547
and what frame they are
putting it out there.

00:41:50.547 --> 00:41:52.130
What do you think
about that when you,

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.921
as a writer who are
looking for the truth--

00:41:53.921 --> 00:41:56.510
when you are reading news
stories about other attacks

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:59.660
or events, do you have any
pre-bias in terms of the truth

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.829
to it?

00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:02.870
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: Of course
we all have pre-bias,

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.809
and what we have to do
is try, and analyze,

00:42:04.809 --> 00:42:05.850
and be honest about that.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.266
There's no getting
away from that.

00:42:07.266 --> 00:42:10.010
But in terms of, for
instance, the way--

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.965
the idea-- one of the
big ideas was that--

00:42:12.965 --> 00:42:15.560
was this whole thing
of the virgins.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.790
And for me, encoded in that,
was an implicitly racist idea

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:26.150
of the Arab "other," this
kind of sexual deviant type

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.710
thing, which is very--

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:30.650
because when you create
that kind of image that

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.140
is dehumanizing, I
mean think of the kind

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:38.570
of Nazi anti-Semitic picture of
the kind of terrible old Jew.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.860
It's all to make it--
take away humanity,

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:45.170
so that you don't deal
with the real situations.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:48.320
It's a real foe
against understanding,

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.280
all those things.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.875
Now that doesn't mean that
there isn't any basis to loads

00:42:53.875 --> 00:42:56.450
of those things, and
especially as ISIS has shown,

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:59.990
there's lots of people
who do believe, you know,

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:01.420
in the whole thing.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.760
But it's just the
way things are used,

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.120
it's very, very unhelpful.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.790
And we need to get
closer to the situation--

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:09.290
not deal with these caricatures.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.285
Does that answer
your question at all?

00:43:11.285 --> 00:43:13.179
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:13.179 --> 00:43:14.470
SPEAKER: Yeah, lovely question.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.027
Do we have-- got one over here?

00:43:16.027 --> 00:43:16.610
Thanks, Marie.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:17.040
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: Oh, sorry.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.410
There's two.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:18.409
Can I come to you after?

00:43:22.074 --> 00:43:23.240
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.330
I'm very curious
about when you went

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:27.035
to meet the bomber's
father, and he

00:43:27.035 --> 00:43:28.660
said that he was
talking about his son.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.650
And he said that his son is
A, not very political and B,

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:32.650
not even very religious.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.730
And he said that there was
a long story behind it,

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:36.730
and maybe you can discuss
that in the questions.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.160
Can you talk more about
this particular interaction?

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.570
How did the father
see the situation?

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.090
How did he feel?

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:45.010
How did you feel?

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:48.130
ROWAN SOMERVILLE:
The father was trying

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.080
to be, as well, the political--

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.350
there's a tremendous
thing about being--

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.180
when there's absolutely
nothing, to be

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.470
a relation of the
Shahid, the martyr,

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.175
is something that
gives you status,

00:43:59.175 --> 00:44:00.550
and there's certain
things that--

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:04.240
and he was pretending to be
that person, or that persona,

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.230
for a while.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:09.190
But then as time passed, he
was actually a grieving parent.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.580
He had no idea, I believe.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.460
[INAUDIBLE] he wasn't
in the country.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.790
He had no idea that his
son was going to do that,

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:20.540
and he would have thrown himself
in front of a bus to stop it.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.400
And in fact, the hardest
moment of questioning

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.310
happened when I saw him as a
grieving parent, and he was--

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.910
had tears in his eyes,
and I asked him, cruelly

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:34.270
actually, because I thought
I had a responsibility

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:36.410
to the parents of the victims--

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.940
I said, you feel so much
pain for your son's loss.

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.460
Do you ever think of
the mothers and fathers

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.440
of the people he's
killed because they

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.480
feel the same pain as you?

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.080
And he went mental.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:52.120
And I was going to
have to kind of run.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.200
And what was I doing?

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.520
I was like a teenager
kicking at a scar.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.620
It didn't help anything.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.440
It was ill-placed.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.430
What had happened?

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:02.430
Now I'm not answering
your question, I'm afraid,

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.470
and that is, how did he become
a suicide bomber, really?

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:09.070
It's the most dangerous
question I could ask there,

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:12.946
and every time I did things
got really dangerous-- and even

00:45:12.946 --> 00:45:15.070
to the point that I had to
get sort of smuggled out

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:18.010
of Qalqilya by someone because
I was asking that question,

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:19.510
and I wanted to know.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:24.160
My opinion, not based on
fact, is that what happens

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.340
is that there are
professionals who

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.290
look for certain
sorts of people who

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:33.070
are vulnerable and available
and angry and desperate.

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:36.550
And they make out
of them a weapon

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.890
because they don't have
sophisticated missiles.

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:43.390
They have burning kites, but
what they do have access to

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:45.490
is the most sophisticated
guidance system

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.830
in existence, the human brain.

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.180
And what they do is make
a weapon out of that.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.375
That's my belief.

00:45:51.375 --> 00:45:52.611
SPEAKER: Hey, thanks Rowan.

00:45:52.611 --> 00:45:53.110
Thank you.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:54.193
That was a great question.

00:45:54.193 --> 00:45:56.900
We're out of time unfortunately.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.200
So just to close, what is--

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.310
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: Sorry.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:00.940
SPEAKER: What's a common--

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.731
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: She
gave up her question.

00:46:02.731 --> 00:46:05.530
SPEAKER: Well, we
can ask afterwards.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:06.540
What's next for you?

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.640
Are you researching something
else, at the moment?

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.015
When can we invite
you back again

00:46:10.015 --> 00:46:11.320
to hear about your next book?

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.990
ROWAN SOMERVILLE: I'm very
interested in religion.

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:16.894
I've been looking
at Scientology.

00:46:16.894 --> 00:46:19.060
I've been looking at lots
of different of religions.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.000
I was very much educated
a strict Roman Catholic.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.890
I was brought up by Jesuits.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:27.970
I believe that most religions
are entirely invented.

00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:37.450
I want to examine this not
as a skeptic, not as a cynic.

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:41.470
And I want to write a
novel about a religion that

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:45.469
really works, one that really
does give you enlightenment.

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:46.260
SPEAKER: OK, great.

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.860
I look forward to reading it.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.660
Thank you again for coming in
to talk with us today, Rowan.

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.243
ROWAN SOMERVILLE:
Thank you very much.

00:46:51.243 --> 00:46:52.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.210
Thank you.
