00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:06.773
Hey, you busy?

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:08.642
Oh no, I'm
just browsing new sources.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.477
Come in, come in, bitch,
what's up?

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:14.515
Well, you know I'm just getting
over breast cancer, right?

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:16.049
I know, I know.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.184
God.

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.553
Your cancer is like, all
I think about.

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:20.587
Really?

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.322
Pretty much.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.958
I bet you don't think about it
as much as I think about it.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.694
Well, I think about
it more than you'd think.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.730
Well, good, then
you'll probably be excited

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.566
about the reason for
my visit.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.569
There's a 5K breast cancer
run in a few weeks

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:37.304
and I'm trying to
get people--

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.174
Stop immediately.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:41.208
Sold.

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:42.009
Of course, I'm in.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.410
What's the maximum pledge?

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.212
50, 100, what?

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.114
There's actually
not a maximum pledge.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:49.550
Okay, okay, 25.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.819
That's really generous
of you--
Oh, it's nothing.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.056
But I was wanting to see if
you would be willing

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:59.026
to run it with me.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:00.060
Run--

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.461
Like, how
do you mean?

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:03.063
You know, I mean, you're
a thing.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.265
People would be excited
to pay money for you to run.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:09.870
Yeah, I don't know that I'm
a thing, you know.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.639
I mean, I do get recognized
a lot, but--

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:13.807
I mean, I don't know.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.075
Are other people from the
office, like,

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:17.077
physically
running this thing?

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:18.612
Yes.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:20.247
Like who?

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:21.548
Gabe.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.349
Gay.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:23.817
Grace.
Lonely!

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:24.885
Kurt.

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:26.086
Oh, God,
he was raised by people

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.387
that weren't his biological
parents.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.388
Okay, okay.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:29.389
That's awesome.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.491
The office is represented,
all right?

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.427
The problem is
with me, I can't.

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:36.763
I can't run, because I bulk
up super fast.

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:38.198
Just like thunder thighs.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.733
It's so embarrassing.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.569
Just, God, I really trust you,
that's why I'm telling you.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:46.607
Amy, the reason to run is to
help raise awareness.

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:48.141
Awareness for what?

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:49.877
C-Cancer?

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:52.246
Like, I think
people have gotten the memo.

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:53.614
Yeah, I got the memo,

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:56.783
that's why
I had a double mastectomy.

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:01.388
When is it again?

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.356
Next Saturday.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:03.423
Oh, balls!

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:04.758
You said Saturday, right?

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:07.628
Oh, I can't, that is so--
God, timing.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.663
I have a
Kentucky Derby party that day,

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:11.365
and trust me, I would love
to cancel

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.400
but I
already bought a hat.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.202
And those are only hats that
you would wear at,

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:16.737
like, you know--

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:19.406
They're not,
like, all-purpose hats, so.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.375
Mmm.

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.744
( phone ringing )
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:25.746
Hi, this is Amy.

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:29.550
Oh, hi Jeff Probst.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.151
Yeah, definitely,
Saturday?

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.620
Yes, I'll be there,
of course I'll be there.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.756
Can I wear a hat?

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:37.891
Jeff?

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.626
Okay, you already know
who that was.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:40.994
Jeff Probst.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.629
So this is
totally gonna cheer you up.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.698
Okay, so Saturday, P. Diddy
is having, like,

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:48.635
a dance-a-thon to
raise money for chinchillas.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:52.339
So they can be used in
coats again.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.174
Oh, God.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.375
But look, I'm so sorry.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:56.777
Is there anything else I can
do for you?

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:58.111
Like, anything else?

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.247
I'm sorry that
my calendar is so booked.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.782
Actually, yeah.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:04.551
A bunch of friends were gonna
shave their heads

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:07.054
for when I
go through chemo.

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:10.123
So...

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:11.391
Okay.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:12.492
That's great.

00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:13.861
I can't
do that, obviously,

00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.063
'cause a lot of people's jobs
are dependent on me

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:20.834
just kind of
keeping this look, you know?

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.803
But I'll tell you what
I will do.

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:28.509
I will continue to
get rid of all of my pubes.

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:29.643
Mmm.

00:03:29.743 --> 00:03:30.811
( phone ringing )

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.413
This is Amy.

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:36.316
Hi, Nick Cannon.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.685
I actually know Nick, tell
him I said hi.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:41.922
Oh Nick,
Tig says hi.

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.423
Yeah, oh my God,
of course,

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:45.626
of course
I'm doing her 5K, yeah.
