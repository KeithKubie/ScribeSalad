00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And these are the numbers you get.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Interestingly enough, these both correspond to a difference of exactly 15% from this number.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's not a coincidence.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It has to do with the fact that d shows up here in the numerator and there's no exponent on d.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well, there's a little 1 hidden there, but we don't need to write that.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is getting into some serious error analysis,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which is a really fascinating topic and requires a little bit of calculus to get into,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but in future classes you can learn about this in more detail.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
For now, it's enough to know that our 15% error in distance measurement

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
corresponds to a 15% error in circumference calculation.
