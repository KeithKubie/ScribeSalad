00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.890
Okay, how did you do? Spectacularly well, I hope. let's

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.740
go over the solution. Okay, so my solution looks something

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.950
like this. First we have an ordered list at the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.560
top and bottom. You know? Opening and closing. And then

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.490
we have a for loop for going over the range from 1 to n plus 1 and then we say,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.630
basically, if x is divisible, and we can use the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.440
mod operator to determine if something is divisible. Mod basically

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.120
says, it gives you, it gives you the remember. So, x

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.760
is divided by 15, what is the remainder. If that, If

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.670
that's zero that means x is divisible by both 3 and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.910
5 we print FizzBuzz. If it's divisible by 3 we print Fizz,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.740
if it's divisible by 5 we print Buzz, else we just

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.920
print x. And we have our end if and our end for.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.930
Okay, not too bad huh? Now there's lots of ways of,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.560
you know, if you want to minimize the logic done here but

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.340
that's not really what I'm trying to look for right here. I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.760
just want to see if you can actually use your for statements

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.730
and your if statements and your

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.510
variable substitution. And your variable substitution

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.690
to make a quick little template. So if you got that, nicely done.
