00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.570
Let's now talk about internet routing security or problems involving

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.285
securing the internet's routing protocol. We will primarily focus on

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:15.220
inter-domain routing or the security of BGP. We will

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.290
further focus on control plane security. Which typically involves

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.400
authentication of the messages being advertised by the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.230
routing protocol. In particular, the goal of

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.259
control plane security, or control plane authentication

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.820
is to determine the veracity of routing

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.000
advertisements. There are various aspects of the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.120
routing protocol that we seek to verify.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.915
One, is session authentication, which protects the

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:47.280
point-to-point communication between routers. A second type

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.720
of control plane authen, authentication is path authentication,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.620
which protects the AS path, and sometimes other attributes. Another type

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.640
of authentication is origin authentication. Which protects the origin

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.120
AS in the AS path; effectively guaranteeing that the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.330
origin AS that advertises a prefix is, in fact, the owner of that prefix.
