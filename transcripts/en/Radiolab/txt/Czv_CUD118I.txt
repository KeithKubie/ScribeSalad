Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio fromW and y. S e n n p r phone. Oh, you know what, will you forgive me if I actually leave my phone on vibrate because, uh, my wife is pregnant and due literally really any day. No kidding. If this vibrates, I might ruin your radio program, but no, it's fine. It's all worse. So recently I had a conversation with this Guy Josh for, he's a journalist science journalist and he told me about something that's been obsessing him recently. This very odd experiment. Well, okay, so this is uh, one of the longest running science experiments of all time. The pitch drop experiment. You can actually see it online. How do I get to it? I had just started her pitch drop, pitch drop. So a, you can also go radiolab.org we have got the live feed, uh, right there on the website and what you will see is this funnel list of black stuff in it.

Speaker 1:          00:58          And then, uh, descending from the stem of the funnel is this little tendrils of this black stuff. And at the end of that tendril as a little teardrop of this black stuff that's, it doesn't move, do anything. But according to Josh, sure. Pitch drop junkies all over the world. People who are just, I've got this open in the background on their, on their web browser and he says they all just sit there watching and waiting. And that's the thing. Once you understand what's going on here, you kind of can't look away. Okay. So here's what happened in 1927 there is this guy, Thomas Cornell who is teaching physics at the University of Queensland and in Australia and he's trying to show his students that, um, well I guess that things aren't always what they seem. Okay. Uh, and so he takes a chunk of this material and called pitch.

Speaker 1:          01:48          What's pitch? Okay, so pitch is a natural substance. In fact, this is actually really the question. What is pitch? Well, what does it look like? It's like, is it gooey? No, that's the thing. It's like a rock. You can break it with a hammer and it shatters into a million little pieces, but it's not a rock. It's a viscoelastic polymer fisco elastic polymer, which means that over many, many, many, many years, it moves really the, what he did was he melted a handful of pitch and poured it into a glass funnel and once it did properly settled, he snipped the bottom of the funnel and waited for what? Well, for it to drip.

Speaker 1:          02:32          You mean drip like a faucet would drip? Yeah, but much, much more slowly. So 1930 Pluto is discovered. Bonnie and Clyde mean phone love going to crimes where you get killed by the police. 31 the empire state building is finished. It'll drip. 1933 the Nazis build their first concentration camp prohibition and still hasn't driven five Amelia Earhart fly solo across the Pacific Ocean. Are you kidding? No drip. 1936 5 million barrels of cement turning to the Hoover dam. No drift for eight years. This rock is slowly, slowly, slowly stretching. He's into this dangling drop and then suddenly one day, eight years after he poured the damn thing into the funnel and the 10th of a second, the blink of an eye.

Speaker 2:          03:15          Oh, the pitch breaks.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Nobody's ever actually seen this happen. I mean it's never, there's drop has never dripped. No, no. The drop is gripped eight times and we're all due for the ninth drop to happen any day now. So wait, why haven't they seen it? So imagine a a science experiment, right? Where the critical data that you want to gather happens in one 10th of a second every 10 to 12 years. It is really hard to be there at that critical moment. Yes. Yeah. This fellow professor John Mains, then he's been watching it religiously since January of 1961 for 50 years. I am still waiting to see miss pitch drop just at a suspense or is there some question here? Well first of all, well, okay, the question is moment when you this ever elongating droplet gives way. What happened if you've got the drop itself hilled by four little fibers, call them fibers.

Speaker 1:          04:19          What breaks first? How does it break? And there are lots of people who like me, are waiting to see whether we can capture that moment and see the way in which from a mechanical point of view it becomes imperative that the dropped in fall, so 1962 mainstay and Mr. Drop in 62 August, 1971 April of 1979 tat one he looked at on a Friday. I knew it was close and thought, well something might happen over the weekend. Came in on a Saturday, Saturday evening, checked to pitch job, nothing happening. I'm going home and by the time I came in very early on the Monday morning, not having gone in on Sunday, it had fallen. Then 1988 he standing right there and I decided I need to cover teams. Something like that. Walked away, came back, oh no. And low and behold he thinks he may have missed it by as little as 15 minutes had dropped.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Now you take your tee and throw it against the wall and rage. Yes. Well, yes. One becomes a bit philosophical about this and I just, oh well let, let's be patient the next time he installed the camera and, and then, and then 28 November, 2000 is what happened. Then the time I was over on the other side of the world in London gets an email saying, professor this [inaudible] drop looking as though it might fall in time. We've been waiting 10 years for this. It's about to happen. Cause it was like I said, don't worry, we've got it covered. Got a camera on it. I'll be able to see exactly what happened when I get back to Australia. The next email said, well it's dropped.

Speaker 3:          06:00          Wow.

Speaker 1:          06:01          Later that day, do you professor mains then I've got bad news. Unfortunately you will not be able to see this because the system failed. The camera went out, the camera went out. We don't have this on record. Come on. So that was one of my satisfied, I might say. Uh, but right now the pitch is getting ready to give birth to another drop. And this time there are three cameras, three webcams on there. And this is what Josh was showing me on the Internet. This ling little almost that all is people are watching people from China, South America. You knew what people were helping the north of Canada. Everybody's waiting. Everybody wants to be the person who sees the pitch fo

Speaker 1:          06:48          and got to admit, I've been checking this thing online. Like were you like watching grass grow? I don't know. It's, I think it's more than suspect. I think that this is, it's about timescale is what it's about. We don't really have that many opportunities to interact with things that happen on these two very, very different timescales simultaneously. Huh? Do you see what he means? Yeah. Cause you know you're in this funny situation. You wait slower than you know how for something to take place that's faster than you can, you know, catch. Exactly. So you're playing at the very edges of what you know how to do, but not if you catch it, then you get this glimpse into this world that's usually unknowable. Exactly.

Speaker 4:          07:38          So for the next hour, we're going to mess around with this idea because you know, we're humans and we live in a human scale, but we've got a bunch of stories that are gonna ask us to stretch

Speaker 1:          07:46          that scale to the breaking point. Yeah, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich today on radio lab

Speaker 5:          07:53          speed wait, things keep getting faster and then faster again and then faster and faster, faster, faster and faster and faster and faster and path until we get to the fastest thing in the universe and stop

Speaker 4:          08:05          bit cold. But before we do that, quick update, some happy news and a bit of sad news about that pitch drop experiment. First up, the drop finally dripped and it was caught on camera this time. And you can uh, watch that moment in time lapse@radiolab.org. Now the sad news, uh, professor mainstone missed it again after 52 years of watching over that tar field beaker waiting, he died without ever actually seeing a drop fall. But on the bright side, I guess the experiment is still going. The 10th drop is expected to fall sometime in the next 14.

Speaker 6:          08:49          So in honor of him, keep an eye on that live feed and a few supervision. You might just, you,

Speaker 7:          08:57          okay. So let's set the baselines here. How fast are our we, you mean like how fast we run? I mean, how fast do we interact with the world around us? Uh, how fast do we taste things? How fast do we feel something? See something. Respond. Hello? Oh, hello. Hey there. Hey, how do we sound? That sounds better. Much better. Excellent. That's Carl Zimmer of course, science writer regular around here. And he told us that question you just asked. How fast do people, humans processed the world? That question popped up in a really big way around 1850 with the invention of the telegraph because suddenly you could send a message across the country almost instantly. If you're in New York and you want to send a message to Chicago, money stopped. It's gonna take about a quarter of a second for that message to get there.

Speaker 7:          09:49          That's 790 miles in a quarter. Second. Now that's really fast. In fact, if you do the math, 790 times, four times 60 times 60 it's 11 million miles an hour. That's amazingly fast. So fast. In fact that some people when they first used the telegraph, they just refuse to believe that it was real. Cause in 1850 you're doing oh 35 40 miles an hour on a horse. 60 maybe on a steam engine up to 80 you're not living too fast. But more importantly for our story, the Telegraph got people thinking about us, about our bodies, right? Cause you know nerves and telegraph wires are remarkably similar. Nerves are long and skinny. They carry electricity from one place to another, just like a telegraph wires. So naturally people wanted to know, well if telegraph wires can do millions of miles an hour, well what about our nerves? How fast are they?

Speaker 7:          10:40          Exactly. And so one day a German guy biologist named Herman von Helmholtz took a frog cause their neurons are kind of like ours. And basically what he did was he, he hooked some wires up to one of the frogs muscles. Now, this was, I should tell you a dead frog, but he sent an electrical jolt through the muscle and then using a very fancy timer, he was able to determine, yeah, the signal was going down the length of the a frog muscle at a speed of 27 meters per second. What does that in miles per hour per se. Um, let's see. I can, uh, Google, actually it's, I love Google. Um, 27 meters per second is 60.3, nine, seven three miles per hour. 16.3 miles per hour. Wait, this is a frog. Is this the same speed? Not Yes. 60 miles an hour. That seems so slow.

Speaker 7:          11:31          Yeah. What's the name of the Jamaican runner? The fastest guy in the world. Hussein bolt. Usain bolt. So it was saying bolt is running at half the speed of his nervous system. Okay. But, but, but in bear mind actually, I mean, uh, there's a big range of speeds of your neurons and actually Hussein bald is much faster than some of your neurons. I mean, there are some neurons that only go about a mile an hour. Which ones are those? Ironically, some of them are from the reward centers of your brain. Chocolate travels slowly. Yeah, relatively slowly. What about pain? I mean, that would, that would be fast. I imagined. Yeah, you'd think so. But pain actually runs kind of slowly. I was surprised to learn. He says it can be as slow as 1.3 miles an hour. Wait a second. So if I put my hand near a candle and then I go, ouch. Shouldn't that happen very fast? Look, I mean, if you were like 70 miles tall, this might be a problem. Okay. But still, I mean, what if we just take a really ordinary example like Robert Looking at the desk in front of him and grabbing that pen? What's involved? Yeah. Well, I mean you just essentially need to kind of walk through this brain. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          12:39          you start at the I. Okay. So, uh, the eye takes the light that's reflected off the [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          12:45          Penn turns it into a little electrical signal and then sends that deep into the middle of the brain, takes a couple of hundred 72nd bounces around for a bit and then within few more, hundreds of a second. The signal has made it all the way back to the rear end of the brain where you start processing vision. But this is just the beginning right now. You've got to like figure out what you're seeing. So our joke is off again this time toward the middle of the brain and then down toward the bottom to these other regions that start to decode the signal, the first visual regions called v one next up, v two before and so on, and they're going to sharpen the image, make out contrast edges, and then the electricity goes back towards the front of the brain after, let's see, another 10th of a second or so. We finally get to a place where we think,

Speaker 9:          13:36          oh, that's a pen we haven't gotten you to. I want it exactly

Speaker 8:          13:42          for that to happen, the electricity has to jump from one part of the front of the brain to another. And another before you can finally say, that's a nice pen. I could use a pen and we're still not done, you know, then you then then little jolt heads nor to sort of the top of your brain. So we've, we've gone from the your eyes to the back of your brain around up to the front of your brain again. And now we're up to the top of your head where you set up motor commands and then you can grab the pen. Christ. So I mean

Speaker 7:          14:17          you add all this up and what are we talking about here? About a quarter of a second quarter of a say feels like one month later, rubber town begin slowly to move toward. The object is design quarter of a size. So that's the same amount of time. It takes a telegraph to send a message from New York to Chicago. Yeah. So your eyes, your hand, New York, Chicago. Oh Man. The sad truth has Carl, is that our neurons, when it comes to communicating and, and sending signals on your answer, they're terrible actually. I mean, compared to our, you know, broadband networks, particularly when one neuron bumps into the next one, there's actually a little space between them. So the signal to get across, it's got jump and then jump to the next one and jump and then jumped. It's Kinda like doing hurdles. It's not smooth. And the spooky part about this slowness says, Carl, the deeper thought here is that if you think about it, because we have this built in delay in processing the outside world,

Speaker 8:          15:17          everything that I'm experiencing already happened.

Speaker 3:          15:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          15:24          you know how like you look out at the stars and you think, oh, that light's been traveling for thousands, millions of years to get to me. And what's happening on that star to the planet around that star right now does even still exist.

Speaker 10:         15:36          Um, you can say that about everything around you because I mean by the time that you become aware of something in front of you, it's been sitting there for awhile, relatively speaking. I'm stuck in the past, but it's, it sounds like if you want to be in the moment, then what you do is you stare up at the sun and you let the light just be light entering your eyes and you don't think anything about the light. You don't try and comprehend the light. You just let the light be light. And that's as close as you're going to get to now. Yeah. Well you're looking at old light. Uh, but

Speaker 7:          16:14          yeah, it's eight minutes.

Speaker 8:          16:18          Like even if you switch, you know, even if you switch on the light and you're looking at the light bulb across the room, it's old light because it had to go from your eyes, through your brain to you to be aware that there was light there. So what I would suggest is that you close your eyes and you stop thinking about, you know, the chair you're sitting in and just focus on your own thoughts because that's the fastest stuff you've got to, it's right there. You don't have to wait for it to be deliberate into your brain. It's already in your brain. So I think your thoughts are the fastest things that you can experience. So my fastest thought that I can ever have is okay,

Speaker 7:          16:52          where I'm my key. You've got to have faster thoughts than that with the faster one. This is an interesting question though. I think it would be non narrative. I don't think it can be a keys or something. I think it would just be like a, ah, someone has thought about this. What? It wasn't me because I had no idea. Don't you think somebody has an answer for us on this? Uh, hello. Hello. Hello. In fact, we found a guy, his name is Seth Horowitz. I am the a, he's a neuroscientist, author of the Universal Sense. How hearing shapes the mind. So we were talking, uh, with, and we ran set through the question, you know, if we're all trapped in the past by the slowness of our nervous system, what would be the most present the most in the now that we could be? Well, if you are any actually disagreed with Carl's gas.

Speaker 7:          17:36          He said, even if you think the simplest thought that it is possible to think it's probably still going to be on the order of a quarter of a second half second. Oh Man. You have to get away from the conscious brain. No thinking, no seeing hearing is the fastest sense because mechanical, it normally operates on the millisecond range. Thousandth of a second, a sudden loud noise activates a very specialized circuit from your ear to your spinal neurons. You mean and bypasses the brain? Yeah, it's the startle circuit. If you suddenly hear a loud noise within 50 milliseconds, 50 thousands of a second, so you talking 20 times faster than cognition, your body jumps. We'll begin the release of adrenaline. No consciousness involved. It's five neurons and it takes 50 milliseconds, 50 milliseconds. So you're already getting into a faster, much faster paradigm by using sound. So if we're going to jilt ourselves as close to the president as possible, then we'd have to play a really loud noise, right? Like,

Speaker 3:          18:37          okay,

Speaker 7:          18:38          wait for it.

Speaker 7:          18:42          This. I know. That was annoying. I'm no, I know. But look, thing we do, we just did together. We were all in the moment, in the present tense together. Not Quite, not as we now understand that we were just shy just to, it's he bits shy of the moment time. If I spoke fast enough for me to say thank you to Carl Zimmer, they could have said hardwoods and now I've got to break. There's no way you could even form the thug. Thank you. In 50 milliseconds. But I tell you what, in this next, in this next segment, we're going to make 50 milliseconds feel like 50 years. Oh, that's a really, really nice promo there. That'll make everybody lean in. That's actually a terrible like there

Speaker 7:          22:07          Ready? Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I remember Krulwich. This is Radiolab and bead is our subject. Keep me doing it. That's what this whole next segment is about. See, I had it in my bones just to set it up a, I got this idea from my friend Andrew's Ali, who is a fantastic writer, wrote the book, uh, resilience. Why things bounce back. We were at a diner. I was telling him about this show and he says, you should do something about the stock market. And I was like, I'm the last person should do is in the most dogmatic. He's like, no, no, no, no. Forget everything you think you know about the stock market. Um, most of us, when we think about stock markets, if you just close your eyes and you think about the financial world, what you imagined,

Speaker 14:         22:47          there's a bunch of people in a room and they're all wearing funny colored jackets and they're shouting at each other and waiving bits of Pavia, right? 70, this kind of Rawkus Watson, it's white gay people screaming, trying to figure out what a crisis, and we'll have this sort of iconography, this cultural iconography of how the financial system works. That is in large part complete

Speaker 7:          23:17          lead divorced from reality because he told me, here's my first surprise, that somewhere between 50 and 70 plus percent of all the trades that happen on what we think of as Wall Street are not executed by a human being as a result of a human decision. They're actually executed by an algorithm at a speed rate and scale that is beyond our comprehension. So I decided I would try and comprehend this new world that he was

Speaker 10:         23:46          describing. And since this is a subject matter that generally makes me frightened, frankly, I decided to call up David Kestenbaum from planet money. Hey Jed. Hello? V David Casto. Indeed there could be more than one. They probably are on Twitter. In any case, it did not click for either of us. Just how fast, how humanly fast trading had gotten. Yeah. Until we visited this firm called trade works. Hi David. Nice to meet you David. So we go into this little building in New Jersey. It looks like it's a startup or something and uh, this guy says,

Speaker 15:         24:17          hello, my name is Mike Dollar. I'm the chief technology officer of trademarks. And Mike over here sat us down at this computer. Opened up would be this little program that logs exactly what is going on at the market representation of insanely specific times. You could pick a stock. Um, we could look at, um, Yahoo for example. We can literally pick some time of day that we're interested in. What time is this? So it's what time? So this is at 1135 26.979 seconds. And in fact, that's not enough precision for us because we really deal in micro seconds. That would be millions of a second. So we have another way of measuring time, which is the number of microseconds since midnight of the previous day. Can you read that? 407 number. Sure. 41 billion. 729,979,559 microsecond since midnight. Wow. So do you always have lunch at like 2,000,305,000 without, that'd be really early.

Speaker 3:          25:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         25:23          hi. How many trays do you do in a day?

Speaker 15:         25:27          Um, I think it depends a lot. Uh, a high frequency trader might do thousand trades in a minute.

Speaker 3:          25:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         25:35          it's about that tempo, but it's kind of very bursty now what happens during those bursts is a bit of a mystery. It's very hard to see what's going on. Often says, Andrew, it's the computers testing the market testing to see if they can find a nibble on the other side. They'll fire out a bunch of buy and sell orders and then when another computer bites on one, they'll quickly cancel the ones that didn't stick. Nope. Sorry. Didn't want to do that. And they're doing this on a microsecond basis by, nope, sorry, sal. Nope, nope, nope, nope. Forget about that by na, and they create huge volumes of transactions that just disappear into the ether. There are some computer algorithms he says, whose whole job is to combat other algorithms, fake them out. For example, we just a very good example, it happened about a month ago in craft. That's Eric Han. Sandra. He tracks high frequency trading for the, from Nanux craft like Kraft cheese crap. Yes. He says, what they saw was this algorithm jumping in the market, buy up a bunch of craft which jam the price up, which allowed that algorithm to sell at much higher prices to 'em the other algorithms and we calculate it out. It costs them 200,000

Speaker 7:          26:44          to push the price up, but they were able to sell about 900,000 of stock and netting again of of over half a million dollars in the matter of seconds.

Speaker 10:         26:58          Now to put that in context, back in the day, you know, 20 years ago when the humans still ran the trading pits [inaudible] according to this guy, I'm Larry Tab, founder and CEO of the TAC group. The average time that it took to execute a trade was around 1112 seconds back then and when you ask people how did we get from 11 or 12 seconds to forty one million seven hundred twenty nine million nine hundred seventy nine thousand five hundred fifty one like a second. Since we like phrases like that, the answer is kind of surprising, but I'll just start with the obvious part. At least the part that's obvious to people who work in finance. It wasn't obvious to me, but a basic law of the market is that the fastest person will usually win. There's always a benefit. That's Andrew again, to getting information faster than the other guy. Absolutely. This has been going on since Julius Reuters used carrier pigeons to send a bunch of stock quotes faster than guy on a horseback, and that was in the 1850

Speaker 7:          27:55          here's a more modern example. Say the latest job numbers come out. US Employers added 227,000 jobs in February. If those numbers are good, that means the stock market is going to go up. So if you can get the numbers and rush to the market before anyone else gets there and buy the stock before it goes up, you could make a lot of money right on the, you know, buy low sell, high principle, basic law of, of getting rich. But when the market's turned electronic,

Speaker 10:         28:22          which began to happen in the early nineties this basic law created a situation that was totally bananas.

Speaker 7:          28:29          What do you mean?

Speaker 10:         28:30          So imagine it's the year 2000 you've got this market in New York, it's electronic. It's basically just a building on broad street, near Wall Street with a giant computer inside of it that's matching buyers and sellers and you have a bunch of traders in different parts of the country that are connected to this market, to this building and a, some of them are using a automated trading bots and one day this Guy Dave Cummings who is in Kansas notices that his robot keeps getting beat. Like when it would send a trade to New York, like say a buy order often right as that buy order was about to get to New York, some other robot would swoop in and get their first and snatch up the trade and it occurs to this Guy Dave, wait a second, is it cause I'm in Kansas if the other guys closer to New York than his cable boots

Speaker 7:          29:16          shorter. So I need to move to New York. No, no, no. Cause we're talking about the speed of light. Well close to the speed of light knowledge. No, obviously it's because he's in Kansas. What do you mean? Obviously cause the speed of light is like a foot and nanosecond. You're going to get your ass kicked if you're in Kansas. I don't even know how you know this for a fact. Yeah, it's a foot in nanosecond. It's a foot and nanos it takes a billionth of a second. Go a foot. It's three times 10 to the 10 something something. Everybody

Speaker 15:         29:42          knows. I know this because when I was in physics, like if I needed to delay a signal by a nanosecond by billionth of a second, I just added an extra foot of cable. And then did you really do that? Yeah. Cause the Proton antiproton would collide and then it would create a mew on that would go out and you only wanted to measure, you want to filter all the junk. So you knew when it was going to arrive, roughly. So you had a little like window I had to arrive and then the window. But you had to get the timing of the window. Right. So it meant like adding a delay and we just would add cable and it was the easiest way to add. So would literally go get some from cable and just splice it in, not splice it Lima there lemo connectors will connect. Of course.

Speaker 10:         30:19          Here's another way to think about it, like say the time it takes for information to get from Kansas to New York is something like this. Did you hear that? I did. First piece is when it leaves Kansas. Second beep is when it arrives in New York. Yes. Actually slowed that down just a bit so we can hear it better, but the point is that is fast, but there's still a little space in there between the beeps, which is the travel time. Very, very little space, but even if these signals are traveling at millions of miles an hour, close to the speed of light, if somebody is a few hundred miles closer to New York than you and they leave at the same time as you will, then it's going to be like you hear that but it a yeah, that beep in the middle of some other dude beaten you by a few milliseconds.

Speaker 10:         31:00          These little differences matter that they're trying to get in and out super fast and maybe each trade, they're only making a fraction of a penny. That's it says Andrew. But if you're making a fraction of a penny millisecond after millisecond after millisecond can add up. Right? But you have to be able to react really fast. So when this guy in Kansas decided to move his robot to New York, get closer to the big market computer, when this happened, it started kind of a land grab. There was a real estate bubble around some of these buildings because people were trying to buy physical real estate next to the exchanges so that the cables that they would run into the exchanges would be just a few feet shorter than the other guy.

Speaker 15:         31:42          Wait a second. So, so does this mean like if I'm like one stop up on the elevator and you're two stops up that I have the, the, the, the second floor advantage. I mean how far do you do this? Theoretically? Yeah. I mean that's what it means. But

Speaker 10:         31:54          I don't know how far this real estate jockeying got because pretty early on the the people who run the market stepped in and they were like, okay, this could get crazy. So they told the machine traders, okay, you want to be close to us, fine, pay us some money, we'll let you come inside. Inside our box, inside the mothership. Is there like some room or all these computers or are keeping each other company now? Oh are they asked? There is, if you visit the New York Stock Exchange now, which we did after going through months of security checks, what you see is amazing.

Speaker 16:         32:38          Say so this is why the 20,000 square foot home,

Speaker 10:         32:42          this is Ian Jackie's head of infrastructure at the New York Stock Exchange. He showed us around

Speaker 16:         32:46          with a number of rows of racks for customer payments.

Speaker 10:         32:50          In 2006 New York Stock Exchange opened up this room. It's the size of three football fields filled with nothing but

Speaker 16:         32:58          by embracive of service. A different specific, so these are owned by banks? Hedge funds brokers, yeah. Oh, number of financial institutions. Are these things training right now? Absolutely.

Speaker 10:         33:10          Each of these computers and there were close to 10,000 in the room, give or take. Where at that moment analyzing the market, making a decision as to whether to buy herself, sending that decision over a cable into an adjacent room where it gets bought or sold. Yeah, no people involved. If you stood still for a few seconds, the lights went out, they automatically went off. If not, they moved because the assumption was that we're not going to be people there. And the whole idea of this place says again,

Speaker 16:         33:33          the whole premise is a level playing field. So any firm can come in here and they will have the same access as anyone else.

Speaker 10:         33:40          And to make sure of that, my favorite part,

Speaker 16:         33:42          every single rack within this facility has the same length of cabling to get to the network points at the end and exactly the same length. Exactly the same. Yep.

Speaker 10:         33:51          Everybody gets the same length cabling. Whether you're one foot away from the, you know, network hub or a thousand feet away, you get the same links. I'm sure they send synchronized test pulses from both your, your trading computer and jazz trading computer, and they make sure they arrive exactly at the same moment. I like to imagine they have a guy with a tape measure. That's the guy you bribe. That's the guy. Anyhow, you would think that since all machines can now be inside the exchange, literally inside the market building, that the speed race would be over, right? Yup. No, actually it only gets worse because the place we visited, the New York Stock Exchange, it's just one market. Many, I didn't know this, but apparently when all trading went electronic, the market's fragment, it used to be that the trade stocks there was the New York Stock Exchange and then there was Nasdaq.

Speaker 10:         34:41          Really just those two markets is Larry. Now there are 13 regulated exchanges. There are roughly 50 what they call dark pools in the marketplace is they're not in public, basically. Yeah, so you've got these 60 some odd different markets and that's created all these different speed races between them. Yet, here's a super basic example. Well, I talked about with Andrew Actually in Chicago. You've got this thing called the commodities market. Commodities are basic goods like corn oil, soy beans, zinc, pork. That's what they do in Chicago. Here in New York we do equities and equity is a share of a company. So you have basic goods in Chicago, stocks of companies in New York. Those are different kinds of things, but they're connected to each other. Right. You know, cause like take oil, which is traded in Chicago. A lot of companies depend on oil and they're traded in New York.

Speaker 10:         35:31          So say oil goes up in Chicago, you can pretty much bet that right after that a company like Exxon is to go up in New York, but it won't be instantaneous. Right. Because information has a speed back in the days of the Telegraph as we've learned, it took a quarter second about that long to get from New York to Chicago. Now with fiber optic cables, about 15 milliseconds. I love that. I had no idea. You could actually hear the time difference. That one I think is pretty accurate. 15 milliseconds. But say you're in Chicago, oil goes up, you know it and you can get to New York in 14 milliseconds. Well, you've got one millisecond where you know the future, you know exactly what's going to happen. You're not even betting at this point. This is easy money.

Speaker 15:         36:10          So what happened over time was a race of people to provide the straightest fiber line between Chicago, New York. That's Mike Bellar again from trademarks. He's part of this race. A couple of years ago a company came along, not his unfortunately and spent some eight figures, some to cut a straighter fiber line between those two points. And um, according to some reports they blew through a mountain to do it. They did a lot. And where the state of the art for communication lines at the time between the two locations was about 15 and a half milliseconds. They came along and they made that state of the art 13.3 milliseconds, a savings of about one millisecond each way, which is just an, it's just a aeon is a thousands of the second you're talking about. That's not well it's an Ian. When your sis computer system is able to make a decision in 10 microseconds, which ourselves, that's 10 times faster.

Speaker 15:         37:02          So your computer's like, I can do this so fast while I'm just waiting, waiting, waiting for the news for Chicago. So a lot of us were sitting around thinking what can we do about this? Turns out there was a way to get from Chicago to New York a little faster because the speed of light through air, it's a little faster than when you're going through a fiber optic cable. And so what they're doing now is they're building a series of towers so they can beam the signal through the air from one tower to the next tower, to the next tower, all the way from Chicago to New York. So, and that would bring the travel time down to about in the neighborhood of around eight and a half milliseconds. You going from 13 to eight and a half? Yeah. That would be going from this to this. I mean come on. That's a lot of potential savings. You can totally hear the difference. Is it helping? Is it, are we fast enough now? Can we stop?

Speaker 15:         37:53          Um, here's the thing. That's minnows neuron and the CEO of trade works. He joined us for part of the interview and he told us actually we would love to stop this arms race. Yeah, absolutely. The arms racist and huge drain on resources, but he says, we just can't, as it stands when a new technology comes out that makes it possible to be faster. If I don't adopt it and my competitors do, I will lose out to them. I have to do it. And looking at Minaj in particular, you could kind of tell it this part of the job. It's just like the plumbing. Yeah. Just kind of makes them weary. Yeah. Couldn't care less. Why not just call a truce and everyone say, we're not going to try and go faster. We're already way faster than any human can think. It's fast enough. We're going to stay up all a truce. There's a such thing in game theory called prisoner's dilemma. Um, and someone will cheat, you're saying. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You can't put a gun to everyone's head and forced them to abide by this truth, even though we'd all be better off if you could. Well, who would be better off

Speaker 10:         38:51          and here Minosh told us, look, even though the speed race sucks for us, it's actually helping you because on a basic level, anytime you replace a human with a computer, things are going to get faster. They're going to get cheaper and now that the machines are competing, getting cheaper still in 1992 it would have cost you about a hundred dollars to trade a thousand shares. Now 10 bucks.

Speaker 15:         39:13          So yes, humans have been completely supplanted when it comes to short term trading and humans who complain about that are being disingenuous. Okay. They, they have not been displaced by anything other than the fact that they can't compete. You seem like you've had to, you seem defensive. Well, just because I can explain the economics of the business don't make me defensive. [inaudible] that also sounded defensive

Speaker 10:         39:42          if Menashe did sound defensive. It's only because he and Mike and everyone in their industry have had to answer a lot of questions over the past few years about where all this speed is taking us and those questions always come back to one particular day. May Six 2010 when things got a little fruity. We hadn't had a down day in a long while. We, the market had been slowly creeping up for quite a while in there. That's Eric Hahn, Sandra again, the analyst who's been tracking high frequency trading. He says, that day, even though things had been going really well that day, it started off down pretty hard, which made some sense because there was bad news coming out of Athens. People were nervous, but then at a very specific moment, two 42 in the afternoon, 1442 and 44 seconds, all hell breaks loose.

Speaker 17:         40:37          Okay, Neil, let me just, let me just interrupt for a second because this market is dropping precipitously adjustment, negative 500 it is now negative 560 [inaudible] on the screen. The Dow was losing about 653 points. Now Dow was down 707 points. [inaudible] boom. There it goes. Look at this market. It continues to slide up. Gat At 835 [inaudible] in here. Now it's down 900 wow. Almost a thousand points. Yes. We'll keep you out in a big way like you had to do with the Gel. All orders down at Dalton tights, Chantelle, two 45 and 27 seconds and emergency circuit breaker shuts off

Speaker 10:         41:30          for five seconds and that was the end of the, when it went out

Speaker 7:          41:34          and stopped for five seconds, that was the bottom of the market. 1000 points down, several hundred billion dollars finished two and a half minutes equally weird when trading started again.

Speaker 17:         41:48          Okay.

Speaker 7:          41:48          The market's bounced right back up. About two and a half minutes later, it was 600 points higher than the bottom. It was like food buying. Now, these kinds of swings had happened before, but never that fast and the speed is one thing. Arguably what's more troubling

Speaker 18:         42:07          is that we still two and a half years later, don't really know what happened.

Speaker 7:          42:14          I mean the SEC investigated for months released this giant 84 page report where they essentially blamed the whole thing on one bed algorithm that this guy in New York was trying to sell a bunch of stocks, told his computer to do it. His computer just did it a little too aggressively. No, that's not how it went down at all. Eric doesn't agree. He thinks what happened is that all the high frequency computers just clogged the network. Really the cause of the flash crash was system overload because he says a basic feature of these computer algorithms is when they detect the network is slow, they pull out, you know, one of the maxims on the street is when the doubts stay out or pull out. And so if you've got this one computer is selling a ton of stock and no computers left to buy, that creates a vacuum.

Speaker 7:          42:54          Now there were people who argued that high frequency trading had actually made the situation better because you know, Andrew says the markets did bounce back right up to the top. It computers self corrected perhaps. But the point is nobody had any idea and that's what gets him that we're in a situation now where when things go wrong, they go wrong in the blink of an eye and then it takes us years to figure out what happened. The question that comes up is how have we crossed some kind of Rubicon where we've passed into a realm where the complexities speed, the volume of all of this stuff makes it no longer human readable. We just don't know what the system is doing and can't in principle find out when things go wrong.

Speaker 7:          46:12          hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I am, I would call it just is Radiolab and today. Do you want to say did today's a speed? This is a perfect example of what we've been bumping into. All our humans are slow. We're just too slow. But now, yeah. Hello, this Lena. It is all right. Now we have a story that should make us all feel a little better. Can I just say, I didn't even think this was remotely possible, but we're about to talk about and the heroine of our story is a Lena Vestigo. How that's that? Is that a hyphenate? No, that vista go is my middle name. How is the last name? And my first name is lean. So Selena is a physicist at Harvard and she has done something with speed that is just remarkable. It's the only way to say it. If we sort of step back one, we asked her to walk us through what she does step by step because it's totally worth it. We start out with a clump of room temperature sodium and at room temperature, sodium is actually a nice shiny metal. Lena and her team, they take the sodium, they put it in an oven and heat it up. Exactly. And as it heats up, Adam's in the sodium starts

Speaker 15:         47:17          vibrate faster and then faster. And when the temperature gets to around 350 degrees centigrade, the Adams form the vapor super high pressure.

Speaker 8:          47:30          And then she forces the atoms to this little pinhole have a little hole in the source. So this fins stream of atoms now comes out of a hole and we hit them, hit on with a laser beam. So you bang them right in their pathway? Yes, kick them in a direction opposite to their motion and that slows them down. Excited and now we can load them into what we call an optical molasses, optical molester. This is so baroque. I love it. In the obstacle, molasses, the aims, will you be hit by laser beams from all directions? Is that your way of like saying don't go this way, don't go this way. Don't go this way. Yes. You corner them in from all angles. Yes. Then we can get them to a really slow down.

Speaker 7:          48:18          It feels a little bit like you've enslaved these Adams. I feel bad for them. It's going to get worse. Yes, because then that's not good enough. Now that she has these Adams trap, she needs to make them sit as still

Speaker 8:          48:28          cause possible. So she turns off the lasers total darkness in the lab and then we turn on an electromagnet, use the fact that he used the fact that the Adams has morning magnets to hold them in a particular point in space so they don't all fly apart. Then we can flip the magnet of this small Adams and selectively kick out the hardest. Just the hardest of them. So they will fly out of the magnet and we just keep a the lowest energy by flipping the magnets. You could say to the, there's one atom that's a little bit too jumpy. So you say get out of here, get out of here

Speaker 7:          49:10          cause you, cause you want just the quietest Adams to stay. That's right. So now after all this, Lena has this teeny little cloud. Oh 0.1 millimeter in size typically have just a few million atoms, like five 10 million. And she says at this point they're all very, very still. And because temperature is really just a measure of speed really. You know when Adam's are moving quickly, we call that hot. When they're moving slowly, we call that cold. These atoms because they're so still, these Adams are really cold, colder than anything on earth. Colder than the middle of empty space. Basically. These are the coldest things that have ever been cold. Yeah. And at that point we have a totally new state of matter

Speaker 17:         49:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          49:58          and of course she was curious about this new state of matters. That's right. I'm a curious lady. And now we get to the part where, uh, well this is the whole reason we're telling you this. She now decides to poke this. Adam's basically a center light, Paulson

Speaker 7:          50:14          shoot a beam of light into this called Adam cloud and see Howard, we ex, you know, when you have a total in, what was it that, well, you know, light fashion hates me. I mean, she says, here's this thing that goes 671 million miles hour. Then nothing goes faster than light. And the question just occurred to her like, what would happen if I took the fastest thing in the universe and stuck it into the coldest thing ever made? Exactly. Yes. So she points your laser at the attic. I mean, the laser beam hits a switch. So here you have this, a light poles coming in, zooming through space, then the front edge will reach our Adam cloud. And unbelievably the light poles in that moment goes from hundred and 86,000 miles per second to 15 miles per hour. How are you getting, no. So the light is going like this,

Speaker 20:         51:08          right?

Speaker 7:          51:10          That's right. Wow. And so I know Adam cloud. Amazing.

Speaker 3:          51:18          Uh,

Speaker 7:          51:18          and then it just chugs along really a little bit at a leisurely speed. Something that you could, uh, feed on your bicycle. Yeah. Maybe ride your bike faster than the light mean. Exactly. You can sort of think of this waste between a bicycle and the light calls. I mean, imagine you could just bike next to this blob of light and you could reach out and maybe pet it a little bit, then bike on a head. Uh, but then you'd be in darkness, but you can go go maybe to the edge of the cloud and wait for the lights. And it's all that when it comes through, you can just catch it. Well, no, that you can't catch it because when the light gets to the other side of the Adam cloud, the, the front edge will accelerate back up to this enormous normal lightspeed

Speaker 20:         52:05          and then

Speaker 7:          52:06          rushes off, scratches out again. Cool. So here's my, Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry. So, so if you've got it down to 15, is that a kind of, uh, a, a like a, uh, a limit? I mean, can you, can we, we could, we could bring it, Lord, it's, it's not a stop light. Can you actually stop light? We can. So that laser goes in and doesn't come out. Yes. I mean you hold it like, uh, like uh, how do you do that? Huh? Okay. So what we do is a, it's actually, okay, so things get a little technical here, but basically probably to simply, Lina has figured out a way to tweak the properties of this Adam cloud. She can make it like a brick that like bounces off of, or she can make it clear. So like cruises through, in this case, what she does is she shoots the light into the Adam cloud. So we slow it down and then right at that moment, because it's chugging along, Chuck Chuck Chuck at 15 miles an hour, she tweaks the Adam cloud to make it well thick. And the light parts will say, oops. Uh, it'll come to a halt. Almost like it's frozen

Speaker 7:          53:11          in a block of ice in this [inaudible]. Yes. It just sits. Wow. When, when, when you realize what you done, did you do a little a Jig or what did you do? You have? Oh yeah, that

Speaker 8:          53:26          was amazing. They were just like sitting in the lab of course, in the middle of the night and just knowing, Whoa, you're the first one who has been in this part of nature. Yeah, it was joy

Speaker 3:          53:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          53:37          you know, of course, to some extent I'm an engineer, but this whole idea that I can take this light poles and bring it down to a human scale, that something you just, uh, at a very personal level gets excited about. This is more like, you know, I mean, you can sort of say a, you know, like, like, like, like, uh, a sculpturer will create a beautiful sculpture.

Speaker 4:          54:07          For me, as I was thinking about this, I actually think of it in terms of painting, like Vermeer, you know, the painter, he could create this illusion that light was just suspended there on the canvas. Just shimmering. Yeah. You Timo captured the light, but that was just an illusion.

Speaker 8:          54:24          Lena actually did it. Yes.

Speaker 3:          54:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          54:31          do you ever, do you ever wonder, do you ever like, you know, after this night you walk out and into the log and I imagine next day and the sun is shining and you just look at the light and you think,

Speaker 7:          54:42          Oh, I've got your number. You're like Zeus. No. You could resist for a moment.

Speaker 8:          54:47          Uh Huh. Uh Huh. And also perhaps being Scandinavian, right where we left the a light around midsummer.

Speaker 7:          54:54          Yeah. You have a whole lot of it or then a whole lot. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Maybe you could do something about that. Maybe you could store the hay for the winter time. You could store it up and then you could unleash the cloud and suddenly there would be sunshine when there was other, and there's darkness. So save it. Save it for the wintertime. Yes. Yeah. Well, we've been doing this for a number of years. This is the one in the for remarkable conversations. Thank you very much. This is wonderful. Yeah, but you didn't [inaudible] real important. Oh wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Speaker 8:          55:26          So, um, we, we can play a trick. The trigger this we can stop and extinguish the light person one part of space and we vive it in a totally different location. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          55:38          you can transport hands port it. Yeah. At this point we were like, what weird ass science fiction movie did we just slip into? Lena says when the light hit those atoms back in her cloud there, it's like pulse cloud will create a little imprint in the arms. It's like if you were to punch soft clay with your hand and then you could see the imprint of your knuckles there in the clay. That's what happens when the light hits those atoms. The light poles will change the items a little bit. That's how it imprints its information in the Adams and according to Lena, that imprint, it's like a physical impression of the light. All the information about the light, it's frequency, energy, whatever. All that stuff is copied in the Adams. So with this shadow of [inaudible], does that mean it's a shadow of light? Yes. And now we can put poulet

Speaker 8:          56:24          imprint out. So now what we have out in free space is a perfect Matta copy. You mean like physical matter? Yes, and then we can move that around. We can put it under shell for, we can move it around, we can squish it and then we can take it all. She says if she wants to, she can then make a few tweaks to the cloud. Then delight, pulse will come back to life, propagate slowly through the cloud and then exit and speed back up.

Speaker 7:          56:47          So you could store, I mean if you were, if you were President Obama and you said, I would like to put it, put the light around me right now in a time capsule for later generations to experience. He could take it using your process, put it in an archive somewhere and then putting in a bottle and thousand years later they would, they would know the light that surrounded him. Yes. No, that's what she said. How would you know that different light is the same? How do you know? Oh, that's the same light.

Speaker 8:          57:15          So it's a contained in my medical copy that preserves the information.

Speaker 7:          57:19          So when the new light turns on, it identically copies the light from before in a way that will, that makes it as as specific as saying, that's Mary Kay Jones again.

Speaker 8:          57:31          Yes, that's right. Oh Man. I've also also also wonder about, you know, because we could, in our lab in Cambridge, we could send the lay person stab at extinguish it, make our little medicard. We put it in a bottle. I could put it in a suitcase, say bring it to a Copenhagen, turn it into light. But I've thought about also, how do I get that bottle? So security in the airport,

Speaker 7:          57:53          what would it look like? Would it just be a bottle full of a full of emptiness? It would be a vacuum, but there would be a little clump of atoms in there. What would have to be less than three ounces of Adams or they would have both. Yes. So much less than three hours. Yeah. You could just walk through the April. You've got no problem. Yeah. Okay. Oh, you can open and be like, you want to do some cool blind him. And that would probably be also against the law. Yes, yes. How am I going to get my light

Speaker 17:         58:19          through security? [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          58:29          if you want to keep the momentum going, check out our short called speedy beat. It's about Beethoven and his apparent need for speed. Most orchestras don't play his work anywhere near as fast as he may have wanted. Go listen@radiolab.org and while you're there you can watch a string quartet play Beethoven's fifth at warp speed. Seriously, it sounds like speed metal.

Speaker 11:         58:52          No. Six. Hi, I'm Chris [inaudible] from the radio at the turn Collagen with the credit. I actually don't have enough credits on this phone to try and do this again, very fast. Regular lab is actually, well, I'll, I'll try really, really fast. Video lab is produced by Ghetto Vermont. Our staff includes Alan Horn from to [inaudible] dot com Keith. All right guys, this is harder than I thought on Keith. Man. Let me and Andy Mills with Hellman, Douglas Smith, Chris [inaudible]. I was looking at Kelsey Patrick pat first. Thanks. Josh. Latinas copied in and craft works in a very special tasks outpatient department. I found that even though I just read that very gray pat call probably cost me about $20 hope you guys use it on the air and this message. That's me. I was looking at Kelsey, Patrick, Megan.
