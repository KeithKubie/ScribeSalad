MARIO: Welcome, everybody.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.920
Welcome to the screen
of the documentary film

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.430
"The Connection."

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.050
And my name is
Mario [? Adetta. ?]

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.811
I'm part of People Development.

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:17.060
I'm part of the Well-Being
team in People Development.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.980
I'm also in the
core team of gPause.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.990
We are honored to have
today with us the filmmaker,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.990
the director of the film "The
Connection," Shannon Harvey,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.950
who came all the way
from Sydney, Australia.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.090
She's a journalist, filmmaker.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.830
And she's going to
introduce her film herself.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.147
Welcome to Google, Shannon.

00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:40.230
SHANNON HARVEY: Thank you.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.820
It is a real buzz to
be here at Google HQ.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.850
We talk about it as a
legendary place in Australia.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.630
And it's absolutely incredible
to be walking around campus.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.340
I even saw somebody
on a skateboard

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.900
with a laptop, which was
perfect, when I first arrived.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.560
But to be talking to a room
with people who are setting

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.530
the agenda for a digital
future that I cannot even begin

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.990
to imagine is very humbling.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.320
And I'm very honored to be here.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.280
So thank you very much.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.170
I've spent the last few years
meeting and interviewing

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.760
some of the world's leading
experts in meditation,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.090
in mindfulness, and
in mind-body medicine.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.270
And I've often heard them quote
from a German philosopher who

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.360
lived in the 1800's named
Arthur Schopenhauer.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.850
And in fact, I've based my talk
on Arthur Schopenhauer's quote.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.790
But unfortunately, as
I went through my notes

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.610
to do my references yesterday,
which is something that's

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.990
very important to do, as a
former journalist, I Googled.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.660
And I discovered that
there is some conjecture

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.780
as to whether Arthur
Schopenhauer actually

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.410
said the quote.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.077
So thank you, Google.

00:02:06.077 --> 00:02:07.450
[LAUGHS]

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.650
I've also discovered, though,
that many wise people have

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.170
said something rather
similar-- people

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.900
like William James, Arthur
C. Clarke, Elbert Hubbard.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.040
And they've said
many similar things.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.390
So the quote that I will
be basing my talk today on

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.110
is being attributed
to the internet.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.220
The internet once said
that, "Every truth

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.560
passes through three stages
before it is recognized.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.460
In the first, it is ridiculed.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.980
In the second, it is opposed.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.740
And in the third, it is
regarded as self-evident."

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.140
And I'm using this quote to
talk about the acceptance

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.820
of the mind-body connection.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.440
I spent the last
few years looking

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.100
at how some of the
latest research

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.180
from leading institutions,
like Harvard and Stanford,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.750
shows that the state
of someone's mind

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.050
can significantly alter
the quality of their life.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.330
It sounds revolutionary, I know.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.410
Who would have thought?

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.390
But this science is also showing
that the state of your mind

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.000
can influence things such
as your body's ability

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.560
to ward off
infection or a virus.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.750
And it can even influence the
outcome of a chronic illness.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.310
In fact, the very cutting
edge of this research

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.140
shows that your
mind can actually

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.520
influence your body to a
cellular level, to your DNA,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.510
and, in fact, influence
the DNA that you

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.640
pass on to your children and
your children's children.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.170
And it may even influence
how long you live.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.010
I want you all,
just for a moment,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.420
to imagine walking into your
doctor's room feeling tired

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.870
and run down, and being given
a diagnosis of chronic fatigue,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.680
and telling your doctor
that you're self-prescribing

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.390
an eight-week meditation course.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.020
You would be laughed
at and you would

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.710
be told to go back to your
commune in California.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.060
It is my personal mission
to take our understanding

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.560
of the truth of the
mind-body connection

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.210
from the first and second stage
of being ridiculed and opposed

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.670
into the third stage of being
regarded as self-evident.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.290
And like all good
projects of passion,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.540
my enthusiasm is personal.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.490
This is a photograph
that I hate looking at.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.400
This is a photograph
of me a few years

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.820
after I had been diagnosed
with an autoimmune disease.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.910
I walked into a doctor's
room at the age of 24,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.930
and I was told that he
suspected I had lupus.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.840
Lupus is an autoimmune disease
where your immune system starts

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.470
attacking your perfectly
normal, healthy tissue.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.810
The doctor told me
that he suspected

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.020
that I may have trouble
having children.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.760
He told me that if the
disease progressed,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.460
it could end up
attacking my organs.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.340
And he told me that I may
end up in a wheelchair

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.980
before I turn 30.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.110
It was pretty devastating.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.800
I was a journalist.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.820
I had just landed my dream job
at the Australian Broadcasting

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.650
Corporation as a radio
and news journalist.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.500
And in that moment,
everything came crashing down.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.220
Unfortunately, the thing
about being diagnosed

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.830
with a chronic illness
is that there's actually

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.460
nothing exceptional about it.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.520
In fact, according to the
World Health Organization,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.770
there's more than
a one in two chance

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.560
you will be diagnosed
with a chronic illness.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.320
And by that, I'm talking
about cancer, diabetes,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.040
heart disease, chronic
migraines, chronic back pain,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.110
chronic fatigue, Crohn's
disease, fibromyalgia,

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.900
multiple sclerosis--
the list goes on.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.060
And it actually gets worse,
because one in four Americans

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.670
will have two or more
chronic health conditions.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.930
The cost of this global
burden of disease

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.150
is predicted to soar to
$47 trillion by 2030.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.100
No wonder the World
Health Organization

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.330
has labeled this as
an impending disaster.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.810
And the UN Secretary
General, Ban Ki-moon,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.640
describes the rising chronic
illness as a global epidemic.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.210
So there I was,
just another person

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.050
saddled with a lifelong
chronic illness.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.660
But being a journalist,
I also had a deep desire

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.400
to search for answers.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.460
Over a number of years, I spent
$30,000 on drugs and surgeries,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.270
on alternative therapies, as
well as mainstream therapies,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.050
but I was still sick.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.970
One day, on yet
another Google search,

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.220
I came across a
document that had

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.970
been written for
medical students

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.500
by an Australian MD
named Craig Hassed.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.770
I didn't realize it at the
time, but this document

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.210
was about to change my life.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.820
It was called, "Mind-Body
Medicine-- Science,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.100
Practice and Philosophy."

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.360
And it explained how, in
the last 5 to 10 years,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.220
the advances in technology have
allowed us to look at the ways

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.940
things like the brain and the
immune system can interact

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.160
in order to affect our health.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.970
It was a document
that was summarizing

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.420
peer-reviewed,
academic research.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.990
This was evidence-based
mind-body medicine,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.790
and it was designed to target
medical students so they could

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.720
apply it to their own practice.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.480
It explored
research, such as how

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.070
the immune systems
of medical students

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.660
became profoundly
suppressed before or just

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.920
after an exam period.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.500
But if they were taught
relaxation techniques,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.630
they showed significantly
better immune function

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.460
and less illness during exams.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.410
It looked at how merely
seeing your doctor coming

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.520
at you to take
your blood pressure

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.860
could make your
blood pressure rise.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.420
And as a result, a
quarter of people

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.060
are being misdiagnosed
with hypertension.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.420
It looked at how a chronic
or long-term activation

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.090
of your stress response, your
fight or flight response,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.870
leads to what's called
allostatic load, which

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.750
is associated with type
2 diabetes, obesity,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.440
hypertension, atrophy of the
nerve cells in your brain.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.042
Stress is bad for you.

00:08:26.042 --> 00:08:27.000
Who would have thought?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.690
But before I elaborate
a little bit further,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.110
there is something that I want
to clarify and make very, very

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.610
clear.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.340
The research and my
film is not saying

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.910
that mental wellness is more
important than nutrition,

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.040
than exercise, than drugs,
and surgeries, and the wonders

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.110
of modern medicine.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.900
But it is saying that
the state of your mind

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.160
is extremely important.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.290
Dr. Hassed's document led me
to the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.030
And some of you who have done
the Search Inside Yourself

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.670
program here at
Google would know

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.020
that this has been an
influence on the program.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.640
Dr. Kabat-Zinn has been
instrumental in introducing

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.950
stress reduction and meditation
into a medical setting.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.250
And he initially
found that people

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.440
who meditated while receiving
light therapy to treat

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.150
psoriasis healed four
times faster than people

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.150
who were non-meditators.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.560
I also came across the
work of Dr. Dean Ornish

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.600
from the University
of California,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.580
whose mind-body
programs have proven

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.310
that people with heart
disease and prostate cancer

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.800
can actually be
treated, sometimes

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.570
without drugs or surgery.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.000
In some cases, his
program has been

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.970
able to slow the progression
of these illnesses

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.160
or even reverse them.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.330
In fact, he recently joined
with a major health insurer

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.880
here in the US.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.300
And surprise, surprise, they
found that the participants

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.330
had significantly
improved health outcomes.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.500
But when the insurer looked
at the dollars and cents

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.690
of the program, it reported
cutting their customer's health

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.130
care costs by half
in the first year.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.260
Dr. Ornish's program
includes stress management

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.230
through yoga and
meditation, a healthy diet,

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.500
moderate exercise,
and social support.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.650
These are not expensive things.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.100
So I started applying some
of the research findings

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.450
that I was reading
about to my own life.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.890
And over a number of years, I
developed a regular meditation

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.610
and yoga practice.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.850
I changed my perception
of my work stress.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.370
I learned about
balancing my emotions.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.780
And I moved much closer to
my family and my friends.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.240
I started feeling
more and more well.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.800
And despite my
original prognosis,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.950
I am very happy to say that I am
the proud mother of a baby boy.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.570
And recently, just
a few weeks ago,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.710
I had a routine blood
test that showed

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:13.260
no sign of autoimmune
disease in my body.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.850
Although our doctors and our
health practitioners mean well,

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.260
most people like me,
with a chronic illness,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.710
are being offered little more
than a bill, a prescription

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.460
for drugs or surgery,
and another appointment.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.680
But I'm living proof of the
power of mind-body medicine,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.080
and I am far from unique.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.930
In my film, which
you're about to see,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.500
you will see the
stories of other people

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.510
who have, in one way or another,
had their health affected

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.650
by the state of their mind.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.170
You will see the story
of Dr. Craig Duncan.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.850
He's a leading sports
scientist in Australia

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.220
who is responsible for the
health and the well-being

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.350
of our late footballers.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.310
He was a vegetarian, and he
was as fit as the athletes

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.980
that he trains.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.240
But he had a heart attack during
an extremely stressful time

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.700
in his life.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.700
As he says in the
film, "It doesn't

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.820
matter how healthy your
body is if your mind isn't

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.500
in some sort of balance."

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.630
You'll also see the story of
Professor George Jelinek, who

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.360
is a leading Australian
medical doctor.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.400
To give you an idea of
this man's credentials,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.380
he has written the medical
textbooks for emergency

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.570
medicine and is the
inaugural editor

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.070
of a major medical
journal that specializes

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.370
in emergency medicine.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.220
His story is perhaps the
most compelling of them all.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.530
And he's my personal hero,
because he has not only

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.760
recovered from
multiple sclerosis,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.030
but he's also developed
a program that

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.770
is seeing many other people
recover from multiple sclerosis

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:51.990
as well.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.140
This is an illness that
traditional medicine

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.730
has no cure for.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.930
And yet, often, when these
people tell their stories,

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.270
they are met with cynicism, and
they are met with opposition.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.030
Mind-body medicine
is sadly considered

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.390
California hippie juju.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.680
Doctors weren't taught it
in medical school years ago.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.530
Therefore, they say
it doesn't work.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.640
20 years ago, the notion
that group support

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.740
would improve the outcome
for women with breast cancer

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.780
was considered ridiculous.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.160
But Dr. David Spiegel from
Stanford is proving just that.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.900
10 years ago, if someone
had said that meditation

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.880
can flip the switch on genes
affecting disease, which

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.640
has now been proven to
be true by Dr. Herbert

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.990
Benson from Harvard, they would
have been violently opposed.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.000
Even to this day, when
I talk about the latest

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.880
research coming
from institutions

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.780
all over the world, looking
at the ritual of medicine

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.410
and how the interaction
between a patient and a doctor

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.430
can significantly alter the
way a sick person's body reacts

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.970
to an illness, I am met
with skepticism, opposition,

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.110
and sometimes outrage.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.650
The science has shown us
that things like meditation,

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.620
mindfulness, emotional
intelligence, and stress

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.810
reduction make us happier,
healthier, stronger,

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.740
and smarter.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.760
These things help
you think better.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.820
They help you sleep
better and live better.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.780
And they cost nothing at all.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:37.520
If this was a drug, everyone in
the world would be taking it.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.200
So if we come back to our famous
quote from the great internet,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.240
it seems that despite
the overwhelming evidence

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.070
about the power of the
mind-body connection,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.390
we are not yet in
the third stage.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.690
The truth is sometimes
ridiculed, sometimes opposed,

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.190
and rarely seen as self-evident.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.990
And this is why I
made "The Connection."

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.480
This is a film
for people who are

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.250
well and who want to stay well.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.450
This is a film for
people who are sick

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.930
and who are searching
for answers.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.320
This is a film I wish my
doctor had have handed me

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.460
when I first got sick.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.110
I hope that, after
you've seen it,

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.710
you might feel as passionate
as I do about taking us

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.850
into the third stage
of realizing the truth.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.950
Or even better, that the
stages we travel through

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.100
are more like those that
the philosopher William

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.910
James proposed.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.820
"First, a new theory
is attacked as absurd.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.940
Then it is admitted to be true,
but obvious and insignificant.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.610
And finally, it is
seen to be so important

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.360
that even its adversaries
claim that they themselves

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.940
discovered it."

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.472
So without further ado, I hope
you enjoy "The Connection."

00:15:48.472 --> 00:15:51.944
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:54.489 --> 00:15:55.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.696
Well, first of all,
thank you very much.

00:15:56.696 --> 00:15:58.110
I loved the film.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.616
If we would like a
copy of it, is there

00:16:00.616 --> 00:16:03.240
some sort of way-- I don't know
if this was mentioned earlier--

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.344
for us to get it?

00:16:04.344 --> 00:16:06.093
Will it be released
online in some format?

00:16:06.093 --> 00:16:07.009
SHANNON HARVEY: Mm-hm.

00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:09.380
It's available online
at our website, which

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:15.200
is theconnection.tv, as
download stream and DVD.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.200
I think it's in
order of confirmation

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.620
from personal experiences.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.770
And I find it very beautiful
how you put it all together

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.540
in such a convincing
way that I just

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.690
can't wait to share this with
anyone, including family.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.370
So a very practical question.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.234
In which language
is it available?

00:16:35.234 --> 00:16:36.650
And is there any
way we could help

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.874
in making it available
in more languages?

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.040
SHANNON HARVEY: Yes, please.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.230
We'd love more help.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.900
It's available, I
think-- I'll just

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.540
check with Jules over there.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:50.960
It's available in five languages
at the moment, with subtitles,

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.620
obviously.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:59.050
So Italian, and Portuguese,
French, German, and Spanish.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:16:59.550
Yeah.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.750
Yeah.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.875
AUDIENCE: That's wonderful.

00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:01.909
SHANNON HARVEY: Yeah.

00:17:01.909 --> 00:17:03.450
AUDIENCE: In the
movie, it's actually

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.325
mentioned that when you
practice meditation--

00:17:05.325 --> 00:17:06.283
SHANNON HARVEY: Uh-huh.

00:17:06.283 --> 00:17:08.780
AUDIENCE: --and the body is
like a response mechanism.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.810
It slows down, like maybe
your metabolism goes down,

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.990
everything goes down.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.359
And when you do cardio,
like you work out,

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.990
then your metabolism increases.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.329
Therefore, all those
signals increases, right?

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.490
But we also know that
working out or doing cardio

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:25.485
is also beneficial.

00:17:25.485 --> 00:17:28.290
But that is
[? quantitatively ?] right?

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.350
So how do you explain that?

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.090
What do think about that?

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.600
Some stress are
good for the body,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.560
and some stress are
bad for the body.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.850
And, like, my personal
belief is that

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.692
this physical intense-- like,
physical workout that we do,

00:17:41.692 --> 00:17:43.150
it's part of that
good stress which

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:46.090
prepares our body for
next level of thinking.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:51.240
Or like, basically, suppose if
I am worried about something,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.400
if I'm able to
handle that better,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.962
then my mind is
prepared for that.

00:17:54.962 --> 00:17:57.170
And now I can move on to
the next level of challenge,

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.215
which my mind can [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:00.215 --> 00:18:01.490
SHANNON HARVEY: Mm-hm.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:06.910
So first of all, I'm not a
doctor and I'm not a scientist.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.901
But it's a question that,
if you want to follow up

00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:12.400
in exact detail, I can put you
in touch with some people who

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:17.490
can help you explain it
at the metabolic level.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.995
But to speak generally
about it, my understanding

00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:21.620
is that there's good
stress and there's

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.280
bad stress, particularly
allostatic load,

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.910
which is the chronic
overload of stress.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.920
And I know, from
my own experience,

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.970
my autoimmune disease was
triggered by allostatic load.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.350
It had been constant stress.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.790
It was the constant deadlines
of being a journalist.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.480
But on top of that, I
was the sort of person

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.010
who would take on the emotional
problems of other people

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.500
that I couldn't fix.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.480
And that was contributing to
an emotional kind of stress

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.600
in my body.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.270
And as Dr. Hassed talks
about in the film,

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.950
there's this constant
wear and tear

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.800
of the body, the constant
release of these stress

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.780
chemicals, like cortisol.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.400
They slowly, slowly
start impacting your body

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.220
in a detrimental way.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.270
Now, what's really
important to know

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.680
is that we've evolved
to have the stress

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.530
response as a good thing.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.050
It's supposed to save our lives.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.277
We're supposed to be able
to run away from the tiger

00:19:21.277 --> 00:19:23.110
that's chasing us, or
the elephant stampede,

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.510
or whatever it is.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.220
It's supposed to
give us more energy,

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.310
and it's supposed to allow our
blood to heal wounds faster.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.690
But when our body is constantly
activating this response,

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.820
it's shutting down
other vital systems,

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.940
like your digestion, which
means that it's not digesting

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.902
nutrients in the
best possible way.

00:19:45.902 --> 00:19:47.610
The question that you
mentioned, as well,

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.680
about cardio being a good
thing, exercise is good.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.590
We know that.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.830
That's unquestionable.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.240
We should all be
exercising, but it

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.540
depends how you're exercising.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.330
I practiced yoga
for years in a way

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:08.180
where I was treating
it as just a workout.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.960
I was doing power yoga
classes, where I was just

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.820
joining to get my
heart rate going

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.950
and build some muscle strength.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.050
And I realized
after a while that I

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.510
was getting to
these yoga classes--

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.980
and I knew the moves
so well that I'd

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.300
write an entire creative brief
for my production company

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.680
in my head in the
hour and a half

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.730
that I was there for
my yoga practice.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.950
And I wasn't present, and
I wasn't in the moment,

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.590
and I wasn't practicing
a moving meditation.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.515
And so I guess what
I'm trying to say

00:20:37.515 --> 00:20:39.390
is that there's good
exercise and there's bad

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.030
exercise, in the
same way that there's

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.460
good stress and bad stress.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.490
But yeah, if you're
interested in knowing more

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.130
about the metabolic
side of things,

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.760
then that might be something
to talk about afterwards.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.470
Yeah.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.700
Yeah.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.040
AUDIENCE: Hi, Shannon.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.510
It sounds like this has
opened up so much for you,

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.430
so much that you had
never imagined before.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.697
I'm curious, what are you
most interested in now?

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.950
SHANNON HARVEY: That's
a really good question.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:13.850
I'm fascinated in how we can
get this into a wider setting.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.420
Having just read
[? Meng's ?] book, fascinated

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.920
by the way that,
slowly, this is actually

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.340
penetrating into
the corporate world.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.220
And I think that is
where we will actually

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.740
start seeing a massive shift.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.850
I am also fascinated in
the way the world around us

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.190
impacts our health--
so the environments

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.250
that we put ourselves in,
the way that our world is--

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.170
sometimes, to me,
it seems like it's

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.490
designed to make
us sick-- hospital

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.940
environments, for example.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.900
And Dr. Esther
Sternberg, who's one

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:53.760
of the experts in the film,
who is actually considered

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.710
to be one of the 100 most
influential female scientists

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.160
for her discovery about the
connection between the brain

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.270
and the immune system,
she's started looking now

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.000
about how the world around
us affects our health.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.770
And I find that
absolutely fascinating.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.340
I mean, I feel like I've
just dipped my toes in this.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.760
And every single day,
there is new science

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.310
being published, particularly
in the neuroscience world.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.000
And it's gobsmacking.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.870
It's absolutely gobsmacking.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.804
Yeah.

00:22:27.804 --> 00:22:28.345
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:28.345 --> 00:22:29.900
I really enjoyed the movie.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.280
And this is maybe
not necessarily

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.970
a question but sort
of a consideration.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.020
I was wondering the whole
time, how does this mindfulness

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.360
and being well aware
of what we eat,

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.170
how we act, how we
go about our days,

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.590
how does that fit into
the consumer's culture

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.840
that we are constantly
bombarded with?

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.620
And another part of
that consideration

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:59.300
is placebo health does not make
money for drug companies, which

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.660
are very heavily
invested in keeping us,

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.490
to a certain extent,
sick, as well.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:08.420
So I was wondering if
you have any thoughts

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.860
on any of those issues.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:11.770
SHANNON HARVEY: Yeah.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:12.936
Well, I've got two comments.

00:23:12.936 --> 00:23:15.240
It does seem like the world
is against us, that it's

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.030
designed to get our stress
response constantly going.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.030
And also, it seems like in
some corporate environments,

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.600
it's almost as if, if
you're not a stress head,

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.442
and if you're not working
12-, 15-hour days,

00:23:25.442 --> 00:23:27.900
then there's something wrong
with you and you're not giving

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.460
enough.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.830
But to add to the comment
about the placebo and the fact

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.950
that you can't
really sell placebo,

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.860
interestingly, when I was doing
the scripting for the film,

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.370
I came across a website saying,
placebo.com or something

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.280
like that.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.190
And they're selling
placebo pills

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.130
and using the science
behind placebo

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.360
as the platform from
which to sell the pills.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.770
So you can make money out
of placebo, apparently.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.654
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:55.654 --> 00:23:57.070
AUDIENCE: In your
film, you stress

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.970
the importance of a community.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.014
And I recently moved
from Colorado out here.

00:24:03.014 --> 00:24:04.680
And what I'm finding
is it's really hard

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:10.020
to find that kind of community
to sustain mind-body healing.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.330
Is there any network that
practitioners are actually

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.110
saying, I believe
in this, and this

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.690
is a practice that
I would support?

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:24.840
Because that's astoundingly
absent in my search here.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.620
SHANNON HARVEY: Yeah.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.715
The power of community
and the power

00:24:29.715 --> 00:24:31.400
of being in a
supportive community

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.540
is absolutely essential.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.770
And for me, it was one of
the biggest breakthroughs,

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.110
personally.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.580
When I first got
sick, I look back

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.330
and I realize that I'd actually
set myself up perfectly

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:48.490
to get sick, because I was in
this extremely stressful job,

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.430
but I was also working
really long hours.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.550
And I was living really far
away from my family and friends.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.630
And text messaging
and email was my way

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:57.770
of communicating with them.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:03.290
And I wasn't actually
being with those people.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.380
In terms of networks
and finding networks,

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.360
I think that we all need to
find our own communities.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.330
We need to tap into
them in some way.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.370
I think meditation
communities, they're around.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.690
I think particularly the
mindfulness-based stress

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.650
reduction community
is very strong.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.810
And they really understand
the community side

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.300
of meditation practice.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.020
Mindfulness-based
stress reduction

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.060
was originally developed
by Jon Kabat-Zinn, who

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.330
is one of the experts
who appeared in the film

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.680
and who's influenced the Search
Inside Yourself program here.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.240
I mean, he really
has fundamentally

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.230
changed the way we look
at meditation in the West.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.410
But that's got a huge network.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.760
They've got over
20,000 practitioners

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.490
now all around the
world, who are teaching

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.060
these eight-week
courses in meditation.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.860
And from those
courses come really

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.730
strong communities, so I'd
really highly recommend

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:02.670
looking into that.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.630
But in addition to
that, I've recently

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.550
written a blog post about the
power of community support

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:09.380
within niches.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.480
So all the footage that you saw
in the film of the cute, little

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.900
babies, that was
my mother's group

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.220
that I joined
after I had my son.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.710
My son's 20 months old now.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.220
He's turning two in April.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.450
And I'm still really close
with this network of women.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.560
And even though we're all
really different people,

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.602
we're actually all
united by the fact

00:26:32.602 --> 00:26:34.810
that we've been through
something very intense, which

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.912
is being the mother
of a newborn baby.

00:26:37.912 --> 00:26:39.620
And that has sort of
brought us together.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.720
And we will be together
for a very, very long time.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.980
And we'll see each
other's children grow up.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.020
And there's something
really magic about that.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.080
And the other comment
I'd make about that

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.050
is that it's really
easy to tell ourselves

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.950
that we don't have time.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:56.880
You know, I find that
sometimes, particularly

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.780
if I've had a really big week
at work and I'm exhausted--

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.910
and our mothers group meets on
a Thursday night once a month.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.290
And I tell myself that I'm
too tired to get dressed up,

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.380
and I'm too tired to get
out there and see them.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.090
And I'll see them
next month anyway.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:18.610
But I make myself go, and I
have never regretted going.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.790
And I think that if you do find
some kind of community that

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:27.110
becomes your people, you will
never regret seeing them.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.477
MARIO: We have a community
around mindfulness at Google.

00:27:30.477 --> 00:27:31.560
SHANNON HARVEY: Oh, great.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.734
MARIO: And it's called
gPause, G-P-A-U-S-E.

00:27:33.734 --> 00:27:35.192
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for that question.

00:27:35.192 --> 00:27:36.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.760
MARIO: And we just
get together around

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.690
mindfulness practices,
mindful lunches.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.439
And it's there for
everybody to join.

00:27:44.439 --> 00:27:46.605
AUDIENCE: And if you can't
remember the [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:46.605 --> 00:27:48.605
just grab one of these
bracelets on the way out.

00:27:48.605 --> 00:27:50.410
MARIO: Yeah.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.030
I have a question.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:57.010
I would like you to comment on
how has the film been received.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.990
Tell us a little bit about
where it's been showed

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.950
and what kind of-- yeah.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.940
SHANNON HARVEY: OK.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.620
So the first thing is that this
is an independent film, which

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:10.080
means that my husband and
I financed it ourselves.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.260
So we don't have a
big studio behind us,

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.230
and we don't have a lot of
money that's driving it.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.010
But we released the
film independently,

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.930
which meant that we did
a tour around Australia,

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.320
and around the
US, and in the UK,

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:29.452
where we showed it to a lot of
people through wellness groups

00:28:29.452 --> 00:28:30.910
and through chronic
illness groups.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.600
It was just so well-received.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.360
It was so humbling.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.370
In fact, at our US premiere,
which was in Massachusetts,

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:46.760
just outside of Boston, we
had a panel discussion where--

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.890
on the panel was, obviously,
myself, Jon Kabat-Zinn

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.460
from the film, a
neuroscientist, a pediatrician.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.530
And also, we had the CEO of
Massachusetts General Hospital

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:02.280
and a health care group
that's responsible for 60%

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.700
of the health care in the
state of Massachusetts.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.920
And his name's Dr. Eric Dickson.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.560
And his response was incredible.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.760
He stated that he wanted
to make it compulsory

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.810
viewing for first-year
medical students.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.110
Then he decided he'd add
fourth-year medical students

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.830
as well.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.895
So they go to it at the
beginning and at the end.

00:29:20.895 --> 00:29:23.270
And then he added that he was
going to make his residents

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.110
and his doctors
and all the people

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.910
involved in his
health care see it.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.970
So that was such an
amazing response.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:33.150
And I know, particularly
for the people who

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:36.180
are from the mindfulness-based
stress reduction clinic

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.460
there in Massachusetts, it
was a big moment for them,

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:44.760
because they felt like
finally, the medical world

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.660
and their world was
coming together.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.800
So that's been really good.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.820
And we've got a
program, which we

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.450
call Host Your Own
Screening of the Film,

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.050
and this is one of them.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.155
And so we've got people all
over the world who are now

00:29:58.155 --> 00:29:59.530
screening the film
and organizing

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:04.290
their own screenings, which
is really, really cool.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.500
MARIO: Well, thank you again,
on behalf of everybody,

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.206
to making the film.

00:30:09.206 --> 00:30:12.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.510
Thank you for being here.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.100
Thank you, everybody,
for joining us.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.415
And I also want to thank
Kathleen and [? Van ?]

00:30:19.415 --> 00:30:21.300
from gPause to
making this possible,

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.705
and your help on the camera
on making of this work.

00:30:25.705 --> 00:30:26.590
And yeah.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.006
I don't know if
you will be around

00:30:28.006 --> 00:30:29.780
in case somebody
wants to approach you.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.420
Thank you so much, and
have a great evening.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.503
SHANNON HARVEY: Thank you.

00:30:32.503 --> 00:30:36.130
