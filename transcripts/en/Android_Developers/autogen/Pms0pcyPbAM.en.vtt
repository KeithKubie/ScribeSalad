00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:06.000
 [Happy music] 

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.366
 Antiv: My name is Alain Antiv, 

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.666
 From Cameroon, aged 23 

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.166
 I live in a very modest environment, 

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.066
 She grew up in an orphaned father's family in Bamenda. 

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.066
 I have always dreamed 

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.033
 To be a doctor, 

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:21.833
 But I discovered that innovation in the medical field 

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:23.466
 Requires at least 30 years of experience. 

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.133
 But I was able to use mobile technology 

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.000
 To innovate and make change 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.633
 In people's lives at a much faster rate. 

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.366
 Tanako: My name is Konrad Tanko. 

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.700
 As a doctor, I took on a great challenge 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.066
 It is an attempt to solve a problem 

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.966
 Maternal and child mortality, 

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.400
 And the use of technology 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.966
 In devising this solution 

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.066
 Even in rural areas 

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.066
 This is one of the most important challenges for me. 

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.666
 Antif: The question that came to our mind, 

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.133
 "Why do we still have maternal and child mortality? 

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.666
 Why is it a big problem? " 

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.666
 After conducting a search, 

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.300
 We noticed that there was a problem with education. 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.500
 We saw that mobile is a great communication channel 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.966
 Thanks to its spread, 

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.600
 In collaboration with Dr. Conrad, 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 We decided to start the GiftedMom project. 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.166
 Tanko: Project GiftedMom is an application 

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.933
 Contains basic and simplified information 

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.833
 Related to pregnancy, breastfeeding, 

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.233
 And vaccinating children. 

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.033
 The beginning was a real adventure, 

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:13.366
 But after you finish designing the application and start testing it, 

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.366
 It was very exciting, 

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.833
 Because we saw a wonderful response from those who used the application, 

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:17.833
 It was exciting for them as well. 

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.266
 So it's technology 

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.466
 Some of them have never seen it before, 

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.533
 Because everything was available on one application, 

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.933
 Everyone loved his acquisition. 

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.266
 Antif: It was of great importance to us 

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.933
 We design a GiftedMom application 

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:29.933
 So that it is light 

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.000
 It is easy to download. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.933
 We also provided content 

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.800
 It can be used even without Internet. 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.433
 Tanako: The network coverage in Cameroon is very good. 

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.733
 Even in some rural areas 

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.233
 Where there is no electricity, 

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.500
 You can use the Internet. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.766
 Antif: We noticed that 70% of smartphone users 

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:48.833
 In Africa, they use Android. 

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:50.033
 We wanted to take advantage of that 

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.333
 Bringing the number of users in Africa to 5 million 

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.466
 Over the next three years. 

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.400
 TANKU: In fact, there are more maternal deaths 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.300
 Children are a global problem. 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.800
 We are not just targeting Cameroon 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.333
 We seek to spread this concept in other developing countries. 

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.666
 Antif: There is a desire to spend a lot of resources 

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:05.266
 Construction of health facilities, 

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.833
 In the long term. 

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:08.566
 But now we can benefit 

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:12.500
 Of the spread of smart phones in providing life-saving information. 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.400
 How glad we were to deploy the GiftedMom application 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.866
 On the Play Store, 

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:18.533
 Because it was one of the first products that interested, 

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:22.233
 It was also interesting that we were sitting in our room 

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:23.666
 We design things and then publish them 

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:26.133
 So that the entire world can reach it. 

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:27.933
 Taco: When we were designing the application, it was some 

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.800
 [Unclear] Medical professionals say, 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 "Will this bear fruit? 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.266
 Do you have certainty that 

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:33.633
 The result will be useful? " 

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:34.633
 When we achieved the result, 

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:35.833
 All were surprised and dazzled, 

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:37.700
 They were very excited, 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.800
 Then browse the application 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.866
 They gave us a lot of ideas to develop it more. 

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.233
 That makes me really proud 

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:43.566
 And enthusiastic as well 

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:45.433
 To move forward. 

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:46.733
 Antif: It was inspiring 

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.666
 See the app you created and designed 

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:50.133
 Serves the intended purpose in 

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.566
 Our rural communities. 

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:53.933
 Every time a lady is in this rural area 

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:55.166
 Application 

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.433
 We see the slogan "GiftedMom," 

00:02:57.433 --> 00:02:59.800
 We are very happy. 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.033
 We promise ourselves, "We will do better things than that."
