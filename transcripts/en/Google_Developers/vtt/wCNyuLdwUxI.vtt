VIVIAN LUM: Discovery
and user retention

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.340
are two key problems developers
like you have to solve,

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.730
whether you're building
mobile apps or websites.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.440
Fragmentation across
platforms unfortunately

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.710
makes the situation
worse because you

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.120
as a developer just
don't have the time

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.130
to solve those same problems
for Android, iOS, and the web.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.620
My name is Vivian Lum.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.090
Today, I will introduce several
search features and tools

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.630
that will simplify your life
and help you get more users get

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.340
more re-engagement.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.600
First, let me
refresh your memory

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.850
about what we covered in our
last search DevByte video.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.550
You learned that app indexing
can drive re-engagement

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.460
because with your
content indexed,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.640
users can navigate directly
from Google Search results

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.890
into your app.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.720
It works for users who
have installed your app,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.680
but let's say I do not have
your app installed on my Android

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.290
phone.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.510
Can Google still help me as
a user find apps like yours?

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.080
The answer is yes.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.500
With app indexing,
Google can tell me

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.800
about the apps that contain
relevant content I'm

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.840
searching for.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.070
And best of all, I can easily
install them right away.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.330
For a while, when I
told some of my friends

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.230
I worked on app
indexing at Google,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.200
they immediately asked if
it works for their iPhones.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.240
Now, with app indexing
for iOS, Google

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.030
can help iPhone users get
to relevant in-app content

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.950
through the same deep
linking technology.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.500
So how do you get your app and
its content found on Google?

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.720
First, you need to make your
app deep linkable by setting up

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.630
deep links in your app.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.940
What are deep links?

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.270
Deep links are like
URLs for your app.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.610
It is what makes your in-app
content indexable by Google.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.930
Next, you need to link
your website to your app

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.880
so Google knows that a
given web URL actually

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.220
has a corresponding
app deep link,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.010
and here's how you can
annotate the link pairs.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.590
Besides building mobile apps,
many cross-platform developers

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.760
also maintain mobile websites.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.990
Suppose you do.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.310
How do you get your mobile
website found on Google, then?

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.620
We encourage you to first start
with our Mobile Friendly Test

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.470
to check out your website's
mobile friendliness,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.310
and then follow our tips
on Webmaster Mobile Guide

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.370
to make your mobile website
more search friendly.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.700
Alongside app indexing, which
helps Google surf the content

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.480
inside your app, you can
also broadcast the types

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.830
of interactions
your app supports

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.310
using a type of structure
data markup called

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.720
schema.org actions.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.710
For example, watch a TV
show, stream a video,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.370
play classical music.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.900
What are schema.org
actions, then?

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.010
Think of it as a
way to declare what

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.330
your content is how and where
users can interact with it.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.500
Together with Google
Voice Actions,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.260
it doesn't matter
whether a search is

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.920
done using text or voice,
and Google can easily

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.760
help users looking for
specific piece of content

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.070
to also discover
capabilities of your app.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.770
Let me give you an example.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.190
As a working mom, I found
myself always quite busy.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.070
So when I get a chance to
relax, my favorite thing to do

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.270
is to lounge on a couch, enjoy
a great movie or a TV show.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.400
The problem is I usually just
know the name of the show

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.430
and have no time to research
or whatsoever whether it's

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.200
worth my time or not.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.690
So I need to know if a show is
any good, where I can watch it.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.800
OK, Google.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.520
"Seinfeld."

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.830
With critic reviews
and watch actions,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.320
not only can I learn
more about a show,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.110
I can also find out
where to stream it.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.920
So if you have an app
with streamable content,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.530
how do you promote content
and actions on Google?

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.230
Just add a few lines of
markup to your website

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.190
and tells us exactly
where it can be

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.140
watched, what can be watched.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.290
The show is now over, and
I'm ready to take a bath

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.420
and go to bed.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.710
Hmm.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.700
Bubble bath with some
relaxing music would be nice.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.900
OK, Google.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.960
Play music on Tunein.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.519
FEMALE SPEAKER: Which genre
would you like to listen to?

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.930
VIVIAN LUM: Classical.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.988
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Playing classical.

00:04:23.988 --> 00:04:27.320
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.520
VIVIAN LUM: With
voice interaction API,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.910
your app can get
selection input from users

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.740
to help them complete a task.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.120
You can also close the
feedback loop with Google

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.070
by telling us completion
statuses using app indexing API

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.900
we launched a few months ago.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.750
Finally, after completing any
integration research, what's

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.920
more important to a developer
than seeing the actual impact?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.750
Whether you're a web
or app developer,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.050
you can simply log
on to Search Console

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.810
to see the traffic driven
to you from Google Search.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.920
Wow.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.290
There are indeed a lot of new
ways for you to get more users

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.000
and keep them engaged.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.540
Let me recap the steps.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.630
One, to get found on Google you
need to set up your deep links

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.010
and link your
website to your app.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.060
Two, to promote on
Google, you need

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.090
to annotate your
content and actions

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.140
and integrate with our APIs.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.060
By integrating
with Google Search,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.000
your mobile app and website
can have a better chance

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.490
to be discovered and
used by your users.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.410
To get started, check out
our developers website

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.450
at g.co/developersearch.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.890
Thank you for watching.
