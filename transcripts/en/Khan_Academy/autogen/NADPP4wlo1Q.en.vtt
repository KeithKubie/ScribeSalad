00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:01.680
 The equation is given to us 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.585
 -2u (y ^ 2 + su-3) 

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:12.585
 is equal to dy ^ 3 + 12u ^ 2 + fy. 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.748
 Pause the video and try 

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:21.260
 find the variables c, d and f. 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.020
 Okay, now let's solve it together. 

00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:24.483
 At first it may seem a little frightening. 

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.468
 We just have an equation to find 

00:00:26.468 --> 00:00:28.272
 these three variables. 

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:29.986
 How will you do it? 

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:32.772
 A sensible approach would be 

00:00:32.772 --> 00:00:35.546
 to simplify what we have here on the left. 

00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:37.984
 To simplify it, we can simply uncover the brackets 

00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:41.255
 and multiply it in this multi-member, 

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.041
 by (u ^ 2 + su - 3). 

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:45.760
 And then in the equality to see 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.673
 whether we can tie the odds. 

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.112
 So let's reveal the brackets. 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.800
 Let's first think how much -2 u of u ^ 2. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.820
 This is minus 2u ^ 3. 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.484
 Since the y of the first y of the square is y of the third degree. 

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:13.460
 Okay, now, let's multiply-2 on su. 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.180
 This is minus 2 per cent 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.109
 and then there is a y y. 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.348
 Consequently, minus 2% ^ 2. 

00:01:25.348 --> 00:01:29.724
 And then we will multiply minus 2u on ... 

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:31.710
 not forgetting, 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.103
 that we bring out 3 here, 

00:01:33.103 --> 00:01:36.580
 so we can treat it as minus 3. 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.260
 Minus 2 minus 3 is plus 6, 

00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:43.319
 and there we have that y. 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.188
 Done, we have simplified 

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:48.403
 the left side of this equation. 

00:01:48.403 --> 00:01:49.782
 Now let's see if ... 

00:01:49.782 --> 00:01:50.981
 Let me actually write 

00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:52.757
 the right side with different colors 

00:01:52.757 --> 00:01:55.102
 and then we can just think of it. 

00:01:55.102 --> 00:01:58.248
 This third grade member, 

00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:00.279
 member y ^ 3 is blue, 

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:03.240
 so let me write the article u ^ 3 here also with blue. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.945
 So, yes. 

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:08.719
 And then I wrote the article u ^ 2 with purple, 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.041
 so let me also write the article y ^ 2 with purple. 

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:13.966
 Plus 12th of a square. 

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:16.357
 And then, finally, but not least, 

00:02:16.357 --> 00:02:18.220
 I have written this first-degree member in green - this article, 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.257
 so let me write the first grade member 

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:25.355
 here is also green, plus fy. 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.140
 And when you look at it this way, you see 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.500
 which members coincide with which other members. 

00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:34.979
 We can see that 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.581
 here I have a third degree member. 

00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:39.123
 This must correspond to this third grade member there. 

00:02:39.123 --> 00:02:44.123
 So d should be equal to minus 2. 

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.393
 Let's record it, 

00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:48.344
 d is equal to -2. 

00:02:48.344 --> 00:02:50.114
 We see the second grade member. 

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:51.554
 This second-grade member responds 

00:02:51.554 --> 00:02:54.108
 of this second grade member there. 

00:02:54.108 --> 00:02:57.695
 So this shows us that this factor 12 

00:02:57.695 --> 00:03:01.073
 should be equal to -2c. 

00:03:01.073 --> 00:03:05.578
 Let's write it down, -2c is equal to 12. 

00:03:05.578 --> 00:03:09.954
 To find with we can divide the two sides into -2. 

00:03:09.954 --> 00:03:15.654
 c is equal to 12 divided by -2, which is -6. 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.720
 There is logic in that c is -6, 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.780
 removing 2 by -6, 

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:23.908
 is subtracting -12, 

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:26.613
 which will be the same as the addition of 12. 

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:28.749
 Then we get exactly the same factor 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:30.932
 for the second degree member. 

00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:32.870
 I think you can see where things are going. 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.215
 Here we have six for the first grade member. 

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.491
 Here we have fy in the first grade member. 

00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:39.673
 This f should be the same, 

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:42.007
 must be equal to the coefficient here. 

00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:45.791
 So f must be equal to 6. 

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.929
 And we're ready. 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:49.785
 And the key to understanding here is that you connect 

00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:51.851
 members with the appropriate degree. 

00:03:53.325 --> 00:03:56.866
 I do not want to be too complicated, 

00:03:56.866 --> 00:03:58.909
 but the simplest way to find it, 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.569
 is like realizing: "Okay, I have a third degree member here, 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.253
 I have a third degree member here as well. 

00:04:02.253 --> 00:04:04.830
 If I look at it simply enough, the way 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.223
 I will get this third grade member here, 

00:04:06.223 --> 00:04:07.825
 is by using this third grade member. " 

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:09.265
 And I just look at the odds and say, 

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:11.923
 "Okay, they have to have the same odds." 

00:04:11.923 --> 00:04:14.721
 And then I say "d is equal to minus 2", 

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.555
 and then proceed in the same way.
