Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World
History, and today we're going to talk about

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.640
nationalism, the most important global phenomenon
of the nineteenth century and also the phenomenon

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.860
responsible for one of the most commented-upon
aspects of Crash Course, my globes being out of date.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.220
USS "R" not a country! [Explosion noise.]
Rhodesia? [Explosion noise.]

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.520
South Vietnam? [Explosion noise.]
Sudan with no South Sudan? [Explosion noise.]

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.580
Yugoslavia? [Explosion noise.]

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.800
Okay, no more inaccuracies with the globes.
Ahhh, the little globes!

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.540
This one doesn't know about Slovakia [explosion
noise],

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.659
this one has East-frackin' Pakistan [explosion
noise]

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.999
and this one identifies Lithuania as part
of Asia [explosion noise].

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.660
Okay, no more globe inaccuracies. Actually,
bring back my globes. I feel naked without them.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:49.520
[theme music]

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.660
So if you're into European history, you're
probably somewhat familiar with nationalism

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.129
and the names and countries associated with
it. Bismarck in Germany, Mazzini and Garibaldi

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.769
in Italy and Mustafa Kemal, a.k.a. Ataturk,
in Turkey.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.820
But nationalism was a global phenomenon, and
it included a lot of people you may not associate

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.660
with it, like Muhammad Ali in Egypt and also
this guy [Lincoln].

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.800
Nationalism was seen in the British dominions
as Canada, Australia and New Zealand became

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.070
federated states between 1860 and 1901. I
would say "independent states" instead of

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.040
federated states, but you guys still have
a queen!

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.160
It was also seen in the Balkans, where Greece
gained its independence in 1832 and Christian

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.910
principalities fought a war against the Ottomans
in 1878. In India, where a political party,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.390
the Indian National Congress, was founded
in 1885, and even in China, where nationalism

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.410
ran up against the dynastic system that had
lasted more than two thousand years.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.670
And then, of course, there are these guys
[Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito], who in many

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.420
ways, represent the worst of nationalism,
the nationalism that tries to deny or eliminate

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.370
difference in the efforts to create a homogeneous,
mythologized unitary polity. We'll get to

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.940
them later, but it's helpful to bring them up now
just so we don't get too excited about nationalism.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.960
Okay, so before we launch into the history,
let's define the modern nation-state. Definitions

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.700
are slippery, but for our purposes, a nation-state
involves a centralized government that can

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.440
claim and exercise authority over a distinctive
territory. That's the state part. It also

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.500
involves a certain degree of linguistic and
cultural homogeneity - that's the nation part.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.020
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! By that definition, China was
a nation-state by, like, probably the Han dynasty.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.099
Dude, Me From the Past, you're
getting smart! Yeah, it could be, and some

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.510
historians argue that it was. Nationhood is
really hard to define. Like in James Joyce's

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.159
Ulysses, the character Bloom famously says
that a nation is "the same people living in

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.659
the same place," but then he remembers the
Irish and Jewish Diasporas and adds, "or also

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.209
living in different places." But let's ignore
Diasporas for the moment and focus on territorially-bounded

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.150
groups with a common heritage. Same people,
same place.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.520
So how do you become a nation? Well, some
argue it's an organic process involving culturally-similar

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.120
people wanting to formalize their connections; others
argue that nationalism is constructed by governments,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.400
building a sense of patriotism through compulsory
military service and statues of national heroes.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.499
Public education is often seen as part of
this nationalizing project. Schools and textbooks

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:59.040
allow countries to share their nationalizing
narratives, which is why the once and possibly-future

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.099
independent nation of Texas issues textbooks
literally whitewashing early American history.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.370
Still, other historians argue that nationalism
was an outgrowth of urbanization and industrialization,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.829
since new urbanites were the most likely people
to want to see themselves as part of a nation.

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.779
For instance, Prague's population rose from
157,000 to 514,000 between 1850 and 1900,

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:23.779
at the same time that the Czechs were beginning
to see themselves as separate from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.419
Which is a cool idea, but it doesn't explain
why other less-industrialized places like

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.419
India also saw a lot of nationalism.

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:34.219
The actual business of nationalization involves
creating bureaucracies, new systems of education,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.900
building a large military, and often using
that military to fight off other nation-states,

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.639
since nations often construct themselves in
opposition to an idea of otherness. A big

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.249
part of being Irish, for instance, is not
being English.

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:51.389
So emerging nations had a lot of conflicts,
including the Napoleonic Wars, which helped

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.650
the French become the French, the Indian Rebellion
of 1857, which helped Indians to identify

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.919
themselves as a homogeneous people, the American
Civil War - I mean, before the Civil War,

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.669
many Americans thought of themselves not as
Americans, but as Virginians or New Yorkers

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:10.469
or Pennsylvanians. I mean, our antebellum
nation was usually called "THESE United States."

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.289
After, it became THE United States.

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:18.120
So in the U.S, nationalism pulled a nation
together, but often, nationalism was a destabilizing

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.000
force for multiethnic land-based empires.
This was especially the case in the Ottoman

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.820
Empire, which started falling apart in the
nineteenth century as first the Greeks, then

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.400
the Serbs, Romanians, and Bulgarians, all
predominantly Christian people, began clamoring

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.780
for and, in some cases winning, independence.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.690
Egypt is another good example of nationalism
serving both to create a new state and to

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.280
weaken an empire. Muhammad Ali, who was actually
Albanian and spoke Turkish, not Egyptian Arabic,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.580
and his ruling family encouraged the Egyptian
people to imagine themselves as a separate nationality.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.340
But okay, so nationalism was a global phenomenon
in the nineteenth century, and we can't talk

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.330
about it everywhere, so instead, we're going
to focus on one case study: Japan. You thought

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.910
I was going to say Germany, didn't you? Nope.
You can bite me, Bismarck.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.040
Japan had been fragmented and feudal until
the late sixteenth century, when a series

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.470
of warrior landowners managed to consolidate
power. Eventually, power came to the Tokugawa

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.780
family, who created a military government,
or bakufu.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.370
The first Tokugawa to take power was Ieyasu,
who took over after the death of one of the

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.200
main unifiers of Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi,
sometimes known as "The Monkey," although

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.890
his wife called him - and this is true - "The
Bald Rat."

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.990
In 1603, Ieyasu convinced the emperor, who
was something of a figurehead, to grant him

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.400
the title of shogun. And for the next 260
years or so, the Tokugawa bakufu was the main

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.660
government of Japan. The primary virtue of
this government was not necessarily its efficiency

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.920
or its forward-thinking policies, but its
stability. Stability: the most underrated

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.650
of governmental virtues. Let's go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.250
The Tokugawa bakufu wasn't much for centralization,
as power was mainly in the hands of local

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.060
lords called daimyo. One odd feature of the
Tokugawa era was the presence of a class of

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.080
warriors who, by the nineteenth century, had
become mostly bureaucrats. You may have

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.000
heard of them: the samurai.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.820
One of the things that made this hereditary
class so interesting was that each samurai

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.120
was entitled to an annual salary from the daimyo
called a stipend. This privilege basically paid them

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.960
off and assured that they didn't become restless
warriors, plaguing the countryside - that is, bandits.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.500
We tend to think of samurai as noble and honorable,
but urban samurai, according to Andrew Gordon's

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.050
book A Modern History of Japan, they were
"a rough-and-tumble lot. Samurai gang wars

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.290
- a West Side Story in the shadows of Edo
Castle - were frequent in the early 1600s."

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.360
And you still say that history books are boring.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.320
As with kings and lesser nobles anywhere,
the central bakufu had trouble controlling

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.330
the more powerful daimyo, who were able to
build up their own strength because of their

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.060
control over local resources. This poor control
also made it really difficult to collect taxes,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.000
so the Tokugawa were already a bit on the
ropes when two foreign events rocked Japan.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.040
First was China's humiliating defeat in the
Opium Wars, after which Western nations forced

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.360
China to give Europeans special trade privileges.
It was a wake-up call to see the dominant

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.350
power in the region so humbled, but even worse
for the Tokugawa was the arrival of Matthew

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.400
Perry. No, Thought Bubble, Matthew Perry.
Yes, that one.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.930
The Tokugawa are somewhat famous for their
not-so-friendly policy toward foreigners,

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.840
especially Western Christian ones, for whom the
penalty for stepping foot on Japanese soil was death.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.380
The Tokugawa saw Christianity in much the
same way as the Romans had, as an unsettling

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.060
threat to stability. And in the case of Matthew
Perry, they had reason to be worried.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.390
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So the American naval
commodore arrived in Japan in 1853 with a

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.080
flotilla of ships and a determination to open
Japan's markets.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.000
Just the threat of American steam-powered
warships was enough to convince the bakufu

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.810
to sign some humiliating trade treaties that
weren't unlike the ones that China had signed

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.420
after losing the Opium Wars.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.310
And this only further motivated the daimyo
and samurai, who were ready to give the Tokugawa

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.580
the boot. Within a few years, they would.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.080
So what does this have to do with nationalism?
Well, plenty. First off, even though the Americans

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.280
and the Japanese didn't go to war... yet,
the perceived threat provided an impetus for

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.580
Japan to start thinking about itself differently.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.340
It also resulted in the Japanese being convinced
that if they wanted to maintain their independence,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.830
they would have to reconstitute their country
as a modern nation-state.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.430
This looks a lot like what was happening in
Egypt or even Germany, with external pressures

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.900
leading to calls for greater national consolidation.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.930
So the Tokugawa didn't give up without a fight,
but the civil war between the stronger daimyo

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.840
and the bakufu eventually led to the end of
the shogunate.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.430
And in 1868, the rebels got the newly-enthroned
Emperor Meiji to abolish the bakufu and proclaim

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.200
a restoration of the imperial throne. Now
the emperor didn't have much real power, but

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.800
he became a symbolic figure, a representative
of a mythical past around whom modernizers

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.090
could build a sense of national pride.
And in place of bakufu, Japan created one

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.410
of the most modern nation-states in the world.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.180
After some trial and error, the Meiji leaders
created a European-style cabinet system of

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.690
government with a prime minister, and in 1889,
promulgated a constitution that even contained

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.780
a deliberative assembly, the Diet, although
the cabinet ministers weren't responsible to it.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.840
Samurai were incorporated into this system
as bureaucrats and their stipends were gradually

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.340
taken away. And soon the Japanese government
developed into, like, something of a meritocracy.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.980
Japan also created a new conscript army. Beginning
in 1873, all Japanese men were required to

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.940
spend three years in the military. The program
was initially very unpopular - there were

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.360
more than a dozen riots in 1873 and 1874, in
which crowds attacked military registration centers.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.279
But eventually, serving in the army created
a patriotic spirit and a loyalty to the Japanese

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:16.980
emperor. The Meiji leaders also instituted
compulsory education in 1872, requiring both

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.560
boys and girls to attend four years of elementary
school. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter?

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.200
An Open Letter to Public Education. But first,
let's see what's in the Secret Compartment today.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:36.480
Oh, it's a graduation hat. Thanks, Meredith the
intern, for letting me borrow your graduation hat.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.640
Dear Public Education, When you were introduced
in Japan, you were very unpopular, because

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.650
you were funded by a new property tax. In
fact, you were so unpopular that at least

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.420
two thousand schools were destroyed by rioters,
primarily through arson.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.600
Stan, it doesn't look good when you bring
it in close like that. I look like a 90-year-old swimmer.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.180
And even though public education has proved
extremely successful, lots of people still

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.620
complain about having to pay taxes for it,
so let me explain something.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.700
Public education does not exist for the benefit
of students or for the benefit of their parents.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.990
It exists for the benefit of the social order.
We have discovered as a species that it is

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.380
useful to have an educated population.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.860
You do not need to be a student or have a
child who is a student to benefit from public

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.940
education. Every second of every day of your
life, you benefit from public education!

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.000
So let me explain why I like to pay taxes
for schools, even though I don't personally

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.580
have a kid in school. It's because I don't like
living in a country with a bunch of stupid people.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.380
Best wishes,
John Green.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.650
In Japan, nationalism meant modernization,
largely inspired by, and in competition with,

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.490
the West. So the Meiji government established
a functioning tax system, they built public

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:42.000
infrastructure like harbors and telegraph
lines, invested heavily in railroads and created

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.800
a uniform national currency.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.940
But the dark side of nationalism began to
appear early on. In 1869, the Meiji rulers

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.040
expanded Japan's borders to include the island
of Hokkaido, and in 1879, they acquired Okinawa

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.640
after forcing its king to abdicate.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.760
In 1874, Japan even invaded Taiwan with an
eye toward colonizing it, though they weren't

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.320
successful. And in these early actions, we
already see that nationalism has a habit of

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.040
thriving on conflict. And often, the project
of creating a nation-state goes hand-in-hand

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.380
with preventing others from doing the same.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.470
This failure to imagine the other complexly
isn't new, but it's about to get a lot more

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.080
problematic, as we'll see next week, when we
discuss European imperialism. Thanks for watching.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.500
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.060
We're ably interned by Meredith Danko and
our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.160
Raoul Meyer: Also, the show was written by
my high school history student, John Green,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.380
and myself, Raoul Meyer.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.520
John: Last week's phrase of the week was "bearded
Marxist." If you'd like to guess at this week's

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.910
phrase of the week or suggest future ones,
you can do so in comments, where you can also

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.300
ask questions about today's video that will
be answered by our team of historians. Thanks

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.960
for watching Crash Course, and as we say in
my hometown, don't forget to be awesome!
