(Destin) Alright man, so the organization is called Not Forgotten.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.050
So, what does that mean?
- Not Forgotten. Ah, we're basically

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.060
telling the kids that they are not forgotten. Um.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.090
That despite the fact that they've been abandoned or abused, that people are out there who care about them

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.100
and love them.
- Got it, and that's you?
- That's us.
-Got it.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.130
-We're on their team.
- Excellent. Alright, so let's do this.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.160
Not Forgotten. Hey it's me Destin, welcome to

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.170
Iquitos Peru. It's a city of 400,000 and we're in morning rush hour

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.200
traffic. For the last week a buddy of mine named CJ and I have been working

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.240
on a concrete crew. We're working on a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
septic tank for an orphanage. It's pretty awesome. So today,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.280
we're gonna learn about how to use levers. You'd be amazed what they can do with simple

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.310
machines down here. You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.330
[Music]

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.360
OK I'm gonna use my lunch to teach you about levers.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.380
For levers there's three things you need to know and that's F R E 1 2 3.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.410
F is fulcrum. Fulcrum is the point that you pivot about.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.450
R is resistance. In this case it's the fish that I'm gonna eat, and E is the effort.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.470
So when I push down on the effort, then I pick up my resistance by pivoting

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.510
on my fulcrum. For a class 1 lever, the fulcrum is in the middle.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.550
For a class 2 lever, the resistance is in the middle, the fulcrum's on one side

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.590
and the effort's on the other. And finally for class 3,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.630
the effort's in the middle, and the fulcrum and the resistance are on the outsides.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.670
F R E 1 2 3. Whatever letter,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.720
corresponds with the number, that is what is in the center of the lever. Check out this video from

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.770
the work site and see if you can identify different classes of levers.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.900
(Destin) That's smart.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.450
[Dialogue in Spanish]

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.500
So what's really cool about this project is we're able to use our time,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.530
talent and knowledge to work on something much larger than ourselves. It's really fun

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.580
but if you think about it, it's not the first time that levers have been used in Peru to build something really big

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.640
out of smaller things is it. Anyway if you think this project's pretty cool and you want to donate to

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.640
the effort, use us and Not Forgotten as the fulcrum, and then lift up abandoned children,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.010
then all you have to do is check out the link in the video description below and you can donate if you're interested

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.050
in that. If not, just remember this. F R E 1 2 3

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.100
and you can always remember what class a lever is. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.200
Have a good one. So here on the job site there's only one rule,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.270
and that's obey the pepe. Si pepe? [laugh]

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.280
Fidel is the boss and you do what he says. If he says do it, you do it fast,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.290
you jump, si? That works.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.310
I'm a mechanical engineer so I'm focusing on the details of the structure

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.350
and this is my buddy CJ. He is a systems engineer so he's focusing on

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.400
the overall project, getting things done. And we are here at a home for boys.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.420
This is kind of what we're trying to set up with Not Forgotten.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.440
Oh. Limit.
- Limitus.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.480
(Destin) It's close to calculus. So you're almost doing calculus.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.520
That's awesome. So you can see here in the boys home

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.540
they're learning all kinds of cool stuff.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.680
So that's what we're trying to do

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.700
[laugh]
