[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:20.490
IKAI LAN: Hi, everybody.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.260
Welcome to another edition of
"Google Developers Live." My

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.420
name is Ikai Lan.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.220
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Arun
Nagarajan here.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.330
IKAI LAN: Just before we get
started, I want to tell all of

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.150
our live viewers that the
Hangout button will

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.670
unfortunately not be
working today.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.190
We love seeing you, we love
talking to you guys, but it's

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.310
not going to be working,
so don't keep trying.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.320
I'll remind every five minutes
for the people that are

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.560
jumping on a little bit later.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.450
It's going to sound like a
broken record, but I'd rather

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.810
let you guys know than to have
people sit there and try to

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.700
jump in and not be
able to do so.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.790
So why don't we go ahead
and get started.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.330
We've got a--

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.960
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Let's do it.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.260
IKAI LAN: --good show
for you guys today.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.990
First off, I've got
two announcements.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.640
We have two special shows.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.970
They're going to be live, but
we're going to post them onto

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.530
YouTube.com/googledevelopers.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.380
The two shows are--

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.940
Arun's doing a really
good one tomorrow.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.610
It's going to be about
Salesforce.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.800
And I'm going to be doing
one about triggers.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.196
So why don't you go ahead and
tell them a little about the

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:10.540
show you're doing tomorrow.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.740
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.470
A little plug.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.280
So Salesforce.com, as a lot of
you guys know, is a very

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.250
popular cloud-based
CRM system--

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.460
IKAI LAN: Is it?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.690
Is it now?

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: --a lot
of businesses--

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.470
IKAI LAN: Yes.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.620
Salesforce is very popular.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.390
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And us being
a cloud-scripting language,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.490
there's a lot of synergy there
that we figure we should do a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.690
GDL about, show you guys how
you can connect, both send

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.250
data up and also receive files
and data back and show it on a

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.340
spreadsheet, put
it on the site.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.090
Lots of cool stuff.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.610
So hopefully, you'll join us
tomorrow and get a sense for

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.440
what that's like and how easy
it is to get started.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.290
And hopefully, you'll walk away
with some recipes that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.640
you can try out yourself.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.600
IKAI LAN: And I will definitely
be watching that

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.970
show, partly because
I think I'm on it.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.190
So I will be here tomorrow.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.190
So if you aren't completely sick
of the two of us, join us

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.700
either live tomorrow at--

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.300
I think it's either 4 o'clock
or 4:30 Eastern--

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.920
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Check
our G+ page.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.670
IKAI LAN: Yeah, check either
our G+ page or

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.930
developers.google.com/live.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.210
I think it's either
4:00 or 4:30.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.450
I'm pretty sure it's
4:30, though.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.900
ARUN NAGARAJAN: We'll
be there.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.985
IKAI LAN: It's an hour long.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:09.745
I think it's 4 o'clock, yeah.

00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:11.630
It's a little bit longer than
our normal shows, which are

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.350
half an hour.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.990
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Actually,
I just remembered.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.050
It's 3:00 to 4:00 Eastern.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.450
IKAI LAN: There you go.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.020
Yeah.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.670
Check the schedule.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.990
I'm sorry about that.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.560
We change time zones so much
when we're talking to people.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.970
And I'm doing a show next--

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.640
I believe it's next Tuesday--
again, check

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.900
developers.google.com/live.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.890
It's about triggers.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.630
This one is a little bit
more beginner level.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.440
But a lot of people use Apps
Script, and you're used to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.280
spreadsheet functions and
working with Docs.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.030
But what you don't know is that
you can schedule things.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.280
You can have code be executed
when spreadsheets are open.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.770
Not a lot can happen when a
spreadsheet's open, but you

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.730
can do things on
certain events.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.660
And I'm going to be talking
about how to do this as well

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.530
as some advanced techniques
of things

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.420
you can do with triggers.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.750
For instance, one thing that a
lot of people run into is, how

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.870
do I make a script that
basically runs forever?

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.520
Well, it's kind of
difficult, right?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.000
If you know your script's
going to run for

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.710
two hours, you can't.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.286
Because there's a timeout
on how long your

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.170
script can run for.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.250
However, if you change triggers,
it is more or less

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.750
possible to simulate this.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.840
And it's a little bit
more durable, too.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.510
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Another
use case is workflows.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.150
IKAI LAN: Workflows, yes.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.890
We have a script that
we're working on.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.700
It's a little bit secret.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.250
No, it's not like anything
world-changing or anything.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.650
I'll be talking a little bit
about that and how I'm using

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.350
clock triggers to work with
documents that are essentially

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.520
destructible documents, which
you give them out, and after a

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.160
certain amount of time,
they go away.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.490
So we'll be talking about
that next Tuesday.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.030
Just check
developers.google.come/live.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.710
Now again, I know I'm going to
be repeating myself a lot.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.260
Do not try to join
the Hangout.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.670
It's not going to work
for you guys.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.260
They were very, very
sorry about this.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.820
And hopefully, we'll have this
working at some point.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.580
OK, I think that's
it for the plugs.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.630
Why don't we go ahead and let's
go and get started.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.800
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Didn't
you want to say

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.050
hello to someone special?

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.120
IKAI LAN: I did.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.420
The someone special
is Rudy Lehman.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.410
We met you at the Los
Angeles Hackathon.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.190
This was on November 13.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.130
We ran into Rudy, and he said
he watched the show

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.740
religiously and I
was like, wow!

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.610
We have real fans.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.399
Rudy drove all the way from
Phoenix-- either drove or

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.800
flew-- from Phoenix
to Los Angeles--

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.589
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It was
quite the trip, yeah.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.010
IKAI LAN: --so he could
participate in our Hackathon,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.550
which you gave me a pretty good
segue into talking about

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.120
the Hackathon.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.460
First off, if anyone is watching
from Los Angeles, hi.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.290
We had a great time
meeting you guys.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.250
Hope you liked the office.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.110
I'm really sorry about the
confusion at the beginning.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.630
But I'm really glad how
the event came out.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.610
We had some really great demos
where people came out and

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.090
built things like a conference
room scheduler, am I spending

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.510
too much of my life
typing meanings?

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.720
Just a lot of really
good developers.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.270
And we're really happy
to have met you guys.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.930
I know that you met some
cool people, too.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.000
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yes, some very
creative folks that come from

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.870
all walks of development some
folks that work for the city

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.560
of LA, some folks that work in
schools, some folks that are

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.180
professional programmers that
just code all day and wanted

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.405
to come and go to the
Hackathon as well.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:08.550
So really interesting to get the
diverse set of developers

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.410
that use our product and get a
lot of first-hand feedback.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.020
I know Drew, who was one of our
core engineers that was

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.030
there, he really appreciated
meeting a lot of

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.790
you folks as well.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.870
It was really worthwhile for us,
and hopefully, it was for

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.470
you as well.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.470
We'll probably do a follow-up
blog post just highlighting

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.760
some of the apps that we got to
know and discuss a little

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.860
bit about what we learned
at the event as well.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.950
IKAI LAN: The food truck
guys, I hope

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.950
those guys are watching.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.720
I really liked many
of you guys.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.130
We had these two guys
that worked for

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.450
a food truck company.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.545
And I was looking at their
keyboards, going, what are all

00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:44.130
these rubber things
on their keyboard?

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.460
And their laptops-- let's be
fair-- they were really

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.870
disgusting.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.950
And they told me, we're
really sorry.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.990
We work for a food truck.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.770
There's food everywhere
all the time.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.620
It's getting all
over the place.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.200
But these two guys came out.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.070
They built a system
for hiring and

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.120
distributing employees around.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.120
Very, very cool.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.790
I was happy to meet them and see
that they were doing cool

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:04.230
stuff through Apps.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.440
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Exciting.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.780
Shall we do release notes?

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.160
IKAI LAN: Yeah, go for it.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.408
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All right.

00:06:09.408 --> 00:06:09.470
Cool.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.190
IKAI LAN: I don't think
there's anything super

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.040
earth-shattering in these
releases, but we're spending a

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.260
lot of time to really
just improve the

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.890
polish of Apps Script.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:17.160
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.750
Great.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.420
I think the last Office Hours
we held was on the 14th.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.630
And since then, we've actually
had two releases, one on the

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.770
21st and another one earlier
this week on the 28th.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.500
Yesterday, actually.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.370
A few things that are
worth noting.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.390
There was an issue around
the lock service.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.030
So if you tried to gather a
lock too quickly and then

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.930
release it subsequently, some
of the releases were not

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.450
getting queued up properly.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.820
So you would run into
an issue where you

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.000
could not get new locks.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.470
It would timeout, and it
would just say that you

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.370
don't have a lock.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.610
So we fixed that issue.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.760
We re-allowed the ability to
have multiple addresses

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.780
in the reply to.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.430
IKAI LAN: Yay!

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.850
I didn't know you
could do that.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.190
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You were able to
do that, and at some point,

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.410
there was a mistake, and
we could only do one.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.170
And the third one that we
fixed on the 21st was

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.640
something with the
editor, actually.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.080
So if you have a library that
has HTML content in it, the

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.130
auto-complete stopped working
in the editor.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.490
It was not a runtime issue.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.010
It was sort of an authoring
development issue.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.670
But nonetheless, it was painful
for our developers,

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.860
and we went ahead
and fixed it.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.800
And then the subsequent
release, a bunch of

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.180
enhancements as well.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.720
We did an enhancement to allow
you to retrieve the BCC

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.390
address for an outgoing
email message that you

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.390
may have access to.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.840
So when you're parsing an inbox,
if you authored an

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.330
email or the person that's
running the script authored an

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.420
email, you could find out the
BCC address for that message

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.000
and then do interesting
things with it.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.990
A long-standing issue with
the On Submit trigger not

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.730
returning the right values
in the event callback.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.700
So when you got the data
range, it was returning

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.960
incorrect top and
bottom indices.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.680
And that caused a
lot of problems.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.830
I think this one is probably
starred quite a bit in the

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.420
issue tracker.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.880
So we're happy to report
that that's fixed now.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.900
IKAI LAN: Keep starring
those issues.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.240
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yes.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.290
IKAI LAN: Keep starring them.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.330
Please star them.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.365
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yes.

00:08:15.365 --> 00:08:19.070
The next one was around
the auto-complete of

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.730
XML document function.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.720
This one was a little bit more
about the authoring aspect of

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.340
things and discovering
of what's capable.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.890
And then we updated the tree
widget, the UI app tree widget

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.360
to have some handlers
for opening and

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.500
closing of those nodes.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.280
That's one of the UI
app widgets that

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.820
we've recently improved.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.380
So those are some of
things we've done.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.299
Take a look at these.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:42.194
They're on the developers.googl

00:08:42.194 --> 00:08:46.070
e.com/apps-script site.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.580
And if you just scroll to the
left on the bottom, there's a

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.540
section for release notes.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.510
So keep an eye on it.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.100
And if you keep an eye on it,
you'll notice that we do quite

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.470
a few releases.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.980
In November, we probably
averaged a release a week,

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.480
even with the holidays
and everything.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.530
And we'll keep them coming, and
at some point during the

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.490
holidays in December, there
will be a freeze.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.800
But hopefully, we'll
have a couple more

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.450
good releases to report.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.170
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.990
Again, the freeze is only a
production push freeze.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.330
It doesn't mean that we're
stopping work, although--

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.520
you're just full of
great ideas today.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.760
No, we're going to continue to
keep iterating and building

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.820
features and improving
the product.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.380
So again, to find these,
you can either go to

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.280
developers.google.com and click
through to apps-script.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.490
Or, me personally, I just like
to search for Apps Script

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.500
release notes.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.830
That brings me to something
we forgot to plug earlier.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.960
For those of you watching,
no Hangout today.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.740
Really sorry.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.140
But we've caught a couple good
blog posts, too, recently.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.390
Google Apps Developer blog.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:51.950
Is that right?

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.470
What is the exact URL?

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.720
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You
said it right.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.160
Googleappsdevelo
persblog.blogspot.com.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.840
IKAI LAN: Let's just tell
people to search for it.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.920
If you look for Google
Apps developer blog,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.610
you'll find the blog.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.920
We've got a couple pretty
good codes.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.540
We got one from Romain, who
always, always gives us these

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.310
great posts.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.900
Revevol is the name
of his company.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.330
Hopefully, I'm pronouncing
it correctly.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.020
But they're doing a lot of very
cool stuff with apps in

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.500
Apps Script.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.270
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.700
This one is a kind of
a utility script

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.570
that anyone can run.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.920
It's a really good example of
the power and simplicity yet

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.330
the effectiveness
of Apps Script.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.840
So I think it's, all
in all, just a few

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.170
dozen lines of script.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.290
But it allows you to set
reminders in a spreadsheet,

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.800
and then get email reminders,
and then be able to respond

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.970
and lots of unique things.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.940
You may not use it, but at
least you'll find it

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.110
interesting and useful to adapt
for your own purposes.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.380
IKAI LAN: I've been
working with Apps

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.380
Script a lot this week.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.320
I don't know what it is about
this week, where I just had

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.280
this whole backlog of things
I wanted to build.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.000
And I've been really happy
in the environment.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.150
There's this thing that I
thought would take me an hour

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.220
to do, and it ended up
taking five hours,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.200
which isn't a bad thing.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.100
It just means I was totally
lost in this thing.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.690
I forgot to eat lunch.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.030
And I forgot how awesome it
is to build stuff within

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.100
Spreadsheets.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.490
Go to Spreadsheets, Tools,
Script Editor.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.820
Because with Spreadsheets, you
automatically get this UI

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.090
where you can display data
and manipulate data.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.010
Now, the bad thing is that when
I wrote the script, I

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.080
told the clients that were
going to use the script.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.700
And again, I'm not
doing consulting.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.110
It's Google employees.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.280
I told them, don't edit anything
in the spreadsheet.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.950
Don't touch this stuff.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.630
So that's kind of the downside
of Spreadsheets is that if you

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.820
write a program outside of Apps
Script that accesses the

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.730
database and someone goes in the
database and just starts

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.250
messing with all the values.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:45.930
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You
don't want that.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.560
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.380
And what I'm working on right
now is kind of a pretty cool

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.620
thing with the URL shortener.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.150
It's because we're trying to
figure out, how are you guys

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.630
finding us?

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.060
How are you guys finding
about the show,

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.100
finding about the blog?

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.740
We want to know.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.910
We want to figure out if it's
coming from Twitter, Google+,

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.140
the blog, YouTube.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.630
We just want to look
at these things.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.070
So I'm working on a script,
and hopefully, that'll be

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.900
something that I can publish
or at least talk about in a

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.190
future show or article or
blog post or something.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.970
But let us know your comments.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.210
We really should have a feedback
box somewhere.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.210
People can drop and send--

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.740
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You can provide
feedback on the

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.120
documents that we have in
the developers site--

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.300
IKAI LAN: You can-- preferably
documents, right.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.340
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's a little
more contextual to the

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.790
help content that we have.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.920
Obviously G+ is a great
way to find us.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.230
Google+ is a great way to find
us and leave us comments and

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.960
questions there.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.160
Yeah, we should probably
have a--

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.820
IKAI LAN: Yeah, for now, what we
want to do is, we're going

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.250
to start planning out the
shows for next year.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.400
So if you have any ideas for
things you want to see or

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.080
things you want us to
do, drop us a line.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.620
Who has the easiest
email here?

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.270
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I think you.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.010
IKAI LAN: Really?

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:52.510
Really?

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.320
OK, yes.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:53.660
Maybe.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.680
My email is--

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:54.940
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Four letters.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.955
IKAI LAN: --ikai@google.com.

00:12:56.955 --> 00:12:58.060
ARUN NAGARAJAN: His
first name.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.680
IKAI LAN: Alternatively, you can
also email Kallion, who is

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.830
gkal@google.com.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.120
Four letter email addresses.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.510
Love this.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:11.950
Email either gkal@google.com or
ikai@google.com for ideas

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.510
about things you want to
see in future shows.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.680
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I think there's
a couple other blog

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.520
posts that I want
to talk about--

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.900
IKAI LAN: Oh, yeah.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.600
Go for it.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.560
ARUN NAGARAJAN: --the
one that Eric did.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.230
Eric Koleda.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.810
IKAI LAN: Yes.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.220
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It
was actually a

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.210
really good blog post.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.410
IKAI LAN: Forgot
about this one.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.450
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Underscore.js,
which is a great utility belt

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.220
library that most JavaScript
developers that I know use it

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.140
for a node js application or
a browser-based web app.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.620
Whatever it is, it's one of
those utilities scripts.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.800
It's sort of like what jQuery
is for dot manipulation.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.380
Underscore is for just general
programming niceness, so array

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:53.400
manipulation, finding things,
slicing maps, just the

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.330
shortening of forEach function
or paradigm, things like that.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.450
It just makes it
so much easier.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.260
And it's got a great name,
great way to access it--

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.980
underscore dot function name.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.960
It's got a templating syntax,
I just found out.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.920
So Eric wrote a great blog post
about how you bring in

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.840
these third-party open source
applications into the fold in

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.610
Apps Script by using the library
capabilities, both for

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.550
client side and server side
JavaScript, which I think is

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.810
really unique as well.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.270
So look through that, try it
out, provide us your feedback

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.260
and we'll continue finding ways
to support more of these

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.695
open-source libraries.

00:14:29.695 --> 00:14:30.090
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:30.850
Underscore is--

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.620
I really like this.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.300
Especially coming from a
language like Python or Ruby,

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.810
you're used to having an each
iterator or you're used to

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.820
lambdas or you're used to other
craziness like that.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.560
It's not crazy.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.540
It's cool stuff.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.700
And when you come to JavaScript,
JavaScript has a

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.900
lot of really good properties.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.990
It's also that the default data
types they tend to be

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.830
limited, right?

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:53.240
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.680
IKAI LAN: I don't know if you
guys ever worked with this one

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.550
library called Prototype.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.430
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Mm-hm, Yep.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.250
IKAI LAN: Prototype, back in the
day, they thought the best

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.730
approach was to go ahead and add
all these methods to array

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.340
and all that.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.910
And it just made everything
go crazy.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:06.740
So I think that's kind of--

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.570
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Not
very compatible.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.220
IKAI LAN: --fallen out of favor,
which is just extending

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.050
the base object.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.960
So something like Underscore
just wraps it instead.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.630
And I think we're seeing this
trend more of composition over

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.570
inheritance.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.540
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Did you
just start a debate?

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.330
IKAI LAN: Yeah, I did.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.290
There's only a few minutes left,
so I really shouldn't.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.640
I think there's no debate.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.780
I think wrap things,
just wrap things.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.520
Don't inherit.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.230
Inheritance is bad.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.050
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And then
there was another one

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.680
from a guest post.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.760
Actually, I forget his name.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.260
Tom.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.920
One of the Googlers that ended
up using Apps Script for a

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.470
personal project around an
auction house being able to

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:45.230
track the bids and then
following up with people.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.380
A really interesting use case.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.620
That one actually comes
with a video.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.850
Go check it out, see what the
interesting ways people are

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.070
using Apps Script.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.660
IKAI LAN: I remember seeing one
of the guys we met at the

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.310
Hackathon who works for
charter schools in LA.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.710
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.030
IKAI LAN: And the thing about
charter schools is--

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.590
I'm trying to define what
a charter school is.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.870
It's like a special school?

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It's still
a public school, from my

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.810
understanding, that has
limited enrollment.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:11.720
And there oftentimes ends up
being a lottery for admission.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.920
So when you have 30 spots for
a new incoming class, since

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.200
they may be in a close-by
neighborhood or they have good

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.520
teachers, and people try to
enroll in charter school, and

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.970
there's often a lottery involved
in picking who gets

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.820
to get those 30 slots.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.300
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.190
And the problem they were
trying to solve--

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.440
again, try to look at things
from a problem perspective--

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.630
was that you have hundreds of
thousands of entries, but he's

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.790
got to pull stuff out
of a hat, right?

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.780
And that used to be the old way
of doing it, pull stuff

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.280
out of a hat.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.960
But with hundreds of entries,
it's like, oh, my goodness,

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.150
this is insane.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.430
So instead, he's using Google
Forms to submit something.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.980
This all goes into a
spreadsheet, and he has a

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.540
custom menu that goes ahead
and just randomly starts

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.400
picking people out, saying,
hey, you're lucky.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.200
You get to go to
charter school.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.080
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And then showing
a trailing list on a

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.609
big monitor plugged into a
laptop showing stuff from

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:06.970
Google Spreadsheets
in a nice UI.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.720
IKAI LAN: A little
bit of theatrics.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:14.619
Little bit of pop-up, here's
your name, "you are" tribute.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:15.430
All right.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.420
Why don't we move
into some Q&amp;A?

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.329
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:19.390
Let's see here.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.109
Go to Moderator.

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.240
IKAI LAN: I looked at this a
little bit before the show,

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.800
and a common theme here is that
we've got a good amount

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.800
of what we call feature
requests.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.780
I've tried to answer these
in the comments.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.020
For instance, I'm looking at
some of these questions, and

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.960
some things like,
for instance--

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.580
whoa, some people are adding
some stuff in here.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.580
People are adding
questions live.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.960
That's not a bad thing.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.550
There's your pop-up calendar.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.730
For instance, there was
one I saw over here.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.430
"Can we use scripts in
spreadsheets on mobile devices

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.480
without desktop use?" Well,
there's nothing to

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.300
announce at this time.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.430
And that's a very,
very new product.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.620
We definitely--

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.970
we've been saying mobile
first, mobile first.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.550
I think we should start
putting our money

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.280
where our mouth is.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.540
But yes, that's something that
we're thinking about.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.230
We're always thinking about
these things, but we really

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.730
don't have anything to announce
at this time.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.860
So don't wait for that.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.080
Things you can do are, you can
build a web UI, and you can

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.290
access that via a
mobile phone.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.030
Of course, you're doing it
through your browser.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.810
ARUN NAGARAJAN: In fact, the
blog post that I mentioned,

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.430
they actually showcase
the tablets there.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.830
IKAI LAN: Cool.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.080
Cool.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.800
Very cool.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.260
Yeah, you're right,
the tablet stuff.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.820
I remember that post now.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.910
There's a few questions here
I wanted to get to first.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.550
There were two I wanted
to answer on the show.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.050
One was-- whoa!

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.520
There's a lot of stuff here.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.330
People are adding stuff live.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:42.740
There are two.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.870
One is, "What's the difference
between using Spreadsheets,

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.830
using ScriptDb, and using Fusion
Tables?" So let's start

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.160
with each of these,
one by one.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.900
Fusion Tables is--

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.940
it's a Google product that
allows you to use geodata and

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:04.290
create these really beautiful
overlays and maps using this

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.210
geodata that you can visualize
things going

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.820
on, locations and--

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.680
OK, you can tell that I'm not
really an expert on Fusion

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.530
Tables, but I used to
sit next to one.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.570
So I always just kind
of overhear things

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.430
they used to say.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.980
And you can do things like, you
can do a lot of the stuff

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.890
that you could do with
the maps API--

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.030
maps service--

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.970
in that you can do some
geocoding, you could do

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:27.100
bounding box queries.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.940
Bounding Box would be something
like show me

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.840
everything within a 5-mile
radius of this point.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.450
And you can just do
querying on this.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.400
So if you're building a service
that involves map

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.440
points, points of interest, you
probably want to look at

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.400
something like Fusion Tables.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.540
It's going to serve your
needs really well.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.830
Now, on the other hand, this
leaves Spreadsheets and

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.600
ScriptDb, when to use one,
when to use the other.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.140
I've been using Spreadsheets
a lot these last few days,

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.070
mostly because you get
a couple of benefits.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.700
You get a built-in UI.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.920
You get a ton of features.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.080
You get sorting, filtering.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.810
You can add charts
very easily.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.530
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Versioning.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.340
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.470
You get versioning?

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.010
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Versioning.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.260
IKAI LAN: Right, right.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.730
I actually never check
the version.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.360
Because there's too
many edits.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.810
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It does become
a lot of versions.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.240
IKAI LAN: But Spreadsheets
has a very nice UI.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.420
Now again, the downside is
something I mentioned earlier,

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.050
which is, because it has UI, if
you give it to people, you

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.780
give them a chance to
really break things.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.130
So that's Spreadsheets.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.550
ScriptDb, on the other hand,
is kind of neat, because

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.720
ScriptDb is, if you have a
single instance of a script,

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.310
you have a global ScriptDb
instance that's shared for all

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.110
users of the script.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.670
Now, you might be asking, why
would I want to do this?

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.000
You can technically also do this
via Spreadsheets if you

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.210
open a spreadsheet via ID.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.010
The difference is that there's
no UI for ScriptDb.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.170
The filter semantics and the
objects you can save in

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.080
ScriptDb tend to be a little
bit more robust.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.660
They look closer to JavaScript
objects.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.190
And you've got a little
bit better

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.060
programmatic query language.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:03.150
Like you can say show me all
the people that have an age

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.520
greater than 45.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.010
And that's much easier in
ScriptDb, whereas if you were

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.320
to do this in--

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.240
I think you should be able to
filter in Spreadsheets but

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.210
it's not quite as intuitive--

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.740
you get a few other
things in ScriptDb

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.740
that are kind of neat.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.630
But again, also appending to
Spreadsheets, you pretty much

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.540
only can append in
a row format.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.230
With ScriptDb, you can actually

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.640
have embedded objects.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.260
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.400
And they can be jagged.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.420
So one object can look
in one shape.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.340
Another object could be
completely different.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.880
And then you can actually have
them all in the same bucket.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.850
So it gives you a lot more
capability as far as the type

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:36.840
of things you store.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.340
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.110
The only thing about storing
objects of different types and

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.640
different shapes is that,
try to keep them fairly

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.350
consistent.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.690
Now, I don't like it when
it's too rigid.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.370
But if you keep it consistent,
like you have

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.170
three or four types--

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:49.490
ARUN NAGARAJAN: For indexing.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.490
IKAI LAN: --in your program,
it's going to be that crazy.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.750
If every single object that
you store looks totally

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.780
different, you're not going
to be able to do anything.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.070
You're going to drive
yourself nuts.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:02.190
So I think those are a lot
of the main differences.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.420
Anything else you want to add?

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:03.785
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah,
so I think--

00:22:03.785 --> 00:22:04.150
IKAI LAN: I feel like I'm
missing something.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.290
ARUN NAGARAJAN: No, it's a
great question, really.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:09.580
Because I find myself
using both.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.270
The question I ask myself is
what's the volume of data?

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.110
If it's just maybe a hundred--

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.790
IKAI LAN: That's a good point.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:17.010
ARUN NAGARAJAN: --couple hundred
rows of data, and I'm

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.660
mostly just appending very
tabular-looking data,

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.260
Spreadsheets is fine.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.490
But if I need to query something
based on various

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.635
filters, or if I don't know
ahead of time if there's going

00:22:28.635 --> 00:22:31.610
to be nested objects and things
like that, I usually

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.500
tend to go with ScriptDb, also
because it can store thousands

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.730
of records.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.720
The size limits there is based
on the total bytes rather the

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.340
number of records.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.030
So those are the two things
that I ask for is, am I

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:43.890
querying a lot?

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.590
And am I just appending?

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.408
Updates are a pain with
Spreadsheets as well, because

00:22:48.408 --> 00:22:48.750
you have to--

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.290
IKAI LAN: They are
kind of annoying.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.340
The thing about Spreadsheets and
ScriptDb to be aware of is

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.120
that the filtering options
only go so far.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.470
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.250
IKAI LAN: So if you're working
with a relatively small number

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.340
of objects-- and when I say
relatively small, I'd say a

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.770
couple hundred, maybe even
a couple thousand--

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.210
instead of trying to build
these incredibly complex

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.040
filters, it's sometimes easier
just to create something like

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.910
an array and just loop over
every single object and say

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.760
doesn't match, doesn't
match, doesn't match.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.880
This also makes your code in
some instances easier to test

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.940
and a little bit more robust.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.790
So it just depends on what
your specific needs are.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.040
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And then there's
actually a third

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.000
service besides Fusion
Tables called JDBC.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.390
So in fact, we have
Cloud SQL as well.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.050
So if you have hundreds of
thousands of rows and are used

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.790
to a relational database
querying mechanism through

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.490
SQL, we actually have an answer
for that as well.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.640
So depending on your background
and if tabular data

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.630
is the way to go for you, that
might be another option.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.860
And you can get a Cloud SQL
instance now for free up until

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.860
June, I think, for
testing purposes.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.140
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.980
And I think you've got a
certain amount of data.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.000
I don't remember what
the data limit is.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.270
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And I just saw
one up for testing myself, and

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.750
it was actually fairly pain
free, so try it out.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.070
IKAI LAN: Pain free.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.650
You kind of made up a word
between pain free and painful.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.840
It was kind of funny.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.660
Yeah, it is.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.940
But he is right, though.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.710
What you want to do is
you want to go to the

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.110
Google API's console.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.550
And you search for that
by going to Google.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.890
Search for Google API's console
is the easiest way.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.010
I never remember the exact
URL for things anymore.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:21.120
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Just search
for everything.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.600
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.080
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It's a good
thing we have one.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.950
IKAI LAN: That's just
how things are done.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:24.660
Yep.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.590
Good thing, too.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.480
So, yeah.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.150
Look for that, and you'll be
able to enable Cloud SQL and

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:29.830
start talking to it.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.652
We've got some samples
on developers.googl

00:24:31.652 --> 00:24:34.500
e.com/apps-script.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.610
Look there in the tutorials for
how to talk to Cloud SQL.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.290
I wanted to answer one more
question before the show ends.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.230
It's a question from--
hold on.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:47.040
It's the one about
working with UIs.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.770
Let me see.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.936
This thing.

00:24:50.936 --> 00:24:52.280
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Did you go
to the next page, maybe?

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.870
IKAI LAN: It could be.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:58.080
Anyway, the question was
something along the lines of,

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.100
when I'm working with a UI app,
it used to be that when

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.310
there was an error, it would
show the error in the

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.290
Spreadsheets or the UI
App or whatever.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.740
And now it doesn't
do it anymore.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.000
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Ah.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.320
There's the question.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.010
From Lenny.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.220
IKAI LAN: From Lenny
in Louisiana.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.530
"When an error occurs from UI,
it's just generic error now."

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.890
We'll look into this.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:15.940
I'm not sure--

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.170
we should find out if this is
what we intended to do.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.100
I'm not sure if it was.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.400
It says, "Before it
used to give you

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.160
the line of the problem.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.360
And for a novice scripter like
myself, that was a huge

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.030
advantage."

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.700
So I've been working with UIs
a lot these last few days.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.090
And when UIs start to get a
little more complex, there's

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:38.130
something called the model
view presenter pattern.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.600
I'm not going to overly
advocate it.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.200
But the idea is that in code
that you use to build the UI,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.530
try to make this as simple
as possible.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:48.100
And what you do is, you want
to abstract out some more

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.620
complex bits into these
functions that can run without

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.395
UI components.

00:25:51.395 --> 00:25:54.510
So an example is, this thing
I'm building for URL

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.370
shortening, for instance.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.210
I have a UI that pops up,
just asks you for a

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.830
URL and some options.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.870
It has a place that calls
a URL shortener.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.880
Now, in the beginning, I just
tested it as is, where I put

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.190
all the code in one function,
built the UI, built the

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.950
handler, whatever.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.150
And I was testing it like
running the code in the UI,

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:12.530
pushing the buttons, seeing
if it worked.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.060
And after a while this
got too hard.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.970
So instead, I took the URL
shortening part, which isn't

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.790
that complex, but there
was a bug there.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.060
I extracted it out into
its own function.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.770
I wrote a quick function
called test.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.510
And I did all my testing and
debugging within the scope of

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.720
the script editor.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.180
Now, this gets you most
of the way there.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.670
What it doesn't really help you
do is debug issues with

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.070
the UI itself.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.250
So that's going to
be problematic.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.360
But for the most part, you can
save yourself a lot of pain by

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.110
doing as much of your
development in the script

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.530
editor as possible.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:44.070
One of the feature requests that
we've seen from people is

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.400
give me a way to
do unit tests.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.740
Unit tests are these things
that, you write code that

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.440
validates whether your code
is working or not.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.530
Like right now, there are
different ways you could fake

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.350
it out in Apps Script, but
there's no real, always be

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.660
running this and tell
me what's failing.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.810
I think that'd be really
cool feature.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.290
But again, we don't
have anything to

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.020
announce about this.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.140
But that's one thing you want to
do is try to do as much of

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.700
your coding within the script
editor as possible and at the

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.450
last second link it
up with your UI.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.570
Now, this isn't always possible,
and when your UIs

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.430
get complex, it just
isn't possible.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.970
But try to hold off that pain
as long as possible.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:23.450
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Decouple.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.670
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.130
And this is true not just in
Apps Script, but in anything,

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.930
whether it's Google Web Toolkit,
whether you're

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:32.160
building an HTML service,
just anything.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:32.750
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.670
Think we're up on time?

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.120
IKAI LAN: I think we
are up on time.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.020
So we're sorry if we didn't get
around to your question.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.340
I've tried to answer them
in the comments.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.810
A lot of these are
feature requests.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.260
So go ahead and file
one with us.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.410
They're under Apps
Script issues.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.025
You could search for that in
Google, and it should be one

00:27:46.025 --> 00:27:47.310
of the first results.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.010
Or any search engine.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.910
Ikai's Custom Search Engine
dot com, which

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:51.670
doesn't exist yet.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.600
Don't try going there.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.330
You'll be able to find these
issues, create a feature

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.070
request, and this way, we can
track it when we're looking at

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.050
what the backlog is.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.290
And if you see anything that's
really important

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.090
to you, star it.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.410
Don't overly star, because it's
the whole crying wolf

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.080
thing, and we won't know
what's important.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.820
So star the issues that
are important to you.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.590
Again, we're sorry for the
issues with the Hangout for

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.950
those of you that wanted
to jump in live.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:14.570
Apologies.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.920
We will try to have it working
before the next show.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.180
And anything else we have to
announce before we jump off?

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.280
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I think
that's it for now.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.340
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.690
Again, the two announcements
we did at the

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:23.050
beginning of the show.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.500
I'm just going to remind
you guys again.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.550
Arun's doing a show about how to
integrate Apps Script with

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.520
Salesforce tomorrow, so
definitely jump on if you can.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.590
If not, we're posting to
YouTube.com/googledevelopers.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.350
That's the channel of everything
that we're doing.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.340
And if you want to find Apps
Script specific videos, you

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.510
can search for Apps
Script videos.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.560
And we have a page that we try
to update periodically with

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.880
all the newest videos, including
"Office Hours" and

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.900
special "Google Developer
Live" shows.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.160
And next Tuesday, I'm doing an

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.830
introductory show about triggers.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.430
So Salesforce, triggers.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.980
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I'm sure
there'll be more.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.175
IKAI LAN: Yep.

00:28:56.175 --> 00:28:58.220
And we'll be doing
a lot more, too.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.450
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thank
you very much.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:00.340
IKAI LAN: Thank you guys very
much, and we'll see

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.930
you at the next show.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:17.867
