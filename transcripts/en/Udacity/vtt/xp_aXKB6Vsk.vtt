00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let us take a look again

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
at our remove html markup function.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here I'm going back to the earlier version,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is sort of fixed.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now let's take a look at this condition up here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We want to know where the core value

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
could possibly have come from

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
To do so, we follow the data dependencies.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What are the statements that this statement

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
is data dependent upon?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
To do so, we will look at the places

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where quote would be written.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And which also would be executed

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
before this statement will be executed.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
For instance, this statement would be data

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
dependent on that earlier statement.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Because here quote is being written,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and here quote is being read.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Therefore, the statement A up here sets the state

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that B later on keeps on processing.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If you want to understand how B behaves,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we follow the data dependencies to A

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and find that this is one of the statements

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that sets the state that B depends upon.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now for a quiz.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Which are the other statements that B data depends upon?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Is this for C in S,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is this elf of C equals the greater sign and not quote,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is this quote equals not quote,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
or is this out equals out plus C?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Check all that apply.
