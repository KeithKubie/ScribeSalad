00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:07.507
NARRATOR: Hamburg,
Germany, December, 1938.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:11.052
Four years into Adolf
Hitler's reign as fuhrer,

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:14.389
he is beginning to establish
his total dictatorship

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.227
by taking direct control
of the German military.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.688
[speaking german]

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:25.650
[cheering]

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.821
But on the brink
of World War II,

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:33.324
Hitler is also involved
in much stranger endeavors

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:35.452
that are hidden to the public.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:38.121
He is committing every
remaining resource

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.249
to searching for ancient
relics that he believes

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.751
could hold incredible powers.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.631
On December 17th,
the German freighter

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:54.095
MS Schwabenland sets out on one
of these top secret missions.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:58.516
Its 33-member team is rumored
to include scientists,

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:02.771
military experts, construction
crews, and key members

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.440
of the Thule Society,
an elite group

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.942
associated with the
Nazis that focused

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:11.780
on mysticism and the occult.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.868
32 days later, they arrive
at their destination--

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:20.038
Antarctica.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.749
The Nazis themselves
were fascinated

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:26.377
by ancient civilizations
and legends

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:30.089
of vanished super races.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:33.218
They were searching for
this lost Arctic home

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:36.346
that they thought that
the Aryans had come from.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:38.890
They were looking
all over the world,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.559
and that included Antarctica.

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:44.103
The Thule Society
actually believed

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:47.106
that there were
mystics or channels who

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:50.652
were able to communicate with
these beings who claim to be

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:53.321
either extraterrestrial
in origin or claim

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:55.448
to belong to this
civilization that

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.076
lived in the Earth's interior.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.453
And they gave a
lot of information

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.498
about the building of
advanced aerospace vehicles,

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:04.999
flying saucers.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.211
And I think this is where
Hitler's Nazi Party got

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.338
a lot of its information
about Antarctica,

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:14.968
and that in Antarctica, there
is this ancient civilization

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.011
or bases where they
could find a lot

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:18.429
of these advanced technologies.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.143
NARRATOR: During their
time in Antarctica,

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:27.480
the Nazis were believed
to have mapped huge swaths

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.692
of the icy landscape by air.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:33.611
Ancient astronaut
theorists believe they also

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:36.781
established an elaborate
underground headquarters

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:40.785
known as Base 211.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:43.788
Hitler and the Nazis were
particularly interested

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:45.331
in Antarctica.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.167
I think they really believed
that there were things

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.460
going on deep under the ice.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.962
And there have
always been rumors

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:53.381
that the Nazis, with
their submarines,

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:58.303
have underwater caverns, small
cities, that they escaped

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:02.140
there after World War II.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.392
When the Germans
got to Antarctica,

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:08.563
what they found
were massive cities

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:11.024
that were highly technological.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:14.402
And these buildings were
not just on the surface.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.946
They went deep down underground.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:20.366
So they began relocating a
massive amount of equipment

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:24.621
and personnel to
Antarctica, re-pressurizing

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.707
these ancient facilities
and reoccupying them.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.632
NARRATOR: In 1946, one year
after the end of World War

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:40.094
II, the US government
launched its own large scale

00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:43.264
mission to Antarctica.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:48.561
Operation High Jump deployed
4,700 troops, 13 ships,

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.564
an aircraft carrier, and
a number of sea planes

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:54.067
to Antarctica.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.903
Although the government
denied it at the time,

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.906
it would later become known
that one of the operation's

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:04.160
primary objectives was,
quote, extending United States

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.455
sovereignty over the
largest practicable area

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:10.041
of the Antarctic continent.
