00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.670
 My name is chrysostom flower 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.910
 work that is being represented here 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.910
 in this place at this time I think 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.869
 that regardless of the connection 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.179
 that you have directly with me is 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.470
 interpret the pain of the Mexican people 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.470
 in general 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.810
 ah 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.360
 I am the mother of three young people from the age of 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.420
 these young people my family lives in equals 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.480
 warrior live in the center of the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.280
 shootings and the daily massacres there 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.340
 on the part of our government the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.220
 repression are now used to 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.100
 speak in code not to express what 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.250
 feel not to walk the streets to not 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.680
 go out at night to keep the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.100
 closed doors I think it's not fair what 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.250
 what is happening in our country and it is not 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.380
 just to what this government is 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.380
 doing to his Mexican people 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.450
 for us the day of the dead is 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.070
 just remember the people that 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.219
 physically they are no longer with us 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.710
 but that his spiritual presence continues 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.490
 connected with us are the people 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.179
 that they give us 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.610
 the strength to keep going the force 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.890
 that they give us to continue struggles like 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.530
 what these young people have undertaken 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.950
 your rights as students for your 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.960
 rights to be educated for their rights to 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.970
 educate the people to new 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.550
 generations 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.830
 I believe that the whole country at this time 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.690
 is afraid of what may happen to 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.550
 his family unfortunately in mexico 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.680
 from the government of the president felipe 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.800
 CalderÃ³n when he declared war on 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.330
 drug trafficking to date that we are 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.940
 in 2014 there are approximately 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.510
 30,000 missing what we 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.140
 we are seeing in equals when the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:35.209
 local government murders 6 students and 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.390
 11 and kidnaps 43 students and 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.150
 is trying to deliver to parents 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.850
 from these boys to their children 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.319
 we see that there are pits and more graves and more 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.140
 fosas mexico is a complete pit 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.319
 I think young people are not well 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:59.720
 they are no longer alive my heart tells me that 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.959
 they are no longer alive but as people who 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.430
 we are like human beings that we are 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.430
 We need to see their bodies 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.930
 when I spoke with the lord actions
