3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.870
This is not an official podcast.

4
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:11.790
This is where it just checking on you on a Thursday.

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.840
I see how your fucking work week is going at most the times. What?

6
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.990
You know the deal. I do it by myself. I lay around, I shoot the shit.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.150
I say things. People hear things,

8
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:24.720
they think that it's about them and who is arisen in the White House?

9
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:29.460
Who the fuck knows? But every once in awhile I bring on a guest and when I do,

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.140
I don't just bring on any guests.

11
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:33.750
I bring on some of the most talented people out there and some of my great

12
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:36.210
friends and today this is no different.

13
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:41.010
I have the great Ben Bailey from cash cab. He's got a new special,

14
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:43.230
he's got a bunch of short films. He's got a new website,

15
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.200
he's got a bunch of shit he wants to talk about. Ben Bailey. What's up man?

16
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.790
How the fuck are you? I'm good dude.

17
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.940
Good to see you now have one was the last time I saw you?

18
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.120
It wasn't last November. Oh.

19
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.370
Might've been once since then.

20
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.000
But we had to have some sort of festival. Yeah. Maybe out here.

21
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.180
But you're talking to walking by to some social media tent.

22
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.030
You're talking about a Madison Square Garden? No,

23
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.880
November percent a year ago already. Yeah, it was, it was the shit,

24
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.630
the no longer Toyota comedy festival. Oh really? Is it done or is just,

25
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940
isn't it just in New York, New York? No. Yeah.

26
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.780
Do you remember how many years when we were in New York?

27
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:22.710
I came to New York and like 95 I believe in, uh, I,

28
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.300
that's just a couple of years after me.

29
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:26.970
I started out here and then went back there. Oh, okay.

30
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.270
And we did like what we did like maybe four or 5,000 shows together.

31
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.950
We get something like that. I literally sat down one time,

32
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.700
and this is 15 years ago now, or maybe like 12 somewhere in there.

33
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.790
And I try to sort of have, you know,

34
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:45.840
add up some idea of how many standup shows I had done. What did you think?

35
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.460
I came up with 10,000 yeah, it was, you know, at least 10 years ago.

36
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.680
Probably more. And you count show is every time you go on. Yeah,

37
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.090
just any set I did anywhere. That's fair. Because anytime you go up,

38
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:58.440
God knows what the fucking happened.

39
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.260
It doesn't matter if it's four or five minutes. Yeah, somebody can still,

40
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.130
there's plenty of time. It's kept something thrown at you. I'm an awful, I,

41
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.170
you know something I remember I kept counting until about like 26 into 30 maybe

42
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:11.280
and then I just lost it.

43
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.100
But I remember though really you gotta keep a track of how many you had done?

44
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.710
Yeah, I probably did too. I don't even remember it, but I probably did too.

45
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.680
I was always jealous of people that did that. Cause A, I'm sorta like,

46
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.950
like I like, I hate stats and like trying to figure out what people,

47
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:26.060
where people are socially, but I love them in sports because they're,

48
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.000
they're like, they're kind of fact as far as like how many home runs you hit.

49
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.340
You know that that's like a ladder too.

50
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:35.350
It gives you some something to go up against. Yeah, but the, I,

51
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.810
I don't find a lot bullshit. Like, you know,

52
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.120
do it all we're doing when it's raining out and blah, blah blah. With,

53
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.760
with that, when you get to that shit, like I'm more into the,

54
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:45.000
how many yards did this guy throw? Four, how many did you run or whatever.

55
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.610
Stuff like that. Right. None had specific situations.

56
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.980
They do break it down a little too far. He like what? Yeah. Fuck.

57
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.590
It's the reason cause we have like nine 19 maybe 24 hour sports networks plus

58
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.110
Internet plus shit heads like me and all that. It's the whole thing.

59
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.320
It's just way too much information and a, what I was trying to get to was,

60
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.150
do you remember when the Toyota Comedy Festival first came around? Yeah.

61
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.270
It was the funniest shit ever.

62
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:09.940
It was just as they would say that it was the festival.

63
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.820
There was like nobody I ever met that was connected with it.

64
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:14.080
They would just hang a banner.

65
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.190
It was just a banner at the regular clubs and it was all the same regular

66
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.180
performers. There was no industry and it would just be, let them have asked.

67
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.140
He would leave on this weekend,

68
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.930
you have the Toyota comedy festival and we have Ben Bailey, Bill [inaudible],

69
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.890
Godfrey. He was on the same fucking people except it was a banner.

70
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.150
We used to have to, it took us like,

71
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.910
we were all so excited because we had nothing going on in our careers.

72
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.550
We were like, oh, I'm part of the festival.

73
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.450
And it took about three years before somebody finally just said, what,

74
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.260
what is this shit beyond [inaudible]? This is every,

75
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.180
this is a regular Wednesday. Right. And somehow though, that morphed into, uh,

76
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.510
an actual festival into the New York comedy festival. Right. Which is, I think,

77
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.910
you know, there's a lot of festivals, you know, out there,

78
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:58.150
but like New York City, you got to have a big comedy festival. You got it. Yeah,

79
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.660
I think so. I think it's great. I was actually, I,

80
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.610
I've been a part of it really. Uh,

81
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.630
but I'm supposed to be next year groundwork for the first nine years when it

82
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:09.840
was, that's right.

83
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.840
I was a part of it for the first nine and then I started booking people and I

84
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:18.220
missed the cut or some shit. I don't know. Yeah, you will meet both like, uh,

85
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.300
the New York underground comedy festival. I don't think I was a part of that.

86
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:24.520
I'm sure I submitted a VHS tape till it,

87
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.920
the joke was that it was so underground that,

88
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.180
and literally no one knew about it was, it sounded like surf reality.

89
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:34.960
It was the same thing. It was like, it was like a banner at a couple of clubs,

90
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.930
you know, and some guy, some guy had a bunch of money. It was like,

91
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:40.330
I'm going to have a festival, you know, that's it.

92
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.650
That's a great plane from La and stuff. And these guys would come in and like,

93
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.340
Yo, we're here for the festival and we're all like, Whoa,

94
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.340
what are you talking about? I'm sure we greeted them warmly,

95
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.630
homie fucking assholes. Well the last time,

96
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.830
well I guess sort of meandering my way towards was that Toyota of comedy

97
00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:00.250
festival then morphed into the New York comedy festival and that's what that

98
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:03.370
they MSG Gig was last year. And as I mentioned,

99
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.920
amazing as I mentioned to you guys, you know,

100
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:10.810
obviously that was a nerve wracking gig and um, I just, you know,

101
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.310
I don't, I can't remember how the fuck came about.

102
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:15.250
Probably from doing the goddamn comedy jam or whatever. I was like, uh, right.

103
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.470
I, I've asked my agent, I was like, Hey, wait,

104
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.540
we paid to rent that thing all day. Right.

105
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.740
Considering 90% of the money is going to go right back to rent and that giant

106
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:25.960
fucking place. I go, yeah. I said,

107
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.840
can I like rent a drum kit first I was just going to rent a drum kit and just

108
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:32.290
jam with my, you know, my, my music by myself. Typical comedian,

109
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:36.470
totally isolated, but because of Josh had a miners and the goddamn comedy jams,

110
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.410
they like the people, they're like, we're going to be in town.

111
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.180
So I rented all this gear and um,

112
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.890
there was this running thing with me and Ben would for about eight years.

113
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.660
We were trying to get together and play music. You play drums.

114
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:51.460
I play at time and we're going to get together.

115
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.570
And every fucking time he'd come out here to la and it's like he's running

116
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:57.770
around, he's got meetings, he couldn't fucking make it.

117
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.610
And then I get to New York and he,

118
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.300
you're out in Jersey and that's just when you don't have a fucking car.

119
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.880
It's like, oh my God, I'm going to get on the path train, do,

120
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.080
we'll fucking anybody to come out chipsy cab. So finally,

121
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.640
like we're just like, um,

122
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.990
I'd come to town and we were going to jam and then that's when I, I,

123
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.590
we finally solidified it and I was going to drive out to your place so,

124
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.510
and you are all excited cause you, you made it [inaudible] built and everything.

125
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.050
I'm like, oh, we're finally going to play in it.

126
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.690
And he's all amped up telling me how great his fucking studio is.

127
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:29.030
And I was like, ah, I don't know man. I think I've got a better place.

128
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.140
And you're like, I got a better place. I'm like, motherfucker, what the fuck?

129
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.510
And I just said, I did it. Give you the answer. I think I told you it was MSG.

130
00:06:37.511 --> 00:06:40.760
I said, well, I finally, I wrote back where like, I was like,

131
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:42.470
it must be someplace good. Yeah.

132
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:45.900
He's not just slamming my own studio that I built without having seen it yet.

133
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.900
He must have some good fucking thing. You and I know you cause up MSG.

134
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:53.180
I'm like monosodium glutamate

135
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.520
can be fucking Madison Square Garden Man. That's real.

136
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.420
I knew when I said I have a better place.

137
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.780
Your next text was going to come back and all capitals because Ben doesn't take

138
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:05.840
any shit from anybody and he's actually big enough to beat the fuck out of me

139
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:09.500
and about 20 other people. So He's, what the fuck? I totally insulted a studio.

140
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.960
So when you me in a better place. Yeah. So he ended up coming down and, and um,

141
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.630
as I mentioned before, is that my phone. Ah, Jesus Christ.

142
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.740
How can you be a flop?

143
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.410
It just makes it real.

144
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.890
It makes it real to the list and people feel like they're actually in the studio

145
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:29.750
witnessing how unprofessional this is.

146
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.680
How many of them like jumped up and looked around? I know cause I do have,

147
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:37.460
when the phone rings they're like, Oh, oh no, that's the standard one day.

148
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.390
Like if you're ever hiding in the closet and there's a serial killer walking

149
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:43.670
around, you know there's a chance when your phone rings,

150
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:45.370
he won't know what shoe he'll think it's him.

151
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.580
It's his phone for a second and maybe you can drop all of them and run up when

152
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:53.840
he, when he goes to look at it, you fucking smother him with your pj's. Oh,

153
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:57.430
it's a great scene in a film right there. Oh there you go.

154
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.130
Killer checks his own phone. He's like, God damn it. Yeah.

155
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.120
Could you want to do your life? Be Professional speaking to play in music is,

156
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:07.220
I have like the hearing damage that I have,

157
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:10.040
which is inevitable if you play or you do this fucking rate of the hearing

158
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:12.860
damage that I have is I actually got my hearing check. Like,

159
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:14.090
I still can hear everything,

160
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.000
but I have a little bit of displacement as to where it is.

161
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.730
Like it'll be to the right and I start going to the left and my wife just for

162
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.900
sting, man just laughs at me. Yeah. As long as it stays,

163
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:27.500
if discipline tickets from doing standup and like playing music and yeah,

164
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.930
haven't been, things happens all the time. I know. Oop.

165
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.890
From my opion Anthea says my ears are shot because what happens is,

166
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.200
is your ears get tired, you know, you keep turning up and turning up.

167
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:39.860
It's all about the duration. Right. You guys do like four hours a day and uh,

168
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.000
I try to be conscious of it, but like I fucked my ears up in the 80s.

169
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.170
One of my years I got that Tinnitus just rings at a real low level or from

170
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.330
really hung over it. But I mean, I don't have like,

171
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.110
like to the Pete Townsend level, but uh, so anyways, getting back to it.

172
00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:58.950
So at Johnson, right, he had to quit. I know that was in DC. Right?

173
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.850
But not from the music, from race car driving. It's just like, what? Oh,

174
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:06.260
is that what it's from? Yeah, that's what they said. It wasn't, you know, he's,

175
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.040
it'd just been an ACDC all these years, like the loudest fucking band. But no,

176
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:13.530
that's not why he's ears are damages from driving race cars.

177
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:16.620
One of the first times I really fucked my ears up as I saw them on the, uh,

178
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.090
what was it, the hate secret tour? Oh No, I saw them. Uh,

179
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.110
I saw them at the Boston Garden Lights. I think Cinderella opened. No, no,

180
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:27.780
I saw him down in Providence. Was it different tour?

181
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.160
I saw them a bunch of times. Who made,

182
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:32.130
who hate seeker out during that whole period? I used to go see him in, uh,

183
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.900
I didn't have earplugs. And as loud as that was the fucking dude driving home,

184
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.230
he had the fucking thing turned all the way up to fucking 10.

185
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.770
I remember just like sitting in the back just taking it rather than ask him,

186
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:46.620
Hey, can you turn that down yet? You're making all of it.

187
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.640
I had like that German, Irish, just like, yeah, don't complain to complain.

188
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:53.520
Suffer in silence. It'll, it'll be over soon. That's what, anyway,

189
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.030
when you're at the back of a car and the guy's driving like a fucking maniac and

190
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.490
I'm, I'm like being polite. Yeah. I'm like,

191
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:03.000
I don't want to offend him by asking him to slow down or whatever.

192
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.250
I'd rather just risk my own death. Hey,

193
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:09.420
not trying to be that guy that tried to be that guy, but a, I'd like to live.

194
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.040
Yeah. I'd like to survive this ride.

195
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.750
I don't want to be in a halo at the end of this. But anyway,

196
00:10:13.751 --> 00:10:17.190
so we finally ended up getting to play at Madison Square Garden,

197
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:18.920
which I think it was worth the fucking weight.

198
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.930
That was our Chinese democracy ain't dude. I gotta tell you, man,

199
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.890
I wouldn't change a thing. You fucking can play. Oh, you can really play a man.

200
00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:28.440
I was really like, you don't tell him this is crazy. And I got to,

201
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:32.220
I got to show that to a, you know, a bunch of people. When I got to do a,

202
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:36.360
the tonight show, I showed it to a quest and Fallon and stuff.

203
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:38.790
I think I showed shorts. I showed it to them and they were just like, wow, man,

204
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.320
you should've given us, you know, Jimmy's all,

205
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:42.360
he should've given us the video we would have played. I was just like,

206
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.810
all right dude, it's not that good. Quite on that level.

207
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.330
I'd like to just show fun, Dude. It really was.

208
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.540
It really wasn't just going off and surreal day. Yeah. And I hit my,

209
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.490
my a then every, every so many people play to like my agent went out and played.

210
00:10:56.491 --> 00:11:00.300
He almost didn't go ahead and twist his arm. Yeah. Yeah. Go up there.

211
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:02.350
I helped it drag them up there. I was like, come on dude,

212
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.500
we'll do a little wing or something. Michael O'Bryan, the,

213
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:08.460
he fucking ran up like, Hey Mike, you want it? He just ran right up.

214
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.690
He was great too, man. So, um, that was a fucking great day, dude.

215
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:13.740
And your show is awesome.

216
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.130
And I didn't know anything about efforts for family before that night. Oh,

217
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.280
that was what you guys played the preview of it.

218
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:23.070
That was the first time we felt like, Holy Shit, man, this is going to be all.

219
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.170
So I didn't even know. Yeah. So great.

220
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.860
Well we've got another 10 episodes of that coming out, but we're here.

221
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:33.180
We're here to, uh, promote your stuff. Let's start with your website. Um,

222
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.200
the Real Ben bailey.com that's you're relaunching your website or you just,

223
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.990
I'm relaunching it. It's been kind of just, you know,

224
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.540
very basic for a long time. And I was like, you know what,

225
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.200
it's time to just split start making my own stuff and putting it out directly to

226
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:49.350
people cause there's no reason to go and try and sell. You know,

227
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.290
like there's two short films on there that I made that I really love.

228
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.990
What's the one would Judah freelancer that you made a while ago?

229
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:58.300
I'm dying to see that, but it's funny. It's a,

230
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:03.301
it's called meet me at res and we made it like way back in like 2002 or

231
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:08.110
something or 2003 and then shut it down like crazy busy after that.

232
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.930
And it just sat there and now I'm just,

233
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.940
I just looked at him like I gotta put this thing out.

234
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:17.170
So it's just about two idiots meeting up for pizza at Ray's pizza in New York,

235
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:20.200
you know, but there's, there's a lot of raised pizzas, dude,

236
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:25.180
that you got a little busy at 14 years later. [inaudible] I'm like, all right,

237
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:27.190
let's put this thing out. And then, uh, what,

238
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:29.050
what happened during those 14 years? It was, you know,

239
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.420
he'd started doing all the movies. You did the cash cab thing.

240
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.530
That was so cool watching you guys like, uh, blowing up.

241
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:38.440
Like I felt like our generation kind of had like an even thing.

242
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:41.650
It was just like nobody knew who we were. And then all of a sudden,

243
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.820
like everybody started like, just got some inroads. I don't know what happened.

244
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.180
Yeah. Some people go into nowhere, you know? I mean,

245
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.840
shoot and I used to sit in his minivan at the end of the nights of stand up in

246
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:56.650
New York, it'd be like, man, this is brutal. We've got nothing. Yeah.

247
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.710
Got nothing going on. You know, dude,

248
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.890
I remember being in New York and then boom and I moved back from La the first

249
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:06.970
time I was out here and I had a, I lost my booking agent,

250
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.410
I had no manager,

251
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.210
I had no agent and I was incorporated as a business and I just cost me too much

252
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:13.421
money.

253
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:17.890
I got unincorporated instead of paying to be incorporated because I wasn't

254
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:18.611
making any money.

255
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:23.611
And I went all the way back to square one and I was living in that walkthrough

256
00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:27.310
bedroom apartment with the guy who was on the lease.

257
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:29.590
And it was me and Bobby Kelly. We had a lot of fun,

258
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:31.750
but there was definitely nights.

259
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.330
It's probably good that I was living with Bobby cause we'd laugh until,

260
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:37.420
you know, you know, the late night in an iron man, take it easy.

261
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.330
But if I had to go home and just be with my own thoughts. That happened that,

262
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:40.930
yeah,

263
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.380
after he moved out and then I moved out and then there was that period about

264
00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:47.890
2000 to 2004 where a, yeah,

265
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:52.150
there was a lot of tastes just waking up going like, uh, what am I doing?

266
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.920
What the fuck? I mean, dude, I had,

267
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:58.600
I mean from 2000 2004 I think somewhere in there I did get a half hour,

268
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.620
but there was like a thousand spread. The guy came to your half hour,

269
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.880
the comedy central one? Yeah, I think so.

270
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.320
There was like a good three year period there just being like, okay,

271
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:12.140
33 years old, 34 years, 35, you know, fuck,

272
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.530
this was not the plan. Am I going to be that? I thought it was okay. Yeah. Yeah,

273
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.860
it was. Um, yeah.

274
00:14:17.861 --> 00:14:22.120
And then the whole AllSeen was coming up and that whole thing blew up and then

275
00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:25.900
we would just, the fucking outcast. Totally. That was, that was rough man.

276
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:31.120
When the alternative comedy club scene developed and then just became this big

277
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:34.900
thing. You couldn't drag it. Industry person. Yeah. We're just in the,

278
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.240
in the mainstream clubs like oops,

279
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.690
you could no idea not going to move to those places. Yeah. Who, Oh man,

280
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.310
that was, those were a, Hey I'll tell you, those are rough ones, you know.

281
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.550
But we, you said that wrong changed. Yeah.

282
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:52.070
So you made that thing like 15 years ago once this movie that you have coming

283
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.230
out, cause I know you're going in the screening here, which is really cool.

284
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:58.610
This one's called blam badly, badly written action man. Yeah. Yeah. It's just,

285
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.130
you know, action movies, the action starts with,

286
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.550
they are badly written in a manner of speaking.

287
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:06.700
It's got a lot of quality in those, but, but they're,

288
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.540
but they're like one liners or like at least kind of clever, witty, you know,

289
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.730
even if they're over the top. Yeah, totally. So I was like,

290
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.040
I just thought, I thought of this character one day.

291
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.990
I can't remember what I was doing and where,

292
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:23.390
but I just like it be funny if you know,

293
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:26.090
so much of those movies now are built around those lines.

294
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.440
If when you finally get to the, you know, one of those lines, it's just awful.

295
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.470
Just no pay off. It's just no pay off at all. You know,

296
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.390
which is like an anti payoff really.

297
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.510
So it's kind of a crazy concept but it just sort of fell together like,

298
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.500
and how long are these movies? They're both about 10 minutes.

299
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.050
And this is like the type of stuff you're going to start putting on the real Ben

300
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:46.940
bailey.com just make it, yeah. Yeah.

301
00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:49.890
I think that's a smart idea because I think those, those shorts,

302
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.970
they ended up turning into something they turn into movies and not,

303
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.480
that's one thing I've learned about this business.

304
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.090
This is just like when you make that decision like at this feels right,

305
00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:00.890
I'm going to do this. So many people, they do it one,

306
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:04.710
two times and when Spielberg of Oprah doesn't want to interview you as some

307
00:16:04.711 --> 00:16:08.990
shit, like well fuck this bitch tried. You just got to keep going.

308
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.220
Cause then when one of them hits,

309
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:14.000
then they go back to your whole library and you got all of that stuff and

310
00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:16.650
they'll, something that will allow, will turn into it. But um,

311
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.680
I hope you're right about that dude. Hey,

312
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:19.940
how long have you been a lot into them?

313
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.760
[inaudible] is about 10 minutes and it's, and it's, uh,

314
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.530
it's badly written action man, which was originally a badly written action star.

315
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.560
Right. And in Lenny Marcus and I were working on writing,

316
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:35.420
throwing around ideas about it and he was abbreviating it when he wrote back to

317
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.130
be was Blas or whatever. Right. And that made me go like, oh, maybe,

318
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.340
maybe there's something in the acronym. Right. And then I was like, Oh,

319
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.700
if I make it badly written action man, then that's Blam.

320
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:51.230
And that's like a badly written sound effect. Oh yeah.

321
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.800
Know what I mean? It's like poem. Hey, you can just kind of fell together,

322
00:16:54.801 --> 00:16:56.990
you know, when you feel like something's working. Yeah.

323
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.430
I had all these ideas and that one,

324
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.340
that little stuff like that just move to the front. So I just made it.

325
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.910
When you shoot that one, uh, in July. Oh, cool. Well there you go.

326
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:07.550
Now you've really stepped it up. One took you 12 years.

327
00:17:07.551 --> 00:17:11.450
This one took you about 12 weeks. Yeah, you're totally right on a tear now.

328
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.340
Jesus Christ. But it's cool. DC Benny's in it and I love that. He's a Dante.

329
00:17:16.341 --> 00:17:19.400
He's in it. He's a great actor. Decent dude. He's so good in this.

330
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.810
He's so funny. He's the evil villain in the in boy, man.

331
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.910
I'm going to watch this and this is going to be on a, it's in it.

332
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.980
Vecchio onus in it. A a riot. Masabi is in it savvy and Korean.

333
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.780
Holy Man. I was saying, dude, he'd be a perfect henchman. So yeah, it's not.

334
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.960
I'm a Salvia how we know him. He used to run the old Boston Comedy Club,

335
00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:43.880
which is now you'd fucking wine tasting or wine. It's a wine bar. Yet.

336
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.120
I walked in there one night just,

337
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.080
I had them go in and look at it and there was all these, you know,

338
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.240
people in their twenties you know, prime of their fucking life.

339
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:54.660
Like we used to be and I just was going like, they're like, can I help you sir?

340
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:58.710
And I was just like this old man comedy club. And they were like, really?

341
00:17:58.711 --> 00:17:59.730
And I was like, yeah, go.

342
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:04.680
I watched like a 20 year old Dave Chappelle right where that two top is.

343
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:07.500
And that was at first they didn't give a fuck til I dropped him.

344
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.810
And they were like, really? Oh they couldn't believe it.

345
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.130
And I was like all offended. Like,

346
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.900
how come you don't know what's important to me? Yeah, totally. I know. Yeah.

347
00:18:15.901 --> 00:18:18.510
It's just like, well cause we moved on old man now I like,

348
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.890
or get the fuck outta here. That's everything for law. I'm fucking leaving.

349
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.580
I know 10 downstairs of that place is now the zinc bar that he used to be

350
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:30.840
called. The beacon cafe. Used to be the,

351
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:34.170
the bag it in the bag it in and we used to drink in there, put in hard,

352
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.360
I remember that kid with the glasses, the kid on the guitar,

353
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:40.920
he come down to fucking like whale like every Monday night even Colker Holy Shit

354
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.040
. That Guy David Coker. Yeah, I've still been in touch with him, man. He,

355
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:47.970
we did a soft for my last special coker and I wrote a song and did it and play

356
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.750
it at the end. Tacky that cash cab blues. Silly like, you know,

357
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:55.080
cash cab blues tune. Right. Cause I love Colker so much.

358
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.490
He's such a great musician. He really,

359
00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:01.410
how long have you been playing by the way? A since I was 12. Yeah. You can tell.

360
00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:02.910
12 years old. I, I uh,

361
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.180
the guy that live behind this English family moved in behind us.

362
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:11.040
This is six weeks. And uh, the old, the old, this guy,

363
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.970
the oldest son ships love. Hello show y'all.

364
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.980
It's this your garden. Uh, Oh, a guy. No, I was talking about that.

365
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:22.470
My last podcast. Like every fucking ingredients. Spice,

366
00:19:22.471 --> 00:19:23.960
they always say differently. Yeah. So yeah,

367
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
there's a lot of little basil or Oregano Basil to my girlfriend.

368
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.200
You've met my girl, right? She's an Australian.

369
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:36.510
I have a new bit around one of those little things that, uh, that still come up,

370
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.520
these little differences between how they speak and how we speak. And she said,

371
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:46.860
uh, we talking about my daughter going, horse riding, right? I'm like,

372
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:50.910
horse riding. Like we say, horseback riding.

373
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.080
And then I'm like, why do we specify? Yeah,

374
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.060
horse riding actually makes a lot more sense.

375
00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:00.780
They kind of get into only ever ride on one part of the horse. Horseback riding.

376
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.700
But you just said horse riding. Get off. It's neck. Yeah, horse neck.

377
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.610
So I have this whole bit about it, but there's so many little things like that.

378
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.190
But, so he's British guy. These British family moves in behind us.

379
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.870
The oldest brother is like, I'm like, I'm 11 what are the names again?

380
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.010
The Sedgwick's I just want to hear he said Andrew Sickly. Jones centric.

381
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.040
Just loyalty is with the urgency of, of that accident.

382
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.500
It's just fucking tremendous. I would listen. Not Fair. Is it the,

383
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:31.830
there's so much gravitas that comes with that accent.

384
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:36.750
It's just we can't fucking important everything, let's say. Yeah, sorry.

385
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.673
No, that's fine.

386
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.720
So the oldest brother is like twenties five or 26 and he's a sound engineer.

387
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.830
So he's got a studio in their attic. He builds a studio in their attic.

388
00:20:46.831 --> 00:20:49.210
And he's working on doing sound mixing for some albums,

389
00:20:49.211 --> 00:20:51.070
like some pretty big stuff like them. What was his name?

390
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.120
His name is Andrew Sedgwick. Okay.

391
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.230
Still is as far as I know,

392
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.770
but so I would go over there and annoy the shit out of this guy was just a

393
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:02.650
little kid who I was so curious about it all his equipment and stuff,

394
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:06.970
his studio and everything that he got fed up with me asking him a zillion

395
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:10.810
questions and he just put a guitar in my hand here, play with this.

396
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:15.400
So I started playing with it and you know, six months later I bought it.

397
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:16.300
I saved up my,

398
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.180
my paper route and I bought his uh oh you got paper too? Yeah, yeah.

399
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.730
Oh you say rod. I say Bro, look at that route. Route. [inaudible] wait,

400
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:28.440
which one did I say? You said route. I thought rob was Midwest. I don't,

401
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.840
we'll see. I have a little Midwest. I lived in Michigan when I was like,

402
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.350
when I was little. So I have this weird mix of accents. I live in the south too,

403
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:41.080
so I kind of don't matter. Something now my dad runs from the law. Oh,

404
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.850
he just, he's a killer. So how many times were you a the new kid in school? Uh,

405
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.470
for, I did it three times. It's brutal. Fucking brutal. Right.

406
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.110
I still remember the kids that were nice to me. Yeah.

407
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.200
I still remember when I moved the last time we moved.

408
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.360
Oh maybe the second time this kid Keith hadn't the first recess goes, hey man,

409
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:03.750
you want to play catch? And he had a tennis ball and you're like,

410
00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.540
and I was just like, oh thank God. Cause he wasn't bad enough.

411
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.380
It was bad enough coming in like we were like Ford, it, we moved to the town.

412
00:22:11.381 --> 00:22:14.520
We were like four days. Uh, we will,

413
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.240
it was already four days into the school year, right? Yeah.

414
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.530
Then we came and I had the very similar thing, man, and how they bring you in.

415
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.750
He's like, you don't just shit. Like I didn't just show up.

416
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.880
I didn't get on the bus or anything like that.

417
00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:27.700
Like we went down to the principal's office because we were late and everything

418
00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:28.534
and they were like, all right.

419
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.320
And they just walked us down and she just came walking and going, okay, class.

420
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.720
We have a new student. They're all looking at like,

421
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:40.240
I kind of like a energy my way through the last one I hung my coat up like, hey,

422
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:41.400
how are you? I made a lot of noise.

423
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.710
I went over and I sat down and then that's when I just sat down.

424
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:47.890
I felt out like cross my desk I felt was like right in the middle of the class.

425
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.900
I just felt everybody glancing me. I was like,

426
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.140
I have to sit down with my fucking orange hair. Like I know,

427
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.390
I know I don't like it either. Fuck off.

428
00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.990
So it's brutal. Being the new kid is fucking hard. I was tall.

429
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.080
Like I was a big kid kind of at that age. In high school I wasn't that big.

430
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.990
Everyone sorta caught up with me and then I drew again later.

431
00:23:07.991 --> 00:23:10.270
But when I was in fourth grade, I was one of the bigger kids.

432
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.310
So it seems like it'd be great,

433
00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:15.620
but know that all the kids who were the bigger guys won,

434
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.710
I had to like fight them. Yeah.

435
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.300
I had to fight my way through first day of school. They,

436
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.620
people were choosing who I had to fight on the fucking playground. I'm like,

437
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:27.400
this is not lost. I always lost, I fought this kid.

438
00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:29.080
I remember I thought this kid,

439
00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:32.830
this is sort of kind of when I look about like it was sort of racist,

440
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.090
the way the teacher handled it.

441
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.880
He was the only black kid and for some reason we fought,

442
00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:39.540
we fought like five racists in the road. He kept kicking my ass.

443
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.390
And finally I remember I was starting to win and he had these fucking work boots

444
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:46.880
on and then you just went like Bam, Bam, Bam like three times in my shin.

445
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.690
I was like crying right now, just sitting there crying.

446
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.010
I remember she fucking, uh, as we used to say back then,

447
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.790
balled him out is what he used to say. You get yelled at, she bald,

448
00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.380
yelled at him and then came in and I was sitting there crying.

449
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:02.000
She came home and she like rubbed my head.

450
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.590
She even thought so you just got away with it but Kinda like maybe cause you

451
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:09.350
lost cause I was so pathetic. Or maybe I just looked like a little,

452
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.420
a little beat up Ron Howard. I Dunno what Ralph Mt for something there. Ginger.

453
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.583
Yeah, she was,

454
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.060
I actually thought about later like why was she comforting me?

455
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.970
We both got into it every fucking recess.

456
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.560
I was clearly not like trying to innocent to,

457
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.960
to get away from the kid. I didn't even know why we were fighting either.

458
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.430
Cause then we ended up being like friends.

459
00:24:31.431 --> 00:24:32.900
It was just like that little kid shit.

460
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.560
And I still remember it somehow I slipped and fell and when I did during the

461
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:42.380
fight. Yeah. Yeah. And then he had this workbooks. I think he fell down too.

462
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:45.910
Maybe we should look with the heel of his boot tongue sticking out, you know,

463
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.070
little kids when they were really trying to make an effort and that was it.

464
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.900
Crying Dude, I had a bunch of cry.

465
00:24:53.901 --> 00:24:57.370
Even if I won the fights when I was a kid. Oh. Cause just the emotions.

466
00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.200
Just like, yeah,

467
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.940
I remember telling him I was at a birthday party,

468
00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:08.750
we were playing street hockey and this one kid who played hockey was like really

469
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:08.961
good.

470
00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:12.440
He kept lifting my stick and kept taking the puck and he was like fucking twice

471
00:25:12.441 --> 00:25:15.920
my height. I got knocked on your stick up. Yeah. And I got so mad.

472
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:18.380
I turned around and I just started fighting him and he just,

473
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.900
he just kind of like, he like lean back and kind of like,

474
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:24.010
let me fucking get like three, four in like missing Kinda.

475
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.760
And then he just went blam and bass blasted me in the side of the head and I

476
00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:29.541
fell down.

477
00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:34.541
I started crying and I walked away and I just remember screaming the top of my

478
00:25:35.331 --> 00:25:38.930
lungs and I was walk cause I used to cut through the woods and people were

479
00:25:38.931 --> 00:25:41.820
yelling from the party to get to school. No, like no,

480
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.180
I'd cut to the woods to get to my friend's house where we were before we played

481
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:48.990
street hockey up. I was already into the woods and people were screaming, okay,

482
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.340
come on, I'll come back. And I was in the middle of was very south going, fuck,

483
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.680
I think his mother yelled one time and I just went home in the woods alone.

484
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.760
And this is the maturity of the other kid.

485
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.950
This is walking through the trail because they, yeah, it was always hot.

486
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.820
Oh, you're such a real moment. Yeah. Know, like I live the same thing.

487
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.790
And what was funny was I came home and I told my mother what happened and um,

488
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.700
it never dawned on her to call over there to drive me all that,

489
00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:22.160
all that overly just getting involved with shit,

490
00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:25.640
parenting that people have done it over the last like whatever since we were

491
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:30.640
kids. She just was like, wow. All right. Wow. When you get home. Yeah. Well,

492
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.990
you know, I have things to do or whatever. And then that was kind of it.

493
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:36.690
And I remember the next day, the maturity or the other kid was, um,

494
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:38.870
when we were on the bus,

495
00:26:38.871 --> 00:26:42.080
I was like ignoring him and stuff and he just kind of yelled at, you know,

496
00:26:42.081 --> 00:26:44.220
everybody stands up, you're to get off the bus. He Yell, Hey Bill,

497
00:26:44.221 --> 00:26:46.620
let me talk to you. We get off the bus. And I was like, alright,

498
00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.590
let me get off the bus. That's cool. Yeah, this is his fifth grade.

499
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.690
He usually just goes like, yeah, sorry about that. I was a guy man.

500
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.570
And it was fun. Yeah. I should've learned that lesson,

501
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:56.580
but I didn't cause I fucked that kid. Huh?

502
00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.640
No, I should say his name. You remember his name? Yeah.

503
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.720
I don't want to say everybody's and I probably should've said it cause people

504
00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:06.860
get all weird and shit. They're actually real people who are still alive. Yeah.

505
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.810
His first name was Tom. Put it that way. He's a tall fucking dude.

506
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:15.030
I told Tom Dude, I was way out of my fucking way class like, and he,

507
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:19.050
even the ass kicking was it gentlemanly as kicking. He just gave me one,

508
00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:22.860
shut the fuck up. The sit down. Quiet little kid. Yeah.

509
00:27:22.861 --> 00:27:24.120
There was no reason for me to fight you.

510
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:26.210
I was just mad because he was better than me. It was just,

511
00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.230
it was really immature. Even for that age, I'm still ashamed of myself. So, um,

512
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.520
so anyway, so this guy ended up giving you a good time. That's for real.

513
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.190
That's really fucking cool. Yeah, it was so cool. Uh,

514
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.790
I guess she had paid for it. Well, I mean,

515
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.760
I could go over there and play it whenever, but at some point I was like,

516
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:45.270
I'm going to save up and buy it. I think I bought it for like 75 bucks.

517
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.440
Did he a he teach any chords or anything or was he no, no,

518
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.470
he just left me to it, you know, but then I like my girl, uh,

519
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.880
my sister's boyfriend was a guitar player and he was quite a bit older and like,

520
00:27:56.881 --> 00:28:00.450
so he showed me some stuff and pretty soon I was like, you know,

521
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:03.600
I knew I could figure out some songs. I always had a decent ear.

522
00:28:03.601 --> 00:28:05.940
I could pick stuff out and find it. But that was the only, that was,

523
00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.680
unless you had the money to take lessons,

524
00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:11.130
that was the only way to learn back then. I felt like lessons know, you know,

525
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.130
like kids today, the shit that they can see on youtube,

526
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:17.880
someone will just totally break the thing down, which is greatly everything.

527
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.880
Yeah. Which is great. And that's why there's so many monster players out there.

528
00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:24.780
But like I would suggest if, you know, as they start to show it,

529
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:27.840
to sort of turn your back to the screen and see if you could just listen to what

530
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:30.790
he's doing and, and just, just so you always develop in Europe because I,

531
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:35.040
I wouldn't want to be that guy. Like, you know, couldn't figure it out. Like,

532
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.390
yeah. Well that's like literally in and out. Yeah. You know?

533
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.320
But I also think that, uh,

534
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.330
maybe one sort of downfall of all of everything being out there for anybody to

535
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.020
learn is you don't develop your own style of guitar, like,

536
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.160
or whatever it is. Right? Like I play guitar differently than most people,

537
00:28:53.161 --> 00:28:56.250
I think because I, no one ever really taught me how to play.

538
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:59.340
I just started playing it. Right. So I have little,

539
00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.520
little things that I do that are probably unique to me. At least.

540
00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:05.930
I hope they are right. Some technique I would be like, actually that's, yeah,

541
00:29:05.931 --> 00:29:08.220
that's wrong. You're holding your hand wrong or you know,

542
00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:10.410
you should know it's still sounds good. But yeah, they were like, well,

543
00:29:10.411 --> 00:29:13.890
but it's, this is what I do. So, you know, but I think music is like that,

544
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.490
you know, it's, it's, it's, it's your expression, whatever, whatever you do,

545
00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:20.640
that's what you do. So yeah, it's a, it's definitely a, uh,

546
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.800
it's kind of a great thing for it. And it's also a weird thing because then I,

547
00:29:24.801 --> 00:29:28.410
I, I definitely, there's always like, then there's like the top like fucking,

548
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:30.750
uh, it's just,

549
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.290
I feel like everybody's influenced now as is whatever subject it is.

550
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:37.400
The first page, the first three links, right.

551
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.170
Becomes like 90% of people's like consciousness.

552
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.310
Cause if you look at 'em I should probably, cause I even do that.

553
00:29:43.311 --> 00:29:45.850
I should probably do want to go on youtube next time I go to look something up

554
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.400
to try. Just click to like, boy, what the fuck is on page three? Yeah.

555
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.840
Like I want to get into the age of 99. Yeah. What the Hell is on there?

556
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:57.490
The underground. Yeah. There's 100,000 pages to look at most things. Right.

557
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:03.100
100,000 hits on how to play, you know. Yeah. I played,

558
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:05.810
I played right before I came over here. I'm doing another one of those, uh,

559
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.660
the goddamn comedy jam. So I have another song. I got it. Nice.

560
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.550
I got to try to get together with one song or you can't say yet.

561
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:14.530
I don't want to ruin it cause it's cause it's part of the show and they get

562
00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:19.240
there. But it's a, you know, I always stay pretty much, you know, 70s and 80s.

563
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.480
Um, I dress up like the drummer that I'm going to tell,

564
00:30:22.481 --> 00:30:25.300
it's just completely ridiculous. Yeah. Cause they'd say what to do.

565
00:30:25.301 --> 00:30:27.180
I want to do one of those with those guys. I gotta get,

566
00:30:27.181 --> 00:30:29.200
I gotta connect with them cause they were like,

567
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:31.660
you should do and when you come out next, but now it's been a year. Yeah,

568
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:33.870
you'd kill it. That'd be so fun, Dude. I wonder if,

569
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.550
I don't know if Josh and those guys came up for the, uh,

570
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.170
the Toyota and now New York comedy festival. They were there.

571
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.880
I think they were in New York for that dude. I have so much fun with those guys.

572
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.360
Then one year I did Montreal,

573
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.150
the comedy festival just to come and I played with those guys three nights in a

574
00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:52.390
row. Oh, it's just to do it. And then I, then I did a standup show,

575
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:56.620
but like the reason I was there was to do the music. Yeah. Because I played,

576
00:30:56.621 --> 00:31:00.460
dude, I played for fucking like 20 years by myself.

577
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.540
Like it was so too. Same thing, man. But it was such like a, um,

578
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.490
like a kind of thing of like why I ended up becoming a comedian because I was so

579
00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:14.290
introverted. And like if it didn't dawn on me until like the mid two thousands,

580
00:31:14.291 --> 00:31:16.810
I started playing in the 80s, that was just like, hey,

581
00:31:16.811 --> 00:31:21.811
kind of the reason for playing is to interact with other human beings.

582
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.390
To share it with people. Yeah. And then, uh,

583
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.450
thank God that that show came around and the first time I got to like,

584
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.250
well I sat in with a few other people,

585
00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:32.760
but the first time I actually Kinda came out, people knew who the fuck I wasn't.

586
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:37.270
I'd sit down and was, it was a really like such a fun thing. So, um,

587
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:42.340
playing music live is like different than stand up obviously,

588
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:46.000
but it's so great. But I think it's just love it, man.

589
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.440
It's fun for us too because we're not in a band and we don't have to deal with

590
00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:55.180
that because I know that a guys have met, they're actually in bands. It's like,

591
00:31:55.181 --> 00:31:58.630
the big thing is how to keep it fun and be when it just starts becoming a job.

592
00:31:58.631 --> 00:31:59.970
Like you've toured with other comedians,

593
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.120
you know when you're told with Comedians,

594
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.350
you're going to have the substance abuse guy. You gonna have the Pussy House,

595
00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:09.340
the late Guy, the EGOMANIAC. Those are all the same guy. Oh,

596
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:13.690
excuse me, y'all. That's all Tony Woods selling.

597
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.910
Tony, tell him I'd have a couple of, we all have a couple of those. I'm one,

598
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.900
I'm a one or two of those guys from time to time. But yeah, I mean,

599
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:26.350
what two are you, would you say I'm late and uh, what were the other ones?

600
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.120
Substance Abuse. Uh, EGOMANIAC, Pussy Hound.

601
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.890
I would say I am a,

602
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:36.820
I'm definitely late and maybe at the touch of substance abuse. Um,

603
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:41.340
I'm substance abuse guy. Cigars drinking. Yeah. I can you,

604
00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.610
I don't know if this makes me a fucked up or anything,

605
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:47.870
but like I know I could shut it off anytime I want to. I just don't want to,

606
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.700
what do you mean that the drinking or the, yeah, it's like, yeah, I could go.

607
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:55.680
I did it. I did it. I know you want a few years. I wanted like,

608
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.460
I did like a year and some change, you know, year in a couple of days.

609
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.630
I was just like, I just, I missed it. Yeah.

610
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.240
But it sounds like it like completely like ruins my a

611
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:11.300
ruined my, I'm like, I don't know. I mean I, I know when to do it.

612
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:17.030
I do it much, much more controlled than I used to. Like when I stopped,

613
00:33:17.031 --> 00:33:20.380
I stopped cause I was like, Holy Shit, this is, I'm out of control here. Oh,

614
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:24.560
all right. I gotta I gotta lay off and regain my footing.

615
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.470
So that's five years I quit.

616
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:32.480
I think that's the difference between like maybe addicts and like fucked up

617
00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:34.670
people like you and I where it's just like I can just,

618
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.470
I just want to get out of control. I was like, all right,

619
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.900
well I'm not going to do that for like a month, you know, stop for awhile,

620
00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:39.920
you know, although this year, you know,

621
00:33:39.921 --> 00:33:42.680
I kept saying that and it was never a month. It was always like three,

622
00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:45.710
four days. I had a real stressful year this year.

623
00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:50.600
Just a lot of stuff now it's just like career stuff, being busy,

624
00:33:50.601 --> 00:33:55.010
being busy, being busy, and uh, all my free time kind of fucking, yeah.

625
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.990
Dissolved and uh, sitting there, you know, writing on a show, it's just,

626
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:00.501
you come home,

627
00:34:00.501 --> 00:34:04.220
your brain is fried and I probably should have picked a better habit,

628
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:08.270
but it started to becoming, coming home and having a whiskey. Right.

629
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:10.380
And then if you came to, and then it became three,

630
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.280
and then my wife is finally like, ah, hey, you fucking booze bag.

631
00:34:13.281 --> 00:34:17.810
What are you doing? Literally call me a boost bag. And then I, then I, uh, I,

632
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:21.920
I dialed it back and uh, for me it's just, it's, it's,

633
00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:25.550
could you like laugh when she'd said that? Oh God, yeah. Yeah. You weren't like,

634
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.420
that's good. No, my wife is just hilarious. You know,

635
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:32.050
you've got all mad and be like, oh, wait a minute. I knew that I was,

636
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:33.380
I did that now. That would've been bad.

637
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.800
If that's your reaction and you need to think about yes, yes.

638
00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.080
Standing there like, yeah, you're right. I need to rate it in. Sorry.

639
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.730
Then you're going, it's cool. Yeah.

640
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.200
I just had a couple of bottles hidden behind toilets and shit. It's totally a,

641
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:47.180
that's totally normal. No, I think,

642
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:51.710
I think everybody that kind of needs to have some little shit that's just there.

643
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:55.160
It's like, or like a little thing that you keep just for, you know,

644
00:34:55.161 --> 00:34:56.300
you have to do it right. You know what I mean?

645
00:34:56.301 --> 00:34:59.400
Like everybody's got maybe some secret little shit that's, oh,

646
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.200
there's whatever it is. I saw this guy one time, this old dude.

647
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.650
I'm going to move the Mike here. I'm sorry. I gotta lean back at some point.

648
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.820
Have bad posture. Um, I saw this one time I was staying at this hotel, right?

649
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.260
And it was this old dude standing there. All right.

650
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:16.280
And like every night like clockwork, cause I would finish the shows,

651
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:19.690
I'd come home, he come walking out was one of the hotels that you could die.

652
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.900
He had a little dog or whatever.

653
00:35:20.901 --> 00:35:23.420
Nowadays everything's like a fucking therapy dog so he can get away with it.

654
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.540
It's a working dog and working. Don't, you're not supposed to ask. Yeah,

655
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.030
I asked the guy in the airport, he's like, you're not supposed to ask about it.

656
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.500
Well, I did. I'm like, yeah,

657
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.200
well if he didn't have a sweater that said working dog on it,

658
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.120
I wouldn't have fucking asked. Yeah. What's its job?

659
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.750
What's did it major in business? So sorry ahead. Um,

660
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:42.960
every night this guy would come out and he would eat, take out a little pouch.

661
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.150
It was tobacco by the way.

662
00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:47.970
You take that out and he would roll his own cigarette and it was, I just saw it,

663
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:48.211
I was like,

664
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:53.211
this is this guy's whole ritual sat there and he would only smoke one and he

665
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:54.150
would just,

666
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.180
he would milk it and he would make it last for like a half hour and he would

667
00:35:57.181 --> 00:36:02.130
just sit out there quietly, no phone, no iPad, no nothing.

668
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.400
And um, I remember seeing that going like, yeah, I get what that guy's doing.

669
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.240
Yeah. And I wish I had the time to do, uh,

670
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:11.560
to do a little more that we just have that,

671
00:36:11.561 --> 00:36:14.610
that I think guys kind of need like alone time. I don't know how women are.

672
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:17.760
Women are a little more social, but I agree they probably need it too.

673
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.040
I have no idea. I shouldn't speak for them. I don't know.

674
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.280
My girl seems content to just be together and then you know,

675
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.720
and talk and chat about everything all the time. And sometimes I'm like,

676
00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:30.990
why am I getting cranky and fucked up right now?

677
00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.160
And like I just need to be by myself like I needed to.

678
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:35.580
I definitely need alone time.

679
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.940
I think that's why we got a million things going on. You know? We also are,

680
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:42.900
these careers are, are all consuming if you let them be right.

681
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.240
Cause we don't have an office, we don't punch a clock.

682
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.030
We don't show up at one time and then leave at another.

683
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:52.140
It's just always going on. Right. You have ideas, you have creative ideas,

684
00:36:52.141 --> 00:36:56.170
you have schedule shit that you're keeping track of things going on.

685
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.640
Well I shot my special right on the 21st of October. I was like,

686
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.790
oh this year just shot a new one. Yeah. And I'm high. All,

687
00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.740
all I gotta do is just fucking, you know, edit that thing,

688
00:37:04.741 --> 00:37:07.660
look at it a couple times. Cause I know what I want and I'm like,

689
00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.320
and I'm just fucking done, man. I'm that time to Christmas shop.

690
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:14.220
I'm going to fucking put my feet up, play some drums and blah, blah, blah, blah.

691
00:37:14.221 --> 00:37:17.340
I mean, I don't know. I don't know what's happening. I'm fucking more, uh,

692
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:23.100
more busy than ever. And it's just like all of these, uh, I dunno.

693
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.730
I just, Eh, I don't know what editing is going to take a while, bro. Yeah.

694
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.820
But I've been able to do it this time where I sat through and, um,

695
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:33.660
I watched the whole fucking thing, which is something I is, you know,

696
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.370
it's brutal. It's you for a fucking hour and a half. It's hard.

697
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.750
And the longer as you watch it, you're like, it's not even funny anymore. Yeah.

698
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.510
You can't believe you're gonna get, yeah. It's like, oh my God, it's an old bit,

699
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:46.710
or, yeah, yeah. Fuck. But every time I go to do one, there's like a major,

700
00:37:46.711 --> 00:37:50.370
like I say, you know, you donate a kidney. He just, I, there's always a chunk.

701
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:51.211
I'm like,

702
00:37:51.211 --> 00:37:55.260
get that the fuck outta there and just go right to the end and then we're done.

703
00:37:55.261 --> 00:37:58.320
And today I figured out what it was and it went from, uh,

704
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:03.270
you know why I felt a little bit too long to now be in like, oh fuck,

705
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:07.950
it's over already. Which is that sweet, sweet spot. Yeah, you don't,

706
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:11.400
you don't want to have it. Um, it's,

707
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.960
it's about 77 so that's about an hour, 15 hour and 16. But I mean, it was,

708
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:17.280
it was getting way, it was getting,

709
00:38:17.281 --> 00:38:20.280
like when they took all the footage from both shows, it was like,

710
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.020
like an hour 30. And I'm like, all right, there's no way.

711
00:38:22.021 --> 00:38:26.230
So we cut it down and then it was like one 29 and I'm like, but I like it,

712
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.950
but I like everything, but I'm just saying, yeah, I think you have to,

713
00:38:28.951 --> 00:38:32.090
if you like release like a concert movie, I think it's gotta be, I,

714
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.530
I would think like 90 minutes if you people are gonna just, yeah.

715
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.560
And it's meant to be a feature. Uh, I just feel like Netflix,

716
00:38:38.561 --> 00:38:41.590
if you're going to go on there and people are going to sit down and if you lucky

717
00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:44.440
enough, if you lucky enough that are actually going to click on your shit,

718
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.880
it's just like we just gotta like you gotta go ACDC on them, you know,

719
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:52.330
where they don't play any ballads. You just gotta fucking just right through.

720
00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:52.810
Yeah.

721
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:57.810
Unless you're like Chapelle which d Chappelle has that way where he can just

722
00:38:57.911 --> 00:39:00.310
really fucking like bring it that like,

723
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:03.390
he's like just watching him do that opening monologue on, on SNL. I mean,

724
00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:08.200
just like, yeah, the level of shit that he's doing effortlessly,

725
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.560
not even consciously the ups and downs, peaks and valleys in them,

726
00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:14.440
the huge laughs and then the poignant moments and all of that.

727
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.390
It's just like that that was, you know,

728
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:20.380
I'd be happy if I could have done in an hour and a half. What the fuck?

729
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:25.120
He didn't like eight minutes, that clinic that he,

730
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.310
uh, that he put on. So, um, yeah, he's amazing.

731
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.210
Super talented guy, man. I always was. Yeah.

732
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.680
I always was when he was standing where someone's drinking as white Zinfandel

733
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:40.150
right now with the Boston comedy club is, Hey, so what did you,

734
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:44.950
uh, um, were you shocked about the, uh, election, uh,

735
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.990
results? I wasn't that shocked. Uh, I was,

736
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.440
we finally met somebody who called it. I knew somebody had to bet Trump.

737
00:39:53.441 --> 00:39:57.220
I didn't bet Trump, I didn't want to bet Trump, but I did a tour.

738
00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:01.360
I was on tour in a lot of southern states for, you know,

739
00:40:01.361 --> 00:40:06.361
the month leading up to the election and nothing but Trump signs.

740
00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.270
Right. I mean, that's all I saw. How much you can see a single Hillary song.

741
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:15.040
I saw hundreds of Trump signs and I was like, this,

742
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.240
this could, this might be real cold shit.

743
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.840
I never in a million years than I think, I thought Hillary was the main person.

744
00:40:22.841 --> 00:40:26.560
At the end of the day, there's going to be, yeah. Until that tour. It was funny.

745
00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:31.060
I did it. I did a Conan the day after the, uh, the election and like,

746
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.260
you know, I got so many people like fucking yelling at me thinking like,

747
00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:36.700
how the fuck could you say this about Hillary?

748
00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.780
How the fuck could you say about Trump like that?

749
00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.120
You can't say anything about anybody.

750
00:40:40.121 --> 00:40:42.310
I try to evenly trashed both of them and just say, Hey,

751
00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:43.990
it'd be nice if people stop yelling at each other.

752
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:47.470
Somehow people missed all of that and they, they, you know,

753
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.360
I think especially the Hillary people,

754
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.830
cause they're so disappointed that they just needed somebody.

755
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:56.320
I got so much fucking shit from people and I actually had somebody just texted

756
00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:59.800
me going like, hey man, I saw you on that. I go, and the guy was like,

757
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:04.270
it seemed like, you know, secretly voted for Trump. And then he wrote secretly,

758
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:10.530
secretly, twice. Yeah. And that was just like, yeah, like at,

759
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.060
no, I didn't vote for that guy. No, I didn't.

760
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:15.250
I didn't vote for either one of them. I couldn't stand them. I like Bernie.

761
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:16.600
Bernie was my fucking guy.

762
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.270
I felt like right after the election for the first time,

763
00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:24.130
I felt like Bernie would've won. I was like, people really want to change.

764
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.260
You know, they don't, they don't know how to get,

765
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.290
and they kind of gave me the same old with Hillary. Yeah. And if the,

766
00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:32.290
if I was like, Holy Shit, if Bernie had gotten the nomination,

767
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:33.740
he would probably be the president right now.

768
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.300
People think Joe Biden could have one. I think just like, like I don't,

769
00:41:37.301 --> 00:41:41.120
I don't like familiarity breeds contempt. I mean, everybody's fucking filthy.

770
00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:44.180
There was just something about like, I felt myself saying it,

771
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:46.340
like when I saw Jeb Bush and I saw Clinton, I like,

772
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:49.610
I just can't deal with another Bush or Clinton. It's such a stupid thing to say,

773
00:41:49.611 --> 00:41:52.220
but I was just like, it's true. There's some truth to it because there are,

774
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.120
I want somebody else to lie to me now. I didn't want, I didn't want this guy.

775
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:57.920
I didn't want this guy, you know?

776
00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.960
I'm not saying Bernie would have fucking solved everything,

777
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:02.510
but I will say all this shit that Trump's doing is fucking hilarious.

778
00:42:02.511 --> 00:42:04.070
Where he's like, I'm going to do this. I want to do that.

779
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.430
I'm going to drain the swamp. It's like, dude, okay,

780
00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:10.010
let's just say you actually go in there and you somehow do this.

781
00:42:10.011 --> 00:42:13.320
How slow DC works. Like you're gonna fucking drain the swamp and then what?

782
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:17.060
Expose all these people and then they're all going to go to jail and like

783
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.580
they're going to be okay with this. Yeah, no,

784
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:23.390
I'm going to get all the illegal immigrants out of this country. You're,

785
00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:26.540
you're going to do, how are you going to do that? You can do that. Yeah. Yeah.

786
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.960
I'm going to build a fucking wall from here. Take fucking California to Texas.

787
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.910
You really, you're gonna. You're going to do all of this through.

788
00:42:31.911 --> 00:42:34.310
I think there are. There already is a wall for one, isn't there?

789
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.950
There's already a fence and a wall through a lot of it.

790
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:42.610
It's like at road can't stop people from coming in by blocking off 3% of the

791
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.500
border. It's a target. It's like they're coming in any way they could come in.

792
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.750
My thought he was going to go the whole face of the country,

793
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:55.100
he wasn't going to come in from all over the fucking place. Well, there is,

794
00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:57.590
I actually think about that shit. It's like, um,

795
00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:02.280
there does become the tipping point where you got too many fucking people. Yeah.

796
00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:05.450
There is that, I mean, back in the day, yeah. We needed, you know,

797
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.530
we needed all we could get because of what we were doing, which was underhanded.

798
00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:14.670
We, that's when America was great, but we needed to take all these yeah.

799
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.140
Get out there in the front lines and they would stuck them out west. Hey,

800
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.800
that's your land over there. Go over there and then provoke them into an attack.

801
00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:26.600
Like what the whole fucking thing was shady. Um, yeah. From the beginning. Yeah.

802
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.940
It's not goes for elections. Well, you know, it's crazy.

803
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.540
They've been corrupted and fucked up since the beginning. Like I'm not gonna,

804
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:36.380
I'm not going to say the show, but I recently did a show, right. And, uh,

805
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:41.270
one of the comics went up and this person went and just trashed Donald Trump.

806
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.000
This is after, after the show, after actually the election.

807
00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:47.540
I want the show after the show. They want up after the show, after the election,

808
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:52.250
right. It was like the full five days after whatever they went, right. And, uh,

809
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.410
went in hard on Trump, blah, blah, blah.

810
00:43:54.411 --> 00:43:56.570
He's a sex offender and Anna and all this type of stuff.

811
00:43:56.571 --> 00:43:59.750
And gradually the crowd started booming, right? Half the crowd,

812
00:43:59.751 --> 00:44:00.950
half the crowd fucking booze.

813
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.980
So then the next person goes up who is a Trump supporter.

814
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:08.450
This person goes up and supports Trump and trashes Hillary.

815
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:11.180
Then the other half of the crowd started pulling them.

816
00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:15.350
I've never seen like so divided dude. It's literally like,

817
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.070
it's like a great sec football game where they play in like a neutral site.

818
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.200
Like with Florida plays at Georgia and like,

819
00:44:21.201 --> 00:44:25.880
it's half fucking bulldogs have gators. It's fucking insane. Like,

820
00:44:25.881 --> 00:44:29.510
I've never liked that at the country's so completely divided that it's a little

821
00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:34.020
scary. But the thing that I don't like is that now the p, you know,

822
00:44:34.021 --> 00:44:38.670
whatever side you're on, where you're seeing the other side as your enemy,

823
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:42.520
right. When we're not supposed to be enemies, we're all supposed to,

824
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:45.540
we all live here together. That's ships, sail. Did I know that?

825
00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:47.920
That's what I'm saying. That's what's shitty.

826
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:53.910
[inaudible] snooze came in and balanced out CNN by being just as ridiculously

827
00:44:54.401 --> 00:44:56.590
far to the other side. I mean, those show, those,

828
00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.510
those networks that are hilarious.

829
00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.970
Like when on election night what I would do is I would just,

830
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:02.140
whoever was winning,

831
00:45:02.141 --> 00:45:05.170
I would watch the other network just to watch some stuff into the sweat they

832
00:45:05.171 --> 00:45:08.110
said, yeah, and just got no. I just, just for the comedy of it,

833
00:45:08.111 --> 00:45:10.720
because I knew there was nothing, nothing. I mean,

834
00:45:10.721 --> 00:45:12.160
I voted for who I wanted to vote for.

835
00:45:12.161 --> 00:45:14.770
I knew this fucking state was going to go with Hillary Clinton. I mean,

836
00:45:14.771 --> 00:45:15.670
that's a, that's a given.

837
00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.600
The oceans vote for blue and everybody else in the middle of votes for red and

838
00:45:19.601 --> 00:45:23.170
then it comes down to like fucking Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

839
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:25.900
Evidently North Carolina, which I, I didn't know about that,

840
00:45:25.901 --> 00:45:29.110
but what I was happy was actually was up to date on all the propositions and

841
00:45:29.111 --> 00:45:30.490
voted read them all mean.

842
00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:33.310
My wife would read them for like days in front of me and like,

843
00:45:33.311 --> 00:45:35.590
we're just laughing her ass off. You're like, you'd, we sit there like reading.

844
00:45:35.591 --> 00:45:37.360
There'd be like a, you know,

845
00:45:37.361 --> 00:45:40.510
do you not want them to drill for oil in the middle of your forehead?

846
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:44.090
And then here's the argument for, and you'd be like, wow,

847
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:47.820
that would probably lead to your death. There is no oil in there, blah, blah,

848
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.530
blah, blah, blah. And then it'd be like, the argument gets, actually,

849
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:54.550
it's the complete opposite. Drilling for oil would actually save this to sit.

850
00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:56.440
Next thing you know, you're like, oh, maybe I should vote.

851
00:45:56.441 --> 00:45:58.690
Like I didn't get anything out of those arguments.

852
00:45:58.691 --> 00:46:02.350
And then we were just laughing. We did. You just eventually look at, well,

853
00:46:02.351 --> 00:46:05.800
who supported this? It'd be like, if it was anything environmentally,

854
00:46:05.801 --> 00:46:09.070
it's like Ed Begley Jr. All right, that guy's been riding a bike for 30 years.

855
00:46:09.071 --> 00:46:11.560
Okay. If he's done with this, I'm going with Ed bag. His power,

856
00:46:11.561 --> 00:46:15.460
his whole neighborhood by riding in on a hamster wheel. You know what's funny?

857
00:46:15.461 --> 00:46:19.690
Hey Dude, do we know who, um, hi. What happened with the condoms in Porno?

858
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:24.310
Did that pass or no? Nice. Actually a thing. Yes.

859
00:46:24.311 --> 00:46:28.750
Keep pouring out. Keep some jobs here and a in, in the valley, right?

860
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.200
So no, they don't have to work on them. No, no. I think that that was like,

861
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:36.640
if they do, they do. Okay. Oh, this is classic Americans.

862
00:46:36.641 --> 00:46:39.070
We don't even know. All right, I'll look it up. We're going to look it up.

863
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:43.230
I thought it used to be that way. And now that they've taken a,

864
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:47.580
<v 1>I had to wear condoms and then they were having a hard time. I think it was a,</v>

865
00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:50.560
<v 0>you could not be further up that Mike. So you gotta make a quick point here.</v>

866
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.473
Okay.

867
00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.410
<v 1>It didn't pass. So they don't have to wear condoms,</v>

868
00:46:56.411 --> 00:46:58.860
but they can't get permits right now. They're having a really hard time getting,

869
00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:02.020
<v 0>okay, so porno permits was saying that maybe it passed,</v>

870
00:47:02.021 --> 00:47:05.110
but they can't get permits now. Jesus Christ,

871
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:10.400
new things to vote on other than, uh, offices. We had to vote on, uh,

872
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.110
whether or not we want it to allow casinos in northern Jersey.

873
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:18.760
And what'd you say? I said No. Uh, which, and, and it didn't,

874
00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.070
it was no as overwhelming. No,

875
00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.140
they're not going to be able to put casinos in northern Jersey,

876
00:47:23.141 --> 00:47:27.820
which is in my opinion, very good. Right? I don't hate casinos. Christie's,

877
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.170
but I don't think they should be everywhere.

878
00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.340
What you say Chris Christie is fat and I cough, he's fat enough.

879
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:37.660
He doesn't mean to get in that that skim bag go on to Jersey. Mike's even more.

880
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:41.830
And the other one was like,

881
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.850
should we designate the money from tolls and fuel tax

882
00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:51.530
into Trans public transportation?

883
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:55.180
Which is first question to before to begin with. First question is, well,

884
00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:00.050
where's it going now? A well, anywhere else? I don't know where. I don't,

885
00:48:00.051 --> 00:48:01.850
I really don't know where. But it was meant to be,

886
00:48:01.851 --> 00:48:04.160
be allocated toward that a certain percentage of it initially.

887
00:48:04.161 --> 00:48:06.440
And then that got changed somewhere along the line.

888
00:48:06.441 --> 00:48:10.490
So ours was like voted changed it back was legalizing weed keeping illegal or

889
00:48:10.491 --> 00:48:13.770
something like that. It was the condoms. It was like, should we repair?

890
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.700
There was one about building up schools and everything were initially you're

891
00:48:16.701 --> 00:48:18.830
like, yeah, this is a good thing. And then, but the whole thing,

892
00:48:18.831 --> 00:48:20.480
the whole proposition was written by these,

893
00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.200
this group of people that are builders and Atlanta. Man,

894
00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:26.420
I don't like that the contract is a right in this shit up.

895
00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:30.030
So what's going on with this? Um, they, yeah,

896
00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.540
a lot of interesting shit on yeah. That wasn't allowed. Yeah. No,

897
00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:35.960
I can't remember how there was like, it was like at least another 12th.

898
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:38.960
There was so many, many a vote on every one of them. Yeah.

899
00:48:38.961 --> 00:48:43.130
But what was great was we f we've figured out the best we could what it was and

900
00:48:43.131 --> 00:48:45.920
God knows what is attached to all of that shit too. Right. You know what I mean?

901
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:49.460
And, uh, so I had all my answers before I went in there.

902
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.770
So what was taken everybody like, you know,

903
00:48:51.771 --> 00:48:55.240
a good 20 minutes if you're reading it for the first fucking time. Um,

904
00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.300
I had them all, so I would just look at the page. Yes. Was Up, no was down.

905
00:48:59.301 --> 00:49:02.150
I would just look at my answer sheet and I'd be like up, down, down, up.

906
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.900
And I just, I just fucking blew through it. I was great.

907
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:10.100
It felt like I was cheating on a test. Um, well let me before we get out it,

908
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.070
we should, we gotta get the answer here? What's going on? It did not pass.

909
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:14.850
You know, it did not pass. It did not.

910
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:19.710
They can't get their permits to make porn. Yeah. Even that is calm.

911
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:22.130
Who's behind? Who's, who's a conservative behind that,

912
00:49:22.131 --> 00:49:24.260
that wants to get porno out of the valley. Did,

913
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:28.760
did Tipper Gore moved to the valley recently. Remember her with the NPRC

914
00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.980
<v 1>one guy that wrote it up and if it passed,</v>

915
00:49:30.981 --> 00:49:33.200
he would have a job for the rest of his life.

916
00:49:33.201 --> 00:49:36.720
Basically making sure there were condoms in porn. So he was

917
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.340
<v 0>so one wait, one guy wrote in it. That does not sound real.</v>

918
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.050
So like I could do that. Yeah.

919
00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.400
He's the one guy who supplies the point it has to get,

920
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:49.760
it's got to get through some sort of fucking legislative horseshit right to then

921
00:49:49.761 --> 00:49:52.640
get put on the ballot. So He's gotten money. Yeah. All right.

922
00:49:52.641 --> 00:49:55.220
Cause I would say then the guy who said the rent is too damn high when he got

923
00:49:55.221 --> 00:49:57.350
something done. Remember that guy in New York?

924
00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.480
It's too damn rent is too damn high.

925
00:49:59.481 --> 00:50:02.690
I hate it when like he kept getting laughs and kept hanging around and then like

926
00:50:02.691 --> 00:50:04.850
one of those politicians like I agree with them,

927
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.060
the rent is too darn high.

928
00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:15.290
I don't know how those politicians exist and that level of phony cartoons.

929
00:50:15.291 --> 00:50:18.650
Yeah. Yeah. Algo was one of the most, was the one of the worst I saw.

930
00:50:18.651 --> 00:50:21.440
And that was the thing I think about Trump that was amazing was watching him

931
00:50:21.441 --> 00:50:25.550
just be a be himself, which a lot of people don't like who he was,

932
00:50:25.551 --> 00:50:28.580
but he was being a person. A lot of people don't think a good person,

933
00:50:28.581 --> 00:50:33.530
but like a candid, you can't, you can't accuse him of not being dude.

934
00:50:33.531 --> 00:50:34.910
It was like there was sitting at the table,

935
00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:38.180
but it was politicians and he was the guy running the table and no one could get

936
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:42.350
them. I couldn't fuck them. None. They could not figure out. They're like,

937
00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:46.880
this guy doesn't care about anything. How do we pin him down?

938
00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:50.510
And he didn't give a shit about what he says from one minute to the next.

939
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.990
He didn't care about the little care. He'd be like, oh, she's allowed to talk.

940
00:50:53.991 --> 00:50:57.420
And I can tell great three against one, three guys, three guys, one.

941
00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:03.260
But he said that it was, it was fucking cause Siri ticket, but it was brilliant.

942
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.430
Like do what he did. I mean,

943
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:07.640
I'm not happy that it certainly these fucking guys that he's putting together,

944
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.800
I joked to my last podcast, you know what he was talking about,

945
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.290
you gonna have change and everything and I was just going,

946
00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:14.510
basically he's just doing the exact opposite. It's like fuller house.

947
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:16.130
You just bring it back. This old show,

948
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.970
I'll say it was like the expendable version of the expendables of Republicans.

949
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.580
It's just, dude, it's the whole thing to him was just a game.

950
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.010
It seems if you talk, if you see them interviewed, no, it's just like he,

951
00:51:27.011 --> 00:51:31.520
he's basically like, oh I won and that was it. It doesn't matter how,

952
00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.400
you know, it's just one, you don't have to worried about the summer.

953
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.540
And they're like, but you're going to,

954
00:51:35.541 --> 00:51:37.610
you're doing all this stuff that you said you weren't gonna do. And he's like,

955
00:51:37.611 --> 00:51:41.990
well who else is gonna do it? Basically it's like Marx brothers Shit.

956
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:46.100
Like you can't just say who else is going to do it? That's not an answer,

957
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.440
but it doesn't give a shit. He's like, this is why this is good.

958
00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.180
It answers your getting so fuck you.

959
00:51:50.181 --> 00:51:53.870
But the thing about the media is they had no followup cause they never dealt

960
00:51:53.871 --> 00:51:57.200
with a guy like this who would just admit to, we had a, you know,

961
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:02.210
typical followup doesn't work because they call him out on it and he just says,

962
00:52:02.211 --> 00:52:04.490
yeah, whatever, who cares? And it says something else.

963
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:07.340
Well [inaudible] back in the day when somebody would call,

964
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:08.840
when they would call a politician out,

965
00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.260
they try to get out of it and they would stammer and then they would just keep,

966
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.963
you know,

967
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:16.850
hitting them with it until just the whole embarrassment of the situation.

968
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:21.620
The person would drop out, he just would admit to it and they had nothing.

969
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:24.860
Yeah. And they're like, well, when they said, oh, he's supposed to be bad,

970
00:52:24.861 --> 00:52:27.290
I keep using this as the example that we use. You know,

971
00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:30.620
you've said this about women, you've said that about women, you said this about.

972
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:31.580
And he goes, Nah. He goes,

973
00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:34.670
I said that about Rosie O'Donnell and it got a huge laugh.

974
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.100
And then the female report, it goes like, no,

975
00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:39.720
you've said that about other women too. And he just goes, hey,

976
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:42.980
you probably right. And that was over.

977
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.890
He made a joke and she couldn't even like,

978
00:52:45.891 --> 00:52:48.500
or anybody in that panel couldn't have been like, you're probably right.

979
00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:51.080
So you're saying you are sexist. Is that what you're saying?

980
00:52:51.081 --> 00:52:52.750
Do you think that like, and,

981
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:55.640
but I still think because of what the fuck he represented,

982
00:52:55.641 --> 00:52:59.000
he could've just been like, yes, I am sexist. Yeah,

983
00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:01.760
I can't believe you're not sitting here and making me a pie or something.

984
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:04.460
They get Outta here and let the men handle it.

985
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:07.370
Clearly people were not put off by that,

986
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:10.340
but it's so hard to tell what's what's true and what isn't.

987
00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.930
Anything you read about Hillary in the last three months or five months or

988
00:53:14.931 --> 00:53:18.230
whatever, it could have been taken out of context. Absolutely.

989
00:53:18.231 --> 00:53:20.960
Putting away to make her look, you know, show her in a certain light.

990
00:53:20.961 --> 00:53:21.860
And same with Trump.

991
00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:25.380
It'd be silly to assume that one side is doing it and one side the other is not.

992
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.243
No, they all are.

993
00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:30.520
It's very difficult to tell what the fuck is real and what isn't. You know,

994
00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:35.580
you know [inaudible] got their news from fucking Twitter guilty charge show me

995
00:53:35.971 --> 00:53:39.720
too man. Me, Facebook, all of that. I, I, I'm,

996
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.810

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.013
I, um,

999
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:52.410
I was actually amazed the election night when they had the pictures of each

1000
00:53:52.411 --> 00:53:55.560
candidate and was finally one that the other side hadn't picked.

1001
00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.930
And I was just like, oh, look at Hillary. She looks like a nice person.

1002
00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:01.690
Donald me, it looks like a cool guy. Yeah. They look as Donald.

1003
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.410
Donald was always like this, the scowl.

1004
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:08.670
And he had like the things like that Rudy Giuliani picture that the left is

1005
00:54:08.671 --> 00:54:12.900
using where he looks like he's roaring. He just came up from the flames of hell.

1006
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.290
That thing is fucking, you could, you could do that to anybody,

1007
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:19.410
especially when you're there. Totally. And when you're that old, you know,

1008
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.090
it's such an effort just to speak.

1009
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:23.280
Your face is going to contort and they just have to do,

1010
00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:26.370
take a couple of pictures. You're gonna look like Satan. And then Hillary,

1011
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:30.100
you always just had that crazy fucking smile and the Bible had been gone and

1012
00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.840
done really unflattering light. Like she looked like, you know, I'll do,

1013
00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:36.960
they did. [inaudible] they did everything they possibly could to both of them.

1014
00:54:36.961 --> 00:54:37.441
Mike Trump,

1015
00:54:37.441 --> 00:54:40.440
like his eyebrows by the end of the election were like beneath his eyes.

1016
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:47.190
It's like, well frank, it shook the fact that he actually has one points out,

1017
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.800
a point that he made repeatedly through the campaign,

1018
00:54:49.801 --> 00:54:54.150
which is that the whole system is fucked. It doesn't work. Right? Yeah.

1019
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.670
But I will tell you all those people that think that he's somehow going to get

1020
00:54:56.671 --> 00:55:01.400
them out of their fucking hole is, that's ridiculous. No, you're not. It's,

1021
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.770
they don't give it. It's on you. It's on you. When they try to act like these,

1022
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:09.960
uh, these people are going to save you fucking ass. They're not. No, they can't.

1023
00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:15.120
No, and that's the uplifting message. If this podcast, it'd be worse, dude,

1024
00:55:15.121 --> 00:55:17.220
there's like, there's like a billion people,

1025
00:55:17.221 --> 00:55:21.780
literally a billion people in China that live in abject poverty. Oh, totally.

1026
00:55:21.781 --> 00:55:26.040
Are brainwashed into thinking that that's, you know, that's their place.

1027
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.830
I don't know. It's a billion people. I know. It's like,

1028
00:55:31.831 --> 00:55:35.790
what the fuck? How would you even begin to try to, have you seen this?

1029
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:39.330
Is the thing, tackle an issue like that? Have you seen no way to do it.

1030
00:55:39.331 --> 00:55:42.150
It's just that's how, that's how it is. Have you seen those cities?

1031
00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:45.840
Like they have a few cities over there that have so many fucking people.

1032
00:55:45.841 --> 00:55:50.670
Like it literally looks like there's a fire but it's just the polluted air.

1033
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.230
It's just the area. It's just the air.

1034
00:55:52.231 --> 00:55:55.920
So like when they were having the Olympics over there at some point when they

1035
00:55:55.921 --> 00:55:59.070
were going to shoot something, you know, filming for the world to see,

1036
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:03.900
they told everybody to like not drive or use any machinery or anything.

1037
00:56:03.901 --> 00:56:07.800
God knows what would happen to you if you did for like, like I don't know,

1038
00:56:07.801 --> 00:56:09.690
24 hours to three days or some shit.

1039
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.000
And they just let all of that shit in the air just settle down onto the ground.

1040
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:18.750
Cause that's, that's what it is. Yeah. Cause it's all like, even like out here,

1041
00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:21.960
like a lot of times people think they, the haze is smog but like hazy,

1042
00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:24.100
like smog is Brown. But haze is that clear thing.

1043
00:56:24.101 --> 00:56:27.610
And that haze is all the dust and all this shit that we're kicking up driving

1044
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:30.310
around. Yeah. So everybody at bay, I think basically,

1045
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.720
what's that new thing that kids are doing?

1046
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.390
You act like a mannequin or some shit. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1047
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:38.340
They made like a billion people or half a billion people fucking do that.

1048
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.520
And then people were just like, ah,

1049
00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:42.490
this is a great place to have people go swimming.

1050
00:56:42.491 --> 00:56:46.630
You guys just have to hold still until we're done with the hundred meter

1051
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:51.690
backstroke. Well, get out of here dude. When um,

1052
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.610
oh wait, there's a couple more things on there that I have any lecture,

1053
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:57.640
any more movies or something like you do you know like the next one that you're

1054
00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.310
going to do? As far as the short film, I don't,

1055
00:57:00.311 --> 00:57:04.330
I think I might do another episode of [inaudible]. I like it. I like it a lot.

1056
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:08.310
Uh, and it was really fun and like the idea was that another comic or you know,

1057
00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:11.740
actor friend of mine would be the be the villain, probably another comedian.

1058
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.630
And so we just keep doing those. But I can definitely see that being a series,

1059
00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:20.260
a web series. It was a niche. Initially. There's going to be a web series,

1060
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.970
but then I made the first one and I was like,

1061
00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:26.170
I dunno if I want to put all that into this every single time just on my own.

1062
00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:26.680
Right.

1063
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.380
I might rather try some other stuff and say I want him to see what people like,

1064
00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:32.650
you know, it get some feedback once the stuff is out there and you go,

1065
00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:34.790
oh that leads to something. The next thing you know, you know,

1066
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.110
you have something on you. I've got something on fucking Amazon or Netflix.

1067
00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.620
Yeah. Like you're walking down a red carpet. People yelling at Ben,

1068
00:57:41.621 --> 00:57:45.370
what are you wearing? What are you wearing? I'm like,

1069
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:49.370
I don't know. And then they go back. Then they go back through all year and,

1070
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:53.860
and uh, uh, uh, recently unearthed gym, meet at race,

1071
00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:57.970
made a face. And you sadly also have, uh, yeah,

1072
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.740
for 12 years now it's a period film. Cause while actually was anyway,

1073
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.310
I want to see it because I want to see like I, cause I'm,

1074
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:08.970
I'm one of those guys that I, I love seeing New York and Oh, you'll love it.

1075
00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:13.210
Any era that it isn't now. Like I love seeing it in the nineties now.

1076
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:17.020
I love seeing it in the 80s. I love seventies of this shit.

1077
00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:21.070
And then the sixties and fifties when it goes back is great. I love them.

1078
00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:24.420
Like I watch, I watch old fucking movies for that reason. Like sometimes I'll,

1079
00:58:24.421 --> 00:58:28.600
I'll watch an old movie and I'll see a guy driving down sunset and you just see

1080
00:58:28.601 --> 00:58:32.080
how spread out the buildings are and how, I mean the shooting,

1081
00:58:32.081 --> 00:58:33.510
so you don't know about the traffic. Uh,

1082
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:35.770
but it's just like some of that stuff where it was just,

1083
00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:38.470
you could just see the hills and stuff. It's like, yeah,

1084
00:58:38.471 --> 00:58:40.030
that back then that's where they had like,

1085
00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:42.900
you want to go shoot a mountain lion and you're like walked out your backyard

1086
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.700
and he's ready. He's just right down the road. Yeah. In, in La. So anyways,

1087
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:48.520
I should say before we go, sorry.

1088
00:58:48.521 --> 00:58:52.540
I also have two podcasts shows that are going to be on this, on the new website.

1089
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.690
Oh, cool. Uh, one of them is a storytelling show. Beautiful.

1090
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:59.110
I remember DC Benny and I used to do that show urban myth. Yeah. Wait, what?

1091
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:00.750
What venue did did that, was that,

1092
00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:03.460
I almost got to this earlier when we're talking about zinc bar,

1093
00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:06.910
because that was the original bank bar was on Houseton street. Yes.

1094
00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.460
And that's where we would do urban myth every Tuesday,

1095
00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:13.640
the new podcast I have is called tall, but true. It's a storytelling show.

1096
00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:17.020
It's been, it's pretty much urban myth. Oh, cool. Has a podcast.

1097
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:20.230
So it's like the two of us tell a story and then a guest tells a story.

1098
00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:24.290
So love to have you do that. Call into that if you want. And then another one,

1099
00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:26.930
uh, and that'll all be on the real Ben bailey.com. Yeah.

1100
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:29.870
And then one where my girl and I, it's called speaking of movies,

1101
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:33.570
we watch a movie and then we just talk about the movie afterward a,

1102
00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:36.800
it goes around, which we love, which we did anyway. And then one day we're like,

1103
00:59:36.801 --> 00:59:39.230
we always have these great conversations after we watch a movie.

1104
00:59:39.231 --> 00:59:40.220
Let's just start recording them.

1105
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:43.610
So can you recommend a movie that you've seen lately that you liked? Dude,

1106
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:46.940
I watched, uh, you've probably seen it I'm way behind,

1107
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:51.830
but I just watched Batman versus superman. I liked it. I've loved it, man.

1108
00:59:51.831 --> 00:59:54.170
You've already seen it all. Yeah, I thought it was great. I liked it.

1109
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:57.560
I said that yesterday at a Benson's podcast.

1110
00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:00.860
Doug loves movies and everybody's like, what? They were like,

1111
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.020
they thought it was awesome. I liked the uh,

1112
01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:10.820
sorry, but I liked the, uh, how the, the way they had f like the,

1113
01:00:10.821 --> 01:00:12.410
the government getting involved on me.

1114
01:00:12.411 --> 01:00:15.950
He just had this guy acting unilaterally and whatever the fuck that means,

1115
01:00:15.951 --> 01:00:16.241
you know, just,

1116
01:00:16.241 --> 01:00:19.760
just basically helping out who the fuck he wants and people claiming him and all

1117
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:22.880
that. I was just going to hold accountable the arrows. Yeah.

1118
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:26.270
That actually seemed like some shit that they would do and then demonize them

1119
01:00:26.271 --> 01:00:28.280
and all that. Like I always forget movies, the sat kind of song.

1120
01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:30.770
But that thing stuck out with me. I, I really liked that.

1121
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.590
I thought it was great man. And it's, it's a, you know,

1122
01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:38.480
if you ever seen a watchman, remember that one? That's the same director, uh,

1123
01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:41.510
Zack Snyder, I think his name is. He made the watchman,

1124
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:46.750
which is like super dark superhero movie based on this graphic novel,

1125
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.370
which is awesome. You should check it out. You'd love it.

1126
01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:53.360
You're there called the comedian. Oh, cool. Superhero called the comedian.

1127
01:00:53.361 --> 01:00:54.350
He's like super dark.

1128
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.470
The only thing I don't like about superman movies is it always comes down to the

1129
01:00:57.471 --> 01:01:01.280
Kryptonite. It's always, it's never, he never bangs the wrong girl.

1130
01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.960
It's you just know. Okay, wait,

1131
01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:05.780
when's the green chain getting wrapped around his neck? Yeah.

1132
01:01:05.781 --> 01:01:08.330
When's it going to happen? That's the only thing that can do it.

1133
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:10.880
The only thing that he's, he's too powerful. That's the thing.

1134
01:01:10.881 --> 01:01:13.160
It almost gets a little boring. Well, well, Ben,

1135
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:16.780
we finally got you on the podcast. I finally got the play jam with you, man.

1136
01:01:16.781 --> 01:01:20.780
It was fucking awesome and a continued success. Check out all things.

where's the next read? Oh there it is. Thank you. Tracker, a Lyft,

1177
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:53.610
you know about Lyft, right?

1178
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:56.880
It's the app that gets you rides in minutes on demand 24,

1179
01:03:56.881 --> 01:04:01.740
seven for less than the cost of a cab if you try and lift. You know what I mean?

1180
01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:04.200
With Lyft, you just download the app. ProQuest the driver,

1181
01:04:04.201 --> 01:04:08.130
they show up in three and a half minutes on average. That's really fast.

1182
01:04:08.131 --> 01:04:09.360
In case you didn't know there,

1183
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:14.550
every Lyft driver is fully vetted through their 10 point safety standard.

1184
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:19.790
Have you ever killed anyone to d a jerk off when you're driving three,

1185
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.080
right? They go through the whole thing. So you'd be safe,

1186
01:04:22.081 --> 01:04:25.500
including criminal and DMV background checks a,

1187
01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:29.640
you'll know you'll get around quickly and safely.

1188
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:33.870
Why can I read tonight? Lyft drivers are rated after every ride.

1189
01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:35.400
It's only the best stick around.

1190
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:39.120
You don't have to worry about getting into a filthy card with some creepy dude.

1191
01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:42.270
Uh, with Lyft, you can tip in the app,

1192
01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.600
which obviously leads to happier drivers. I mean,

1193
01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:49.500
nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating from the passengers.

1194
01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:53.250
It's just better all around experience. What happens on that 10th one.

1195
01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.370
We'll leave that up. Bigger isn't always better.

1196
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.440
I'm your fucking size queen Lyft isn't the biggest ride sharing app,

1197
01:05:01.441 --> 01:05:03.960
but it's the fastest growing in the highest rated one.

1198
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.980
I'm talking quality over quantity. You know where they're taking a shot at here.

1199
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.520
It rhymes with scoober. Um, thanks to Lyft,

1221

You're stepping into a better day. Think of what, think about it.

1223

Underwear is the first thing you put on the last thing you take off.

1224
01:06:41.121 --> 01:06:42.200
Unless you Matthew mcconaughey,

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:06.910
[inaudible],

1283
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:07.870
<v 5>hey, what's going on?</v>

1284
01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.960
And still birth is the Monday morning podcast and a,

1285
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.510
it's, it's

1286
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:14.343
<v 6>late in the day.</v>

1287
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:19.330
And I finally got to it and this is my fourth attempt at trying to do a good

1288
01:10:19.331 --> 01:10:23.080
one, get a good one now. But that line,

1289
01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:28.090
what movies that from fast times at Ridgemont High Mr hand, do you remember him?

1290
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:30.550
Do you know the guy who played that?

1291
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:35.970
He was in my favorite Martian and he took that gig back in the early sixties and

1292
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:41.170
for so select 30 fucking years, every time somebody ran up to them they said,

1293
01:10:41.171 --> 01:10:43.000
hey, it's that fucking Martian guy.

1294
01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.820
And he hated life and he hated that fucking show.

1295
01:10:45.821 --> 01:10:47.560
And then he did that show movie.

1296
01:10:47.561 --> 01:10:51.880
Fast Times at Ridgemont high in one day the clouds parted and some young young

1297
01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:54.130
kid came walking up to him and said, hey Mr hand.

1298
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.230
And evidently he was really excited. Isn't that a nice show? Business Story?

1299
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:04.000
I don't know what the fuck that has to do with my podcast or this fucking bus

1300
01:11:04.001 --> 01:11:08.200
that is in front of me that is not moving. Go your bus.

1301
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:13.000
You go merge, you've con. Um, anyways, uh,

1302
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:15.180
you're new to my page on my website.

1303
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:18.360
I do one of these every single week and people send me questions and I try to

1304
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:19.980
answer them to the best of my ability.

1305
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:22.620
I try not to say constant during the podcast,

1306
01:11:22.621 --> 01:11:26.640
but occasionally it's flips out when there's a broad boss driving two miles an

1307
01:11:26.641 --> 01:11:30.030
hour. What the fuck is wrong with me? I can't say words.

1308
01:11:30.031 --> 01:11:35.031
Lately I was working at Xannies in Nashville and I kept stumbling over words and

1309
01:11:35.341 --> 01:11:37.590
then I started thinking why I keep stumbling over these words.

1310
01:11:37.591 --> 01:11:39.840
And then I almost started stuttering on stage.

1311
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:45.240
And speaking of which, if you came out to see me at xannies in Nashville,

1312
01:11:45.241 --> 01:11:47.490
Tennessee, I just want to say thank you very much.

1313
01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.580
And even though I just said thank you very much,

1314
01:11:50.581 --> 01:11:52.920
you might've sensed a little bit of anger underneath that.

1315
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.630
And it has nothing to do with you guys.

1316
01:11:55.620 --> 01:12:00.240
It has to do with the fact that there aren't enough hours in the day today and

1317
01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:04.560
I'm fucking frustrated. And uh, I basically only have about 10,

1318
01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:08.280
15 minutes to do this podcast. And you know, usually,

1319
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:13.320
usually I go on for about 45 minutes, but today, uh, whatever, half hour,

1320
01:12:13.321 --> 01:12:17.460
this is going to be like an EDP kinda like guns and roses that lies album,

1321
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:20.550
except I'm not going to drop the n word, you know.

1322
01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:22.650
So slash if you're listening to this,

1323
01:12:22.651 --> 01:12:25.200
if you're one of the 14 people who listens to my podcast,

1324
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:27.810
you're not going to feel awkward or after

1325
01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.000
I have to fucking explain yourself. Um,

1326
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:37.020
I don't fucking know people. You know what? You know what? I got nothing.

1327
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:41.430
I got nothing this week. I got nothing. Funny to say. I am fucking burnt out.

1328
01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:45.000
I just did back to back weeks on the road plus a college.

1329
01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:47.630
Do you want to hear them? You want to hear my a,

1330
01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:52.140
my week I was in a always in Washington DC.

1331
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:57.090
Then I was in la and then I went to Colorado.

1332
01:12:57.690 --> 01:13:00.870
Then I flew to Indianapolis,

1333
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:06.060
did the Bob and Tom Show, and I had a night off the night before.

1334
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:09.360
And because my brain never shuts off, I'm like, well,

1335
01:13:09.361 --> 01:13:13.320
why the fuck would I just chill out in Indianapolis when I can drive four

1336
01:13:13.321 --> 01:13:17.490
fucking hours up to Detroit and go to a red wings game? And that's what I did,

1337
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.480
except I thought it was only a two hour drive and it turned out it was a fucking

1338
01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:24.510
four hour drive, four and a half actually. And I went up,

1339
01:13:24.511 --> 01:13:25.740
there was Redwings penguins,

1340
01:13:25.741 --> 01:13:27.540
which turned out to be one of the games of the year,

1341
01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:30.300
but I had to leave before the third period ended.

1342
01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:33.510
And I missed the penguins come back and went and over time.

1343
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:35.600
But I still got to go to that arena. And, uh,

1344
01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.870
I couldn't believe how small it was. You know, there was no upper deck.

1345
01:13:39.871 --> 01:13:43.870
It just kind of went straight up. You know, it was kind of an, I don't know,

1346
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:48.510
an old school building and like in 1975 kind of way. But, uh,

1347
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:52.890
I was really cool and the fans were awesome. And uh, you know,

1348
01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:57.720
I don't like go into that expansion shit and I don't like fair weather fans and

1349
01:13:57.910 --> 01:14:00.960
that's choice. Got Good fans. And there were a lot of Pittsburgh penguin fans.

1350
01:14:00.961 --> 01:14:05.040
They're talking a lot of shit even when they were down for two or to two

1351
01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:09.060
periods. And I missed them all talking shit when they came back and one seven,

1352
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:10.380
six and fucking over time.

1353
01:14:10.381 --> 01:14:15.180
And where was driving by fucking corn field in the middle of Indiana, Bob.

1354
01:14:15.181 --> 01:14:16.014
And

1355
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:21.640
so my brain right now is frazzled and um,

1356
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.400
you know, you might wonder, uh, what the fuck is wrong with bill and, uh,

1357
01:14:27.401 --> 01:14:29.440
you know, I don't have any answers driving a hybrid.

1358
01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:34.630
I just drank three quarters of a Sam Adams Beer, one of their seasonal brews.

1359
01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:39.460
And I'm on my way to a writers meeting because I have to go write some sketches

1360
01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:43.480
for something that I'm shooting and I'm exhausted.

1361
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.450
This is one of these times when I just wanna sleep for fucking nine,

1362
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:51.970
10 hours and wake up the next day and just stare at the fucking wall.

1363
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:55.060
But I can't because I have to do this.

1364
01:14:56.050 --> 01:15:00.220
I have to somehow put my voice into a sketch, which is not an easy thing to do.

1365
01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:05.590
I find it's very hard for me to write sketches because I write very set up,

1366
01:15:05.591 --> 01:15:06.880
punch, set up, punch.

1367
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:11.320
There's not a lot of layers that mental left model left turns, you know,

1368
01:15:11.321 --> 01:15:12.154
it's just like my act.

1369
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:16.540
There's a lot of screaming and a the f word so long you have to figure out how

1370
01:15:16.541 --> 01:15:17.950
to do that. And we're at a red light,

1371
01:15:17.951 --> 01:15:20.380
so I think it's time for a podcast question. Look at this.

1372
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:24.250
This is just like the cash cap. Uh, okay. Bill. Question number one.

1373
01:15:24.251 --> 01:15:28.120
Have you ever been asked to write material for another comedian?

1374
01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.140
First of all, look at this fucking guy riding down the street with a bicycle.

1375
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.580
I hate when people do that.

1376
01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.670
They put a reflector on their back and then all of a sudden they just,

1377
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:39.400
they feel like they're like a, this sorta like a,

1378
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:41.800
a motorcycle on some level.

1379
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:46.900
They start riding with traffic like the Kevin Bacon and quicksilver, you know,

1380
01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.350
nothing makes me want to lean over and open my passenger door

1381
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.360
and commit vehicular manslaughter like some fucking turn your life.

1382
01:15:58.210 --> 01:16:03.100
Somebody didn't have the lights on. Um, like that. Do you know what?

1383
01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.280
I don't know what the fuck was I taught? What was the question?

1384
01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:11.140
Have I ever been asked to write material for another comedian? Ah, yes,

1385
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:16.120
yes. I have. I have a written for a,

1386
01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:20.710
I wrote for one roast is Shaquille O'Neal roast and I got to admit,

1387
01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:23.650
you know, at first I started writing the jokes and I was like,

1388
01:16:23.651 --> 01:16:25.130
I don't want to write jokes from another comedian.

1389
01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.790
I want to write them for me and I want to be able to say them.

1390
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:29.350
So I get the laugh.

1391
01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:33.340
But then I realize what's cool about a roast is you're not at work like writing

1392
01:16:33.341 --> 01:16:34.630
for Comedians Act,

1393
01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:39.040
whether then going to go on HBO and kill with some joke and get credit for,

1394
01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:43.030
um, it's, it's a very specific thing.

1395
01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:45.940
It's not like I have a chunk of material about Shaquille O'Neal,

1396
01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.610
so what do I care? And I wrote it and dome evidently went really well.

1397
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:54.100
People in the writers room, I guess liked it.

1398
01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:57.700
And I got a real kick out of it and a, I got one joke on the air

1399
01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:02.380
and I believe that joke was, uh,

1400
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.440
something about watching Shaquille O'Neal play basketball was like watching a

1401
01:17:08.441 --> 01:17:11.120
retard, something along those lines,

1402
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:15.530
something along the lines of that. He was just such a big dude. You know,

1403
01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:18.380
he's such a big fucking dude that even when he dunks the ball,

1404
01:17:18.381 --> 01:17:21.320
it doesn't look good. He looks like a fat kid, Dunkin,

1405
01:17:21.321 --> 01:17:25.790
a ball and like a nerf hoop set. And that was basically, that was basically it.

1406
01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:29.810
I went the cheap route. I use retard as a reference out, so I'm not proud of it,

1407
01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:32.120
but it got on the air. All right, here's another one.

1408
01:17:32.121 --> 01:17:35.330
Do you agree that the reason main TV shows are abruptly canceled?

1409
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:41.030
The reason many TV shows are properly canceled is due to the media's attempt to

1410
01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:45.950
control what we watch, such as reality TV. Okay.

1411
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:51.050
Um, the media, his attempt is if the entire media is working together,

1412
01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:53.840
um, if you're in the conspiracy theory,

1413
01:17:53.841 --> 01:17:58.841
I would work a little higher up the ladder and try to see who owns media in this

1414
01:17:58.911 --> 01:18:03.680
country. And you'd be surprised. It's not that many people. So,

1415
01:18:04.190 --> 01:18:05.820
uh, I dunno.

1416
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.290
I don't think reality TV is an attempt to keep for them to control what we

1417
01:18:09.291 --> 01:18:13.430
watch. I just think it's really cheap and it's, uh,

1418
01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:17.900
it's something mesmerizing about watching 10 losers in a house,

1419
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:22.070
talk shit about each other. As much as I make fun of it.

1420
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:26.030
Does this guy just fucking bump into me with the fuck is wrong with you?

1421
01:18:26.031 --> 01:18:29.960
You fucking idiot. I just fucking rear ended me.

1422
01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:32.543
<v 7>Hang on a second.</v>

1423
01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.660
<v 6>Fucking do this. I'll fuck away. He just did that</v>

1424
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:41.660
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

1425
01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:44.540
<v 6>quite a gut. I think some guy just literally tapped my bumper.</v>

1426
01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:49.983
<v 7>Hang on a sec.</v>

1427
01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:51.491
<v 6>You know what?</v>

1428
01:18:51.491 --> 01:18:53.990
This would be great if we get to a fucking red light cause I know we didn't hit

1429
01:18:53.991 --> 01:18:57.170
it hard enough. Hold on, hold on a second.

1430
01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:02.490
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

1431
01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:06.020
<v 6>bump into me. Hang on a sec.</v>

1432
01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:10.670
Did you just bumped into me? You didn't. Okay.

1433
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:12.380
I don't know if it was my car or not.

1434
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:15.410
I was wondering why you had such a nonchalant look on your face.

1435
01:19:15.411 --> 01:19:19.100
I'm like he's saying all right. I'm just making sure. Alright. Alright,

1436
01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:24.750
sorry about that. Okay. All right.

1437
01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:31.520
Okay, so anyways, let me know. You didn't bump into me.

1438
01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:35.810
I think my car just had like a hiccup but it literally felt like somebody just

1439
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:39.350
tapped my phone and I looked in the rear view mirror.

1440
01:19:39.351 --> 01:19:43.580
This guy was right on my fucking ass. You guys almost heard in la moment

1441
01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:47.080
what is I fought him. I want to fuck, fuck.

1442
01:19:47.230 --> 01:19:49.830
And if the I have enough speaker phone do it,

1443
01:19:49.831 --> 01:19:53.280
then they could have used my podcast in court.

1444
01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:57.760
Then I finally would have got past like 50 fucking listeners. God Damn it.

1445
01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:02.270
That was, that was a moment right there. That was a moment that almost happened.

1446
01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:08.550
Chris. Stupid question. Did you just pull up into me? Ah, no, I, oh, okay.

1447
01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:12.810
Jesus. Can you believe I'm not a private investigator with that?

1448
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:17.790
So that sort of fucking police work. All right. So anyways,

1449
01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:22.230
anyway, Shit. I gotta wrap this podcast up cause I'm at where the fuck I'm at.

1450
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.400
So this guy BIM writers thing that I'm doing, but you gotta admit, you know,

1451
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:31.110
that was pretty exciting that for a second. Um, all right, let's,

1452
01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:33.900
let's try to blow through some of these more, some more of these questions. Oh,

1453
01:20:33.901 --> 01:20:34.740
before I get off the phone,

1454
01:20:34.741 --> 01:20:38.190
thanks to everybody who came up to see me that xannies in Nashville,

1455
01:20:38.191 --> 01:20:43.191
Tennessee and had an awesome time and literally tons more people showed up since

1456
01:20:43.531 --> 01:20:45.720
the last time. It's really made me feel good that, you know,

1457
01:20:45.721 --> 01:20:49.440
people actually saw my special, they liked it and it made them want to come out.

1458
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.340
And uh, I'm really psyched about that. And I know I've been telling you guys,

1459
01:20:53.341 --> 01:20:56.940
I'm putting the dates up for 2009 they're definitely getting up this week.

1460
01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:00.780
I talked to my booker and uh, they're supposed to be emailing me something.

1461
01:21:00.781 --> 01:21:03.870
So I'll get the dates up, up on my website, up on my mind space page.

1462
01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:08.310
Please come out to see me and you'll watch me put together my next special that

1463
01:21:08.311 --> 01:21:12.490
hopefully I will take this summer coming summer. So anyways,

1464
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:15.960
here's a long question about corporate America. Hey Bill,

1465
01:21:15.961 --> 01:21:18.720
let me tell you why I F in hate corporate America,

1466
01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:21.540
especially Verizon exclamation point.

1467
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:24.540
They sold me a blackberry that recently for the fifth time,

1468
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:25.740
the keyboard wouldn't work,

1469
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:29.010
couldn't make or answer calls and couldn't do anything.

1470
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.610
Each time it would happen, I'd go to Verizon, they would fix it for me.

1471
01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:34.080
But the last time, a few weeks ago,

1472
01:21:34.081 --> 01:21:37.650
a buddy of mine in the army was costing to the day before he shipped off to Iraq

1473
01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:42.240
and I was unable to answer the call. Jesus, that sounds like a lifetime movie.

1474
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.620
I guess a little phone, I need to say goodbye.

1475
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:52.100
So I went to Verizon furiously as you should have demanding an explanation on

1476
01:21:52.411 --> 01:21:54.750
why they sold me such a shitty phone.

1477
01:21:55.170 --> 01:21:58.680
They told me that they could do was replace it with the same model phone in

1478
01:21:58.681 --> 01:22:02.880
which my response was all you'd be doing is giving me a shiny year piece of

1479
01:22:02.881 --> 01:22:07.680
shit. God bless you. God bless you.

1480
01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:11.070
That's exactly what you should have said and they should have taken the phone

1481
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:15.120
and buried inside of his head and blamed him for that design as if he designed

1482
01:22:15.121 --> 01:22:16.590
it all right. Leading me.

1483
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:21.210
And this basically led him to sign up with a t and t and now Verizon wants to

1484
01:22:21.211 --> 01:22:25.110
charge me with $125 early termination fee.

1485
01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:29.430
I've been arguing my case with them on the phone trying to explain to them that

1486
01:22:29.431 --> 01:22:32.880
if I still had Verizon I wouldn't be able to make this phone call.

1487
01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:37.650
They kept telling me that they understand why I am except upset and which my

1488
01:22:37.651 --> 01:22:38.670
response was great.

1489
01:22:38.671 --> 01:22:43.290
So if you understand why you still ask for my money and basically there is no

1490
01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:46.800
way that I'm going to buckle and give it in to them. Good, good for you.

1491
01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:48.630
I keep calling them disputing them.

1492
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:52.410
I'll keep calling them the student up for two years if I have to.

1493
01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:56.010
To me it's a matter of principle because what pisses me off is how these

1494
01:22:56.011 --> 01:22:59.030
corporations are allowed to conduct business. You know,

1495
01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:03.480
I don't even need the rest of the three. The rest is exactly exactly that.

1496
01:23:03.481 --> 01:23:07.180
They're bigger than you and they have more money than you and they can wait you

1497
01:23:07.181 --> 01:23:10.150
out and then they can send you shit to a collection agency cause you're the

1498
01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:13.750
little guy and they know that you're not going to do that.

1499
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:17.890
This is what you want to do. You want to, you got to do that old school thing.

1500
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:18.191
Just go.

1501
01:23:18.191 --> 01:23:23.191
I want it to speak to a manager and you keep going up the ladder asking to speak

1502
01:23:24.371 --> 01:23:26.530
to somebody, bumped them, get everybody's name,

1503
01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:31.120
keep using words like ridiculous and outrageous.

1504
01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.560
Like this is ridiculous.

1505
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:37.590
This is outrageous and a just do it the way like an old lady would and just,

1506
01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:42.040
just don't get off the phone. Don't ever curse. If you never curse,

1507
01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:44.680
then they can't. Uh,

1508
01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:49.990
they can't hang up on you. I'm full of Shit. I don't know what to do.

1509
01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:53.260
You know what? Go burn down their fucking building or something.

1510
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:57.280
But I'm sorry man, I really didn't answer that question well, but, uh,

1511
01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.570
I gotta go in and do this meeting, so whatever.

1512
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:06.100
Thanks for listening to the Monday morning podcast. I know this was real short,

1513
01:24:06.101 --> 01:24:06.431
but hey,

1514
01:24:06.431 --> 01:24:11.431
we had a nice yelling match with a potential yelling match with another person

1515
01:24:12.341 --> 01:24:14.920
in the car, which turned out to be friendly.

1516
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.920
How bad did you guys want that to escalate into violence? You know, you did.

1517
01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:20.080
Then you could have heard me get my ass kicked.

1518
01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:23.680
Like I just rolled down the window like I've ever taken a karate class.

1519
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:27.550
It was fucking ridiculous. But fortunately, shit didn't go down that way.

1520
01:24:27.551 --> 01:24:31.480
So anyways, it was very short, very exciting. TJ Hooker,
