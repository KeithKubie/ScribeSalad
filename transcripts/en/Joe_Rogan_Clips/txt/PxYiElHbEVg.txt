Speaker 1:          00:00          Are So opposite because I've only been in one fight in my life. It was in ninth grade playing basketball and it was against a dude named Matama. Like I'll never forget, his name is Matama Drake. And I threw one punch and I hit him right in the face and he looks at me and goes, what's up? And I was,

Speaker 2:          00:18          oh no. [inaudible] know. Like, oh, we're good. Oh my God, you

Speaker 1:          00:28          get away with it. Oh yeah, we'd start playing bass. Thank God. Like that was it. Like literally I hit him as hard as I could. I could take a shot. Oh. And it was just like, what's up? I was like, nothing. Nothing is up. So that's the only time that you back? No. Wow. No, cause I, I, then I started, you know, oh you okay. It's your ball man did not try to get you back. I mean, and then I, I was, there was a club in Houston named power tools that I used to a gay bar. No, w no, no, no. It to be right. Yeah. It sounds like one that was hardcore gay bars. Houston, the gay bar was called riches at the time, but I worked at power tools and I was a bouncer. So that's when I was like 250 pounds, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:09          Uh, you are a lot bigger when I met you. Oh yeah. Cause I played college football for Arkansas, so I played outside linebacker. So I was just stop lifting weights or do you still put a little bit? No, I'm all cardio now because yeah, like trainers, any trainer I work with since I got a big frame or like what puts him said no, I want to stay lean. Right. You know, but it's good for old age to man. You don't want to have back problems in 44 years old now. Yeah. I'm a crazy dude. Two time flies. 51 see what 55 zero two in is so scary when you read stories about people just dropping dead too, like around her age. Luke Perry. That's what I'm saying. Mason Lee my age. Well, they said what? What is the danger zone is like 45 to 55 with heart failure.

Speaker 1:          01:52          It's like cry in. Oh Man. Did I beat my body up. I'm running that bitch until the fuck his wheels fall off. I'm always getting stem cell shots and I'll fucking run in hills and lifting weights. I still live heavyweights retarded. Yeah. Why don't you tell that word? Set it again. Trying to get that rid of that word out of my vocabulary. It just comes out sometimes. Why? Why are you still lifting weights? Like heavy like that? Like what does it do for you? Well it does a bunch of things. First of all, if you want to train Jujitsu, it's very good to be strong. Yeah, it makes a big difference. First of all, for defense, especially for defense, you know like for offense for sure too, but really you want to be able to defend you. Like defending is you have to be strong but also you just like being bigger.

Speaker 1:          02:33          It helps. Yeah, I like it. Yeah. I like being able to pick up things. I liked the physical ability of beans for, I liked being in shape too. Yeah. Like being able to run for long distances. I like knowing that I can go rounds on the bag, like I'll do fives hard rounds on the back so you can run it on. My knees are messed up. I can't like get on a treadmill and raw. I can do like I've done the stem and the knee and it's helped out a lot, but I'm still that dude that's on, I'm like on the super fortunate. I'm super fortunate. My knee injuries, I've had knee injuries, but um, my meniscus, I only had one meniscus scope on my left knee and it wasn't terrible. Like I was back to full 100% function after that. And my right knee, I didn't, I have a little baby tear that I've got some stem cell shot into, but I had both of them reconstructed.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Their ACL were replaced, but I'm no problems. They work, they work great. Yeah. See, I just need to, I listened to you and I, it's like you always taken something and I'm like, Oh, I've got to find out what that is and now just want to get in better shape. I'm in shape, but I, it's when you get older it's just like tough. It is just, it just key is writing it down like you have to do it. Like do, do you keep a daily schedule off? Shit, you have to do it? No, I just wake up and go. I do have, I wake up, I work out like a cardio workout and then I do infrared sauna, which has changed my life. Changed Your Life, right? Every morning I infrared sauna for now. It's the best. You sweat all that shit out. You're like, you feel great.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Your skin glistens like I think it's actually like changed the game for me. I have more energy now. Everything's better. It's so good for your body. They did a study that showed a 40% decrease in mortality, mortality amongst all causes, heart attack, stroke, cancer, 40% decrease with people that were doing the sauna four times a week. Well, I will tell you this because the whole thing is everybody wants to feel young and when you were young, the thing you did most of sweat and I feel like when I sweat, it just it's, it feels, I don't know, I just feel good sweating because he reminds me of when I played sports. It reminds me even though I'm not doing on the, you know, I sweat a little on the treadmill, but when I do that infrared, it makes me feel great. Mom, I think there's a bunch of shit going on, but there's that.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Yeah, for sure. Like it's good to feel good, like you're sweating, but there's heat shock proteins. Your body actually produces anti inflammatory properties. It's really good for you. It's really good for joint aches and all kinds of like this. I used to think of the song as being nonsense. Like what do you, what do you fucking lane in the Sauna for liquidity doing? They're just getting hot school workout, post workout. What kind of sauna do you do though? I do a regular song. Okay. Super Hot. Regular Simon telling you you need to try the infrared. It's Ken. Yeah. I mean, but look, it's all just about getting your body, Huh? Yeah. Like it's good to try to infrared. I'm sure. I'm sure it works great. But this study, the 40% decrease in mortality, that was with a regular storm saw. Okay. Yeah. That's why I got a regular sauna because a doctor, Rhonda Patrick told me that, okay, the studies that have been done have all been done with a regular sauna and she said there might be some benefit for infrared on it, but I don't know what's published.

Speaker 1:          05:30          What is, see if there's a benefit. See if this, they can say what's the benefit to infrared cooking my organs. I don't even know it. No, I don't think so. No, I think it's great for just feel amazing afterwards. Supposedly what happens, right? It gets deeper in your tissue or something. Like it's supposed to go deeper inside. I remember I was texting back and forth. I was like, you gotta like if you do the infrared sauna for like a week, it's a game changer. It just is too. So I don't know. I would like you to try regular sauna to, how hot does the infrared get? A like 140 140 minutes by heating the air though too. It's a difference. It's not, it doesn't heat the air. It's like you walk in and it feels, it doesn't feel like it's that, but that's just weird. That's your microwave shit. None of that, man. It's like hot pockets. Can you turn them into a hot pocket? That's what I'm saying. I probably burned it up all my organs right now, but I don't know. I love it. I like coming in and feeling that superheat. You go in there and you're like, oh, it feels so good.
