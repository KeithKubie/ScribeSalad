00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.329
Even if Grant makes 0 glasses wipers, we know that he's going to have to pay

00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:08.697
$1,200 for rent each month. So, his expenses are going to start at $1,200 and

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.207
they continue to increase incrementally for each wiper set he produces. So, we

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.806
need to include both of these pieces of information in our equation. That means,

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:22.411
that this answer choice, 6.5 times number of glasses wiper sets made, can't be

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:27.208
right because it doesn't account for the monthly rent. The first choice here is

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.888
actually not right either because this is saying that for every glasses wiper

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.459
set that Grant makes, he'll pay $1,200. That would be pretty unfortunate for

00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:41.264
him, that would be a very, very expensive wiper business. And we also know that

00:00:41.276 --> 00:00:45.521
it costs $6.50 not $1,200 to make each wiper set. That leaves us with two more

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:49.678
choices, both of which include 1,200 and 6.5 times the number of glasses wipers

00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:54.007
made. The difference between these is the sign here. If we pick this third

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.125
answer choice right here, we'll be seeing that Grant's monthly expenses decrease

00:00:58.137 --> 00:01:02.562
because of this negative sign right here. Decrease for every glasses wiper sets

00:01:02.574 --> 00:01:07.035
he makes. This would mean that he would actually be making money off of paying

00:01:07.047 --> 00:01:11.345
for materials, which doesn't really make sense. That means this answer choice

00:01:11.357 --> 00:01:15.550
isn't right either. The last one is correct. Grant will spend a fixed amount of

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:19.430
$1,200 and then, on top of that, he will spend $6.50 for every wiper set he

00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:20.297
made.
