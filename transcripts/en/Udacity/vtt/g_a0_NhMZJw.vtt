00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's see. It takes 45 sec to swing back and forth 10 times.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
To swing back and forth one time would be a period of 4.5 sec.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now remember this is the period for the pendulum--2π times the square root

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of the length of the pendulum over the acceleration due to gravity,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
or by squaring both sides and doing some algebraic manipulation,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we find that this is the acceleration due to gravity,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and plugging in 12 for l and 4.5 for t we find an acceleration due to gravity of 23.4 m/s².
