00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
 - 

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.130
 In the previous video we saw that a vector field could 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:12.580
 to record as a scalar field gradient - or, to put it 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.080
 otherwise, it will be equal to the private one 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.060
 derivative of our major f in relation to x on and plus the private derivative of 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.100
 the largest f, the scalar field, with respect to y in j 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.690
 I record it in many ways to remember what our gradient is 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.490
 We have seen that if our vector field is the gradient of 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.780
 scalar field, then we do it 'potentially' 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:47.825
 So, f is a potential vector field 

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.510
 - 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.140
 This also tells us (and this is the most important of them 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.400
 previous clip) that the curvilinear integral of f is between 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.900
 two points - let me draw two points here and make a note 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.210
 the coordinates to know where we are in the xy plane 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.780
 Axes: Axis x and y axis 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.820
 Let's say we have this and this points 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.620
 I have two different paths between them 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.190
 I have a trajectory 2 that looks like it will 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.005
 I call it c1 and she goes in that direction 

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.270
 - 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.380
 And now, I'll take another kind of green, we have 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.010
 a trajectory c2 that looks like this 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.010
 They both start here and come here 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.520
 We learned from the previous video that the curvilinear integral 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.330
 is not dependent on the trajectory between two points 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:57.930
 In this case, the curvilinear integral in c1 by f point dr 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.560
 will be equal to the curvilinear integral of c2 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.870
 on the trajectory c2, from f, etc. If we have 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.500
 potential in any area, anywhere, the curvilinear integral 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.590
 between each two points is independent of the trajectory 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.390
 That's the good of the potential fields 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.190
 Now, what I want to achieve in this video is to add 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.680
 more significant than those of the previous clip 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.710
 And this is a very good addition, which 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.540
 maybe you are obviously anyway 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.550
 I have already recorded it here 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.410
 I can just re-order this equation 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.745
 Let me do that 

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:35.310
 I rearrange it 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.976
 I will write this in orange 

00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:42.730
 Thus, the curvilinear integral of the treceria c1 point etc. minus - 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.670
 I just pull it out on both sides - minus the curvilinear integral c2 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.110
 of f point dr, will be equal to 0 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.610
 Here I just took the equation we achieved in the previous video 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.430
 and I pulled it out on both sides 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.370
 We learned a few videos before that if it is about 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.560
 a curve integral of a vector field, 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.690
 not the scalar field, then the direction 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.090
 of the trajectory is important 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.370
 We have learned that the curvilinear integral on, say, c2 from the f point 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.580
 dr, is equal to minus the curvilinear integral to minus c2 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.830
 from f point dr, where minus c2 is the same trajectory 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.740
 such as c2, but in the opposite direction 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.370
 For example, I can write minus c2 so ... 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.440
 let him take another color. Let's say it's a minus 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.740
 c2. This is a trajectory, just like c2, I call it 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.100
 minus c2, which instead of going in that direction, 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.380
 goes in that direction 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.980
 Let us not pay attention to the old arrows of c2 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.030
 We start here and come back here 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.100
 This is minus c2 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.220
 We can put the minus on the other side 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.250
 and let's say minus the curvilinear integral 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.770
 on the trajectory of u2 of u is equal to 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.510
 the curvilinear integral on the opposite trajectory of f point dr 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.630
 Here I just put the minus on the other side - I multiplied 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.370
 both sides by minus 1 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.900
 Let's replace - we have a minus in this equation 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.480
 the c2 trajectory - we have this and this here 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.880
 So, we could replace 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.800
 with that 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.670
 let's do it 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.670
 I'll start with the first part 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.410
 So, the integral on curve c1 by f point dr, instead 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.200
 minus the curvilinear integral of c2, I will say plus 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200
 a minus c2 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.940
 I'll still get a green color ... We've found, 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.480
 That's the same as that 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.720
 Minus the curvilinear integral on this trajectory 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.950
 is the same as the curvilinear integral 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.350
 the opposite trajectory 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.610
 So we say that plus the curvilinear integral to minus c2 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.270
 of f point dr is equal to 0 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.670
 Here comes something interesting 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.550
 Let's see what the combination of 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.560
 trajectories c1 and minus c2 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.370
 c1 starts here 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.280
 Let him take a nice, bright color 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.580
 c1 begins at this point 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.540
 And it moves from this point to the curve c1 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.020
 and stops here 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.840
 Now do the same with minus c2 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.590
 Minus c2 starts at this point, goes up and returns 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.810
 at the same point - makes a closed line 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.270
 So this is a closed curve integral 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.440
 If we combine this, we can translate 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.660
 Remember this is a closed line 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.365
 As we reverse this, instead of having two curves that begin here 

00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:58.450
 and they're going here, now we're going to start here, we'll go 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.660
 to here and we will go back on this trajectory, 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.630
 opposite to c2 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.880
 This is equivalent to a closed curvilinear integral 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.150
 So it's the same as a closed-loop integral 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.730
 We can call the closed trajectory c1 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.200
 plus minus c2 if we want to be more specific 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.900
 for this closed trajectory 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.390
 Here I just plotted random c1 and c2 (or minus c2) 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.600
 This can be any closed trajectory when the vector field f exists 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.000
 potential, or when it is a scalar field gradient - 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.960
 when it is a potential vector field 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.620
 This can be written as a closed trajectory of c1 plus 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:45.930
 the opposite of c2 from f point etc. Here I copied 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.040
 this means that it will be equal to 0 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.050
 Here's what we learned from this video 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.110
 We can call it 'conclusion' 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.160
 This is a natural conclusion that you can 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.610
 then make a conclusion 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.900
 Now we know that if we have a vector field that is 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.570
 scalar skull gradient in some area, or 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.440
 maybe in the whole xy plane, this is called the potential of f 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.320
 This is a potential feature 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.370
 We will often deal with its opposite value, 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.670
 but working with negative is easy. If we have a vector field, which 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.650
 is a scalar field gradient, we call this field 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.100
 'potentially' 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.880
 And that tells us that for every point in the prospect we are talking about, 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.860
 the curvilinear integral from one point to another 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.150
 is independent of the trajectory - that we learned from 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.130
 previous video 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.890
 And that's why an integral, which is a closed loop, ... 

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.570
 if we take some other place and pick up 

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:52.915
 any other integral that is a closed line, or if we take the curvilinear 

00:07:52.915 --> 00:07:57.490
 an integral of the vector field of any closed line, it will be 0, 

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.740
 because it is not dependent on the trajectory 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.240
 We learn from this video 

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.370
 if you see something like this: 

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.580
 If you have f point dr and make you calculate 

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.840
 provided that f is a potential field (or that f is a potential field) 

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.710
 is a gradient of another function, or that f is 

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.960
 irrespective of the trajectory), you will immediately say that 

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.170
 it will be 0 - and that will greatly facilitate your calculations 

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.466
