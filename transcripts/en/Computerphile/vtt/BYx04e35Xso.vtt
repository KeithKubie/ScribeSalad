00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
&gt;&gt;What's the problem with quantum then?

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.600
OK, I think we probably... Probably we should talk about the opportunity

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.420
I mean what, what's the idea?

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.200
Why would we want to build a quantum computer?

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.780
We discovered... the first observation was

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.060
that it's actually quite difficult to simulate a quantum system.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.720
and this could be illustrated with this famous double slit experiment

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.740
where you send electrons, or photons or whatever

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.440
through two slits, and then you notice

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.500
that you get this interference pattern. So it gets dark and light, dark and light

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.960
which we can understand if we think of electrons or photons as waves

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.080
'cause the waves interfere with each other

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.220
but at the same time we know that they are actually particles because we never have half a photon, we never have half an electron

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.480
so the question is, if each time we send only one electron through these slits

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.160
Which way does it go? Does it go left, or right?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.580
and now you think you're clever, you put some detectors on the slits

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.780
You have to 'trick' nature, find out where it goes and as soon as you do this

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.180
they behave like particles, there's no interference pattern any more.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.380
and that's called a measaurement, so all quantum systems

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.320
er they have this dual behaviour, they behave like waves as long as you don't look at them

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.420
and as soon as you look at them, they behave like particles

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.580
behaviour where this electron goes through,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.620
seems to be going through both holes at the same time

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.000
it's really doing something in parallel

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.480
the one explanation is, er, one understanding is Everett's

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.000
er, multiple worlds interpretation

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.440
that there are parallel universes and in one universe the electron goes through this and the other one through this

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.080
and you don't determine which universe you are

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.620
unless you look at it, and then you are either in this one or in this one

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.080
OK, now,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.140
quantum computing tries to exploit this

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.500
very weird nature of quantum physics

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.920
and using the mathematical models we have from physics

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.140
we can develop new computational paradigm, new...

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.880
programming language so to say, quantum programming

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.160
and in this language we can exploit this quantum parallelism

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.620
to have certain computations run faster

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.940
it's not completely easy because everything you do has to be

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.500
reversible, every computation you do

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.340
you also have to be able to do backwards so everything needs to be symmetric

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.360
&gt;&gt;Is it a Qubit?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.760
Yes, a Qubit is a bit, and it has an amplitude, it can be

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.000
somewhere between zero and one, yes?

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.840
and a Qubit, which is maybe like, in the middle.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.020
is like this electron going through the one slit and the other slit and we don't know which one

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.900
so while the Qubit is not observed

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.520
it's at the same time zero and one, so to say.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:10.260
and all its interaction are based on this "it's two things at the same time," like SchrÃ¶dinger's cat famously (alive and dead)

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.560
so as long as you don't open the box

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.860
the Qubit is in some super-position so to say

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.880
it can be just one but it can be also in a super-position

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.800
and that's the interesting case

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.660
but the rule is, you're not allowed to look at it while you do this

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.400
so it has to be unobserved

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.600
because once you observe it you determine which universe you are

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.200
then this multiple universe idea disappears, this paralellism disappears

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.360
&gt;&gt;The magic is let out of the box?

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.080
The magic yeah, once you look at it the magic is out

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.860
you have to close your eyes

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.860
for as long as you.... then at the end you can look because you want to know what the outcome is

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.700
and then you measure but not inbetween

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.160
There are some, very famous algorithms

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.980
which work on a quantum computer faster

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.900
than on any, known, classical

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.560
there's no known classical solution

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.060
a famous problem

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.560
is the problem of factoring a number

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.180
so for example 15 can be factored at 3 and 5

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.640
and this problem is actually quite important for

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.780
cryptography. The RSA algorithm

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.060
is based on this idea that you have the product of two prime numbers

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.300
but you don't tell anybody what the prime numbers are

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.040
so, it's called a one-way function

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.540
so it's actually surprising, it's easy, computationally to find out whether a number is a prime number

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.440
but it's hard to factor a number

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.980
it's hard (this by the way is not proven)

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.620
nobody knows a way to factor a number efficiently on a classical computer

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.600
but since Shor (The Shor Algorithm)

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.400
we know on a hypothetical quantum computer, that using this quantum paralellism

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.020
there is a clever way to do this

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.980
it uses a certain number theoretic function

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.980
which has a period (repeats itself)

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.180
and using this super-position of Qubits

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.200
you can actually, with a good probability measure,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.980
this period, the repetition, and from this period you can then, find a factor

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.740
that's quite clever, yeah. So

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.060
it seems that quantum computing can...

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.340
can be much much faster than classical computing

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.820
now here's the problem

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.180
we haven't yet been able to build

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.780
a quantum computer of reasonable size, where there's anything interesting happening

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.460
and why is this a problem?

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.260
why is it difficult?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.700
the challenge is to do computations without looking at it

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.320
while you have... Your Qubits are represented by some physical object

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.020
some ions or whatever

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.780
some particles, yeah

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.600
and you want these particles to interact with each other to do the quantum computation

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.620
But, they should not interact with the rest of the universe

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.680
So you basically have to make them interact with each other, without touching them

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.460
and, that could be possible. It may be

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.040
"an engineering problem" as one says

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.620
But we don't know whether

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.720
whether it's actually possible in principle

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:27.000
I think there is a mistake to extrapolate, we know in small systems

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.060
we have this quantum behaviour, and quantum

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.280
er, theory gives us very, very good predictions on how these systems behave

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.400
but we don't know

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.040
whether it actually scales up. Whether

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.140
I mean, there is this problem that you have

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.660
involuntary measurements, or involuntary observations

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.360
it's called decoherence

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.580
so when this system loses its quantum magic and becomes classical

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.840
and what we don't know is

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.060
whether we can actually avoid decoherence in a large quantum system

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.900
because in the end, in physics it's always like this:

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.560
"You should never assume an outcome of an experiment before you have done it"

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.480
so far, nobody has done this experiment which shows that large scale quantum computing is actually possible

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.420
so it may be that there is some hidden law we haven't yet been able to test ya?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.800
which basically says "Once you do too much quantum parallelism, nature...

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.980
...shakes its head and says no that's getting too complicated I'm not doing this,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.660
I'm going to put some decoherence in otherwise it gets too complicated

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.220
it could be, I'm not saying it is like this but we basically don't know

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.680
So I think research in quantum computing in this area

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.640
is very interesting, very exciting, because we have actually an open question

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.520
and either way the answer will be interesting

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.560
The answer is either, OK we can build a quantum computer, we can do all these cool algorithms, great.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.340
Or the answer could be, Actually it's impossible we have discovered a new law of nature

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:12.440
which actually says that nature in the end is classical and this quantum stuff is only on a small scale

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.840
which would be very very exciting as well

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.640
Either way it's exciting, we should find out, but we shouldn't

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.080
assume now that we know the answer without having done the experiment

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.100
&gt;&gt;There's supposed to be some kind of computer that's been built

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.600
Yeah

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.300
&gt;&gt;Is it that we don't know if it is doing what we guess?

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.360
Yes there's this D-Wave and there are other projects, but as far as I know

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.700
we don't know yet whether really get quantum paralellism out of it

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.280
there are all sorts of claims and counter-claims and I don't think it has been decided yet

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.880
&gt;&gt;Is it possible to simulate a quantum computer on a classical computer?

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.260
Yes indeed, er, I've actually developed a library

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.360
doing exactly this, called Quantum IO Monad

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.200
Yes you can do this, the problem is, to simulate this quantum paralellism

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.000
you have to really go through all the possibilities and you have an overhead

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.560
exponential overhead

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.520
so yes you can simulate it, but it's inefficient

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.260
&gt;&gt;So could you do a very simple sum or something like that on this?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.240
Yes we did this algorithm, the Shor algorithm

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.340
to factor a number and to factor 15 and it turns out, the answer is either 3 or 5...

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.180
[laugh]

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.200
&gt;&gt;Is that something we could link to, people could look at or is it err....

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.120
yes, yes

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.060
&gt;&gt;Cool well we'll put that in the description if anybody is interested in it

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.320
it's actually implemented in the programming language Haskell, the functional language

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.440
I hope you can still download the code!
