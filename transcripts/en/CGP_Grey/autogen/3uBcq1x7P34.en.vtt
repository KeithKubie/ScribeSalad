00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.960
 How many continents are there on earth? If you grow up in the English world 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.880
 Maybe you think the answer is obvious: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.839
 But not everyone uses the same method to calculate. 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.249
 The general definition is that "the continent is a large land mass separated by the ocean." 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.930
 It's normal until you really start thinking and discovering problems. 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.970
 Let's say: This kind of problem: 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.790
 This is Europe, this is Asia, you will notice that there is no ocean in the middle. 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.570
 Then why is this a "two" continent? 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.340
 The general reason is culture: European culture is too different from Asia. 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.680
 It is best to treat them as two different entities. 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.830
 Oh... maybe. 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.969
 But if cultural arguments are established, it is clear that India and the Middle East also apply. 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.800
 Here you have nine continents and a new question: If you define the "continent" with cultural differences, 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.589
 You have to endlessly add useless borders. 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.460
 So some places abandon cultural differences and combine "Eurasia." 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.890
 This Eurasian cannot be confused with the "Eurasia" that is fighting the East Asian countries (see "1984") 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.920
 Combine the European and Asian worlds into six continents. 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.449
 Combine the European and Asian worlds into six continents. 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.069
 That side: North America and South America? 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.909
 They are connected in Panama - at least in the decision of the President of Old Roosevelt 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.479
 Someone has to cut this country in half and this person has to be him. 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.390
 But the Panama Canal is only 13 meters deep. 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.240
 You can walk through the Panama Canal from the north of Alaska. 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.830
 Then, if not because of the Amazon rainforest that is full of poisonous snakes and beasts 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.610
 Finally you can walk the southern tip of Chile. So although there are canals, 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.830
 North and South America is not really separate. This is why some places, especially South America, 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.780
 Think of the Americas as a single continent. 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.810
 So the total number of continents fell to five. 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.140
 But if you don’t care about the Panama Canal, you have to ignore the Suez Canal. 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.170
 Create a huge "Eurasia and non-continental": 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.210
 It has an area of ​​85 million square kilometers and a population of 5.7 billion. 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.620
 This four-land view should be completed because 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.250
 It is true that there is no continent that can be combined and it is also in line with the current definition. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.270
 Unless we are not finished yet, because of the question about "big". How big is it to be a continent? 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.360
 How big is it to be a continent? 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.240
 Is Australia a small continent or the king of the island? 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.170
 Why is Greenland not the smallest continent? It is quite big, even if it takes off its ice. 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.680
 Speaking of ice, Antarctica? This forgotten continent is unfairly squeezed under the map. 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.430
 Just because no one lives there. 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.900
 Take off the Antarctic ice and you will see a bunch of islands 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.970
 Not a continent that was originally thought. 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.220
 And in order to increase trouble, the largest land here is smaller than Australia. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.370
 So if you want to call the Antarctic "continental", there is still a pile of islands behind 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370
 Waiting to upgrade to the mainland 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.130
 For example, New Guinea, Borneo, Madagascar, Baffin Island, Sumatra and Honshu Island. 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.800
 When this matter seems to be approaching the peak of brain damage, after all, someone wants 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.860
 Define the extent of "big" and draw a boundary for no reason. 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.440
 This question is familiar to those who remember the topic of "Pluto is a planet." 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.130
 This controversial fiasco (mostly) also involves size issues. 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.580
 So our question is bigger than the beginning: There may be three or dozens of continents. 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.650
 Do you know who can tell: 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.910
 science! 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.080
 Question + Science = Answer 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.970
 Let us ask the geologist what the continent is. 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.360
 For them, the continent refers to the plate: the part of the crust that moves together 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.750
 So geologist, let us look at your continent: 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.330
 Antarctic plate, Australian plate, Eurasian plate, South American plate, 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.880
 African plate. It looks pretty good right now. 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.080
 Medium...east plate, indian plate, caribbean plate, 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.430
 Pacific plate!? Hey, there is nothing there. 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.640
 "Almost" no. Nazca Plate? Scotia Plate? Are you playing really? 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.190
 At least the North American plate looks decent, 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.069
 Until it contains a part of Russia, half of Japan and Iceland. 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.670
 This didn't help much, thank you very much to the geologist. 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.740
 The core of the problem is that the word "continental" does not have a simple and consistent usage. 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.190
 So how many continents do you have? So, 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.190
 How many continents do you want? 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.260
 Sixth, the answer is six.
