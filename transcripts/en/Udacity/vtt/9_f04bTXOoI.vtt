00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So you've got a pretty
sweet looking control,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.540
but what about users who
can't see the shiny hotness?

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.820
Accessibility is a key 
consideration when building apps

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.050
and particularly when 
you're creating new views.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.600
You can start by adding
a content description,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.560
as you would for every
other view in your layout,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.870
to ensure that they are all accessible.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.596
But what about views
like our wind speed

00:00:18.596 --> 00:00:21.707
and direction gauge
where the content isn't static?

00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:23.250
Knowing you're looking 
at a wind gauge

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.816
isn't very useful
if you don't know

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:27.432
what the speed and direction
it's displaying are.

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:29.710
Well, there are couple of options here.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.220
For generic views which
don't control their own values,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.270
this simplest alternative 
is to set the content description

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.205
within your app at runtime.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:41.240
An even more robust solution
is to send an accessibility event

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.910
from within your view.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.370
Whenever the visual content 
has been modified.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.440
Then override the dispatch
populate accessibility event,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.716
and then the current control's 
visual value, the accessibility event.

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:55.592
Go ahead and add 
accessibility handlers to your view,

00:00:55.592 --> 00:00:57.170
and then click here when you're done.
