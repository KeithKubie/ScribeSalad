00:00:00.316 --> 00:00:01.149
- [Narrator] What we're going to do

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:04.577
in this video is talk about
presidential signing statements.

00:00:04.577 --> 00:00:07.436
And these are statements
that presidents issue

00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:09.914
when they are signing a bill into law.

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:11.030
They don't always do this.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.614
In fact, it was quite infrequent

00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:13.981
for a very long time.

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:17.113
The first signing statement
was issued by James Monroe.

00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:19.195
But it was quite infrequent until we get

00:00:19.195 --> 00:00:20.530
to the modern times.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.709
And starting with Ronald
Reagan, they become much,

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:26.672
much more common for
presidents of both parties.

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:28.850
And even though it is not considered

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.670
by legal scholars to be legally binding.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.670
So, not legally binding,
presidents still do it.

00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:39.230
And they have multiple reasons.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.465
Sometimes, it acts as
a bit of an explainer

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:44.456
for why they are signing the law.

00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:45.654
They might say how great the law

00:00:45.654 --> 00:00:48.452
is, why they think it's a good idea.

00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:51.919
But sometimes, they also
say what problems there

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:53.104
are in the law.

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:55.165
And in an extreme case,
they can sometimes say

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:59.193
that there are parts of the
law that are unconstitutional.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:01.731
And those parts that are unconstitutional,

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:04.259
the Executive Branch
might not follow exactly

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.705
the way the law states.

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:09.472
Well an obvious question is,
if it's not legally binding,

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:11.776
why does the President
even take the trouble?

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:13.485
Well, the explainer purpose might

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:17.278
be political, or it
might rally up the base.

00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:19.671
But issuing a statement on the problems,

00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:21.642
it's the President's way of signaling

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:24.035
to the entire Executive
Branch and to Congress

00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:27.349
that hey, look, don't be
surprised when I don't follow

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:28.863
the letter of the law of the parts

00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:32.066
that I think are unconstitutional.

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.493
And to make this tangible, let's look

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.632
at some actual signing statements.

00:01:36.632 --> 00:01:37.551
This is a signing statement

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.215
by President George W. Bush in 2006.

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:44.444
Today, I have signed into law H.R. 972,

00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:48.871
the Trafficking Victims
Reauthorization Act of 2005.

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:51.553
This act enhances our
ability to combat trafficking

00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:54.320
in persons by extending
and improving prosecutorial

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.494
and diplomatic tools, and also

00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:58.510
adds new protections for victims.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.200
So that part's kind of an explainer.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.200
But then it goes on to
say, Section 104 purports

00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:08.476
to require the Secretary of State,

00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:12.053
prior to voting for a new
or reauthorized peacekeeping

00:02:12.053 --> 00:02:15.898
mission under the auspices of
a multilateral organization

00:02:15.898 --> 00:02:19.565
to submit to the Congress
a specific report.

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:23.383
The Executive Branch shall construe

00:02:23.383 --> 00:02:26.813
this reporting requirement
in a manner consistent

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.274
with the President's
Constitutional authority

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:32.792
as Commander in Chief and the
President's constitutional

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:37.255
authority to conduct the
Nation's foreign affairs.

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:38.621
And so what they're saying is, hey,

00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:40.297
hold on a second here, Congress.

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:42.269
You want our Secretary
of State, before making

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.364
this decision, to submit
a report every time?

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:47.967
You're kind of starting to muck with how

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:50.270
the Executive Branch executes there.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.509
So this is signaling a bit to the Congress

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.936
as, hey, don't be surprised
if we don't follow this

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:59.579
exactly the way that you are expecting.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.808
You have a similar tone
in an executive order

00:03:01.808 --> 00:03:04.225
from President Obama in 2009.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.087
Today, I have signed into law H.R. 1105,

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:11.871
the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009.

00:03:11.871 --> 00:03:14.382
This bill completes the work of last year

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:16.325
by providing the funding necessary

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:19.150
for the smooth operation
of our Nation's Government.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.930
So once again, a bit of an explainer.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.834
But then it goes on to say,
the Department of Justice

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:26.137
has advised that a small number

00:03:26.137 --> 00:03:31.124
of provisions of the bill
raise constitutional concerns.

00:03:31.124 --> 00:03:33.852
And then it goes on to list
actually several bullet points,

00:03:33.852 --> 00:03:34.865
and I'm just going to give you one

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:38.646
of them, just so you
get a sense of things.

00:03:38.646 --> 00:03:41.245
Legislative aggrandizements,

00:03:41.245 --> 00:03:43.644
committee approval requirements.

00:03:43.644 --> 00:03:45.531
So, when you aggrandize yourself,

00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:48.088
it's making yourself
more than you really are.

00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:50.138
And so a legislative aggrandizement

00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:52.748
is the legislative branch trying

00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:55.681
to go beyond their legislative powers.

00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:58.258
Numerous provisions of the legislation

00:03:58.258 --> 00:04:00.343
purport to condition the authority

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:03.847
of officers to spend or reallocate funds

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:07.361
on the approval of
congressional committees.

00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:09.693
These are impermissible forms

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:13.572
of legislative aggrandizement
in the execution

00:04:13.572 --> 00:04:17.518
of the laws other than
by enactment of statutes.

00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:19.779
Therefore, although my administration

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.541
will notify the relevant
committees before taking

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.797
the specified actions and will accord

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.510
the recommendations of such committees

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.665
all appropriate and serious consideration,

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:32.826
spending decisions shall not be treated

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:37.090
as dependent on the approval
of congressional committees.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.235
So, here in this signing statement,

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:41.307
President Obama's saying, look,

00:04:41.307 --> 00:04:44.692
this is overstepping the
bounds of legislative authority

00:04:44.692 --> 00:04:47.754
to tell us how we will spend these things.

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:50.337
We'll take your advice
under consideration,

00:04:50.337 --> 00:04:52.479
but dictating how to execute

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.800
is not the job of the Legislative Branch.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.850
So I'll leave you there.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:57.683
I encourage you to look up

00:04:57.683 --> 00:04:59.254
more presidential signing statements.

00:04:59.254 --> 00:05:01.452
They're readily available on the internet.

00:05:01.452 --> 00:05:03.556
They're part of the Federal Registry.

00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:05.852
And think about why presidents do this.

00:05:05.852 --> 00:05:07.973
And, what role does this have?

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:09.243
And why this is considered

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:12.160
an informal power of the President.
