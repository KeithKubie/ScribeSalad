00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:06.726
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: A skateboarder in
a skate park is actively analyzing,

00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.306
synthesizing and evaluating
their environment.

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:11.406
You're working with simple machines

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:13.646
and a compound machine,
like a skateboard.

00:00:14.126 --> 00:00:17.226
You're looking at angles and
the geometry of a skate park,

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:20.126
making small adjustments
built on trial and error.

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:22.106
I think that's something
that scientists

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:24.706
and skateboarders have in common.

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:26.626
They look at the word
a little differently,

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.766
and through a lens
of their discipline.

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:34.366
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: Okay, so
the idea here is, you know,

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.656
you're going to be riding in the
bowl, and you're going to be kind

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:39.476
of working between sort of unbalanced
forces and balanced forces.

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:43.006
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: My name is Bill
Robertson, I'm an Associate Professor

00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:44.856
at the University of
Texas at El Paso.

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:47.046
I have a background
in History, Biology,

00:00:47.306 --> 00:00:50.536
Spanish and in the Specialization
and Science Education.

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:58.976
&gt;&gt;Yeah, All right!

00:00:59.056 --> 00:00:59.626
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: I've
been a skateboarder

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.046
since I was 13-years-old.

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:02.966
It's part of who I am.

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.386
It's how I see the world.

00:01:04.386 --> 00:01:05.406
It's my passion.

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:07.096
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: You were
cruising around pretty fast,

00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:09.326
and then you went up
the, in the invert.

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:10.846
So like how do you think you moved

00:01:10.846 --> 00:01:12.776
from like balanced forces
to unbalanced forces?

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:14.216
How did you stall it like that?

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:15.206
&gt;&gt;Student: It's all about motion.

00:01:15.386 --> 00:01:18.076
You go with the flow, like...

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:19.466
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: One of
my skateboarding buddies,

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.646
when I told him I was getting my PhD
and I was going to become a doctor,

00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:26.796
he said, "Dude, I don't
know anybody with a PhD."

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:30.516
And that's when I started thinking
about Dr. Skateboard, you know,

00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:33.906
putting what I learned
and skateboarding together

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:35.646
with my goals in education.

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:43.096
So what kinds of kids do you
encounter at a skate park?

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:46.516
Well, they're typically people
who really enjoy the sport.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.886
They're inherently creative.

00:01:49.586 --> 00:01:50.916
They're daring.

00:01:51.336 --> 00:01:55.336
And for the most part,
they are dissatisfied

00:01:55.696 --> 00:01:56.846
with their learning in school.

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:01.046
Where does learning really occur?

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:03.446
Learning takes place
when people go to areas

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:05.646
of high risk and high ambiguity.

00:02:05.986 --> 00:02:08.306
And so if you think about
your own learning, you know,

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:10.206
if you go do something
that you've memorized,

00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:11.836
or something that's not
really that challenging,

00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:13.006
you're not really learning
a whole lot.

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:14.776
But when you learn something,

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:17.796
there's usually something
you're laying on the line.

00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:22.236
For young people, the risk sometimes
is, "Am I going to be embarrassed

00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:23.446
in front of my classmates?"

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:27.816
You're really going to do tricks
that are risky, and in some ways,

00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:29.406
they take you to places
you've never been.

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:33.226
The ambiguity part is
something that it's unknown.

00:02:33.496 --> 00:02:34.546
"What's going to happen here?"

00:02:34.756 --> 00:02:36.616
And that's where learning occurs.

00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:46.556
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: Sweet, man!

00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:49.816
So, the one trick that caught my eye
in there, there was a bunch of them,

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:52.886
you know, but one was doing
the blunt, like where you go up

00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:55.436
and you kind of balance on the
tail, and then you pop it back in.

00:02:55.656 --> 00:02:56.966
But how do you make that trick?

00:02:57.246 --> 00:02:59.956
&gt;&gt;Student: You got to compress
your knees to drive that force back

00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:03.776
to slow yourself down so you
have enough speed just to get--

00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:05.416
just enough just to get up and stall.

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:08.086
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: Skateboarders
really do see the world differently.

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:10.746
They're always looking at their
world as something to skate.

00:03:10.806 --> 00:03:14.226
And so it's a matter of seeing
not only the physics behind it,

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:17.236
but analyzing, synthesizing,
evaluating and creativity.

00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:19.076
The upper part of Bloom's Taxonomy.

00:03:21.126 --> 00:03:22.706
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: Big front-side air.

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:28.616
So Diego? Let me ask you, so
what do you need to do to make

00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:29.926
that front-side air, you think?

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:31.946
&gt;&gt;Diego: I made a false start.

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:35.316
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: They are looking
at their environment in ways

00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:39.876
that they're dealing with speed,
momentum, velocity, acceleration.

00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:41.576
They're talking about motion.

00:03:41.906 --> 00:03:44.306
&gt;&gt;Student: It's motion
inertia, then just inertia

00:03:44.306 --> 00:03:47.646
where you're just sitting
and with motion inertia,

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:50.166
it's like cranking a little toy.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:52.536
You do it the faster you
can, the more speed you get.

00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:53.876
The slower you do it, that's

00:03:53.946 --> 00:03:55.176
like you're not going
to get that much speed.

00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:56.636
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: So you
kind of create speed

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.106
and force just out
of gravity, really.

00:03:58.106 --> 00:03:59.386
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, that's
all it is, man.

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:02.396
That and good times,
that and good times, man.

00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:03.396
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: That's for sure.

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:04.386
&gt;&gt;Student: All right, cool!

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:06.676
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: They're,
in many ways,

00:04:06.676 --> 00:04:08.606
embodying these principles of flight.

00:04:08.606 --> 00:04:11.616
You know, lift, gravity,
thrust and drag being used.

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:13.726
But they're not thinking
about it in those terms.

00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:15.986
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: The park is
sort of like your laboratory.

00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:17.046
You're using all this science.

00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:18.606
'Cause you make some
subtle adjustments

00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:20.046
to make sure tricks happen, you know?

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:22.246
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, like
it's just one little thing

00:04:22.246 --> 00:04:23.586
that will make the trick different.

00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:26.276
You put your foot a little bit to the
left, you're not going to land it.

00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:28.206
One inch to the right,
you'll land it perfectly.

00:04:28.946 --> 00:04:30.666
It's more like how precise it is.

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:33.756
You have to be really kind of
precise with skateboarding.

00:04:34.626 --> 00:04:36.536
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: So one of the
things we talk about with that is

00:04:36.536 --> 00:04:38.836
like it's very kinetic,
but at the mid-point,

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:41.306
it kind of pauses,
and so it has that...

00:04:41.306 --> 00:04:44.456
&gt;&gt;Student: It's like potential, and
then as I make the movement, kinetic,

00:04:44.456 --> 00:04:47.796
and then potential at that one
split second that I stop the board

00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:51.576
in mid-air, and then becomes kinetic
again, whenever I flick it back.

00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:52.856
&gt;&gt;Dr Skateboard: I think
by knowing the term,

00:04:52.986 --> 00:04:54.746
and by know what they're
trying to do,

00:04:54.746 --> 00:04:57.256
they can actually help
themselves learn more,

00:04:57.486 --> 00:05:00.456
because they can find a practical
application in their own lives.

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:11.266
You really are in some ways living
out sort of a scientific method.

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:13.576
You're thinking of a hypothesis.

00:05:13.576 --> 00:05:14.836
Some trick you want to learn.

00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:18.076
You're looking at your environment,
seeing, "Where can I best do this?"

00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:20.326
So you're analyzing
what you're going to do.

00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:21.766
You're going to go
through some trials.

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:22.926
You're going to collect some data.

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:24.976
And then you're going to
kind of have an outcome.

00:05:24.976 --> 00:05:26.396
Did I figure it out?

00:05:26.496 --> 00:05:27.336
Did I not do it?

00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:28.926
What do I need to do to change?

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:34.826
Skate parks become their classroom,

00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:37.746
and it become their
field-based environment,

00:05:37.746 --> 00:05:41.516
where they can achieve
success in learning.

00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:44.156
My mission has always been
that people will see something

00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:46.976
in skateboarding, and understand
that there's a certain amount

00:05:46.976 --> 00:05:48.636
of mastery that goes on in here.

00:05:48.736 --> 00:05:51.496
And mastery, to me, is one of the
most important characteristics

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:52.996
in having success in anything.

00:05:52.996 --> 00:05:55.026
You know, if you can
master something,

00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:57.976
you can probably master
something else.

00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:02.656
I'm trying to reach out
to the kid who's maybe not

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:03.856
that interested in school.

00:06:03.856 --> 00:06:05.646
Who's maybe a bit marginalized.

00:06:05.986 --> 00:06:08.756
And we're trying to find pathways
for those people to learning.

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:13.106
Skateboarding is something that
I think we always look at sort

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.686
of a youth fad that you pass through.

00:06:15.686 --> 00:06:19.026
But one thing I found out is, you
know, skateboarding is here to stay.

00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:23.356
And I think if we can tap
into what kids like to do,

00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:25.806
and help them to make
connections to their learning.

00:06:25.836 --> 00:06:29.356
And that we can carefully guide
them, and caringly guide them

00:06:29.716 --> 00:06:33.006
through this process, they
can really achieve success.
