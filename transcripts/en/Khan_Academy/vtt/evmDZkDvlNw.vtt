00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:00.885
- [Voiceover] So right over here, we have

00:00:00.885 --> 00:00:03.160
one rational expression being subtracted

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.810
from another rational expression.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.364
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:06.364 --> 00:00:08.384
and see what this would result in.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:10.649
So actually do the subtraction.

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:12.041
Alright, let's do this together.

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.547
And if we're subtracting
two rational expressions,

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:18.588
we'd like to have them
have the same denominator.

00:00:18.588 --> 00:00:20.864
And they clearly don't
have the same denominator

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:23.011
and so we need to find
a common denominator.

00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:24.544
And a common denominator is one that

00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:27.504
is going to be divisible
by either of these

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:30.423
and then we can multiply them by

00:00:30.423 --> 00:00:32.478
an appropriate expression or number

00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:34.759
so that it becomes the common denominator.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:35.978
So the easiest common denominator

00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:38.787
I can think of especially
because these factors,

00:00:38.787 --> 00:00:40.784
these two expressions have no factors

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:43.059
in common, would just be their product.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.683
So this is going to be equal to,

00:00:45.683 --> 00:00:48.121
so we could just multiply these two.

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.780
So this is going to be, so let me do,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.877
let me do this one right
over here, in magenta.

00:00:54.877 --> 00:00:56.608
So this is going to be equal to

00:00:56.608 --> 00:00:57.698
the common denominator.

00:00:57.698 --> 00:00:59.637
If I say, if I want to just multiply

00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:01.146
those two denominators.

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:04.896
For this one, I'll have my 8x plus seven

00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:08.379
and now I'm going to
multiply by 3x plus one.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:10.630
Multiplying it by the other denominator

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.288
and I had negative 5x in the numerator

00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:14.867
but if I'm going to
multiply the denominator

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:16.411
by 3x plus one and I don't want to change

00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:18.269
the value of the expression, we'll have

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:21.496
to multiply the numerator
by 3x plus one, as well.

00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:24.166
Notice, 3x plus one divided
by 3x plus one is just one

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.430
and you'll be left with
what we started with.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.190
And from that, we are going
to subtract all of this.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.025
Now there's a couple of ways you

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.267
can think of this subtraction.

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:35.995
I could just write a
minus sign right over here

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:40.396
and do the same thing that I
just did for the first term.

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:41.591
Or another way to think about it

00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:43.065
and actually for this particular case,

00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:45.387
I like thinking about it better this way,

00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:48.035
is to just add the negative of this.

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:50.332
So if I just multiply negative
one times this expression,

00:01:50.332 --> 00:01:53.653
I'd get negative 6x
third over 3x plus one.

00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:55.532
If I had more terms up
here, in the numerator,

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.368
I would have to be careful to distribute

00:01:57.368 --> 00:02:00.154
that negative sign, but
here, I only have one term.

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:02.313
So I just made a negative and so I can say

00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:07.026
this is going to be plus
and, let me do this,

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:11.090
in a new color, do this in green.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.411
Our common denominator,
we already established,

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.942
is the product of our two denominators

00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:20.942
so it is going to be 8x plus
seven times 3x plus one.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.541
Now if we multiply the denominator here

00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:29.826
was 3x plus one, we're
multiplying it by 8x plus seven.

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:30.744
So that mean's we have to multiply

00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:33.089
the numerator by 8x plus seven as well.

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:38.089
8x plus seven times negative
6x to the third power.

00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:42.329
Notice, 8x plus seven divided
by 8x plus seven is one.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.372
If you were to do that, you would get back

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:47.333
to your original
expression right over here,

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:50.212
the negative 6x to the
third over 3x plus one.

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:51.744
And now, we're ready to add.

00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:53.648
This is all going to be equal to,

00:02:53.648 --> 00:02:56.749
I'll write the denominator in white.

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.721
So we have our common denominator,

00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:03.701
8x plus seven times 3x plus one.

00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:05.849
Now, in the magenta, I would want

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.902
to distribute the negative 5x,

00:03:08.902 --> 00:03:13.902
so negative 5x times positive
3x is negative 15x squared.

00:03:16.603 --> 00:03:21.583
And then, negative 5x
times one is minus 5x.

00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:24.486
And then, in the green, I would have,

00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:26.645
let's see, I'll distribute the negative 6x

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:29.304
to the third power, so
negative 6x to the third

00:03:29.304 --> 00:03:32.206
times positive 8x is going to be,

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:37.206
negative 48x to the fourth power.

00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:38.881
And then negative 6x to the third

00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:43.282
times positive seven is
going to be negative 42,

00:03:43.282 --> 00:03:47.402
negative 42x to the third.

00:03:47.402 --> 00:03:50.908
And I think I'm done
because there's no more,

00:03:50.908 --> 00:03:53.404
there's, you know, I only
have one fourth-degree term,

00:03:53.404 --> 00:03:55.807
one third-degree term,
one second-degree term,

00:03:55.807 --> 00:03:57.538
one first-degree term, and that's it.

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:59.441
There's no more simplification here.

00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:02.940
Some of you might want to just write it

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.536
in descending degree order,
so you could write it

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:10.536
as negative 48x to the fourth minus 42x

00:04:11.422 --> 00:04:16.422
to the third minus 15x squared minus 5x.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.120
All of that over 8x plus
seven times 3x plus one.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.624
But either way, we are all done.

00:04:29.624 --> 00:04:31.493
I mean, it looks like up here, yeah,

00:04:31.493 --> 00:04:33.513
there's no, nothing to factor out.

00:04:33.513 --> 00:04:34.965
These two are divisible by five.

00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:37.972
These are divisible by six but even

00:04:37.972 --> 00:04:40.107
if I were to factor that
out, nothing over here,

00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:42.824
down here, no five or six to factor out.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.645
Yeah, so it looks like we are all done.
