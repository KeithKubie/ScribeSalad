00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.495
I remember when I first
saw the Radcliffe Gym.

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:05.530
It was on a really hot day.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.870
In the summer before I
arrived as Radcliffe dean,

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.560
I'd been appointed
but I had not yet

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.350
moved to Cambridge
to take up the job.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.350
And I was being given a tour
of the Radcliffe facilities.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.300
And we climbed the stairs to
the old Radcliffe Gymnasium.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.050
And it must have
been 105 degrees.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.660
There's no air conditioning.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.760
And it was the summer,
so it wasn't being used.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.700
But there were stadium seating--

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.300
kind of temporary stadium
seating jammed into the room.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.760
And I was told it was
being used for dance.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.330
And it was so gorgeous-- the
bones beneath the stadium

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.850
seating and the
kind of disrepair

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.530
into which it had fallen.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.190
The bones of the place
were just so glorious.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.630
A huge space with
a balcony around it

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.130
that was meant to be a track
for the Radcliffe students

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.370
of the early 20th century.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.050
And, as I understood it--
came to understand it--

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.030
the Radcliffe alums not only
used that balcony as a track,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.300
they had to learn how
to lower themselves

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.800
on a rope from the balcony
onto the floor of the gymnasium

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.920
because it was believed
that it would be important

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.250
for women to know how to use
a rope to get out of a burning

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.470
building or some
other such challenge

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.240
that they might be faced with.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.790
And I've talked to
numbers of Radcliffe alums

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.340
from a generation
before mine who

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.860
describe the terror
with which they

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.620
approached this requirement.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.510
I vowed that I was going to try
to make that space new again

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.090
and to make it beautiful again.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.250
And so it was renovated in the
first decade of this century.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.790
And it now is the heart
of the Fellowship Program,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.210
but also a space that is
used for public programs

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.180
and gatherings by the
Radcliffe Institute

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.440
and many other units
across Harvard.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.300
It's a beautiful
space, and I think

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.460
has been restored to some of
the glories of its early design.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.590
But you can see on the
wall some of the pictures

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.860
of young women undertaking
the kind of exercise that was

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.270
deemed appropriate for them.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.120
I don't think I've ever
seen someone being--

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.920
or lowering herself on a rope.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.800
I'm not sure there's any
photographic record of that.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.780
But the space is
a wonderful one.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.910
And I always feel
kind of heartened

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.070
when I go there
and think about how

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.780
the space is serving the
needs that are taking of the--

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.770
activities taking
place within it.
