00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.100
So now that you know what you're
expecting to change through

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.760
your hypothesis and what you're going to
do, you need to run an experiment.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.560
You can do this using an A/B test.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.280
This will help you compare two different
versions of your webpage or app and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.129
learn which one performs better.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.500
You can use a Control group and
an experimental group.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.100
Having a control group can show you
how effective your campaign is.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.090
Now, the control group consists
of randomly selected users

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.630
who are representative of
the population you're targeting,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.300
and who do not receive the change to
whatever campaign you're running.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.140
So being representative of
the population means that if 50% of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.830
your app users are male and
50% are female,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.850
you need to have the same demographic in
your randomly selected Control group.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.190
Now everything except the one change
you're targeting should stay the same.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.090
For example, if you want to test
the effect of moving your sign-up button

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.813
to the top of the screen, all messaging,

00:00:55.813 --> 00:01:00.170
colours, looks and feel of the site
should stay the same, except for

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.080
moving the sign out button
to the top of the screen and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.730
only the people in the experimental
group will see these changes.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.340
So the people in the experimental
group will see the sign up button at

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.090
the top of the page and
the people in the Control group

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.670
won’t see a change in the location
of the sign up button.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.380
This way you can see how the people in
the two different groups perform and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.230
which button placement would
result in more sign-ups.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.950
Now your Control group
doesn’t need to be huge.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.830
The key is that it is representative
of the target population.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.080
If you have a really, really large
population like thousands and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.840
thousands of people,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.568
you might only need about 5% of that
population to be in your Control group.

00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:40.560
However, if it's a smaller population,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.020
you may need closer to 20 %
to be in your Control group.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.890
To determine the best sample size for
your experiment,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.750
there are a ton of free online sample
files calculators you can check out.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.080
Now to run A/B test, there are a ton
of different tools that you can use.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.730
For example, Optimize Me allows you
to make changes on your website and

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.920
will run and
host the experiment for you.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.880
So, let's hear from
an expert about A/B testing.
