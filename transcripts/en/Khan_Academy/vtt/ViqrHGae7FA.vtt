00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.610
In the last video, we attempted
to approximate the area

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.520
under a curve by constructing
four rectangles of equal width

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.320
and using the left boundary of
each rectangle, the function

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.380
evaluated at the left boundary,
to determine the height,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.239
and we came up with
an approximation.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.720
What I want to do in this video
is generalize things a bit

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.428
using the exact same
method, but doing it

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:22.600
for an arbitrary function
with arbitrary boundaries

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.550
and an arbitrary
number of rectangles.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.940
So let's do it.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.140
So I'm going to draw the
diagram as large as I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.540
can to make things
as clear as possible.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.480
So that's my y-axis.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.410
And this right over
here is my x-axis.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.500
Let me draw an
arbitrary function.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.600
So let's say my function
looks something like that.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.510
So that is y is equal to f of x.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.460
And let me define my boundaries.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.230
So let's say this right
over here is x equals a.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.490
And this right over
here is x equals b.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.230
So this is b.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.829
And I'm going to
use n rectangles,

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.620
and I'm going to use
the function evaluated

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.410
at the left boundary
of the rectangle

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.740
to determine its height.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.030
So, for example, this
will be rectangle one.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.100
I'm going to evaluate
what f of a is.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.950
So this right over
here is f of a.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.880
And then I'm going to
use that as the height

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.400
of my first rectangle.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.230
So just like that.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.001
So rectangle number
one looks like this.

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.000
And I'll even number it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.862
Rectangle one looks
just like that.

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:49.320
And just to have
a convention here,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.380
because I'm going to want to
label each of the x values

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.740
at the left boundary, so
we'll say a is equal to x0.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.890
a is equal to x0.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.760
So we could also call this
point right over here x0,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.699
that x value.

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:07.240
And then we go to
the next rectangle.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.880
And we could call this one
right over here, this x value,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.780
we'll call it x1.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.060
It's the left boundary
of the next rectangle.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.870
If we evaluate f of x1, we get
this value right over here.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.312
This right over here is f of
x1, so it tells us our height.

00:02:22.312 --> 00:02:24.270
And we want an equal
width to the previous one.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.870
We'll think about what the width
is going to be in a second.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.930
So this right over here
is our second rectangle

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.910
that we're going to use
to approximate the area

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.576
under the curve.

00:02:35.576 --> 00:02:37.320
That's rectangle number two.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.070
Let's do rectangle number three.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.720
Well, rectangle number
three, the left boundary,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.980
we're just going to
call that x sub 2.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.435
And its height is going
to be f of x sub 2.

00:02:50.557 --> 00:02:53.140
And its width is going to be the
same width as the other ones.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.100
I'm just eyeballing
it right over here.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.050
So this is rectangle
number three.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.130
And we're going to continue
this process all the way

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.890
until we get to
rectangle number n.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.080
So this is the n-th
rectangle right

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.740
over here, the n-th rectangle.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.820
And what am I going to label
this point right over here?

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.180
Well, we already see a pattern.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.840
The left boundary of the
first rectangle is x sub 0.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.010
The left boundary of the
second rectangle is x sub 1.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.270
The left boundary of the
third rectangle is x sub 2.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.650
So the left boundary
of the n-th rectangle

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.110
is going to be x sub n minus 1.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.340
Whatever the
rectangle number is,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.770
the left boundary is x
sub that number minus 1.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.952
And this is just based on the
convention that we've defined.

00:03:45.952 --> 00:03:47.910
Now, the next thing that
we need to do in order

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.160
to actually calculate
this area is think about

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.590
what is the width?

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.960
So let's call the width of
any of these rectangles--

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.915
and for these purposes, or
the purpose of this example,

00:03:57.915 --> 00:03:59.540
I'm going to assume
that it's constant,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.140
although you can do these
sums where you actually

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.880
vary the width of the rectangle.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.600
But then it gets a
little bit fancier.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.290
So I want it equal width.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.645
So I want delta x
to be equal width.

00:04:08.645 --> 00:04:10.270
And to think about
what that has to be,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.390
we just have to think, what's
the total width that we're

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.890
covering?

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.244
Well, the total distance here
is going to be b minus a,

00:04:17.244 --> 00:04:19.660
and we're just going to divide
by the number of rectangles

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.743
that we want, the number
of sections that we want.

00:04:21.743 --> 00:04:23.660
So we want to divide by n.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.560
So if we assume this
is true, and then we

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.250
assume that a is
equal to x0, and then

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:40.610
x1 is equal to x0 plus delta x,
x2 is equal to x1 plus delta x,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:49.280
and we go all the way to xn is
equal to xn minus 1 plus delta

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.330
x, then we've essentially set
up this diagram right over here.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.630
b is actually going
to be equal xn.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.400
So this is xn.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.180
It's equal to xn
minus 1 plus delta x.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.540
So now I think we've set up
all of the notation and all

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.890
the conventions in order
to actually calculate

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.700
the area, or our
approximation of the area.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.030
So our approximation,
approximate area,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.737
is going to be equal to what?

00:05:17.737 --> 00:05:20.070
Well, it's going to be the
area of the first rectangle--

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.153
so let me write this down.

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:24.410
So it's going to be rectangle
one-- so the area of rectangle

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:33.330
one-- so rectangle one plus
the area of rectangle two

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.750
plus the area of rectangle
three-- I think you get

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:46.140
the point here-- plus all the
way to the area of rectangle n.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.700
And so what are
these going to be?

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.400
Rectangle one is going to be
its height, which is f of x0

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.080
or f of a.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.270
Either way. x0 and a
are the same thing.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.680
So it's f of a
times our delta x,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.690
times our width, our
height times our width.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.330
So times delta-- actually
I can write as f of x0,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.750
I wanted to write-- f
of x0 times delta x.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.460
What is our height
of rectangle two?

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.555
It's f of x1 times delta x.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.930
What's our area of
rectangle three?

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.020
It's f of x2 times delta x.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.120
And then we go all
the way to our area.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.370
We're taking all the sums,
all the way to rectangle n.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.470
What's its area?

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.685
It's f of x sub n minus 1.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.860
Actually, that's a
different shade of orange.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.360
I'll use that same shade.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.276
It is f of x sub n
minus 1 times delta x.

00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:43.900
And we're done.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.050
We've written it in
a very general way.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.852
But to really make
us comfortable

00:06:47.852 --> 00:06:49.310
with the various
forms of notation,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.660
especially the types
of notation you

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.920
might see when people are
talking about approximating

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.250
the areas or sums
in general, I'm

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.400
going to use the
traditional sigma notation.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.680
So another way we could
write this, as the sum,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.854
this is equal to the
sum from-- and remember,

00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:09.020
this is just based on the
conventions that I set up.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.222
I'll let i count which rectangle
we're in, from i equals 1 to n.

00:07:14.222 --> 00:07:16.180
And then we're going to
look at each rectangle.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.740
So the first rectangle,
that's rectangle one.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.050
So it's going to be f of-- well,
if we're in the i-th rectangle,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.440
then the left boundary
is going to be

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:34.030
x sub i minus 1 times delta x.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.990
And so here, right over
here, is a general way

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:43.580
of thinking about approximating
the area under a curve using

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.270
rectangles, where the
height of the rectangles

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.710
are defined by
the left boundary.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.420
And this tells us it's
the left boundary.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:57.070
And we see for each, if this
is the i-th rectangle right

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.430
over here, if this is rectangle
i, then this right over here

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.550
is x sub i minus 1, and
this height right over here

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.500
is f of x sub i minus 1.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.400
So that's all we did right
over there times delta x.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.270
And then you sum of these
from the first rectangle

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.396
all the way to the end.

00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:18.770
So hopefully that makes you
a little bit more comfortable

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.750
with this notation.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.340
We're not doing
anything different

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.090
than we did in this first
video, which was hopefully

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.580
fairly straightforward for you.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.180
We have just generalized it
using a little bit more mathy

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.730
notation.
