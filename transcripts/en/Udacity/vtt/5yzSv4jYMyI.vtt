00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.210
Hi Michael, how are you doing?

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.480
&gt;&gt; Oh, good thanks. What the, what's on tap for today?

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.310
&gt;&gt; Well, as you can see on your

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.920
screen today we're going to talk about support vector machines.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.920
&gt;&gt; Hmm.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.930
&gt;&gt; And at the end of it, we are going to circle

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.350
back to boosting, so that I can try to explain to you

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.240
why it doesn't seem to over fit as much as you might

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.080
think or at least not in the ways that you make it.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.470
&gt;&gt; Ooh, that would be cool. I was worried that that was maybe a command.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.320
&gt;&gt; What

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.980
was a command?

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.512
&gt;&gt; The thing that you wrote on the screen.

00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:32.009
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] Man you know that reminds me of one of my favorite

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.780
little thing about police. That any combination

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.838
of the word police is a legal sentence

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:39.571
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I see.

00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:39.990
&gt;&gt; Please.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.030
&gt;&gt; Please. Police Please please. Please police.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.230
&gt;&gt; Please please please please please

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.760
please police. Those are all legal sentences.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.140
&gt;&gt; All right, we'll please stop.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.660
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.085
this is why I hang out with you, Michael.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:56.330
Ok,so today we're going to talk about support vector machines

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.720
and I'm going to do something unexpected. I'm going

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.870
to start out The beginning of this with a quiz.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.430
&gt;&gt; With a quiz.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.300
&gt;&gt; Yes, with a quiz. So here's the quiz for you, Michael. I've drawn on

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.040
here ,uh, some points, some labeled positive

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.040
and some labeled minus, representing two different classes.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.550
And, you'll notice that you could draw

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.710
a line to separate them, therefore they are

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.590
&gt;&gt; Linearly separable.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.400
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So the question I have for you is simply this, which is the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.128
best line? And here's how you're going to show

00:01:31.128 --> 00:01:33.610
me. Here's how you're going to show me. I'm

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.210
not just going to ask you to draw some random line because that's too hard for

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.079
us to get feeback on. So instead what I've done is I've drawn three green dots.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.720
Here on the sort of upper left and three red dots here on the bottom right

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.000
and what I want to you to do is select one of the green dots and one

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.380
of the red dots and since you'll have

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.040
two dots that will define a line and that'll

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.090
be the way you indicate to me which of the lines is in fact The best line.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.450
&gt;&gt; The best line.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.160
&gt;&gt; The best line. And I'm not going

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.550
to even tell you what best means. You tell

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.008
me what best means, when you justify why you would choose one over the other.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:13.680
&gt;&gt; If I think they're all the best, I can choose any one I want?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.740
&gt;&gt; That's right. Ok. So you got it?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.100
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.680
&gt;&gt; OK. Go.
