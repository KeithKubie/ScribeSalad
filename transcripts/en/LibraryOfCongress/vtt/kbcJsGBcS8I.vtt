Cultural Treasures from Around the World.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.920 position:66%
Thank you, Cheryl and Kathy for organizing
the conference and for including the WDL.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.340 position:59%
Today we want to talk to you about the
World Digital Library and show you how

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.190
to bring the World Digital
Library into your classroom.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.420
&gt;&gt; Hello, I'm Cecilia Penaloza,
the Program Specialist of WDL.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.770
&gt;&gt; And I'm the Description
Coordinator, Carissa Pastuch.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.580 position:69%
When you are done today we hope you will
walk away with a better understanding of how

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.070 position:58%
to use WDL primary resources as tools
to support your students research.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.890 position:70%
&gt;&gt; In other words, we would like you to be
comfortable searching using the main features

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.370 position:56%
of the site in guiding your
students to navigate our collection.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.540
&gt;&gt; Imagine providing your
students free access to treasures

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.180
from around the globe without
leaving your classroom.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.480 position:66%
Your students can examine a 16th Century
map of Portuguese and Spanish discoveries.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.630 position:61%
You can do that with maps from the WDL.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.310 position:70%
Here at the top left is one example, we call
it the Walter Mueller Map [assumed spelling].

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.750 position:56%
It's titled Map of the Entire World.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.960 position:69%
It was created in 1507 and was the first map

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.200
to depict a separate Western
Hemisphere with the name America.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.850 position:59%
&gt;&gt; The other atlas pictured here is
titled [foreign word] or General Atlas

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.460 position:69%
of all the Islands of the World, in English.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:24.410 position:69%
The atlas consist of 111 maps representing
all the islands and peninsulas of the world,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:35.420 position:75%
and showing all the discoveries made by European
explorer from the 1400 to the mid-16th Century.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.560 position:75%
&gt;&gt; During the first years in elementary students
can be struggling with text and reading.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.750 position:58%
Using maps or photos from WDL can
lead to engagement and allow students

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.030 position:56%
to read these items instead of text.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.690 position:69%
For some of those students this is something

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.430
that can boost their confidence
and increase participation.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.080 position:64%
You're probably asking how to get to WDL.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.940
To get to WDL you simply type
www.wdl.org into your browser

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.310 position:67%
and this will take you to the WDL homepage.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:20.890 position:69%
&gt;&gt; If by any chance you don't remember our
URL exactly, just type World Digital Library

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:28.200
into your browser and you should be
seeing WDL listed at the very top.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.880
&gt;&gt; Here you see a screenshot of the
WDL homepage, which is hyperlinked

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.480 position:64%
to the site so you can just click and go.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.600
The World Digital Library is
a free multilingual collection

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.950 position:69%
of cultural treasures from around the world.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.290
&gt;&gt; The World Digital Library
or WDL as we call it

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.420
as an [inaudible] accessible
Internet based digital collection

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.190
where you can find the world's
cultural treasures.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.730 position:63%
Items showcased in WDL can you give a
sense of the history of humanity as well

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.560 position:66%
as highlight achievements of many nations.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.210 position:63%
Presented here is a manuscript page by a
master of literature, Gustave Flaubert,

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.350
the author of <i>Madame Bouvard et </i>.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:31.300 position:70%
Flaubert fiercely worked and reworked his
writings until he reached the memorable style

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.580 position:64%
that generations of readers have enjoyed.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:41.670 position:59%
We can see this process exemplified
here in his worked titled [inaudible].

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.560
This is the kind of treasure that
makes WDL different and relevant.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.380 position:67%
&gt;&gt; Our ultimate goal is to promote
cross-cultural awareness and understanding.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.190 position:69%
WDL is in essence a collaborative initiative
undertaken by the Library of Congress

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.640 position:67%
and a large of number partner libraries,
museums, archives and cultural institutions

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.670
from around the world in
cooperation with UNESCO,

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.450 position:58%
the United Nations Educational
Scientific and Cultural Organization.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.680 position:58%
&gt;&gt; The item on the top left hand side

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.610 position:58%
of the slid is a [inaudible] fragment
called The Curse of Artemisia.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:33.620 position:56%
It is written in Ancient Greek and
dates from the late 4th Century BCE.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.060 position:69%
The middle item is one of the [inaudible]
dictionaries of old Spanish, [foreign word],

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.570
one of the languages of the Incas.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:51.360 position:61%
At the bottom left is an Arabic work by
[inaudible] from the Canon of Medicine.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.790 position:56%
[Inaudible] is considered one of
the most significant Islamic writers

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.570
of the Islamic Golden Age.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.510 position:58%
&gt;&gt; Partners may include institutions,
foundations and private companies

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.720 position:70%
that contribute to the project in other ways.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.090 position:70%
For example, by sharing technology, convening

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.280
or cosponsoring meetings,
or contributing financially.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.060
Currently WDL has content from
190 partners in 81 countries.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:28.520 position:58%
&gt;&gt; Our digital collection nowadays is
composed of more than 12,000 items.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.780 position:67%
Among those, manuscripts, maps, rare books,

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.860
prints and photographs, films
and sound recordings.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; WDL is not an encyclopedic
library, it is a curated collection.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.260 position:72%
Content on the WDL is selected by partner
institutions in accordance with guidelines set

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.620 position:61%
by the WDL Content Selection Committee.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.250 position:59%
Content is chosen for its cultural and
historical importance with dual regard

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.630
to recognition of the achievements
of all countries and cultures

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.970
over a wide range of time periods.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.810 position:75%
&gt;&gt; We are not custodians of the physical object.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.560
The objects remain in the custody
of their housed institution.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:23.680 position:64%
Let's take a manuscript from the
National Library of France as an example.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:30.380
This is Raynard Cycle [foreign
word], it's titled in French.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:36.310 position:63%
This is the most famous set of animal
stories produced during the Middle Ages.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.100 position:59%
&gt;&gt; WDL has the digital representations
taken from the original object,

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.120
in this case a manuscript,
and offers it for download

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.120
for educational purposes
while the National Library

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.500
of France keeps the actual
manuscript under their stewardship.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.000
&gt;&gt; WDL has legal permission to
give access to the digital item.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.600 position:73%
To offer a multilingual [inaudible] description
of the object, and it's cultural relevance

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.610 position:56%
in a way that will be understandable
for all global audiences.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.030
&gt;&gt; Let's go back to the home page.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:24.370
All bibliographic information
or metadata, navigation,

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.130
and supporting content are
translated into seven languages.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:36.310 position:64%
These include Arabic, English, Spanish,
French, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.540
These are the six languages of the
United Nations plus Portuguese.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:46.770 position:73%
Portuguese was included because of the National
Library of Brazil's participation as one

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.210 position:70%
of the original founding institutions of WDL.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:55.690
Translations are done by human
translators and not machines.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.200 position:59%
This feature lengthens and complicates
site development and maintenance

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.600
but brings WDL closer to the
goal of being truly universal.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.950 position:69%
You can toggle between languages by clicking
on the language icon at the top right

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.390
of the screen as is circled here.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.250 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Let me clarify it a little bit more.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:21.160 position:66%
Books, manuscripts, maps and other primary
materials on the site are not translated,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.440 position:66%
but presented in their original languages.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:31.470 position:73%
One hundred twenty eight languages are
represented in WDL, including many lesser known

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:37.860
and endangered languages, such
as [inaudible] and Cherokee.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:45.850
&gt;&gt; Here you see a screenshot of an
item detail page or record on WDL.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:53.730 position:64%
You can get to this page by clicking on
the reference image or title of the item.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.360 position:61%
This particular item is called <i>The Tale</i>

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.570 position:58%
<i>of Genji </i>and is often considered the
first great novel in world literature

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.290
and one of the best known classic
works in Japanese literature.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.570
Added value on our site includes
consistent, high quality metadata.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.290 position:61%
Each item is described by a consistent
set of [inaudible] information relating

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.890 position:64%
to its geographical, temporal and topical
coverage, among other requirements.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:25.810 position:63%
Often you hear the definition of
metadata as metadata is data about data.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:31.020 position:61%
This definition is correct, metadata
summarized basic information about data

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:36.610
which in this case is the content,
be it a manuscript, book or print.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:41.560 position:73%
Consistent metadata provides the foundation for
a site that is easy and interesting to explore

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.550
and that helps to reveal
connections between items.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.400
Author and date created are
examples of metadata.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.220 position:58%
Clicking on the author here will
take you to a list of all WDL content

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:59.320
that has the same creator, which
in this case is Murasaki Shikibu.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:05.940 position:70%
WDL currently has seven items by this author,
which were shared by National Diet Library,

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.910
Library of Congress and the
[inaudible] State Library.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.070 position:64%
Having the ability to filter through that
metadata makes it much easier for someone

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.600
to locate a specific document or
to make connections between items.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.020 position:56%
The metadata also improves
exposure to external search engines.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:29.600 position:59%
&gt;&gt; WDL has descriptions for each item.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.630
These descriptions are intended
to answer two questions,

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:37.470 position:67%
what is the item and why is it significant.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:44.760 position:72%
This information provides content for user and
is designed to spark the curiosity of students

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.960 position:61%
and the general public to learn more
about the cultural [inaudible] country.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:13:00.300
Here is a screenshot of the options
one can use to explore WDL content.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.980 position:59%
On the top left hand corner of the
WDL homepage you see the word explore.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:11.020
If you click on that a dropdown
menu will appear.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:17.650
&gt;&gt; Now we're going to discuss
sorting and a free text search.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:23.800 position:64%
Explore is simply a way of browsing a
site using one or more filtering options.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:31.710 position:59%
These options include place, time
period, topic, type of item or format,

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.390 position:59%
language and contributing institution.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:40.040 position:75%
Each browsing session can be narrowed down using
filters until one reaches the desired result.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.130 position:61%
&gt;&gt; The first option to filter is place.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:51.360 position:69%
This option allows you to sort content by
visual graphics [inaudible] of the resource.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.240 position:67%
When cataloging, our metadata specialist
uses modern place names [inaudible] region,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.280
country, [inaudible] and city.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:11.160 position:70%
&gt;&gt; If the content does not deal with a
geographic subject, for example works dealing

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.680 position:72%
with religions, science or mathematics, we use
the region or country or origin of the author

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.680
or where that person primarily
worked to classify the item.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.320 position:66%
Therefore, these items still exist and
are browsable in a geographic context even

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.270 position:63%
if they're not about a particular place.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:36.270
&gt;&gt; Time period allows you to filter
by the date the item was created.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:43.910 position:56%
Topic allows you to sort by topic
drawn from the Dewey Decimal System.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.670
&gt;&gt; Type of item or format allows
you to sort items by format.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:56.680
For example, books, journals,
manuscripts, maps, etcetera.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.310
&gt;&gt; Language allows you to sort
by the language of the content.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:09.320
Note that items with no linguistic
content, such as photograph,

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.150 position:66%
will not be sorted using this [inaudible].

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:20.900 position:69%
&gt;&gt; And finally you can sort by contributing
institution, which is just sorting according

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.540 position:75%
to the institution that contributed the content.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.840 position:66%
In addition to sorting, the search box,
as shown here in the middle of the screen,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.780 position:58%
circled in red, can be used to
conduct a keyword search of the site.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:41.740 position:58%
This is probably the easiest way to
get an item about a particular topic.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.690 position:72%
You just type in a keyword and hit enter and
all of the metadata descriptions and full text

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.140 position:72%
of printed books on the site will be searched.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.660
Let me briefly pause here
to provide an anecdote.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.560
One of the teachers in residence
here at Education Outreach, Tom,

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.300 position:58%
described how he effectively used the
WDL for a project with first graders.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:07.050 position:75%
He used the website for a unit he called Long
Ago and Now, which basically asks young students

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.340 position:63%
to compare their life with one long ago.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.250
What they tried last year somewhat
successfully was to extend the idea

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.940 position:75%
and add a geographical component to the project.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.920
They asked students to look ago
in different parts of the world.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.470 position:63%
They performed a keyword search
together on WDL using the term children.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:32.400 position:75%
Results included photographs of children from
many cultures and places, including [inaudible],

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.380
China, Hungary, and children
from various backgrounds

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.780 position:72%
and ethnicities, such as [inaudible] children.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.570
These photos are photos that these
young students can easily analyze

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:49.040 position:67%
for some basic similarities and differences
between themselves and those pictured.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.780 position:75%
WDL photos and other materials are almost always
more nuanced than a photo students will find

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.700 position:70%
in their textbooks or other online resources.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:04.360 position:73%
And engaging this material encourages
reflection that other visual resources may not.

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:14.460 position:70%
&gt;&gt; In order to illustrate our display in some
features let's [inaudible] look at an example

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:21.720 position:63%
for one item [inaudible] of the book
titled <i>Women of the Empire in War Time </i>.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.590
This book is from our partners
at the British Library.

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:32.490 position:70%
It was published in 1916 to celebrate the
contribution made by British women in support

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.680
of the allies during World War I.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:42.680 position:64%
To view the digital images of the item
click on the reference image circle here.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.930
Clicking on the reference image
will take you to the item display.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.980 position:73%
&gt;&gt; Here you see the item description in English

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.860
which explains what the item
is and why it's significant.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.670
&gt;&gt; The feature highlighted
here is great for students.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:12.140 position:64%
It's a text to speech conversion, which
is a function that allows users to listen

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.730
to the metadata and description
in all seven languages.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.610 position:75%
Just click on this button to listen to the text.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.370
&gt;&gt; To change the item display
to another language,

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:33.500
just toggle between the languages
using the language icon.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:40.620 position:58%
Here is an example of the same record
in Arabic for <i>Women of the Empire</i>

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.900 position:63%
<i>in War Time </i>or [foreign word] in Arabic.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:52.950 position:75%
Using the text to speech function you can listen
to the description and metadata in Arabic.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.690
Again, just click the button
to listen to the text.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.810
You may have noticed that the text

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.650
to speech function button has moved
to the left side of the screen.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.740 position:63%
This is because the orientation of the
language has changed from left to right,

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.210
and so has the language interface.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:17.930 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Display here is the same item, <i>Women
of the Empire in War Time </i>in Chinese.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.220
Click the text to speech button,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.970
and don't expect that I will
read Chinese, because I don't.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.800
&gt;&gt; Now we'd like to show you
the item display function.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.060 position:61%
Again, you click on the reference image
and you'll go to the item display.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.390
It will take you to this screen.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:46.640 position:73%
Once you've clicked on the reference image each
item can be viewed through the zoom features.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.200 position:63%
Use the arrows at the bottom of the page
to scroll through the pages of the book.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.460
Item detail will take you
back to the item record.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:03.270
&gt;&gt; You can zoom in into any page
of a book or any part of a map.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:12.060 position:70%
To zoom in or out use the zoom button located
at the bottom right of the display panel.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.730
[Inaudible] included in books
such as maps have been digitized

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.970 position:63%
and are presented with the zoom feature.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.690 position:59%
&gt;&gt; Another way to discover items on
the WDL site is the timelines feature.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:33.230
Each timeline allows users to zero
in on particular time periods.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:39.600 position:72%
WDL currently has four timeline options, these
include Chinese books, manuscripts, maps,

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:45.490 position:63%
and prints, illuminated manuscripts from
Europe, U.S. history and world history.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.140
We're currently developing
a timeline for World War I

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.950 position:67%
to commemorate the U.S. entry into the war.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.800
All timelines are curated.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.980
Let's look briefly at the
world history timeline.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:03.260
&gt;&gt; After clicking on the world
history timeline options,

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.420
the first item that appears
chronologically is the [inaudible].

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:19.550 position:69%
We're emphasizing the first date on the
Mayan calendar which mark the year 3372 BCE.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:25.990 position:66%
Seen here is a small section of one of
the panels of the magnificent [inaudible],

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.010 position:69%
one of the four surviving Mayan [inaudible].

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:37.940 position:70%
To continue moving through time click and
drag the time bar at the bottom of the screen

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:45.740 position:70%
or use the arrow to the right and left of
the display item in the middle of the screen.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.100 position:75%
You will encounter interesting dates and topics.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.620
This document can also [inaudible]
interactive map.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:59.660
&gt;&gt; Yes, Cecilia, interactive maps
are an extension of the timeline.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.170
What we wanted to accomplish with
interactive maps was basically

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:08.300 position:63%
to provide a spatial representation of
the documents included on each timeline.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.230 position:73%
Here you see the World History interactive map,

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.500
which as we mentioned pulls
from the curated timeline.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.450 position:56%
You can use this option to see where
these items fall geographically.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:26.910 position:58%
The text box, as you see here, is the
summary of the timeline [inaudible].

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.610
Once closed you can see the green
circles with a number inside.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:36.510 position:56%
Each circle and number represents
the number of items for that region.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.830 position:56%
You can click on the number to get
to the gallery display of the items.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:44.080
And click on the reference image
to go to the record of that item.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.520 position:64%
Alternatively, you can click on the
region provided at the top of the gallery

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.460 position:61%
which is linked to all items in the WDL
collection that deal with that region.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:58.230 position:69%
We're exploring other options for teachers
to pull WDL content and compare with content

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.190 position:69%
from other sites and institutions currently.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:13.660 position:58%
&gt;&gt; Please note now the helpful links
that we are putting together for you.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.300 position:63%
In closing, you can [inaudible] what
you can learned during this presentation

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.000
by continuing exploring and
navigating the site on your own.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.790
We encourage you to take
some time now to explore

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.620 position:70%
and ask us any questions that you might have.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:38.370 position:67%
We want you to know that you, teachers, are
a very important segment of our audience.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:43.470
It is key for us to know that we
are serving your appropriately

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:48.270
and that we are giving you
thoughtful and provoking content.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:55.060 position:72%
It is important for us to know that you are
-- your students are engaged with the content,

00:23:55.060 --> 00:24:01.150
which in many ways depends on
your own engagement with it.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:08.620 position:75%
We encourage you to look at the site and examine
how it can better serve you and your curriculum.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:16.000 position:69%
Find the connection that might exist between
your lesson plans and our collection.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.090
WDL is a research tool which
needs to be used creatively.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:28.840
Remember that and feel free
to contact us at any time.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.480
We will be happy to help.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.620
&gt;&gt; Thank you, guys.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.980
Now we would like to take some time
to perform an exercise with you.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:43.730 position:58%
We'd like for you to play around
with the search function on the site.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:52.750 position:73%
Enter www.wdl.org into your browser and perform
a keyword search using the word children.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.020
Look at the results.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:59.840 position:63%
Do you think your students could use any
of these as we have discussed earlier?

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.830
Can they use these pictures
and compare them to themselves?

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:07.780 position:59%
Would your students find this helpful?

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.730
If so or if not, how?

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.260 position:59%
&gt;&gt; What are the connections that you
see between the life of those pictures

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.970 position:56%
in the photograph and your students?

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:36.850 position:56%
We trust that you are creative, that
you will facilitate this encounter

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.840 position:59%
between your students and our content.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:46.190 position:67%
That's [inaudible] that we need
[inaudible] to help us reach your students.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:54.250 position:70%
So try to create a narrative that helps us to
showcase our content and help your students

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:58.880
to get more knowledge about
the world [inaudible].

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:13.520 position:66%
&gt;&gt; So are you guys coming across various
ethnicities, photos, what type of formats?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.010 position:75%
What do you think would be particularly helpful?

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.660
Do you think a print or photograph
may be more helpful?

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.700 position:64%
Do you think a map could be more helpful?

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:30.660 position:58%
&gt;&gt; We are always amazed when we
encounter teachers and they say to us

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.420
that they are somehow complicated
trying to explain

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.070 position:69%
to their kids about the different religions.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:46.710 position:69%
And we always point out to them that we
have wonderful Bibles, wonderful [inaudible]

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:51.310 position:56%
that perhaps the idea to enter those
kind of subjects is to go first

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:57.890 position:73%
for the artistic [inaudible] of the images, and
that helps a lot because as kids get engaged

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:03.970
in the image it's much easier
to jump into more heavy content.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.260 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone, this is Kathy McWiggin
[assumed spelling] from the Library of Congress.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.580 position:69%
I'd like to ask Carissa and Cecilia some
questions from the beginning of the program.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:22.140 position:67%
There was a question that came in about the
use of content and can I use the content.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:30.020 position:56%
Can you talk about the copyright for
the items on World Digital Library?

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:39.720 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Content provided on WDL is downloadable
and can be used for educational purposes.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.020
Any format of content.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:52.020 position:66%
You can use a map, you can use the
manuscript, the book, all pages of a book,

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.770
and foldout maps are downloadable.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.200
&gt;&gt; This is Cecilia here.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.150
I would like to point out to you
that our collection is growing.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:09.500
We make releases of new content
every two or three weeks.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:16.570 position:73%
And that means that sometimes you might
encounter not exactly what you are looking for,

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.020 position:64%
but this is a collection that is growing.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:28.380 position:64%
We depend many ways of the willingness of
the institutions to share their content.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.400
So but we are very aware of
the needs that teachers have,

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.550
so we're trying to fill those gaps.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:45.350 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Carissa and Cecilia, I was recording
the questions as they were coming through,

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:50.170 position:64%
so I'll give you a few other questions
that were brought up within this session.

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:52.530 position:69%
And I know Jason, you handled some of these,

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:56.360
but we'll just maybe not every
was paying attention to the chat.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:02.010 position:59%
But Jennifer Abbott wrote, "Are print
artifacts transcribed for easy reading

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.970 position:66%
or are there only scans of the documents?"

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.090
&gt;&gt; Well, we use scans that
come from different sources.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:17.580
And actually the zoom feature
will allow the students

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.960 position:63%
to get very, very close to the material.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:26.040 position:56%
So there's not a percent translation
of each page, you will see the page

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.380
and that will really increase the
visibility of the entire book.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:37.460 position:63%
Another thing that we have to clarify,
we don't have just one image of one page

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.930
in a book, we have the entire book.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:44.570 position:70%
If the book has 300 pages, the scans are 300.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:48.770 position:61%
&gt;&gt; And back to the transcription
issue, transcriptions are only provided

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:54.030 position:69%
in extremely famous works, otherwise we will
not provide transcriptions of these items.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.070
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:01.480 position:73%
&gt;&gt; We just don't have the resources to do that.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.570
&gt;&gt; Great. Okay, I've been forwarded
a couple other questions and I'm --

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.130
if it's okay I'm going to go ahead
and ask those to you now, too.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:14.170 position:56%
How about, what are some of the
most viewed or downloaded resources?

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:23.800 position:67%
&gt;&gt; I would say that one of the most popular
right now is the Florentine [inaudible].

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:31.500 position:61%
We have a very important collection of
[inaudible] and we needed the last one,

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:36.790
[inaudible] the last part
of the [inaudible] Empire.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:44.380 position:59%
And we got it after a long negotiation
with [inaudible], a library in Italy.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:53.920 position:66%
And we scanned all the pages, and those
[inaudible] extremely, extremely solicited

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.970 position:64%
by teachers and actually academics, also,

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:02.930 position:59%
because it's the first time it's
available online to be seen and study.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.920
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.480 position:72%
I think we have time for a few more questions.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.460
Oh, here, Desiree asks, "Is
there a way to request documents

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.630 position:70%
or recordings that you don't currently have?"

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:27.240 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Well, we receive suggestions, but as I
said before, we depend on the institutions

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.430 position:66%
that we are negotiating to get scans from.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:35.760 position:73%
Now, if the teachers wanted to let us know that
they are very interested in a certain item,

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.380 position:70%
of course we will welcome that suggestion
and try to negotiate for you to get the scans

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:46.920 position:61%
and the description, which is the most
important part, in the seven languages.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.400 position:59%
It's a complicated work, but we love
it, so we will make the best of trying

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.940 position:58%
to get you the content that you need.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.880 position:73%
&gt;&gt; We do have certain content that we
prioritize, such as Mezzo American [inaudible],

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:06.480 position:69%
Chinese rare books, so we do encourage our
partners to donate these types of materials,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.440 position:58%
and sometimes seek it out if need be.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.990
&gt;&gt; Great. Okay, here's another
question that's coming in.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:16.540
I'll type it as I'm speaking.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:21.000
But as you work with teachers are
you learning particular strategies

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.240 position:75%
that teachers are often using with this content?

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.370 position:75%
In other words, how are they -- how are teachers
around the world using the World Digital Library

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:32.240 position:67%
and what seems to be working best for them?

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.900
&gt;&gt; That is a good question.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:41.130 position:61%
We try to learn a lot from the feedback
we get, and webinars such as this one,

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:45.690 position:56%
and talk with the teachers in
residence here at Education Outreach

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:50.410 position:72%
to learn how teachers are using these in
their classrooms, learn how they use our site.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:56.330 position:63%
So we really depend on you in a forum
such as this to respond and let us know.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:01.540
We hope that you can perhaps
identify gaps in our timeline

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.350 position:61%
or gaps in our content and let us know.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:09.230 position:56%
Feel free to e-mail us, Tweet us and
let us know where these gaps exist,

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:14.870 position:56%
how we can better fulfill things
that will work with your curriculum.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:19.340
So please respond, let us know.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:27.790 position:75%
&gt;&gt; And a related question came in, "Do you have
teachers using this content all over the world?"

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.770
&gt;&gt; Yes, most definitely.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:38.840 position:61%
We can hear from them, from [inaudible]
from Albania, we can hear teachers

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.060 position:58%
that write from -- to us from Russia.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.130
It's quite amazing for us.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.990
Sometimes we're not totally
aware of the access that we have

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:52.170 position:56%
to these remote places in the world.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:56.840
So, yes, we have responses
from teachers from all

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.580 position:73%
over the place, and that's very, very exciting.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.400
&gt;&gt; And we can track our users.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:08.510 position:73%
Of course we can't tell, you know, if our users
are a teacher or what their profession is,

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:13.970 position:61%
but we can track them and right now our
number one user by country is China.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.000
&gt;&gt; That's very interesting.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.970
A related -- different question
came in, I'll type it in.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.270 position:69%
This really has to do with the digitization.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:33.300 position:58%
Is -- you know, we know you digitized
resources from all over the world,

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:38.820
is digitization ever a problem
in places like the Third World

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.930 position:63%
where resources may not be as available?

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:47.270
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a great question
and the answer is yes.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:55.010 position:66%
There is very much a different level of
financial possibilities for people who are

00:34:55.010 --> 00:35:02.920 position:56%
in Africa and South America, Central
America, even, part of India.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:09.030 position:69%
So we do -- we are aware of those
problems, and at that point you have to talk

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:21.290 position:70%
with educational ministers with consortiums
that found those kind of initiative projects,

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:24.810 position:75%
because universities sometimes do a lot of that.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.250 position:66%
We here, where we work, we don't digitize.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:35.970 position:59%
We have some centers for digitization
and that help us a lot to go by areas.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:43.960 position:73%
But definitely, in Africa, for example, we have
a lot to do, and to teach them how to digitize

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:49.000
with the standards that we need,
because sometimes we receive things

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.310 position:70%
that we really cannot put in our site because
it will not be using all the resources

00:35:55.310 --> 00:36:01.480 position:63%
that we have, because the scans are too
weak, because they're totally imperfect.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:10.150 position:75%
So there's a lot of capacity building to be done
and we are very aware and working on that area.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:14.220
&gt;&gt; Our major locations that
we focused on is Iraq,

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:20.970 position:75%
Uganda and Egypt, our capacity building that is.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:30.170
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] asks specifically
about projects underway in India.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.240
I believe Cuddy [assumed
spelling] is from India.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:38.890 position:66%
&gt;&gt; We currently have one partner in India,
in Cashmere, but we are currently working

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:43.290 position:56%
to recruit other partners and would
love to have more partners in India.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:51.070 position:61%
&gt;&gt; On a related note let's say somebody
like Cuddy wanted to help you guys out,

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:54.450
could she do that as an educator?

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:59.060 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Well, if she has any connection
with the national library, for example,

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:05.030
she can put us in contact with them
and tell them about our initiative.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:11.790 position:66%
Of course, some people ask, also, if we
will be adding new languages, for example.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:17.640 position:66%
And, yes, it's a goal, but we are working
with the resources that we have right now.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:23.730 position:64%
We would love to have more languages, and
that's a lot of work for the translators,

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:28.090 position:67%
for the editors, but most definitely for --

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:33.490 position:66%
to accomplish the mission to be
universal, we need to have more languages.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:40.340
So if India is one of the countries
that we would like to have, yes.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:46.190 position:69%
And we do have a lot of content about India,
we have actually the Constitution of India.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:52.890
&gt;&gt; Great. This is fascinating.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:58.110
We unfortunately are just
about at the end of our time.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:04.760 position:75%
So Carissa or Cecilia, do you have any final
words before I kind of do my final housekeeping?

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:12.280 position:59%
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to reinforce that we
recognize that teachers are indeed one

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.540 position:73%
of the most important segments of our audience.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:23.120 position:63%
And we rely heavily on their feedback to
better our site and to select content.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:30.020 position:66%
So please, I encourage you to respond
here in the chat room, respond by a Tweet,

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.100 position:61%
any way you can, be interactive and let
us know how we can better serve you.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:41.780 position:72%
&gt;&gt; And just now I thank you -- a big thank you
for all of you for the attention, and please,

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:46.400
come back to our site and
explore what is going on there.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.320
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:47.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.620
&gt;&gt; I second that.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.930
Thank you to Carissa and Cecilia
for a wonderful presentation,

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.220
and for everybody who joined
as attendees, as well.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.480 position:56%
We would love to have your feedback.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.020
If you look at the content on the
slide right now, there's a link.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.690
You can click on that survey link
and please take a few moments

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:10.270
and provide very helpful feedback
to us on the presentation.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:15.270 position:61%
You will also receive any e-mail within
five business days with directions

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.110
to access a certificate for
one instructional hour.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:22.230 position:63%
In case you want to use this session as,
you know, continuing education units,

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.320 position:67%
that's something that you could do as well.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.410 position:61%
Thanks again, everybody for joining us.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.350
Good night.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:36.340
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
