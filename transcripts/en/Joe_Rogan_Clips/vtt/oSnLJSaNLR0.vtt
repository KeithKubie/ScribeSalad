1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.231
Man,

2
00:00:00.231 --> 00:00:03.000
I just got something on my Instagram about the guy who got hit by a dog and I

3
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:03.870
just put that up there.

4
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:06.660
The day I saw somebody put it up trying to hit by a dolphin.
Yeah.

5
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:10.440
He was doing some paddle board and as a dolphin was living life a little bit,

6
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:11.610
dolphin was doing the stick.
So there,

7
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.240
you know how he's paddleboard down and there's a wave coming and then you can

8
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:17.590
see the dolphins.
You know they like to surf,
so they get in the wave,

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.860
they're doing their thing,
and I think the Dolphin sees him.

10
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.860
He's the only one who decides to come out of the water and get a little air.

11
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.360
He's like,
oh,
this is a paddle boarder.
Get a little air POW.
And He fucks him up.

12
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.530
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Here we go.
Whoa,
look at this.
Oh,

13
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:36.150
that's 100% on purpose.
Like it makes you wonder about dolphins like a dog.

14
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:40.440
I was like,
oh,
what an opportunity it is.
100% on.
Perfect.
Yeah.
I had to,

15
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:43.830
I had to put that.
I had to post that on Instagram.
That guy's all right.

16
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
He's all right.
He fell in the water.
He fell in the water.
But the dolphins heavy.

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.020
Yeah.
Go fat checks.
You got a little side chat.
What do you do in that moment?

18
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.220
Do you hit him?
You hit the dolphin.
Do you punch it?
No,
I have respect.
I know.
No,

19
00:00:56.221 --> 00:01:00.450
I punch out and fuck you up.
I'm like,
the Dolphin got the air.
I'm like,
Hey,
look,

20
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:03.330
you're having a little fun.
Yeah,
because how much of the Dolphin way?

21
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.630
And it's his element.
It's a big animal.
Yeah.
You got to get back to the shore.

22
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.960
That is pretty funny though.
Yeah.
Walked out,
went off,
walked out when?
Yeah.

23
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.640
You know,
you know elbow and as it's coming and you don't want to piss him off,

24
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.380
you're in their neighborhood.
Oh yeah.
And this is,

25
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.310
that's clearly on purpose.
Yeah.
That's clearly I,
it's like you fucking dummies.

26
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.470
Get out of the way,
bitch.
Yeah.
What are you doing?

27
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.810
You're not even surfing paddleboarding.

28
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.280
Surprisingly hard.
I wonder if his friends laughed.
Oh,
the other dolphins.
Yeah,

29
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:40.250
he's talking to his friends.
They probably thought it was awesome.
Yeah,
yeah,

30
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.340
yeah.
I went paddle boarding.
It's not easy.
I didn't think it was hard.
It is.

31
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.850
You stand,
you stand straight like this.
You sure you don't have to go.

32
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.890
That was hard.
There was a lot of waves.
It was a,

33
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:55.110
it was a little little walk away,
but I was like,

34
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.540
I thought this would be way easier.
I fell twice.

35
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.470
Jb speaking,
following me.
Stop it Bro.
Yeah,

36
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:09.300
I'm paddleboarding.
Um,
is one of those things where it's like,

37
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.760
it's,
you're just use mostly using your core right out.
I'm not an expert at it.

38
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:17.070
I did it once or twice when I was in Hawaii,
you know,

39
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.620
hanging out with the fam who's stuck.

40
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:24.570
If you got like placid water and actually calming
panel board,

41
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.220
you ever surf?
I've tried.
I'm gonna be seven.

42
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.240
Want to do this this year just to get some lessons,
taking some lessons.

43
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.780
Who did a little bit.
I've,
I've,
I've been,
uh,
up onto wave.

44
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:35.720
The water was pushing me,
but I can't,
um,

45
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.590
I can't call it surfing what I was doing,
but I was in the water.

46
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.520
I was having fun.
Yeah.
That's a respectable thing to know.
How to do.
Right.

47
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:47.400
When you hear someone can serve like Ah,
well no,

48
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.580
I've decided that I have to do it.
I've been living in California all my life.

49
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:54.960
I'm paying to be a surfer.
I'm,
I live here,
I pay this,
the surfing,

50
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.040
surfing tax,
but I'm not going to the beach and getting my money's,

51
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.850
I got to go and get it.
Yeah.
When we think about how many people live in La,

52
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:08.680
how few actually go to the beach,
right?
Yeah.
Beaches,
not that crowded.

53
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.110
No comparison.

54
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.060
How many fucking people over here to all those things that where people just

55
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:17.290
take it for granted.
Yeah.
So would you you serve?
No.

56
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.320
You know I'm scared of sharks.
Yeah.
So I started the quest last year,

57
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:23.880
so last year I took a couple of lessons so this really gets a little warmer.

58
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.723
I'm going to do it again.

59
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.960
We were thinking about doing a surfing challenge for sober October.

60
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.370
I was going to be like time spent up on a board for the entire month.

61
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.820
Tom Kamber contest.
All right.
Are you going to be doing it?

62
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.630
But we haven't decided and I think the guys are,

63
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.630
they don't want to do the surfing thing.
If you do it,
let me know.

64
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.490
I want to do it with you.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
you're cold in October,
wasn't it?
Maybe.

65
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.570
Yeah.
That's the idea.
Pussy.
Come on.
Fear.

66
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.750
Did you see the code in October?
Barely.
It's like eight September.

67
00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:55.810
What was happening with this?

68
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.460
It happens very fast in the way I saw this as a navy you at or a French navy men

69
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:04.180
jumped off about to celebrate and as he's in the water here,

70
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.840
a shark comes after him.
Yeah.
It just comes out of nowhere.
They can't,

71
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:09.850
no one can really see it.
Then all of a sudden right at the last second,

72
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:12.100
they spot it and they're like,
oh shit.
Get the fuck out of the way.

73
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.640
It just nibbles like that as foot a little.
It almost looks fake,

74
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:18.490
but the way you're acting,
it's not like that shit's fake of hall.

75
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.700
It just happened.
All of a sudden he's just in the water.
They didn't a man.

76
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.300
That's how it goes.
That's their world.
Look at.

77
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.630
You can't even see anything in there.

78
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.230
That's the thing that freaks you out the most about the ocean is the
possibility.

79
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.590
It's like you're just looking down.
You don't see a goddamn thing.

80
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:36.400
And also the meg.
Yeah.
Dot.
I liked that Australian guy.

81
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.850
Remember that Australian surfer and the shark was coming after him and he was

82
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:42.790
just pushing him away and he was in there when he talked about,
he's like,
well,

83
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:45.880
he was looking like he wanted to bite me.
I decided I didn't want him to,

84
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:47.970
so I just pushed him away a little bit.
Oh yeah,

85
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.310
you just fought off a shark.
He's like,
yeah,

86
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.020
I didn't want it to be bitten.
So that's a good attitude to quiche.
Yes.

87
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.260
I'm not interested in this.
I'm not freaking out,
but I still want to be bit,
yeah.

88
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.850
Yeah.
You don't want to freak out.
Right.
If you freak out that,

89
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.350
they probably can sense it.
She really spazz out in the water.

90
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.420
They probably know all this guy's scared as fuck.

91
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.150
This guy smells like food.
They apparently don't like to eat us.

92
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:20.470
Is this the guy right here?
That's 8 million views.

93
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.080
Great white shark surprises,
solitary surfer.
I haven't seen this one.

94
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.160
That's not the one I'm talking about.
You were going to be bad.

95
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.600
Could be some that don't look right behind him.
Oh,
Jesus.
Louise's

96
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.370
surf.
No,
I think he saw it and he's like,
yeah,
likes,

97
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.640
oh man.
But he's paddling with his arm,

98
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.720
looking like the seal with every time he paddles,
the arm could disappear on him.

99
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.990
She's going to do surf.
Yeah.
Five,
five,
five,
five,
five foc.

100
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.790
But you're so helpless in their world.

101
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:58.980
It's like you ever see what happens when a shark kids,
yeah.
Beached.
Oh yeah.

102
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.130
I was looking for this video that a day we found that one where you were like,

103
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.110
why does pick it up and throw it out?
Get their water.

104
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.020
There's a video I saw of a girl literally doing that just like a chick in a

105
00:06:07.021 --> 00:06:08.900
bikini.
There's is this smaller shark,

106
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.040
but she just grabbed him by the tail yanks it good for her.

107
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.950
But the problem was with the one you can't,

108
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.950
sharks don't just start swimming when they get put in the water that they need

109
00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:19.380
to be like they can't stop moving really.

110
00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:22.200
So they got to have a little shove and on and on.
It's hard to do too.

111
00:06:22.201 --> 00:06:26.170
They had to drag that shark out by a boat to sort of get it going to get oh

112
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.000
water and skills so it can breathe and oh,
okay,
that makes sense.

113
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.740
That'd be going into,

114
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.850
water's got to come this way because sharks are super weird in terms of their

115
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:38.790
physiology.
Like if they go upside down and go to sleep,
all right.

116
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.870
And fucking strange.
And they have to keep moving.

117
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:48.170
I don't think they can breathe if they sit still,

118
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:51.110
unless they find a spot where there's a nice little dress.
Oh,
right,
right,
right.

119
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.320
So it happened to,

120
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.420
I can't show this one either cause this is going to get taken down,

121
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:56.280
but it's that girl getting pulled into the water.

122
00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:59.640
She's trying to feed a shark off of a boat and it grabs her by the finger and

123
00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:03.580
just yanks her and oh gee.
And everybody freaks out all so quick,
fast.

124
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.840
What kind of shark is it doesn't say,

125
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.350
but also to in Australia.
So it might be,
yeah,
great.
Fuck that.

126
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.840
Why did she think she could feed the shark with her fingers?

127
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.850
Told her she could and that was a bad idea.
Yeah,
that's,
that's the worst thing.

128
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:22.270
You know,
you're probably right.
Cause you know,
like when you,

129
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.100
when you haven't done it before,
you're going to make,

130
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.900
you're going to ask a reasonable question.

131
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.170
Can the shark bite me and pulled me in and he's going to tell you something in

132
00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:32.770
the expert voice.
Like,
no,
he's not interested in you.
You don't look like a seal.

133
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.110
He's not going to try to,
you know,
bite you.

134
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.010
Plus she's probably hanging out with like three or four dudes that want to fuck

135
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:42.820
around.
