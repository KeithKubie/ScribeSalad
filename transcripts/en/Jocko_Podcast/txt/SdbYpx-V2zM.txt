Speaker 1:          00:03          December, 1944

Speaker 2:          00:07          yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07          In the city of Bastogne, Belgium during the battle of the bulge, the American soldiers primarily from the hundred and first airborne division, but also from the nine 69th artillery battalion and Combat Command B of the 10th Armored Division. We're surrounded by Germans. They were outnumbered by approximately five to one. They were lacking in cold weather gear. They were short on ammunition and low on food and medical supplies. The weather was horrible due to heavy cloud cover. Resupply from the air was not possible. They appeared to be doomed. That is certainly what the Germans thought. So on the 22nd of December, the German sent a message with two young German officers offering an opportunity for the Americans to surrender the message. Read to the u s a commander of the encircled town of Bastogne. The fortune of war is changing this time. The USA forces in [inaudible] near Bastogne have been encircled by strong German armored units.

Speaker 2:          01:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46          More German armored units have crossed the river or Fu near or Fruitville have taken marsh. I have reached st who bear by passing through on Bray Cbrei Tla. Libra mall is in German hands. There was only one possibility to save the Incircl, the USA troops from total annihilation. That is honorable surrender of the encircled town.

Speaker 2:          02:20          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:21          In order to think it over a term of two hours, we'll be granted beginning with the presentation of this note. If this proposal should be rejected, one German artillery core and six heavy a battalion's are ready to annihilate the USA troops in and near Bastogne. The order for firing will be given immediately after this two hours term. All the serious civilian losses caused by this artillery fire would not correspond with the well known American humanity signed the German commander, the American commander General Anthony Mcauliffe. Upon hearing this offer didn't like the idea at all. In fact, his initial response was simply nuts. After a little discussion with his staff on what the proper written response would be, they decided that was the proper response. So they put together a formal note on letterhead to return to the German commander. It red

Speaker 1:          03:42          22 December, 1944 to the German commander nuts signed the American commander on Christmas Eve. General Mcauliffe sent out a message to his troops in the besieged city. It red headquarters hundred and first Airborne Division Office of the Division Commander 24 December, 1944 what's Mary about all this you ask, we're fighting. It's cold. We aren't home. All true, but what has the Proud Eagle Division accomplished with its worthy comrades of the 10th Armored Division, the 705th tank, destroyer battalion, and all the rest? Just this. We have stopped cold. Everything that has been thrown at us from the north, east, south, and West. We have identifications from four German Panzer divisions to German infantry divisions and one German parachute division. These units spearheading the last desperate German lunge. We're headed straight west for key points. When the Eagle Division was heard, the ordered to stem the advance, how effectively this was done will be written in history, not alone in our divisions, glorious history, but in world history.

Speaker 2:          05:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:25          The Germans actually did surround us. Their radios blared our doom. Their commander demanded our surrender in the following in Putin arrogance and that's when the general added in the note of the German surrender demand and he gave his response, the simple response of nuts, do you want it all the troops to know? And then he closed out the memo explaining their current situation on the ground. The message continued. Allied troops are counter attacking in force. We continued to hold Bastogne by holding Bastogne. We assure the success of the allied armies. We know that our division commander General Taylor will say, well done. We are giving our country and our loved ones at home, a worthy Christmas present at being privileged to take part in this gallon feet of arms are truly making for ourselves. Well, merry Christmas. A C McAuliffe. Well, the Germans did attack Bastogne on Christmas Day and they did initially break through the American perimeter, but the American soldiers stood their ground and defeated the attack, eventually destroying all the German tanks. Then the next day, the 26th of December, General Patents, Fourth Armored Division along with the 26th infantry division, broke through to Bastogne and opened up a quarter to relieve the embattled but Victoria's troops.

Speaker 1:          07:26          It was a glorious example of will and defiance and undaunted courage in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. And it was an example of the victory of light over darkness. But let us never forget that forever you victory. There is a cost. There is sacrifice. And one letter home also written on Christmas Eve, December 24th, 1944 from the battle of the bulge by Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Blair, the commanding officer.

Speaker 2:          08:26          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:26          Of the 268 field artillery battalion who was born in New Orleans and raised in Mississippi. This letter shows some of that sacrifice. The letter was written to Colonel Blair's parents, but in the letter he also speaks of his young wife Mary and their three year old daughter Susan.

Speaker 2:          08:58          This is what he wrote. Do Your folks well, so this is Christmas Eve.

Speaker 1:          09:14          I've spent a lot of lonely ones. Those when I've been away from you and Mary.

Speaker 2:          09:19          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:19          but I've never spent one quite this lonely.

Speaker 2:          09:23          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:23          and one in which the Christmas spirit seems so lacking in the surroundings. Even the first one, if the war with Mary leaving the next day was not so bad as this one, then I had things to worry about and lots of work to do, but here everything is as it has been the same day in day out routine and all I have to think of is how much I miss you and Mary and Suzy and what fund and how comfortable and right

Speaker 2:          09:58          it would be

Speaker 1:          10:00          if we were all spending Christmas Eve and Christmas together. We will have Turkey tomorrow.

Speaker 2:          10:12          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:12          Then some of the men will have received Christmas packages and that will be the extent of our Christmas. There is no peace around us, no peace in our hearts. The Christmas star is an airplane flair. The three wise men, where are they now? There's nothing here, but anger and men's hearts. The wisest men are those who do the best job of killing the enemy while avoiding death themselves. The mangers are corrupt with dead and rotting cattle and the village ends gape at the night through the glass list, windows and tireless roofs. The gifts of the Maggi

Speaker 2:          11:15          are steel and flame and high explosives,

Speaker 1:          11:28          but deep in my heart,

Speaker 2:          11:29          yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:31          I know that peace will come again and families will again be together for God and his son are watching over us and protecting us all as well as we will let them.

Speaker 2:          11:47          So in the hope of tomorrow

Speaker 1:          11:52          then the piece to dear

Speaker 2:          11:54          dad and mom, merry Christmas to you

Speaker 1:          11:59          and a happy and peaceful new year. All my love. Your son Arthur.

Speaker 2:          12:21          Well,

Speaker 1:          12:23          Arthur did not make it home to be with his family again the next day, Christmas 1944 as he was wishing the officers and men of his battalion and Merry Christmas, a German shell hit wounding several of the men and killing Colonel Arthur W. Blair. He was one of the 19,000 Americans killed in the battle of the bulge. Then one of the thousands upon thousands upon thousands that have died for our flag and the ideals of freedom that it represents. Carnal. Blair's executive officer wrote a letter to the family and said, the memory of the kernel is one that will always be kept green by those who knew him, had served with him. He was an outstandingly gallon officer, a fine leader, and above all else, a true gentleman on the field of battle where there can be no sham. He proved it beyond the question of a doubt.

Speaker 2:          14:12          Okay?

Speaker 1:          14:12          And the executive officer signed off the letter quoting Shakespeare when her ratio bid, a final farewell to his friend Hamlet. Now cracks and noble heart. Good night, sweet prince and flights of angels sing the to thy rest, to all those noble souls that left us too young. Third cracked our hearts. We bid you the same goodbye. May flights of angels send you to your arrest. We will remember you always, and we are thinking of you this holiday season. Merry Christmas. Have a happy new year to all and may there be peace on earth.
