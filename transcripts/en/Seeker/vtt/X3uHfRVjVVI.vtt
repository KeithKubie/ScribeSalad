00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.989
So there are only 4 simple pieces to our genetic
code, right?

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:10.080
Cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine, C,
G, A, and T. Well, not anymore folks, not

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.080
anymore.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.080
Now...there are six.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.110
When you actually think about it, trying to
make an entire complex being and all the crazy

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.860
stuff that goes with us (gestures at self)
out of only 4 simple pieces isn’t very efficient.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.350
The proteins that our DNA codes for are themselves
made out of amino acids, of which there are

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.350
only 20.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.440
Isn’t that crazy?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.599
Every living thing is made out of different
combinations of just 20 basic building blocks,

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.730
coded by just FOUR even more basic building
blocks.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.719
So it’s safe to say, scientists have been
dreaming about expanding that toolkit for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.920
a long time.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.019
That’s right.

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.120
We’ve upgraded.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.260
These ‘unnatural’ additions to genetic
code have names like this and this [point

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.559
to TOS] but to simplify things we call them
X and Y.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.840
And this class of synthetic DNA base pairs
are called xeno nucleic acids, or XNA.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.179
Biochemists first started trying to add these
new base pairs to DNA in the 1980s, which

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.629
as you can imagine, is not easy.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.010
Base pair bonding in natural DNA is highly
accurate--A always bonds with T and C always

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.910
bonds with G, but the pairs we’ve added
are harder to get right.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.160
It’s easy for the newbies to mis-pair.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.410
This is because the hydrogen bonds that hold
the two sides of the DNA helix together are

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.540
very weak.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.340
And while they’re enough for the natural
stuff, holding synthetically introduced base

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.000
pairs together properly requires something
a little stronger.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.910
One team has gotten around the bonding problem
by making the new base pairs stick together

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.270
because they’re both hydrophobic, making
them line up properly to bond in an effective

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.270
way.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.280
Others have simply tried to strengthen the
hydrogen bonds by manipulating the structure

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.920
of the unnatural bases.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.840
But that’s really just the first hurdle.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.590
Once you’ve gotten the new base pairs to
stick together, you have to make sure they

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.930
don’t disrupt the rest of the DNA and make
chunks of it nonfunctional.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.710
And then you have to get the cells of whatever
organism you’re adding it to to actually

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.270
accept them and be equipped to produce whatever
these new bases are asking them produce...seems

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.420
like a pretty big headache.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.570
Nature is doing just fine on its own, a master
technician with all its gorgeous cellular

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.420
machinery--why do we want to mess with it
so much?

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.739
Well, because it’s worth it.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.150
We already genetically engineer organisms
like E. coli to produce a desired chemical

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.650
product for us, because their genome is easy
to infiltrate and they reproduce so fast you

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.360
can make industrial quantities of the thing
you want--like insulin, for example.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.959
But, as we’ve discussed, we’re only working
with 20 amino acids to build everything out

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:30.959
of.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.340
Adding in synthetic base pairs could make
it possible for organisms to be able to build

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.019
proteins out of more unusual materials...like
synthetically produced amino acids.

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.200
Maybe, metal-binding ones that would be conductive
or magnetic, making bio-materials that could

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.810
be used in electronics!

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.040
Ok, ok, but aren’t we getting into mutant
superhero territory, here?

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.769
It’s easy to wanna make that leap, but we’re
not quite there.

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.799
Because all of these materials are synthetic--both
the base pairs and any unnatural amino acids

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.010
those base pairs would code an organism to
use--they are obviously not found in nature.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.500
Scientists have to provide these materials
to the organisms in order for the organisms

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.269
to be able to use them...and in most cases,
even to survive.

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.200
If the modified organism doesn’t have the
materials to make these synthetic base pairs,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.319
they just die.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.939
They couldn’t run rogue, Jurassic Park style,
even if they wanted to.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.459
Realistically, we’ll use these new capabilities
to produce new catalysts, which are used to

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.329
improve and speed up chemical experiments.

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.930
And this could radically transform our ability
to engineer and mass produce more effective

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.930
medicines.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.079
With new DNA and new amino acid building blocks,
we have control over what proteins are produced

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.980
at a level of detail we could never have previously
imagined.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.260
It’s like we’ve been trying to cobble
together shoes by hand, but now we have access

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.629
to a state of the art shoe-making factory.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.540
We just have to figure out the blueprint of
the place, and the high-tech security system.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.540
And who knows?

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.950
Maybe the work that it takes to get us where
we want to go in this field will help us better

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.919
understand the lingering mysteries of DNA...like
how it all came to together at the beginning

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.180
of everything to create life.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.389

of DNA manipulation, check out this video

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.389

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.019
And as always, thanks for watching.
