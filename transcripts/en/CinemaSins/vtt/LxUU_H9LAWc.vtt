00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:17.260
Dude! What the f*ck are you doing?
I had to go to the bathroom.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.920
While I’m in the tub?
Well, it was an emergency.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.849
That's not even cool, man. Especially when
we have a whole other bathroom downstairs.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.550
I didn’t think I could make it to the other
one.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.650
It’s 20 paces away!
Well that would have been at least 16 paces

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.230
too many, trust me, and then you’d be mad
at me for making a mess on the floor, alright?

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.050
So, what do you want me to do?
Are you sure you want to do this? I mean…

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.050
there’s a camera right there.
Why are you filming yourself taking a bath?

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.690
I don't think that's any of your business
actually.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.430
I think maybe it is. Can you at least cover
up?

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.300
What?!
Like, cover up, dude. Like, your Johnson right

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.180
in my field of view and I'm trying to do stuff.
My Johnson is identical to your Johnson, dude.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.119
I'm not entirely sure why you would care that
it was in your line of view.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.670
I don’t want people thinking we’re gay
or something.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.090
You say that kind of thing a lot. I’m starting
to think maybe you're a homophobe.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.020
No, I'm not a homophobe, you're a homophobe,
homophobe. You freaking homophobe.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.770
I am not a homophobe.
Yep.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.479
I’m just… straight. I mean, I'm sure if
the right situation presented itself, you

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.939
know, with the right person, you know, I would
go gay.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.859
You would go gay? Who would you go gay for?
Probably like a movie star or a movie character,

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.500
right?
Who in the movies, if you were given a chance,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.229
would you go gay--
Denzel Washington.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.299
You said that kind of fast.
No I didn’t. No I didn't.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.170
Almost as if you’d thought about it before.
I've certainly never thought about going gay

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.170
for Denzel Washington.
Are you sure?

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.479
Or George Clooney.
Dude.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.279
What about you, homophobe?
Dude, I'm not a homophobe.

00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:00.829
Who would you go gay for in the movies.
Man, I don’t know. I’m like, really f*cking

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.790
straight. Like, really straight. It’d have
to be somebody like... Gandalf probably.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.000
Liam Neeson?
No, no, no. Much more incredible than Liam

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.640
Neeson.
Mr. Incredible?

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.300
No, dude, if I'm gonna go gay for a movie
character, it's not gonna be a f*cking cartoon.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.090
It's gonna be somebody magical and powerful,
like Gandalf.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.730
I think I would go gay for Gandalf.
What?

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.372
Yeah. I mean, he’s wise. He’s funny. He’s
got super powers. I mean, what's not to like?

00:02:28.372 --> 00:02:33.020
He’s like a thousand years old, though.
Dude, age ain’t nothing but a number, man.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.060
Besides, that guy travels by eagle, man.
Only when the story calls for it.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.960
I know who I would go gay for. From Life of
Pi. Richard Parker.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.430
The tiger?
Yeah.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.070
Man, he’d tear your face off.
Richard Pah-Kah!

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.330
(flush noise) Alright that's it. I’m coming
in.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.870
There's not even enough room for the two of
us.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.230
You should have thought of that before. Now
I’m naked now.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.400
You didn't even wipe.
No! Richard Parker! No!
