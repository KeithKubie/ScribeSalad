SPEAKER: Without
any further ado,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.800
I would invite Rachael
to come and share

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.450
all the wisdom with us
from her book today.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.240
RACHAEL O'MEARA: Hi, everybody.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.050
Welcome.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.710
This is so weird.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.840
I'm usually the one who's
hosting people at Google

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.439
as a person who helps authors
have their message come out

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.980
in the world.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.570
And today is quite the occasion,
because I actually have

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.920
a book that I get to share.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.370
And today is the official
world premiere, woo!

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.980
I get to say that because it's
actually launching officially

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.479
today.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.900
So you guys in the room and on
the video are like the first

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.010
people in the whole world of
7 billion people to hear about

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.510
"."

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.660
So it's pretty exciting.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.851
I'm really glad you came today.

00:00:57.851 --> 00:00:59.350
And I'm excited to
share my message.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.350
I'm excited to share more
about what's happening

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.000
with "Pause," my story.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.750
I work at Google in
San Francisco usually.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.520
So I'm on a team for the sales
world underneath the platforms

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.410
team called the PDC.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.340
Shout out to them.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.330
Hi, I know you're on video.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.990
And I've been at Google
for nine years, which

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.169
is quite extraordinary
in itself,

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:23.710
and I was at
DoubleClick before that.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.910
So that's all in the book.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.493
I'm not going to get
into it too much.

00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:29.320
But that's a little bit
about me to get started.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.610
And a couple of things
as we go along here.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.850
So I just put this presentation
together last night.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.433
I was like, should
I have some slides?

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:39.250
And knowing I've hosted
authors before, I

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.824
was kind of thinking
like, well, I

00:01:40.824 --> 00:01:42.740
guess for the visual
learners, that'd be good.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.930
And then I put
some sides together

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.638
and realized I didn't
have anything on it

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.080
other than pictures.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.310
So this will be fun.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.840
I'm excited to share.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.270
And all of the quotes
that you'll see today

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.590
are from and in "Pause."

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.110
And they're basically quotes
that really spoke to me,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.930
quotes that I thought
were inspirational

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.552
or really helped
resonate a message.

00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:02.260
And then I put some
quotes up there, too.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.718
So I have a couple
of quotes, and I

00:02:03.718 --> 00:02:08.770
have these on my Facebook
page, and just enjoy

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.200
the pictures and the quotes,
and I think they're great.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.150
So today my whole objective
and my vision is to have fun.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.100
I'm just really excited
to be here, obviously.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.550
And I'll be talking a lot, but
I also want to answer questions.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.070
So we'll leave time for that.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.420
Then we'll talk some more,
and you can get your book.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.320
So there's books
available outside.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.230
Glen's here from Books Inc,
and I put a link on the slides

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.540
so you can see where to
get them if you're online

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.640
or want to get a
book somewhere else.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.684
And just a note
before we jump in--

00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:43.100
this is not a
Google presentation.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.337
And I get to say that
because I'm a Googler.

00:02:46.337 --> 00:02:48.170
And I also want to just
have some fun today.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.330
So no templates, just all
quotes, so have some fun,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.025
and really hopefully
sharing my message.

00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:56.900
And for those of you
who are not in the room,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.210
there's like 100
balloons in here,

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.355
and you've got a couple
here you can see.

00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:03.980
But I'm pretty excited, because
I didn't put the balloons here,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.646
but it seems like
they were meant to be.

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:07.400
So whoever left the
balloons, thank you.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.540
I feel very festive with
the Googly balloons here.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.590
So I saw this meme and I had to
put it into the deck yesterday,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.260
because this is what
I feel like right now.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.780
Well, OK, I'm not
a stormtrooper,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.790
but two of my worlds
colliding here.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.900
I love muppets.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.130
I love "Star Wars."

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.080
But really it's like
my worlds are colliding

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.870
where I'm a Googler
and I'm giving a talk,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.590
and "Pause" is out in the world.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.830
So it's like shit gets real.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.230
And I blocked that out as a
word-- but I just said it,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.520
so it doesn't really matter--

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.200
so that the NC-17 people don't
veto my presentation out there.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.780
But yeah, this is a really
interesting time for me.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.850
And it just feels good.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.650
And it's like, OK, the
worlds are merging.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.370
I've had "Pause."

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.110
I've been writing
it for five years.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.260
And then I've got Google.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.510
I've been here for nine years.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.520
And it's like they've
been separate,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.830
sometimes weaving in and
out, but now it's like, boom,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.700
they're together.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.710
So it's a really cool thing.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.960
And I like that
they're together.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.390
And I don't know about muppets
in stormtrooper outfits,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.750
but you can send me
feedback on that.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.980
I did not create that meme.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.230
It was on the web.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.240
So here's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.160
We'll be talking about
my story, and then I've

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.740
got some parts of what
we'll talk about today

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.279
that are in "Pause."

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.529
We'll even do a demo.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.070
And I kind of use the
demo as a joke as a term,

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.290
but the idea is that I
want to experience pausing

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.630
and take you through
something today

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.270
that I think will be
helpful for all of us.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.580
And just a really
quick experiential--

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.190
I'm all about the
experience of what

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.609
you can do to intentionally
shift your behavior.

00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:42.400
So we'll talk about
the five signs you need

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.030
to pause, the types of pauses.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.520
I'll take you through what
I think mental flossing is,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.290
and this technique I
came up with called

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.290
TASERing for your
limiting beliefs,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.610
and why all this matters.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.050
Why do we need to pause?

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.800
Maybe you know already, but I'll
give you my version of that.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.850
And then keeping it Googly--

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.640
that's for all the Googlers--
next steps and AIs,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.760
because we're so
action oriented here.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.770
Really what that means is
takeaways or something else.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.170
So my story-- hopefully you can
read the quotes up here, too.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.420
So a lot of everything
I'm going to say

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.780
is pretty much in "Pause" today.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.000
So what I want to share the
most is basically my story.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.110
So back in 2011, I'd been
at Google about five years.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.520
And I was in a role in
the gTech community, which

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:41.000
is our internal customer service
team, and I wasn't doing well.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.620
For whatever reason things
weren't going great.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.040
I was kind of in this rut.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.170
I was burning out.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.940
And how many people,
just show of hands,

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.169
has ever felt that way?

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.960
Like in a burned out
state, or just rotten,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.501
you can't figure
out what's going on?

00:05:54.501 --> 00:05:56.150
You're like, what's going on?

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.250
I feel like I'm doing
OK, but for whatever

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.730
reason things aren't working.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.960
So in the room a lot
of hands were raised.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.520
And the idea is that--

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.620
I wasn't about effort.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.590
I really wanted to do well, but
I was kind of new in the role.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.850
About six months in, managing
a team of customer support

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.670
people, and things
weren't going great.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.750
I was getting feedback that my
performance wasn't doing well.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.640
My performance was suffering.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.780
And I actually had this whole
list of things to improve upon,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.570
which were very tactical
and helpful for me.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.120
So I had this plan in place.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.920
Hold on a second, I
got some water here.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.480
And I didn't know what to do.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.230
Everything I was trying,
I was like, today

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.890
is going to be different.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.560
I'm going to go in there and
my meetings will be different.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.850
I'll communicate effectively.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:46.810
I'll be more present.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.570
I'll have other things to share.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.600
And to whatever effect, I
just kept feeling burned out.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.910
And my mental state was one
where I was feeding myself

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.460
stories that things
would never get better,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.310
or that I wasn't doing well.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.140
Tapes, I call them,
played in my mind.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.080
Like, Rachael,
there you go again.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.250
Why are you even bothering?

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.930
Or why don't you
just quit today?

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.540
Or you're a failure.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.230
So all of this was going on.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.740
And I reached a point where
my manager was basically like,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.530
this isn't a fit for you.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.540
And that is one of
the signs, by the way,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.210
that you need a pause
when someone tells you

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.620
it's not working out.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.770
So I was faced with a choice.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.070
And I went home that day,
it was a Friday afternoon.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.300
And I went home riding my
bike home in San Francisco.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.440
And I was like, what do I do?

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.100
Do I quit?

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.050
Do I just keep trying?

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.390
And I think I like
Google, but I don't know.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.220
And my mental state
just wasn't in a place

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.590
to really think clearly.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.320
So what happened
was I got on a Skype

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.070
that weekend with a couple
girlfriends and someone

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.740
suggested that Google might have
this leave of absence program.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.830
And I was like,
oh, that's right.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.080
They do have a leave
of absence program.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.650
I should look into that.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.650
And so that weekend
I spent researching

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.920
the leave of absence
program and made a case

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.760
to take three months
of unpaid leave.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.890
And so Monday morning
I came back to Google,

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.480
and I made the
request to my manager.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.320
And she was as
surprised as I had

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.060
been to learn that
we had a program,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.780
or that that would be a good
idea, and said, that sounds

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.299
like a good fit as well.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.320
Let me take it to HR and see
if we can get it approved.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.520
And what happened was
I got it approved.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.809
And this was the
beginning of what

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:47.150
I would call my pause, which I
define as any intentional shift

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.700
in behavior.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.100
So it doesn't mean it's a
long-term break like I had,

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.630
but it can be.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:58.970
So I ended up taking three
months of unpaid leave in--

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.310
it was the summer of 2011.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.760
And the terms were that I would
come back to Google, ideally,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.280
but I wouldn't be
in the same role,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.250
and I would hire a
replacement when I returned.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.460
And so all of that happened
before I left, which was great.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.755
I had about a month
and a half to do that.

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.630
And I didn't know if I
was going to come back

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.515
to Google, actually.

00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:20.930
And I just really
had no idea, other

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.230
than I knew I needed to
move into a new state,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.390
and I couldn't continue
as things were going.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.560
It wasn't effective for me,
and I really wasn't happy.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.560
So that's a little bit
about the background

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.880
of how this all happened.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.854
And looking back now, five years
ago, if I had known any of this

00:09:39.854 --> 00:09:41.270
would have been
the case, and this

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.532
would be how things
have turned out,

00:09:43.532 --> 00:09:44.990
I would have been
really surprised.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.200
Because I was just
about the end of my rope

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.520
and not sure what to
do and what happened.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.420
So that three months of
unpaid break was me unwinding.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.791
It was me kind of reassessing
where I wanted to go.

00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:01.790
I didn't know if I was
on the right career path.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.520
I didn't know if I
should stay at Google,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.520
but I was pretty
sure I liked Google.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.671
And it was really this
unknown time for me.

00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:12.920
And it was the first time
in my life for a few things.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.200
And one of them was to
really be with myself.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.200
Meaning, looking at my
career, looking at who I was,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.390
and being like, is
this what I want?

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.000
Is this the path that
I want to stay on?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.490
And so that led to a whole
other bunch of discoveries--

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.360
many, many discoveries
since then.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.290
So the good news is that was
the opening, I'll call it,

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.110
kind of the first doorway
that I walked through.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.960
And then that led
to a lot more that

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.710
ended up happening
as I did return

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.614
to Google in September of 2011.

00:10:41.614 --> 00:10:43.030
And I looked for
a new role, and I

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.894
got a new job, which is the job
that I have now and the team

00:10:46.894 --> 00:10:47.560
that I'm on now.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.610
So that is my story
in a nutshell.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:59.120
And so since then I came
back to Google, and maybe

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.180
about eight months
later, I started

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.680
thinking about wanting
to share my story.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.650
And I didn't really
know how to do it,

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.070
but I started to
write a document which

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.750
later became the book.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.600
And one of the first
themes I captured

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.650
was, how do you know if you need
this so-called break, or pause,

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.630
or a shift in behavior?

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.030
So I came up with
these five signs.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.400
And each of these
signs, the idea

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.152
is that you might have one
of these happen to you,

00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:29.110
or maybe all five of them
have happened to you.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.230
In my case-- and I'll go
over them in a second--

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.820
I think I had all of
them happen to me.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.690
So I kind of did the tally and
decided that, yeah, this is

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.110
a good way that you can pause.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.780
So I'll walk you
through the five signs.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.540
The first sign is you
used to love your job,

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.760
and now you loathe it.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.040
Pretty self-explanatory, right?

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.880
I thought so.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.810
So that was my case.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.350
I used to really enjoy being
at my work in the day to day.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.030
And all of a sudden
it was like, just

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.040
things weren't going
great, and I didn't even

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.465
want to be there anymore.

00:12:02.465 --> 00:12:03.590
So that was the first sign.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:10.550
Second sign, you
know need a break,

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.235
and you used to love your job,
and then your manager tells you

00:12:14.235 --> 00:12:15.110
it's not working out.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.870
I mentioned that this
one was also experienced.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.285
So this might come as a
really direct message.

00:12:20.285 --> 00:12:22.201
It could be something
you hear in the hallway.

00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:24.080
It might be something
a coworker says to you,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.570
or even a friend who's like,
you sound miserable there.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.370
What's going on?

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:32.330
But in my case, I call it
the proverbial pink slip.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.560
But basically, it was my manager
having a heart to heart with me

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.080
and saying this really
wasn't a fit for me.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.240
And at the end looking
back, and even at the time,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.060
I knew she was right.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.350
So that's the second sign.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.580
And the third sign is that you
have a technology intervention

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.860
from a friend, or someone
who really cares about you,

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.440
or even just knows you
as an acquaintance.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.080
And we can all probably
identify with that one.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.170
The idea is that if you're
on your phone all the time,

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.420
or you're missing
out on relationships

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.006
because you're tethered
to a laptop, and I was.

00:13:06.006 --> 00:13:07.380
I was tethered to
my email, and I

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.170
would be checking it
like Sunday afternoons

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.820
to get ready for Monday.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.530
That's a sign.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.390
And if it's interfering
with how you

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.425
are with other people, or
your family, or other ways

00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:19.800
that you want to
be in the world,

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.930
then that's a telltale
sign, in my opinion.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.790
And the fourth sign is
that there is an overcoming

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.500
challenge that you face.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.380
And this could be something
like a health challenge,

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.400
or a family member
that has become someone

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.880
that you need to be paying more
attention to, or ill, or sick,

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.110
or something like that.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.910
Could be a layoff.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.590
But basically in
adversity-- something

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.007
that you're faced
with that isn't

00:13:46.007 --> 00:13:48.340
exactly what you'd planned,
and you got to deal with it.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.910
So who can relate to that one?

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.280
Yeah, I think that one's
a pretty common one.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.910
And then the last one is
that there is actually

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.400
an opportunity that comes up.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.490
So this one can be in
multiple different ways.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.740
But the idea is that there might
be some nagging opportunity

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.370
that you want to pursue,
or an idea that you

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.820
have to follow through with.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.080
It might be something as easy as
a class that you want to take.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.610
But it could be something like
a weekend with a friend who's

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.130
been wanting you to go for
years on a certain trip.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.414
It might be an idea to have
a business that you start.

00:14:26.414 --> 00:14:28.330
It could be a whole bunch
of different things.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.830
And so the idea is
that, again, this

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.480
is an intentional
shift in behavior.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.150
So if this is something
that's going on,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.910
and you kind of think about
things, more than even a couple

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.550
of times a day, then
that might be a good sign

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.230
to know that a
pause is something

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.540
that could be helpful.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.290
So those are the five
signs, and I kind of

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.680
went through them quickly.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.530
But the idea is if you
go through each one

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:47.988
of those mentally
and give yourself

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:51.399
a point for any of those,
if you score a one, that

00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:52.690
means you're doing pretty well.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.751
But if you have maybe even
more than two, two or more,

00:14:55.751 --> 00:14:57.750
chances are a pause would
be a really good idea.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.360
And the good news is
everyone can pause.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.560
And that's a big
message I have today

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.560
is that it's not about
this long extended break.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.490
This is literally about
being intentional and being

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.770
with yourself to know what
you need to do for you.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:11.760
Whatever works for you.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.765
Whether you've got resources
like time, or money,

00:15:14.765 --> 00:15:16.140
or activity, and
all of those are

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.527
levers that you can play with.

00:15:18.527 --> 00:15:20.610
So there's many different
types of pauses to have,

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.590
and I mention this right there.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.640
So they can go from
a simple thing,

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.880
like following your breath.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.380
And how many people here do any
types of mindful meditation?

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.860
Or just-- yeah, a lot
of hands are going up--

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.080
ways that you can practice
being in the moment

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.880
and being with yourself?

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.090
And that might mean a walk where
you're being really mindful

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.350
around the block.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.540
Or it might be a
conversation that's

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.760
more engaging than what
you would normally do.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.530
Having a deeper
level of engagement

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.870
with a person other
than yourself.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.460
All of those I consider pauses.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.420
Again, it's an intentional
shift in behavior.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.900
Other ideas for pausing,
so digital device pausing.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.470
So this is a big one.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.250
So digital device
pausing, if there

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.460
is an idea where you think
you're on your phone too much,

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.220
or you're checking it when
you go to the bathroom,

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.332
or you are sleeping with
it under your pillow,

00:16:14.332 --> 00:16:15.040
things like that.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.220
I think they are
actually real cases.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.270
And the idea is that
that's OK, but make sure

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.850
that the boundaries that you
have for those digital devices

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.440
are in service to you.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.310
So is it taking
you away from being

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.990
with others or the moment?

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.670
Or you're not really, fully
present in one activity?

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.040
So digital device pauses
are a big, big deal.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.259
And more than ever,
they matter, and you

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:39.300
can experiment with that.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.660
So it might be setting
up a rule for yourself.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.537
I'm a big fan of rules so you
can get into some boundaries

00:16:46.537 --> 00:16:47.370
and creating things.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.200
So not checking your
phone after 9:00 PM,

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.960
or staying off social
media on the weekends.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.330
That's one I actually recently
started, and I liked it.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.870
Although, it won't be
happening right now.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.490
Then you can expand from there.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.140
So there's other
ways you can pause.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.280
And if you have time to
do it for more than a day,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.979
or it could be a
weekend, or a week.

00:17:06.979 --> 00:17:08.520
And then there's
the extended pauses,

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.240
like I had for three
months, which is amazing.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.329
And not a lot of us have
that luxury, I know.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.339
There's actually a
statistic from the Society

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:21.660
of Human Resource Management
that says about 14% to 15%

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.770
of global companies allow
for unpaid or paid breaks.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.500
There's only 4% of companies
that have paid breaks.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.010
So knowing that's not an
option for a lot of us,

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.220
my point is that you can
pause and integrate that

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:35.970
through your life.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.720
It doesn't have to be
a long type of break

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.510
that you need to take.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.926
And then the other type of
pause is the unintended pause.

00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:46.300
So this is when
you get laid off,

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.410
or you have this huge shift that
you weren't planning to have.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.397
And I think a lot of
us go through this

00:17:52.397 --> 00:17:53.480
at some point in our life.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.000
But the idea is that it's
easy to get stuck in a victim

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.440
mentality, or maybe just sulk
around, and now say, well,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.220
now what?

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.890
But the actual idea is if
you are intentional about it,

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.910
that time is an amazing gift
that you can have for yourself

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.010
and choose how you want
to live differently.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.990
It might be during that time,
or it might be shifting careers,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.990
or it might be looking
for something that really

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.150
does align with you more.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.510
So those are all types
of pauses and great ways

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.230
to integrate intentional
shifts in behavior.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.200
And there's even a thing
called mini pauses.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.710
I write about these in the book
from Dr. David King Keller.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.340
He did a PhD on pausing, which
is pretty cool, in my opinion.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.690
And there's a couple
exercises in the book,

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.976
and maybe we'll do one
of those in the demo.

00:18:40.976 --> 00:18:42.530
Hey, look at that.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.880
So next we're going to
try one of these out.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.904
And we're a little limited,
because we're here in the room.

00:18:49.904 --> 00:18:51.320
But if you're with
me in the room,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.510
go ahead and just get
comfortable, and maybe

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.960
put your feet on the floor.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.043
If you're not in the room
and you're watching this

00:18:57.043 --> 00:18:59.540
at home or at work,
do the same thing,

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.630
follow along, and try
how this is for you.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.750
So we're going to try
one of these micro pauses

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.200
from Dr. Keller.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.900
And what we're going to do is--

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.620
I think it's called
the two palm pause.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.070
So go ahead and
I'll face this way.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:18.280
Put your two hands up about
six inches from your nose

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.405
and notice your hands.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:32.500
Scanning them for the
texture, lines, color.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.890
Notice your breathing.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.810
And go ahead and
put your hands down.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.540
How did that feel?

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.980
Did anyone notice a shift?

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.420
I did.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.430
Yeah, so that's literally a 30
second pause that you can take.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.440
And it really does wonders.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.960
And then there's a couple
more like that that he has.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.120
And then my favorite go-to
is just following the breath.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.000
So you can go ahead
and put one hand

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.520
on your belly or your
stomach, go ahead

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:19.670
and inhale, [INHALES]
and exhale, [EXHALES]

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:20.670
and do it one more time.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:26.750
Inhale through your nose,
[INHALES] [EXHALES] Exhale

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.250
your mouth.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.670
And you can close your
eyes or open your eyes.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.963
We'll take one more.

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:38.050
[INHALES] [EXHALES] Go
ahead and open your eyes.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.030
So that's the
daily breath pause.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.140
And again, that took
maybe 30 seconds.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.530
And every chapter I have
exercises that you can try that

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.950
are related to pausing
or journaling exercises.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.410
And the idea is that you
can increase that time,

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.890
or go up to 10 breaths
and count to 10,

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.270
and increase your
skill level in it.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.620
It's actually more like
lifting weights at the gym.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.910
So those are some really
quick demos that we just did.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.460
But the idea is that, again,
it's about what works for you.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.170
So as you decide and think
about what kind of pausing

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:18.010
would resonate with you-- it
might be things to do outside.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.450
It might be journaling.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.760
It might be these micro pauses.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.360
It could be a solo
retreat for yourself,

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.790
as scary as that might sound.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.820
All of those are
options, and I encourage

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.310
you to look at
what works for you

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.970
and see what would really
resonate and then try it.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.450
Because the idea is that
everything is an experiment.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.060
And in the book, I talk about
Dr. Carol Dweck and her growth

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.190
mindset research.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.350
Has anyone heard of
Carol and her research?

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.831
I think most of us here have.

00:21:48.831 --> 00:21:49.330
Yeah.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.470
So the idea is that if
you bring your curiosity,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:58.300
and an open mind, and that
childlike understanding

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.000
of what can I learn here--
learning and growing?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.822
Then you will likely
learn or grow.

00:22:04.822 --> 00:22:07.030
And if you have that fixed
mindset, it's not so easy,

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.820
and you kind of shut
down and are closed off.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.830
So I invite you to bring your--

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.980
I call it the pause
mindset, as well.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:20.260
So it's this idea of being open
to ideas and then acting on it.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.570
So those are a couple of
demos, and they're in the book

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.590
as well.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:31.917
Another idea that
I have for pausing,

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:33.750
and I talk a lot about
this, where we've got

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.882
limiting beliefs in our world.

00:22:35.882 --> 00:22:38.340
And a lot of what I've been
studying at the Wright Graduate

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:43.110
University in Chicago, the
Wright Foundation with Bob

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.990
and Judith Wright is about
what are our belief systems,

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.940
and where do we operate from?

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.150
Because each of us have these
in our minds, in our heads,

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.440
and it's how we see the world.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.760
So this technique I call
the TASER technique,

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.580
and I think of it like mental
flossing is kind of the overlay

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.080
here.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.692
Where think of
like dental floss,

00:23:03.692 --> 00:23:05.650
and you're kind of going
in between your teeth.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.680
I'm a big flosser.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.850
I don't know if we got
any self-devoted flossers

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:09.460
in the room.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.659
But if you are in
there and getting

00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:13.200
in between the
grooves in your teeth,

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.589
you're cleaning out the gunk.

00:23:14.589 --> 00:23:16.380
And we can't really do
that with our minds,

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.780
because they're obviously
not accessible that way.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.370
God knows what would happen.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.490
But you can think
of it metaphorically

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.690
and know that when you
are mental flossing,

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.020
you can have the same effect.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.280
So that means being conscious
about what your thoughts are

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.660
and what your beliefs are.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.610
So TASERing is an
acronym, and it

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:43.050
stands for Tune In, Acknowledge,
Shift, Express, and Repeat.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.720
So the idea is that
any belief that you

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.370
have that you don't
think is accurate--

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.480
so we'll do this together.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.880
So go ahead and think
about so far your day,

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.200
and maybe you've got an hour
that you've been in traffic,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.520
or you're late and
you potentially

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.150
had an argument with a
partner, or anything like that.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.980
Go ahead and what
was the thought that

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.220
went through your mind
about you as a belief?

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.830
In my case, I was
preparing for the talk.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.780
I was looking at
emails for my job.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.670
And I was like, why am I
looking at emails for my job?

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.540
I'm not prepared.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.310
I'm not enough.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.310
That's a big one for me.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.643
So that's a belief that I have--

00:24:21.643 --> 00:24:23.570
I'm not enough.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.490
So if I were to take and
apply the TASER technique--

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.450
and think of TASER like a
zap, like these stun guns.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.530
So T is Tune In.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.520
So, oh, OK, so my belief
is I'm not enough.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.730
OK, well, that's great.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:37.710
Acknowledge it.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.210
OK.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.502
So that's my belief.

00:24:39.502 --> 00:24:40.460
And I'm not judging it.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.044
I'm not like, there I go again.

00:24:42.044 --> 00:24:43.460
There's not really
a critic there,

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.760
but it's just acknowledging
that and simply knowing that.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.680
And shift is, what
is the new belief

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.320
that I would want to replace
that with in this outdated

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.320
system I have in my mental map?

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.560
So my shift would be
pretty much the opposite

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.150
of what my belief is,
which would be, what is it?

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.514
I am enough.

00:25:03.514 --> 00:25:04.555
Yeah, it's really simple.

00:25:04.555 --> 00:25:06.750
It's just pretty
much the opposite.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.570
And it's about me.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:08.350
It's not about somebody else.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:09.250
It's about me.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.560
So, oh, I am enough.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.360
And then expressing
that is either

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.160
saying it under my breath.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.410
It depends on where I am,
but I could say it out loud.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.640
I am enough.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.117
Like I am right now,
so this is pretty cool.

00:25:21.117 --> 00:25:22.700
Or I could be writing
it in a journal.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.780
And the idea is
when we express, we

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.250
are creating new mental
maps in our brains.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:31.916
The neuroplasticity is there
so that we can change the way

00:25:31.916 --> 00:25:33.040
that our minds are working.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.910
And over time as we
repeat this, the R,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.740
we're creating new
ways of thinking,

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.425
and new ways of
being, and new habits.

00:25:40.425 --> 00:25:42.050
And it's not going
to happen overnight.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.764
This is a long haul process.

00:25:44.764 --> 00:25:46.930
But the idea is that if we
actually become conscious

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.240
of this-- and this is
one tool you can use--

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.130
then you might actually
be able to shift

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.420
some things around that are
in better service to you.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.050
And so that you end up
feeling more satisfied or not

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.170
as in that mental
mind tailspin like I

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.720
did when I was in
my burnout phase

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.190
at Google a couple of years ago.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.470
So that's one tool.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.070
And I invite you all to give it
a try today at least one more

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.760
time.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.260
OK.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.718
So we're not done
yet, but I wanted

00:26:15.718 --> 00:26:19.300
to just go ahead and actually
answer any questions that you

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.250
have that have come up so far.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.600
AUDIENCE: So thank you
for mentioning those five

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.070
identifiers of when
someone needs a pause

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.290
and then doing a pause.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:34.240
So should there be a
pre-conception before the pause

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.960
that what should one
achieve after that,

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.037
or should it be open ended?

00:26:38.037 --> 00:26:38.870
RACHAEL O'MEARA: OK.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.119
So the question is,
should it be open ended?

00:26:42.119 --> 00:26:43.660
It's a good question,
because I think

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.270
that's the first
question we all have.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.500
We want to jump to, well,
what does this mean?

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.080
And do I need to
have it figured out?

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.540
And I know that was my question.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.790
And I didn't, and I was kind
of freaking out about it,

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.500
because I didn't know
what would happen.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.480
So I call this
the pause paradox.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.130
And the idea is that we're
taking a step back to be,

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.500
and not be so busy, or do.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:11.420
And our human mind
type A thinker brains

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.520
want to figure everything
out really quickly.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.085
And so the paradox is you've
got all this time, why would

00:27:17.085 --> 00:27:18.710
you not want to figure
it out and think

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.580
about things as you reflect
or you shift your behavior?

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.550
And my thought is I think it's
good to have broad strokes.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:28.370
I think it's healthy
and a really good thing

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.260
to do to set your intention.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.140
So what do I want to have
come out of my weekend

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.570
as I reflect on my career shift?

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:40.640
Or what are the three
things I feel like I

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.410
want to do more with my family?

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.760
And that's intention.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.060
Those are changes.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.850
So I think broad
strokes are really good.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.808
And then I think the
little things, like, well,

00:27:48.808 --> 00:27:51.410
how am I going to do that?

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.480
What are the 10 things
I need to do today

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.680
to make sure that I stay on
track are maybe not as good.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.270
And again, it's an experiment.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.280
So I think it will be
different for all of us.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.050
And I think it depends
on what works for you.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.510
But I invite all of you
to actually not plan,

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.560
because I think it's easy for
our brains to get into that.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.500
And the whole gift and
the magic of a pause

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.160
is maybe being out
of your comfort zone

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.050
and not controlling everything.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.110
Potentially it could be to let
the magic happen, as I say.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:25.320
Like being out of your
comfort zone is scary.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.370
And we have a lot of
fear in our own heads

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:32.000
that prevent us from wanting to
do that based on just safety,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.370
and the psychological
safety of wanting

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.090
to know what's comfortable.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.410
So when we start
letting things just go,

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.110
we kind of want to go into a
panic mode or change things.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.600
But in general, I'd say,
well, why not just be and not

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.057
have a big plan?

00:28:48.057 --> 00:28:49.640
And if you set your
intention and know

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.910
what you want out of it, I think
that's a really good way to go.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.960
Because you kind of have a
guide that lay on the horizon,

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.930
but you don't have to have
all the minutia steps.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.900
And then that's the routine that
we know, and where most of us

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.564
are used to.

00:29:03.564 --> 00:29:05.480
So you're going to really
change a whole bunch

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.021
if you're in that
routine and wanting

00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:09.200
to stick to what you know.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.630
But I think it's a experiment.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.220
Good question.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.180
Yep?

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.030
AUDIENCE: You said that you
were working pretty hard putting

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.630
in all the efforts
before you took a pause,

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:26.340
and after pause you
said that you are happy

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.840
and you are satisfied.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.210
So what were the key things in
your day-to-day life changed?

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:37.260
What type of approaches
changed towards your work

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.370
that you felt the other way?

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:45.210
RACHAEL O'MEARA: Yeah, what
were the things that changed?

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:50.010
So in my case, I took
this three months break.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.720
And I knew I needed
to take myself out

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.550
of the system, which
was work at the time,

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:59.270
and allow my self
some new space.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.530
So I did that.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:05.150
And what happened was
I learned a few things

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.820
about how to be present for me.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:12.800
Meaning, how do I
engage with someone else

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.220
and really see them eye to
eye, like have eye contact,

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.740
and appreciate the
conversation I'm

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.770
having in the moment with them?

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.420
And I didn't really
do that before.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.800
To be fully honest, I
think I just surface

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.320
level engaged with people.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:35.510
And I didn't have that
presence, and so there wasn't

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:36.920
a lot of meaning there for me.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.190
Meaning, I wasn't
getting satisfied.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.380
I think I was settling
for conversations

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.587
that were OK and good.

00:30:44.587 --> 00:30:45.920
And this was in my relationship.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.560
This was with
friends and at work.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.410
But when I took it
to a deeper level,

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.434
and really wanted
to be with someone,

00:30:53.434 --> 00:30:55.100
and see someone eye
to eye, and be like,

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.822
wow, I'm really noticing I'm
enjoying this conversation.

00:30:58.822 --> 00:31:00.530
I'm learning something
about this person.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.270
That's pretty cool.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:06.146
It allowed me to feel more.

00:31:06.146 --> 00:31:07.520
And I think that
was a big shift.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.728
I didn't know it at the time.

00:31:08.728 --> 00:31:11.300
And since then, I've done
some personal development work

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.610
in emotional intelligence.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:15.927
So I know now that
was what happened.

00:31:15.927 --> 00:31:17.510
But I think it was
being more present.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.259
Honestly, that was
like the simple answer.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.020
And then I did a few
things on the break,

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.190
too, that helped me
align with my strengths.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.030
So I took the strengths
finder assessment,

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:34.490
which is in the book from
Tom Rath and the Gallup poll

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:35.330
people.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:38.020
And I aligned with
what my strengths were,

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.680
so I actually felt happier
because I was working.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.020
And I decided to go into sales
because I actually just thought

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.780
that I would be better managing
relationships and creating

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.010
relationships.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:52.580
And I was also asking my friends
what they thought I was good at

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.670
and similar messages
started appearing--

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:59.870
like you're a great networker,
you're a great communicator.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.490
It actually was not
the same feedback

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.990
that I'd gotten in the job,
which was very affirming to me.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.460
So a lot of it was
actually self-affirmation,

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.720
self-validated intimacy, which
is David Schnarch's term, which

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.630
I quote and cite in the book.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.890
But it was about
feeling good for myself,

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.590
and I had never really
done that before in a level

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.430
that changed how I
thought about things.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.180
So I think it was a
combination of things.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.340
Essentially feeling
more present,

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.140
and then allowing myself
to be affirmed, and feeling

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:32.834
affirmed, and enjoying the
moments, and feeling happier.

00:32:32.834 --> 00:32:34.500
Whether it was someone
I was talking to,

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.560
or the job that I was
really aligned with that

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.255
played to my strengths more.

00:32:39.255 --> 00:32:43.070
So that's kind of what I think.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.840
So what is the point?

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.160
Why are we here?

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.460
What does pausing
really lead us to?

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:56.030
And I think it's similar to
the more broader mindfulness

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:59.660
question of being more
present with myself.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.040
But the idea is that if
I can shift my behavior--

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.540
so getting away from the
pause language a little bit--

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.190
if I'm just talking about
choosing to be different,

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:09.440
and that's all this really is.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.950
This is my choice, your
choice, our choice to change.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:18.650
And if I can actually not
have a knee-jerk reaction-- so

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:21.200
deciding to take that
three-month unpaid leave,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.330
that was a long pause.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.880
But if I just choose
to be different and act

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.680
in a different way,
taking some time,

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.250
the idea is that new
ideas might emerge,

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:35.100
new ways of being might emerge,
new thoughts might emerge.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:40.180
And I can change my behavior to
align with what matters to me.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.240
I'll say that again because
it's really important.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.680
If you're out there and things
aren't really going great

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.870
for you, or you want
to change in some way--

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:52.150
maybe one of those
five signs happened,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.910
maybe you're feeling an itch
to just do something different,

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.560
or you're not
feeling satisfied--

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.890
satisfied is a really
key part of this--

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:00.970
you can pause.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.060
And shifting that behavior
can allow new things

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.970
to emerge for you, whether
it's ways of being,

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:11.199
or ways of behaving, or engaging
with others, or relationships,

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:13.330
career, all of that.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:17.949
And you can lead a more
satisfied and meaningful life.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:20.949
And my teachers in Chicago,
Judith and Bob Wright,

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:23.090
this is their huge
message and theme

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.929
that I continually
learn from them.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:27.239
And if I'm with myself--

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.620
meaning I'm emotionally present.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.420
I can feel my feelings.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.219
I know I'm in joy,
or I'm in fear.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:33.790
I'm in anger.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:34.510
I'm in sadness.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:35.440
I'm in hurt.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.639
And I can just be with that.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:39.190
And that's difficult.
It's not easy.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:43.989
I'm able to be more with
others and feel more satisfied.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:47.199
Because I know that I'm here,
and these beliefs are changing.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:49.239
And I have-- I know I matter.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.190
I know I'm good enough.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.150
I am enough.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:52.800
I'm loved.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.389
I can connect.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:57.620
And these are topics
called yearnings, which I

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.900
won't get into too much today.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.779
But my mentor, Judith
Wright, this is her research.

00:35:02.779 --> 00:35:04.570
But when we go and
satisfy these yearnings,

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.587
then we do lead more
meaningful and satisfied lives.

00:35:07.587 --> 00:35:09.670
And a lot of the time,
we're so busy in our heads.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:13.930
We are living, like I
historically was, from my neck

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:15.684
up.

00:35:15.684 --> 00:35:17.100
We don't tune into
that, and we've

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.080
learned over time to
maybe shut it down or not

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.800
pay attention to it.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.050
And that's OK.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:23.550
But the idea is
that you probably

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.410
aren't going to
get too satisfied

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:31.590
or feel a lot to know what
really makes you come alive.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.510
And isn't that why
we're all here?

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:36.210
Isn't that why we're
on this planet?

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.750
And not to just be kind
of chumming through life?

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.520
And I talk about
this in the book--

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.094
I have three types of people.

00:35:44.094 --> 00:35:45.510
I kind of sum it
up this way where

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:50.880
there's pausers, sleepers,
and pause helpers, I think.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.240
And so pausers are the folks who
choose to intentionally shift

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.720
their behavior.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.170
And this can come in a
number of different ways.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.640
There's sleepers.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.480
So I think I had the
word zombie at first,

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.570
and I was like, that's
probably not a nice term.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.640
So sleepers are folks I think
who sleepwalk through life.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.455
And this was me.

00:36:11.455 --> 00:36:13.330
Even though I was a
national rowing champion,

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.430
and I was a huge
achiever, I wasn't

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.899
on a level of really
being emotionally present.

00:36:17.899 --> 00:36:20.190
And I'm probably being pretty
hard on myself right now,

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.830
but I take it with
a grain of salt.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:26.760
So sleepers maybe wake
up and pause one day.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.200
Or maybe there is
a pause helper.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.690
So pause helper is the
third type of person

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.665
where they potentially get you.

00:36:32.665 --> 00:36:34.290
If you tell them
you're taking a pause,

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:35.980
they're not going
to shut you down.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.910
Or there might be
a way that they're

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.550
encouraging and supporting
you in whatever you're

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.120
go through in life.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.780
And so I think
there's ways you can

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.240
transition between any three
of those groups for sure.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.936
And maybe go back and forth
throughout your lifetime.

00:36:50.936 --> 00:36:53.310
But the idea is that when you
can pause and intentionally

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.707
shift your behavior to generate
ways of being that are new,

00:36:56.707 --> 00:36:58.290
or emotions that
come up that are new,

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:01.500
or new thoughts that you have.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.820
That can shift your life
in a big way, like mine.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.430
So my life has shifted, but
these are little changes

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.240
over time, as well.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.823
They don't have to
be this long break.

00:37:10.823 --> 00:37:12.990
So if you decide to turn
your phone off at 8:00 PM

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.101
every night, now you've
got another hour.

00:37:15.101 --> 00:37:17.100
And that doesn't mean
you're on Netflix an hour.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.020
You're like a lump on the couch.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.600
But you're actually engaged
with meaningful conversation

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.100
with others.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.190
Because I'm meeting
my connection needs,

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:29.080
and I'm feeling affirmed
and validated again.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:33.420
Those things add up, and they
allow you to be more present

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.420
and feel more.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:38.260
And again, this is all going
back to being more satisfied.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.790
And if we're kind of floating
through life being a sleeper,

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.120
it's not so satisfying.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.117
And it is on some level if
you want to rationalize that,

00:37:47.117 --> 00:37:49.450
but think about what could
happen, or what could change.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:52.080
What could change if you
decided to intentionally shift

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.490
your behavior?

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:56.260
And that's kind of
the whole point.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.660
So that leads us
to a pause plan.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.160
And the idea is that anyone
can create their own pause

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.040
plan that works for you.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.190
And a pause plan is
really just what would you

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.340
want to do to start pausing?

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.090
What would you want
to intentionally shift

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.340
for your behavior?

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.920
It can be a little
small tweak in your day.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.970
It could be looking at your
two palms for 30 seconds today.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.914
It could be having
a conversation

00:38:24.914 --> 00:38:26.830
that you've been wanting
to have for two years

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:29.150
and you've been putting off.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:31.140
And the book is
filled with really

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.350
how you can decide
what works for you.

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.430
And I talk about
the pause dashboard,

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.490
which is three
levers that we all

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:39.930
have and we can kind of adjust.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.580
So whether you've
got $1 million,

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.510
or $1, or zero dollars, or
all the time in the world,

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:49.140
or five seconds, the idea
is that you can create

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.630
a plan that works for you.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:53.610
So the three levers are--

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.500
really the first one
is money, finances.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.940
So if you wanted to
really dive in and take

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:04.470
this high-end type of pause,
you can, but you don't have to.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.362
And pausing isn't about luxury
vacations, although it can be.

00:39:08.362 --> 00:39:10.320
But it allows you to
think about what could you

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.079
do based on your budget?

00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:13.620
And I actually have
a whole worksheet

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.110
on this if you wanted to look
at plugging in some numbers,

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.710
and it's on my site
and in the book.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:24.730
And the next one is, we
did finances, so activity.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.560
So what do you want to do?

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.060
And pausing isn't about the
quantity of time at all.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.140
If you've heard that 100
times in different ways,

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.530
that's the case.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.690
Pausing about the
quality of time,

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:38.250
and based on what
you'd want to do.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.230
So this is where you
get to choose again

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.440
what you want to do.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.760
So it could be that
walk in the park.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.730
And ideally, you get out of
your comfort zone a little bit.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.190
Maybe it's actually trying
to meditate if you've never

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.740
tried it, and decided
always that you

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.022
don't have time for it.

00:39:54.022 --> 00:39:54.730
Well, guess what?

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.680
If you brought your
growth mindset,

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.910
maybe this is a curious thing
for you, and you can shift.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.460
And we all have that power.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.340
And then the third one is time.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.840
So I talked a little
bit about this,

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.860
but time is really irrelevant.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.390
It's about what works for you.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.780
So between those
three levers, everyone

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.510
can come up with
what works for you.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.980
And I think journaling's
a great tool.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.740
It's also a way that
you can express,

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.200
and it also changes how
you think about ideas

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.180
when you put them on paper.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.050
There's research on that,
and it's in the book.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.700
So journaling can be
part of your pause plan.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.740
It can involve other people.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.870
And the idea is that--

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.630
how can you shift to lead
a more meaningful life?

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.330
And that's really
the name of the game.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.220
It's not to be a better pauser,
although, that's probably

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:46.110
pretty nice, but it's really
about what can work for you.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:50.030
So I hope all of you can
walk out of this room

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:53.180
or in this discussion,
and decide what you

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.500
could put into your pause plan.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.870
And maybe just take a moment
right now with me kind

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.300
of going back into that
space, and close your eyes

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.580
if you want to.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:07.330
Go ahead and take a breath,
[INHALES] [EXHALES] and ask

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:12.030
yourself, what would I do?

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:28.940
Who would I be if I had one
minute, five minutes, an hour,

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:33.940
days to pause?

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:47.620
Go ahead and open your eyes,
and that is the power of pause.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.130
Thank you.

00:41:51.034 --> 00:41:54.572
I'll take more questions
if we've got some.

00:41:54.572 --> 00:41:56.030
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned journaling.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.340
Are there any special
techniques within journaling

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.870
that you can relate that we can
use as part of our reflection?

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.190
RACHAEL O'MEARA: Yeah.

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:08.117
So the study that
is in "Pause," it's

00:42:08.117 --> 00:42:09.950
also in the Search
Inside Yourself training.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.010
There was some research done
that for two minutes a day

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:19.020
if you journal about an
emotional experience--

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.230
so you write in a
book literally how

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.990
you felt about
something that happened.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:28.640
There's research that
shows that you actually

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.530
process that differently.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:34.040
And now it's escaping
me, of course,

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.130
but it's actually leading
to being more in touch

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.250
with your feelings and changing
how you feel about things.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.100
So it's a tool you
can use to harness

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.862
that emotional intelligence and
continue to build that skill.

00:42:45.862 --> 00:42:47.820
But two minutes a day,
and this study, I think,

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.400
was over a series of weeks.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.720
And the group that
they researched

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.670
found that they had--

00:42:55.670 --> 00:43:00.515
I think it was-- a better sense
of overall happiness, something

00:43:00.515 --> 00:43:01.140
to that effect.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.390
I'm probably
butchering the study.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.240
But yeah, it was
interesting to me.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.120
Because two minutes
a day, I mean,

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.850
that's pretty easy to
come up with, right?

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.567
Whether it's in the
morning or night.

00:43:12.567 --> 00:43:14.150
And if you actually
did that about how

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.240
you felt about
something, so like, oh,

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.360
such and such happened
to me, and I felt--

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.420
and name an emotion.

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.240
I felt happy, I
felt a lot of joy.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.380
It could be gratitude.

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:29.180
But it might also be things that
weren't so pleasant, like, sad,

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.850
or really frustrated and angry.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:33.800
And so the idea is
that you're activating

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.300
different parts of your
brain through writing,

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.508
and it's also activating
your emotional intelligence,

00:43:37.508 --> 00:43:41.450
and therefore allowing yourself
to increase that skill.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.670
And there's other
research too about writing

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.110
and how it operates
different parts of the brain.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:50.690
And I've got a few of those
cited in "Pause," where

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:52.785
it enhances your
learning because it's

00:43:52.785 --> 00:43:55.160
in different formats, whether
you're thinking or writing.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.590
And it reinforces it.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:00.600
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about your long pause,

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.140
and if there is anything that
you're really glad that you

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.830
did, any strategies
that you actually

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:09.290
did that changed
your perspective,

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.300
and also how you would
do it differently

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.169
if you did it again.

00:44:12.169 --> 00:44:13.210
RACHAEL O'MEARA: Oh, boy.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:20.030
So yes, there were things
that I did in my three months.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:23.750
So back to the question
earlier, do I plan it all out,

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:24.800
or do I just do it?

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.380
And so I had a real
urge to travel.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.390
I've always been a traveler.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.070
I knew I could do
some crazy trip.

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:33.230
I want to go to
Argentina or something.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:37.130
And I got kind of real
with myself and said,

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.260
is that really the best
thing for you right now?

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.390
So I actually chose
to not do things.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:42.680
I chose to not travel.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.010
I chose to be with myself,
which was kind of scary,

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.590
and just regroup a little bit.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:53.070
So that decision I
thought helped me a lot.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.070
And it was a choice that
I made to really not do

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.111
what I would normally do.

00:44:56.111 --> 00:44:57.747
And this is that
comfort zone thing.

00:44:57.747 --> 00:45:00.080
My comfort zone was to go out
on an adventure, because I

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.038
was pretty adventurous.

00:45:01.038 --> 00:45:03.650
And I can do that,
and figure it all out.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.590
Being with myself and
learning how I wasn't working,

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.800
and maybe my career was
a sham, and I didn't even

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.800
want to do this anymore
was really scary and not

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.000
in my comfort zone.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.310
I didn't see it at the time,
but in hindsight that's

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:18.500
actually really what happened.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.650
So I allowed myself, I gave
myself permission to do that.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.490
And I knew that one of
the responsibilities

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:30.180
I had was knowing I may not
want to be here anymore.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.960
I may want to switch
careers entirely.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.980
I had this idea I
wanted to do bike tours.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.970
And I did, actually, in
the fall of that year,

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:39.500
along with working at Google.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:43.460
But I think it just helped
me allow myself some space

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.490
to come up with ideas.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:46.880
And what would I do differently?

00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:50.330
What would I do differently?

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.089
I think there were three things
that I did that I actually

00:45:53.089 --> 00:45:53.630
really liked.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:55.951
So I don't know, that's
a great question.

00:45:55.951 --> 00:45:57.200
Maybe I'll think of something.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.410
I'm sure there's some things
I could have done differently.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:00.710
So one was choosing
not to travel,

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:02.293
but I did take a
couple of mini trips.

00:46:02.293 --> 00:46:04.340
So I took one to see
my brother in Texas.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.800
I went to Burning Man
for the first time, which

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:09.050
was a key part of my
pause, by the way,

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:11.420
was the last week of
my three months leave.

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.850
And it opened up me
being more present,

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:16.580
as well, to a life
that I knew I was like,

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.350
whoa, what is this place
that people are in?

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:25.110
And then I rented a friend's
home in Tahoe for a month.

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:26.720
So I would go up
there on weekends.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.315
And so those were just cool
little things that I did.

00:46:29.315 --> 00:46:31.190
But again, I didn't have
to plan a huge trip.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:36.380
Because I think in
my mind I wasn't

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:40.820
ready to take responsibility
to have a big to-do item,

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.040
because I wasn't
mentally equipped,

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.040
I don't think, at
that point for that.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.520
Does that answer your question?

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.280
That's a good question.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.090
Yeah.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:50.590
Great.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:52.048
Well, thanks,
everyone, for coming,

00:46:52.048 --> 00:46:53.980
and I will be here
to sign books.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.770
Thank you.
