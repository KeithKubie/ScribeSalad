00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's start this problem by talking about the feather problem.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Remember back in unit 2 that Aristotle said that "objects fall at a constant speed,"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and he said that speed is proportional to the mass.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Galileo on the other hand said that "all objects fall with constant acceleration."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We've seem to have taken Galileo's side in this debate, but is that the right thing to do?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
After all the feather or a sheet of paper seems to fall down and what seems to be constant rate.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's consider something called air resistance.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, if you're driving in a car on a highway and you stick your hand out the window,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you don't need to have a ridiculously long arm but it helps.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You can feel this force of air resistance, and this is the force of a quickly moving object.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
For example, your hand feeling the actual individual molecules of air as they slam up against your hand,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and that provides an actual force and its always opposite the direction of motion.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So, if the car is going this way the force is that way.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The size of the air resistance force is more or less approximated by an equation like this.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Here v is the speed your traveling and b is some number that depends on

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
maybe the size and shape of your hand or the feather.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
As you can see, this force goes bigger as your velocity increases.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So, let's see how this feather and it's being pulled down by gravity.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
As its speed increases, the air resistance force it feels will also increase.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What eventually happens is the feather reaches what's called terminal velocity

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and that is the maximum speed that the feather reaches.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So, let's say the feather with mass 0.001 Kg so it would be 1 gram

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and this b, this constant up here of 0.04.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm not going to tell you the units, but I bet you can tell me what they are on the form.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I want you to tell me knowing what you know about motion at a constant speed.

00:01:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What will be the feather's terminal velocity in m/sec.
