If we multiply each term by 2x, we'll get 4 minus 3x equals 7. Nice algebraic

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.178
thinking if you got that one correct. To get the answer, we simply simplify the

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:16.074
factors in the numerator and denominator. For this first term, the x's would

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:20.676
cancel to equal 1. This would leave us with 2 times 2, which equals 4. For the

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:25.312
second term, the factors of 2 would cancel it to leave us with negative 3x,

00:00:25.312 --> 00:00:29.116
here. And for our last fraction or term, we would simply have 7.
