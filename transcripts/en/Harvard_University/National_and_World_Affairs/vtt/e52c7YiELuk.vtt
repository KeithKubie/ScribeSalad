00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.660
K-a-z-a-b-e-l-o

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.489
but in Sesotho if there's an L followed by
a vowel itâ€™s pronounced like a d

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.579
so it's "Kazabedo"

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:21.769
is her name, "Kazabedo"

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.429
come on babes, we've got something for ya

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.629
see you're too nice

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:32.760
yeah there ya go

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.170
squeeze it right in

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.770
there you go, good girl

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.660
I know, not so bad huh?

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.910
the big difference

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.940
that we made was really

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.490
pushing harder to get her rehydrated aggressively

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.379
and putting

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.620
the interosseous line in was

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.620
one of the bigger interventions

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.500
she just 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.520
needs a feeding tube down now as well because
 she not going to be able to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.320
and ultimately I prefer to feed through the stomach if we can

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.930
because there's also immunity involved in doing that

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.710
it's just she's took to sick to anything so this will 
hopefully pump her back up a little bit

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.440
and then we'll put the feeding tube down to help.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.520
let's do this huh

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.520
I know, I know, it's no fun, I know

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.590
she wasn't crying at all before

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.990
yeah

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.100
we're perking her up a bit

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.100
it's all right, it's down. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.100
I just really don't want to 
have to put tape on her nose but I think we're gunna have to

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:29.510
I would say from the time she got to clinic
her care

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.519
rivals what

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.419
we would have been able to do at

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.049
many you know

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.299
good hospitals in the United States

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.519
I wish we would have seen her sooner

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.819
I understand why we didn't

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.839
so they're about a 4 hour walk from here.

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:50.899
she's severely malnourished

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.379
and suffering from a 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.249
a treatable infectious disease 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.569
that wasn't treated in a

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.779
timely fashion.

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.260
That's prednisone to help 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.609
decrease the inflammation, you got it.

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.909
She's no where near 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:06.879
out of the woods at all

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.779
you know she's an orphaned baby

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.489
She's an orphan baby girl

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:16.849
and her economic prospects are limited, her
educational prospects are limited

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.989
you know I don't know if grandmother lives to be
old enough to see that child through childhood

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.769
that would be surprising to me.

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.779
So you know you have to start thinking 
who is else is going

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.590
to take care of her. is she going to end up 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.439
as the youngest of three siblings, is she going to end up

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.039
in a child headed household,

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:40.680
you know is she then because of her lack
of educational and economic opportunities going to be

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.510
herself at risk for if she doesn't have
HIV now, she is certainly at high-risk getting

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.159
it through

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.139
sexual activity as she gets older and

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.290
either turns to that is a source of income

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.419
or is forced into that because of the

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.109
violence against women in the mountains

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.220
or uses it

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.879
as a source of solace in a very bleak
life.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.279
"Oh! you peed! Yay! Woohoo!"

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:10.079
Because she is somebody who is fighting so hard 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.679
against the odds,

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:14.749
because the deck is stacked so against her

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.560
I think she deserves more of our fight

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.459
than someone for whom the deck is stacked

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.959
less against.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.409
"yeah, we're making progress, 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.949
making progress"

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.529
you know when I buy my nieces a new DVD, or

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:30.400
try to help them you know

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.199
go to the best school they can

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.570
so they can go to a nice college, no one asks 
me why I'm doing to me ask you one

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.229
that for them, I don't have to justify kindness to

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.039
children who are entitled and blessed, so I don't know

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.120
that I should have to justify it for children

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.220
whose lives have been just absolutely miserable.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.069
You know, she had physicians and nurses paying attention
to her, she had the appropriate medications

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:55.379
she had good IV access

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.040
the diagnostics were somewhat limited, I mean we couldn't
check labs on her

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.289
I have no idea what her lab test would look like

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.220
and so that part, that 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.389
was sub-optimal.

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.379
but other than that I would say, 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:09.409
I would rate her care  

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.989
here as good. as very good.

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:15.689
"I am giving her some plumpy nuts

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.729
to see if she will eat a little bit for us"

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.050
you know I was lucky enough to be trained

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.560
at an excellent institution with some of the best

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.369
mentors and teachers that one can come across

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:32.110
and you know to be able to use that to help

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.219
a little girl living in the middle of nowhere
who otherwise would be forgotten about,

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:40.219
it seems like the right thing to do to me.

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.560
We take it one clinic at a time.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.169
one baby at a time.
