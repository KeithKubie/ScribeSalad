00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.910
In summary, solving a design problem at one level of abstraction means dividing

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.640
it into subproblems. Solving each of the subproblems at a lower level of

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.090
abstraction and ensuring that the lower level solution, indeed,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.530
contributes to the higher level. That is, divide and conquer.
