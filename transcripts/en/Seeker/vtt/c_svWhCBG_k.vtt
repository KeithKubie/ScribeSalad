00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.040
Welcome to a very special week, where we're
joining The Swim to raise awareness around

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
ocean health.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.429
Now climate change may call to mind: clouds
of gases, smog blanketing cities, and rising

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.400
temperatures around the globe.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.180
But it has also has many profound impacts
on our oceans too--like the fact that climate

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.730
change is literally dissolving pieces of the
ocean floor.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.050
When we release excess gases like carbon dioxide,
they linger in the air and insulate the world,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.640
basically creating a thick gas blanket that
traps heat and disregulates the world’s

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.910
natural temperature cycles--and our oceans
come into play here in surprising ways.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.730
For a lot of earth’s history, the ocean
has acted as a carbon sink.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.420
That means that it absorbs CO2 gas from the
air.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.940
That CO2 combines with the ocean’s H2O in
a chemical reaction that produces carbonic

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.940
acid.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.310
Which, as it sounds, is pretty acidic.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.870
In a normal, healthy cycle, this CO2 absorption
does lower the pH of the ocean, but luckily--the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.390
seafloor is lined with a thick layer of calcium
carbonate.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.430
This is what seashells and the other bodies
of some sea creatures are made out of, and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.850
these form a layer on the bottom of the ocean
just like leaves and other dead organisms

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.470
form the top layer of soil in a forest.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.960
And luckily--calcium carbonate, also called
calcite, is a basic compound.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.750
Not as in---oh, calcite, she’s so basic--but
like, the opposite of acidic.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.920
In fact, we humans regularly consume calcium
carbonate as an antacid for stuff like heartburn,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.070
so we know firsthand how useful it is in combating
acidic environments.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.330
So, in a typical cycle, the seafloor basically
acts like a big Tums tablet, reacting with

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.750
that carbonic acid to maintain the ocean’s
normal pH and allowing ocean life cycles to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.470
keep swimming along healthily.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.470
But.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.470
As we all know.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.590
Global climate change is happening because
we humans are putting WAY more carbon dioxide

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.990
and other greenhouse gases out there into
the atmosphere.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.833
And that means that the oceans are absorbing
more and more of that CO2.

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:56.560
And they work so hard for us, guys -- absorbing
up to a quarter of our total CO2 output every

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.950
year, so when global greenhouse gas emissions
rise….so does the amount of CO2 absorbed

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.950
by the ocean.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.710
This means that there’s not enough calcium
carbonate to keep up with all the carbonic

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.420
acid that’s being produced, meaning our
oceans are getting more acidic.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.800
Not only that, but there’s SO much CO2 being
absorbed that entire sections of the seafloor

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.710
are just straight up...dissolving.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.010
Now, getting down to the very bottom of the
seafloor is hard and expensive, so instead

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.250
scientists recreated deep sea conditions in
laboratory microenvironments--down to the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.750
currents, salinity, chemistry, temperature,
alllll the deets.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.550
Replicating these environmental variables--which
were verified by physical sampling and computer

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.050
modeling--helped the research team pinpoint
how fast the calcite dissolves in these environments,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.610
both now and back in the day under different
conditions.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.349
And by comparing the dissolution rates pre-
and post-industrialization, they calculated

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.040
how much is missing currently.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.650
And it’s a lot.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.599
In some hotspots, anywhere between 40-100%
of the calcite seafloor is just gone.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.060
Some specific areas, particularly in the northwest
Atlantic, are faring worse than others because

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.440
ocean currents gather lots of dissolved CO2
there, making the calcite seafloor there have

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.360
to work a lot harder and thinning it out.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.660
So...what’s underneath?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.190
I mean there’s not just gaping holes in
the ocean like big bathtub drains, there is

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.970
more stuff underneath it, it’s just not
the calcium carbonate that used to be there,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.910
that’s all dissolved away.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.800
These gaping wounds in the ocean floor essentially
mean we’re exhausting our stockpile of the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.769
only material that keeps the ocean from becoming
too acidic for life to thrive.

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.740
Think of it kinda like a deep sea version
of the holes in the ozone layer.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.720
As disheartening as this news is, maybe now
that we know it’s a problem, we can start

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.120
to address it?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.080
Maybe there’s a way to re-seed the ocean
floor with calcium carbonate, maybe there

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.740
are human-made technological solutions to
human-made problems.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.239
More work is needed, like further mathematical
modeling of the issue and more actual sampling

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.440
of the ocean floor in these areas, but we’ll
be finding out soon enough whether there’s

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.950
anything we can do about it.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.390
The health of our oceans is one of the most
important issues facing humanity today, and

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.750
climate change poses a big threat.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.960
Seeker is highlighting The Swim all this week,
to bring awareness to the impact of specifically,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.680
plastic pollution on our oceans.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.559
We ask you to help us spread the message.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.710
Tell us how you are reducing plastic pollution
in the comments below.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.990
Keep coming back to Seeker for all your environment
updates, and thanks for watching.
