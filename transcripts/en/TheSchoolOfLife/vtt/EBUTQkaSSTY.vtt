00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:15.058
Though we may keep a little quiet about this, especially when young, we tend deep down to be rather hopeful that we will eventually

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.510
manage to find perfection in a number of areas.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.499
We dream of one day securing an ideally harmonious

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.959
relationship; deeply fulfilling work, a happy family life, and the respect of others.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.829
But life has a habit of dealing us a range of blows and leaving nothing much of this array of fine dreams

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.369
save some shattered and worthless fragments.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.779
It's at moments of disillusion that we might turn our minds to a concept drawn from Japanese Philosophy and in particular

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.628
from the Zen Buddhist approach to ceramics.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.349
Over the centuries zen masters developed an argument that pots, cups, and bowls that had become damaged

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.989
shouldn't simply be neglected or thrown away.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.070
They should continue to attract our respect and attention and be repaired with enormous care. This process

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.179
symbolizing a reconciliation with the floors and accidents of time

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.049
intended to reinforce some underlying themes in zen.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.790
The word given to this tradition of ceramic repair is Kin Tsugi.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.470
Kin: Golden, Tsugi:

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.269
joinery. It means quite literally to "join with gold". In

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.829
Zen aesthetics the broken pieces of an accidentally smashed pot should be carefully picked up reassembled and then glued together with lacquer

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.019
inflected with the most expensive gold powder. There should be no attempt to disguise the damage. The point is to render the fault lines

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.399
beautiful and strong. The precious veins of gold are there to emphasize that breaks have a philosophical merit all of their own.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.339
The origins of Kin Tsugi are set a date the Muromachi Period, when the shogun of Japan,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.729
Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, broke his favourite tea bowl, and distraught, sent it to be repaired in China.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.060
But on its return,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.299
he was horrified by the ugly, metal staples that had been used to join the broken pieces and

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.830
charged his craftsmen with devising a more appropriate solution. What they came up with was a method that didn't disguise the damage,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.680
but made something properly artful out of it.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.490
Kintsugi belongs to the zen ideals of 'Wabi Sabi', which cherishes what's simple, unpretentious, and aged.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.689
Especially if it has a rustic, or weathered quality. A story is told of one of the great proponents of Wabi Sabi, Sen

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.359
No Rikyu. On a journey through southern Japan,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.130
he was once invited to a dinner where the host thought he will be impressed by an elaborate and expensive

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.160
antique tea jar that he had bought from China.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.100
but Rikyu didn't even seem to notice this item and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.869
instead spent his time chatting and admiring a branch swaying in the breeze outside. In

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.009
despair at his lack of interest, once Rikyu had left, the devastated host  smashed the jar to pieces and retired to his room

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.159
But the other guests more wisely gathered the fragments and stuck them together through

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.419
Kintsugi. When Rikyu next came to visit, the philosopher turned to the repaired jar and with a knowing smile exclaimed,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.820
"Now, it's magnificent."

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
In an age that worships youth,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.380
perfection, and the new, the art of Kintsugi retains a particular wisdom as applicable to our own lives as it is to pots:

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.459
That care and love expended on the shattered pieces should also encourage us to respect what is damaged and scarred,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.429
vulnerable and imperfect, starting with ourselves and those around us.
