00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:20.820
The Titanic, the unsinkable ship, launched
on April 10, 1912, carrying some 2,200 passengers

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.590
and crew en route to the United States.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.950
On the night of April 14, 1912, the ship hit
an iceberg and sunk, resulting in around just

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.710
700 people surviving—only a third of the
people on board.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.420
However, there were a few lucky people who
survived because a twist of fate when they

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.630
didn’t board the Titanic as planned.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.930
In December 1911, Milton S. Hershey, the founder
of the Hershey Chocolate Company, put down

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.620
a $300 deposit (about $7,281 today) for a
state room aboard the Titanic.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.280
The check for the transaction, made out to
White Star Lines, is still in the Hershey

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.690
Community Archives.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.850
Hershey had founded the Hershey Chocolate
Company back in 1894, and it resulted—as

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.489
you probably guessed—in a roaring success.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.409
By 1907, Hershey had his own factory to mass-produce
chocolates and distribute them nationwide,

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.100
resulting in enough money to take a lengthy
trip to Nice, France.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.500
On the return home, he thought he and his
wife might as well spend the days at sea lounging

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.290
in luxury, which is why he put down the deposit
on the state room.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.710
It’s not certain exactly what caused Hershey
to abandon the Titanic trip at the last minute,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.880
as the company will only say that he found
it necessary to return to the United States

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.880
earlier.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.350
There are two theories: first, a pressing
matter at the factory required his attention,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.740
and second, that his wife Kitty had fallen
ill, resulting in an early departure.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.610
Both stories have some weight; Kitty had notoriously
bad health, and the founder of a company would

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.770
certainly be required to cut his vacation
short if “an urgent matter” popped up.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.520
Regardless of what happened, Hershey did not
board the Titanic as planned.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.960
Rather, he and his wife hopped on the German
ship Amerika and arrived in the United States

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.380
several days before the Titanic sank.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.090
Ironically, the Amerika passed through the
waters the Titanic would be sailing through

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.200
and sent word ahead that there were a few
treacherous-looking glaciers along the way,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.540
and to watch out for them.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.680
Obviously, the warning wasn’t heeded.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.390
The Titanic was unsinkable, after all.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.160
Even if he had been on board, Hershey and
his wife would have had a better chance at

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.569
surviving than a majority of passengers.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.200
Based on figures given by the British Board
of Trade, 97% of female first class passengers

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.210
were saved during the disaster, along with
33% of male first class passengers.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.069
That’s in comparison to the 46% of female
third class passengers, 8% of male second

00:02:41.069 --> 00:03:02.749
class passengers, and 16% of male third class
passengers who were saved.
