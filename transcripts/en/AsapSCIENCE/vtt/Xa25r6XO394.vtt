00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660
History is full of stories of demons and other unearthly creatures coming into our world

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.460
and wreaking havoc on society.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.460
But what does science have to say about zombies?

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.740
Are these ferocious freaks plausible or scientifically accurate in any way?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.340
Should we be preparing for a zombie apocalypse?

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.920
Well, it depends on what type of zombie we are talking about.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.920
Dying and coming back from the dead?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.020
Not so likely.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.940
But a virus that induces zombie-like qualities of rage and the incessant need to eat human flesh?

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.020
Hypothetically.....yes.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.640
The main factor involved is finding a virus specific to the brain areas for these symptoms

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.640
while leaving other areas intact.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.160
Neurons are some of the some of the longest cells

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.400
and can transport molecules and proteins across the entire body.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.880
Many viruses such as rabies take advantage of take advantage of something called

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.880
Retrograde Axonal Transport
