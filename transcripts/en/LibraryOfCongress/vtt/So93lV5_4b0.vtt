00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.940
&gt;&gt; Eric Eldritch: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.740
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.040
&gt;&gt; Eric Eldritch: I'm
really glad that you're here

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.340
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.520
We hope that you've been able
to make new friends and to meet

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.280
with your colleagues from
across the Metro area.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.510
And we're glad to introduce you
to the Library of Congress itself.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.920
Our program today is full of --

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.120
of information that will help you
learn how to find information,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.840
and I'll let the speakers do that.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.220
And to give a welcome on behalf of
the -- of the Library of Congress,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.500
I'd like to introduce Dr.
Colleen -- Dr. Colleen Shogun,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.010 position:56%
who is the Deputy Director of
National and International Outreach.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.510
Would you welcome Dr.
Colleen Shogun?

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.020
[ Applause ]

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.320
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogun: Hi everyone.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.340
Good afternoon and welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.930
It's great to see you
all here today.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.000
Once again, my name's
Colleen Shogun.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.530
I'm the Deputy Director of National

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.190
and International Outreach
here at the library.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.950
And as you might know,
we have a new --

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.800
a fairly new librarian
of Congress here at LOC.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.240
Her name is Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.280
And she asked me to
welcome you here today.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.920
She regrets that she
can't be here herself.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.220
She's super busy.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.500
She's, you know, in huge
demand all across the city,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.830
all across the United States
and all across the world.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.140
But she definitely is a very
big fan of this program.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.180
So since 1999, the library has
hosted over 230 HACU interns.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.680
And we're very proud to
participate in this program,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.820
which brings new ideas, new minds,

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.380
new talents to the
Library of Congress.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.000
And we're also honored to have
received the HACU President's Award

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.910
for serving as a leader of --

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.320
of advocating for diversity
in the federal workforce.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.570
I understand that you've all had a
brief tour already of the library.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.420
And as probably your docents,
your tour guides have told you,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.740
this beautiful building
that we're in today,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.140
the Jefferson Building
is really a testimony

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.810
to a particular moment in time.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.110
The particular moment in time

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.180
when the United States was
becoming a world power at the turn

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.050
of the century from the 19th
century into the 20th century.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.380
So the building stands
really for the idea

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.980
that the United States would
become a world leader as far

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.650
as knowledge is concerned and
as far as learning is concerned

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.950
and also educational
access for everyone.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.550
The library has adopted the
ideals of Thomas Jefferson.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.440
We know Thomas Jefferson was the
founder in some ways of the Library

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.930
of Congress because he provided us
with the very first books to serve

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.010
as the Library of Congress.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.900
He believed that free, unhampered
pursuit of truth by an informed

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.690
and involved citizen --
citizenry was necessary --

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.200
was necessary criteria
for democracy.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.770
It didn't mean that that was a
nice thing to have a democracy,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.450
but it was something that
had to exist for democracy

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.990
to function and to flourish.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.900
And there was a time when most
libraries strictly guarded their

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.420
doors to knowledge, so libraries
weren't always necessarily open

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.410
or free to everyone.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.190
But this institution was
always dedicated to the idea

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.750
of universal access
and equal opportunity

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.610
and we still are obviously
to this day.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.380
Everyone is welcome to
the Library of Congress.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.830
And I feel very comfortable saying

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.360
that because our new librarian
really espouses that --

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.990
that principle and talks
about it on a daily basis.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.830
And what she means by that is the
youngest people, and she calls them

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.690
"scholars in training," people that
are not even, can't even read yet,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.160
kids that can't even read yet,
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.590
We have a Young Readers
center just one floor down,

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.940
and she enjoys going there,
reading stories to them,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.560
reading books to them, trying to
get kids engaged in the notion

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.890
of reading and of learning, all the
way up to our high school students

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.360 position:56%
who we encourage to use the Library
of Congress; to our college students

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.650
and then our most senior scholars
who come here to the library

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.490
to write books and
important research articles.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.880
So the library really belongs
to everyone from the whole range

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.080 position:56%
of early learners all the way to our
-- our most senior intellectuals,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.400 position:56%
and she really means that sincerely.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.630
The Library of Congress is --
I'm not sure if you know this,

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.710
but it is the largest
repository of human knowledge

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.500
in the world, which is pretty cool.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.800
I mean it is.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.690
It is the place that has the
most amount in one location

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.470
of information and
knowledge in the entire world.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.120
And that's pretty special.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.430
We have 3,000 people.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.810
I'll tell you a little
bit about the numbers.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.060
So what does that mean?

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.450
3,000 people work here at the --

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.170
about 3,000 people work here
at the Library of Congress

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.670
where the main research arm
of the United States Congress,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.440
so we take that mission
very, very seriously.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.310
Before I came to work in outreach
here at the Library of Congress,

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.550
I worked at the Congressional
Research Service for many years,

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.430
which is a division of the
Library of Congress that works

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.030
to serve members of congress
and staff, providing them

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.270
with nonpartisan information and
analysis about public policy issues

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.290
that are being debated today.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.520
We're also surrounded by 36 million
catalogue books here at the Library

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.720
of Congress, print materials
and 460 foreign languages,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.020
69 million manuscripts, the
largest rare book collection in all

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.060
of North American and the
world's largest collection

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.270
of legal materials,
films, maps, comic books,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.320
sheet music and sound recordings.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.480
So, it's not -- The Library
of Congress is not just books.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.180
Yes, books are a very,
very important part

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.720
of our 160 million
object collections,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.750
so that's the foundation
of our collection.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.980
But the library also -- Library
of Congress also recognizes

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.040
that you can learn from
a lot of different types

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.550
of materials and not just books.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.140
So the library collects
widely, hence the notion

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.230
that the library is
the largest repository

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.800
of human knowledge in the world.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.220
So the amount of information
is when you think

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.940
about it is pretty mind
boggling, 160 million objects,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.780 position:56%
160 million items that you can learn
from at the Library of Congress.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.470
But then you might say, well,
"Why is that so important today?"

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.230
You know, why is it so important

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.710
to have physical collections
of -- of these items?

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.090
Because, you know,
this phone, right,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.220
in my pocket can put easily 160
million pieces of information

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.600
at my fingertips, and I can
walk around with it, you know,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.160
all day here at the library.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.640
It can walk around with it at home.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.920
You can use it for all kinds
of purposes, just curiosity

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.900
or actual learning,
scholarship research.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.370
It can be used today.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.640
You can google any question that
you don't know the answer to.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.700
If you're at my house,
you ask Alexa.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.270
That's what I like to
do because I'm lazy.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.860
So now I talk to, you know,
almost like a virtual robot

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.060
to answer questions for me.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.160
But the question is,
so you have access.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.190
All this information
is at your fingertips.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.040
There's not a question of the
fact that we don't have access

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.030
to information today, and you
don't have to necessarily come

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.570
to a library to -- to read a book
or to read a magazine article

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.580
or to read a newspaper article.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.410
But the question is,
can you distinguish

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.220
between reliable sources?

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.530
How do you know what is
actually factually correct?

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.340
Do you know the right
questions to ask

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.500
to get the answers that you need?

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.860
And that works for anything.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.720
That works if you're
using your phone.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.050
That works if you're using
something like Alexa.

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.720
My husband is very bad at
asking Alexa questions.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.260
He asks her questions in the wrong
way and he never gets good answers.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.190
So, I mean, just using a
simple device like that,

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.550
if you don't know how to use
it, then there may be a lot

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.510
of information inside that
device, but you can't gain access

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.930
to the information that you need.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.960
And that's really where
libraries play a major role.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.150
The vast amount of information

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.800
that has now been made
available has made libraries

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.690
and librarians even more important.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.270
Some people would argue it's
made libraries less important

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.420
because we're all walking
around with virtual libraries

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.910
in our pockets or in our backpacks.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.450
But that's not really true.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.300
Simply, access to more
information doesn't mean

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.310
that we don't need experts like
we provide here at the Library

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.260
of Congress or any library,
right, the public libraries,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.050
research libraries that
we don't require experts

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.400
to help us find the right
answers and the right sources.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.300
As Dr. Hayden likes to say,

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.990
"Librarians are the
original search engines."

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.490
Library staff makes
it easier for you

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.600
to access the correct
information so that you know

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.600
when you ask those questions that
you're getting the most reliable

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.970
and authoritative answers.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:53.050 position:56%
This is not a place that is
thriving on the notion of fake news.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.230
This is not a fake news place.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.100
This is a place that is --

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:02.230
is premised upon the idea of giving
you the best possible information

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.670
and giving you the widest
range information --

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.450
of information to answer the
questions that you might ask.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.630
So I hope you enjoy today's
lecture on the role of libraries

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.850
and the leadership that libraries
play in the quest for knowledge.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.390
As students, I urge you to
return here to the Library

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.070
of Congress some day and
conduct your own research,

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:31.750
whether it's research for a course
that you're taking or research

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.720
for a paper that you're
writing or something just

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.890
that you're personally
curious about.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.930 position:56%
It doesn't always have to be about
something academic and intellectual.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.290
And I know that's probably
your focus now

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.550
because that's what your --
your -- your phase in life,

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.840
but it doesn't have to be that when
you come to the Library of Congress

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.720
or you come to any, you know,
even your local library.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.140
You can just want to ask a
curious question about a hobby,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.620
about your genealogy, about
historical backgrounds,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.080
about something about your family
or something about your community.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.660
And here at the Library of
Congress, we're here to serve

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:15.170
that entire range of -- of requests
or information that you might need.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.000
Knowing how to access and knowing
how to ask the right questions

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.300
to gain accurate information
really is a skill

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.540
that will help you no matter
what career you decide

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.720
to go, you decide to pursue.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.670
It doesn't really matter, but I
will guarantee you that if you're

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.220
in a job, it doesn't matter
what job that you're in --

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.890
well most jobs these days,

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.920
but getting the answer
correct is the most -- is --

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.150
is the most important aspect.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.570
You can do it quickly.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:49.390
You might be able to write it in a
-- in a very clear, succinct way,

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.380 position:56%
but the bottom line is you have to
get -- the answer has to be correct.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.680
It has to be authoritative.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.590
It needs to be supported
by reliable resources.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.440
And gaining that resource
and learning those --

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.360 position:56%
and learning that skill is something
that you can really take advantage

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.240
of here at the Library of
Congress or any library.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.370
So I'm going to turn the
program over to Jonathan.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:15.070
I think he's going to give us some
announcements about the program.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.120
But once again, welcome
to the Library of Congress

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.190
and I hope you enjoy your day and
your internship and the program.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.990
Thank you.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:28.370
[ Applause ]

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:32.580
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Santeliz: Thank
you very much Dr. Shogan.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.000
This is really amazing to be here.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.860
First of all, my name
is Jonathan Santeliz

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.540
and I'm the Executive Director

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.200
of the HACU National
Internship Program.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.210
We're really happy and we're
really fortunate to be here.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:54.320
2017 is our 25th year that our
program has been in existence.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.920
And over the course
of those 25 years,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.630
a lot has -- a lot has happened.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.620
We started with just one
agency and 24 interns.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.850
And now we have partnerships with
about 20 or different agencies all

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.590
across the federal government.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:14.160
And we're very fortunate to count
on the Library of Congress as one

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.170
of those agencies that has
been a consistent supporter

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.090
of the internship program.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:25.680 position:56%
I had some remarks that I want to
make, but I also want to acknowledge

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.610
to folks that have made
this program possible.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:35.200
And so first and foremost, the
two individuals that were key

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.200
in making this possible, Miss
Hazel Cerron [Assumed Spelling].

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.010 position:56%

of Congress staff to make this event
possible, so please later on today,

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.320
please thank them for the
great work that they've done.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.620
I also want to acknowledge the
Library of Congress interns

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.320

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.440

Alright, close, you know.

[ Applause ]

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:56.510
Also want to recognize that we
have a few HACU alumni in the crowd

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.460
that were interns a few years
back, not too long ago, right.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.460
And they're also here.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.310
And interns I -- I encourage
you to reach out to them,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.270
talk to them so you
can hear their stories.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:14.510 position:56%
So first of all, Miss Leah Kerwin --

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.050

And Mr. Ricardo Graciafierdo

Where are you?

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.790
Not here. He stepped out.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.540
Alright, he's -- he's
-- he's back to work.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:38.290
Alright. I'm going to close
with just a few things.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:44.100
I've always encouraged the interns
to as you're doing your internship

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:50.380
to capitalize on this opportunity,
to take advantage of the resources.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.840
And you've gotten a lot of
information from Dr. Shogan

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.640
about all the amazing
resources that are here.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:03.300
I want you think of the Library
of Congress as your library, okay,

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.060
as the resource that
you can tap into,

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.570
as well as within your agencies.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.110
This is the agency.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.720
This is your US Department
of Agriculture,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.300
US Department of Health
and Human Services.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:23.270
So definitely, as you're here,
don't be shy about taking

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:28.990
in really the beauty of this
building and asking questions

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:34.590
about all the amazing opportunities
and resources that are here.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.360
With that, that is
all I have to say.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.240 position:56%
Thank you very much for coming here.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.280
And go ahead and introduce
our next speaker,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.880
Mr. George Coulbourne who's
the Chief of the National

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.510
and International Outreach Office.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:59.150
[ Applause ]

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.890
&gt;&gt; George Coulbourne: Now
that Jonathan's taken half

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.420
of my presentation,
mine will be very short.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:11.990
Really, I look out at
the audience and I'm --

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:17.650
I'm just really very happy that all
of you could join us here today.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.230
This is a sentinel
event for this program.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:26.130
I remember back in
early 2000 I think

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:31.190
that there was another new
service unit called the Office

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.940
of Strategic Initiatives.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:41.220 position:56%
And the head of that service unit,
Laura Campbell who has since retired

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:48.180
and gone on to even bigger
things was very much an advocate

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:54.590
for this type of program, for
giving young men and women a chance

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:59.120
to immerse themselves
in our nation's culture,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:06.310
all the same time promoting
diversity within the workforce.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:11.060
The library has always
had a history, most --

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.260
especially most recently
for promoting diversity.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.970
It's like any other
government institution.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.540
It waxes and wanes.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:29.150 position:56%
But I tell you there are people here
that I can say are truly committed

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:34.160
to promoting diversity
in the workplace.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:40.230
But today is a celebration of
-- I always get this mixed up.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.930
Is it HACU or HNIP?

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:52.110
So, we'll say today to celebrate
HNIP's program here at the library.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:56.030
And I would be remiss
not to say that I want

00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:01.330
to thank Eric Eldritch
and Julie Lee.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:06.510
Julie, the two of you stand
up, because they are Hazel's --

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.370
[ Applause ]

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.490
-- They are Hazel's mentor.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.730
Hazel's has been a real
addition to this team.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.260
We're a relatively
small team, and --

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:23.210
and I think they've worked
extremely well on program --

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:28.230
this program, as well as major
national and international programs

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.530
that come out of our office.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.880
So I thank you all.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:42.860
Really, I want you to know that
this program is truly a critical

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:48.310
component and shows the library's
commitment to promote in a diverse

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:55.010
as I said workforce, to
support the inclusiveness --

00:19:55.010 --> 00:20:00.270
the culture of inclusiveness
here at the library.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.110
I know over the years,
it's been some changes

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:09.600
in the way we do things both
from a senior administration

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.050
and at the service unit level.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.970
But this has always held
the same, and with the --

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:20.440
with the event of IFP, which is
the Intern and Fellowship Program,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.110 position:56%
which is part of the National and
International Outreach Service Unit,

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:30.540
we are committed to
really broadening our reach

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:37.990
for internships, fellowships
and residencies in our country.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:45.080 position:56%
As I said, Jonathan's already
thanked the Spring HACU interns here

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.380
at the library.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.680
I want to thank you.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.980
We met not too long ago.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.330
I was joking with Yoselin
and told her I was going

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.710
to call her up to say a few words.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.450
But they've been a great group.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.350
They have made some
major contributions.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:10.750
And I especially want to take this
time to thank Jonathan and Noel.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.930
They've been wonderful partners.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:18.170
We've sparred over the
years, but that's --

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:22.680
that's what make it a
good relationship as --

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.910
that we do some give and take.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.750
But they have really brought some
great talent here to the library.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:34.310
Now, for this event,
we're very fortunate

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:39.180
to have an exceptional
leader and librarian.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.270
The Director of Diversity
and Leadership Programs

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:51.520
at the Association of Research
Libraries or the ARL, Mark Puente,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.530
who will challenge you to think
creatively about your future.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:03.390
At the Association of Research
Libraries, Mark directs all aspects

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.630
of this association's
diversity recruitment

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:13.440
and leadership development programs
and serves as the ARL staff liaison

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:19.940
to the ARL Committee on
diversity and leadership.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.690
Now, Mark's research interest
from what we understand

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.050
and we hope we have this right
Mark are centered on diversity

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.940
and leadership, particularly
in the context

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:38.290
of academic research libraries
and fine arts librarianship.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:42.680 position:56%
Mark has been actively involved
with diversity and leadership issues

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.380
since the beginning
of his library career.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.160 position:56%
Mark at one time was also an intern.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:54.600
He's also a graduate of
the Minnesota Institute

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:01.500
for early career librarians and the
Harvard ACRL Leadership Institute.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:07.620
In his responsibilities for the
ARL career resources, he designs

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.600
and directs the Annual
ARL Leadership Symposium

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.500
and leads the planning of the
Bi-Annual National Diversity

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.210
and Libraries Conference.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.820
Mark has presented at regional
and national conferences on topics

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:28.000
such as networking, minority
recruitment strategies, diversity,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.180
inclusion in the workplace

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:34.580
and residency programs
and academic libraries.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:39.150
So it is with great pleasure
that I introduce Mark Puente.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:46.510
And please join him and welcome
him to the Library of Congress.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:53.140
[ Applause ]

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.640
&gt;&gt; Mark Puente: Thank you
very much for that welcome.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.660
I'm really delighted to be here.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.980
As I was listening to the remark --

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.720
I'm going to time myself
to help dictate how fast --

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.400
how quickly or how
slowly I can talk.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.150
So -- No, I'm really
delighted to be here.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.120 position:56%
And as I was listening to some of
the opening programs, I was thinking

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.020
about my own experiences not only

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.190
as a librarian information
science professional,

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.100
but I also had a previous
career as a music educator.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:22.400 position:56%
And in my experiences, it was really
the relationships that I built

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.490
through the course
of those two careers.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.980 position:56%
But especially I can tell you a
little bit about my educational path

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.760
to librarianship and some
cohorts that were built

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.980
as I pursued my Master of
Library and Information Science,

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.640 position:56%
and also I was a spectrum scholar,
which is a large scholarship program

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.920
that is funded and sponsored by
the American Library Association.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.590
And some of those relationships

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.800
that I built those
programs are really ones

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.300
that endure some 16/17 years later.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.650
And I know that you are
-- have the potential

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.690 position:56%
to build some lifelong relationships

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.270
that can really help
bolster and help guide you.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.990
You'll be developing peer
mentors through this experience.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:05.680
So, I really invite you to fully --
really think about taking advantage

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.660
of the relationships that
you're building here.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.990
I mean the money was
always really great.

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:10.720
The scholarship money
was great, you know,

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.790
less student loan debt,
all that sort of thing.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.940
The practical experience
that I had in some of my --

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.570
in my fellowship experience
was really wonderful.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:22.390
But when I think about my, what
maybe has been most impactful,

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.300
I really think about
those relationships.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.600
So please do that.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.690
I'm going to talk just
a little bit today.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.510
It's always in the context -- all
in the context of librarianship

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.120
of course, because
that's the current --

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.570
that's the world in which I --
through which I navigate right now.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:37.870
But I'm going to tell
you a little --

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.100
start off just by telling
you a little bit about myself

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.960
because I hope it's a
little bit relevant.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.540
I was born in -- in
San Antonio, Texas.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.980
This is my beautiful hometown.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.280
I love it.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.580
I miss it.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.880
I go back there.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.180
I still have a home there.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.480
I go back very, very frequently.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.780
I grew up in a pretty modest,

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.430
I would say a working class
neighborhood in San Antonio.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.620
This is an intentional for those
of you who may be old enough

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.180
to remember my intentional homage

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.400
to the Ricky Ricardo/Lucy
and Ricky Ricardo Show.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.300
But if you can see the heart there.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.390
But my father was a brick
mason growing up in San Antonio

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.570
for the better part of 60 years.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:16.330
My mother was at the time that
my parents met in the 50s,

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:20.320 position:56%
she was a credit clerk in a local --

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.430
in a downtown retailer
in downtown San Antonio.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:25.730
And they met.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.030
They lived -- grew up in
the same neighborhood.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.480
My father was great, a good
singer and that sort of thing.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:36.410
I should've given you -- I'm sorry,
the -- the trigger alert to this.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:41.030
Because this slide represents
really I guess the change.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:45.360
This is very much a part of the
reality that my parents grew up.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.020
The parents -- the San Antonio that
my parents grew up in was very,

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:54.490
very segregated, very divided, and
not only around racial/ethnic lines

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.970
as is represented here
in this slide,

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.810
but across many, many other lines.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.110
So it was -- it was difficult.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.080
And my parents pretty much I would
say really encouraged my brothers

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.790
and I to assimilate, right,
to become more like the --

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.340
the majority culture, right, the --

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.790
the dominate cultures that
were in San Antonio at the time

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.440
because that's what
they saw would be --

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.590
That's what they thought would
be our pathway to success.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.200
Hopefully some of that -- a lot
of that maybe is changing now,

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.410
as I think about people
that I am trying to shepherd

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:30.860
through in my capacity at
ARL into higher education

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:34.580
into graduate education and
into careers in librarianship.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.320
Now, the San Antonio --
I'm old enough -- I'm --

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.620
I'm one of those cusp-ers
[phonetic].

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.860
I was a baby boomer, but
just on the cusp a bit.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.130 position:56%
But this San Antonio that my parents
grew up in like I said was very,

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.000
very divided within once
less than probably --

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.930
It was probably five square blocks.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.330
There was the church for
the Latinics community,

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:53.630
the Hispanics and Latinos.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.390
There was the church for those
of German and Czech descent

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.220
and there was another church for
the African-Americans or the black

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.990
or the -- the black congregations.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.350
So it was very, very divided.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.650
And about the late 60's,
that started to kind

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.390
of break down a -- a little bit.

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.300
And the San Antonio that I grew
up in, especially into my teens,

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.570
especially into my 20's and 30's
was really very, very integrated

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.020
with the majority cultures
really embracing the --

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:23.800
the flavors and the smells and the
sounds of the Latinics culture,

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.830
right, our food -- If you've
ever been to San Antonio --

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.130
Has anybody been to San Antonio?

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.430
I hope some of you have.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.760
Who -- who are -- Anybody
from San Antonio?

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.060
Yeah. No, no?

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.300
Okay. I miss breakfast tacos
more than anything I think.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.340
So anyway, but, you
know, home of the --

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.020
the Alamo, our world
famous Riverwalk and lots

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.400
of -- lots of great food.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.700
Please come visit.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.660
When I was a kid, backtracking
just a few years later,

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.060
this was really my first experience
with the library and that was

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.030 position:56%
with the San Antonio Public Library.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:55.750
We call that color enchilada
red because of, you know, the --

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.220
right, the -- the likeness
to the red tortillas.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:04.330
But anyway, and this is where
I first became both familiar

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:09.550 position:56%
with the resources that library's
steward and also with the personnel,

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.710
the people that steward
those resources

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.540
and that really took an interest
in me and in my life, in my career

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.220
and my development at
a pretty early age.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.690
So that was it, a little
bit about my experience.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.610
I should say and I do want
to tell you a little bit

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.540
about my organization, The
Association of Research Libraries,

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.710
which is right here in
Washington D.C. It is not

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.690
like a -- a lot of associations.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.990
The Association of Research
Libraries is an institutional

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.670
organization of 124 of the top,

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.850
well largest we would
say research libraries

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.600
in the United States and Canada.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.950
So, a lot of your land
grant universities,

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:53.650 position:56%
your big state schools, colleges and
universities are members of ours,

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:57.100
a lot of the Ivy League
schools are members.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.640
And then we have a couple of
public libraries that are members,

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.300
the New York Public Library,
Boston Public Library

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.880
and we have quite a few federal
libraries, Library of Congress,

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.560
where you're visiting today, the
National Library of Medicine,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.040
the National Archives, which
is just down the street.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.300
I hope some of you might have
an opportunity to visit NARA.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.570
Did I say the National
Library of Medicine?

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.870
That's the other one.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.170
And I think those are
the -- the federals.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.580
And excuse me, I'm --
I'm very warm today.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.880
Sorry about that.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.340
So, I was asked -- asked
to talk a little bit

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.110
about -- about the profession.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.050
And we heard a little
bit already about why --

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.860
why libraries are still relevant
today and why should be --

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:37.190
they be in the age of fake news, in
the age of ubiquitous information

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:39.670
where you can literally get
on Google or get on your phone

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:41.980
and find information
almost anywhere.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.730
Why is this profession
still important, right?

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.590
And that has already been
expressed a little bit.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.330
But, what is the library?

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.900
What makes a library, right?

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.840
Most people when they
think of libraries,

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.970
they think of very
large repositories as --

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.840
as this esteemed institution
here, right.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.140
We think of books.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.130
We think of manuscripts,
right, papers, people's papers.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:08.010 position:56%
Before there was email, people would
write memos and actually send them

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:11.330 position:56%
to people, audio recordings, videos.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.160
I was actually a music librarian

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.490
when I was actually still
a practicing librarian.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.790
That's what I did.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.400
I have a Master's degree
in Vocal Performance.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.100
And that's what I did for a little
while before coming over to the --

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.650
to the dark side of
association work.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:26.950
We think about maps.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.420
We think about periodicals, right.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.560
Not too many newspapers
around anymore.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.940
Most of those are in
digital format, but --

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.400
but nevertheless, libraries
traditionally collect all those

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.950
sorts of things, a lot of
the journals that you who are

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.040
in academic institutions,
you know, that --

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.460
that you gain access
to every single day.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.040
So what is the library?

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.490
Well, things have changed a little
bit, right, or maybe quite a lot.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:57.900 position:56%
So libraries are still repositories,
right, places where there are lots

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.540
of collections of things, of these
physical things that you can touch,

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.360 position:56%
that you can smell, that you can
read, that you can take out and take

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.300
to the -- take to the beach,
right, these sorts of things.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.110
But they're also a lot of
different things these days, right.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:14.190
And especially in my context which
is academic in research libraries.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:18.920
It's a lot about digital content,
a lot about digital content.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.390
It's about databases, right.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.550
It's about these large databases
that index the resources

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.160
that you need for your research
papers and that sort of thing

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.910
so that you can go and
perform searches to figure

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.440
out what exactly are the best
resources for the research

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.780
that you're trying to do.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.020
Electronic and digital resources --
that's the actual content, right,

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.910
the actual articles that you
seek out to do your research

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:43.110
or to find information or to
entertain yourself if that's,

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.680
you know, how you choose
to access that information.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.120
A lot of what's happening

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.660
in libraries right now I
think is very exciting.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.720
This is one of the most
exciting pieces of it is

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.890
about maker spaces, right.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.870
And we're talking everything
from, you know,

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:02.370
from primary school age
children to very, very advanced,

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.890
like gaming technology that informs
things like, you know, like --

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.590
like these sophisticated war
modeling and things like that.

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.800
It's really a very
interesting and exciting thing.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.450 position:56%
If you have an opportunity, I -- I
encourage you to get online and look

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.440 position:56%
for the North Carolina State
University, and look for -- There --

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.460
there are videos about
the Hunt Library.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.390
It's a -- a side tech
campus in -- in --

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.440
in the research triangle
in North Carolina.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.130
And they will -- they have some
of the most interesting things

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:34.580
that you'll ever see, huge walls
where they do data visualization.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:38.970
They have gaming areas where
people work with gaming technology

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:42.900
and that sort of thing,
streaming audio and video,

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.420
like these large aggregators,
these people who collect all

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.140
of this content of -- of
speech, of sound, of, you know,

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:54.620
every variety of music and
art that you can imagine,

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.360
and make that content available
just, you know, on your phone

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.540
or on a laptop and data
-- data, data, data.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.550
Data is huge these days, right.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:05.980
I'm sure you all know that.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:11.190
You can make a career out of just
how to manage and describe data.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:15.750
And then thinking about libraries
as really extending much, much,

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.060
much beyond the walls, but
also how it exists in the --

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.410
in virtual reality, right,
and all these resources

00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:25.770
that are interconnected
on a -- on a global scale,

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:29.160
especially with respect to
researchers and that sort of thing

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.100
in terms of sharing resources on
the cloud and that sort of thing.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.480
So did I miss anything?

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.780
Did I miss anything?

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.640
Is the library anything
else to you other

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.290
than what I've articulated
here today

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.390
in just these few bullet points?

00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:46.210
It's people?

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:47.650
Yeah, we'll get there.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:51.600
Yeah, absolutely, yeah it
is people, right, exactly.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.900
Anything else?

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:57.290
No? I've covered it all.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.560
Okay, good, great, excellent, good.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:04.380
So, let's go back to the
people, the people aspect of it.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.360
So what is this, the thing that
we call a librarian, right?

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.420
People who go through formal
education today is largely called a

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.460
Library and Information Science.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.710
There are many different
sectors as I mentioned earlier.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.350
There are those in public
libraries like the one

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.990
that I showed the picture of in
the San Antonio Public Library,

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:26.610
are those who are employed
and engaged in school

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:30.410
as school librarians are
as media specialists.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:34.260
There are academic libraries,
librarians that are focused largely

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.580
on college and university campuses.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.480
And there are special libraries,
things like law libraries,

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.050
things like those who are focused
on health sciences are also science

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.050
and technology, these
sorts of things.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:48.410
So these have been sort

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:51.220
of the largely traditional
categories I think

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.320
of those people of the personnel.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.720
And things are again changing quite
a bit and have changed quite a bit.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.850
So when we think about librarians
today, these are a lot of the --

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:05.250
This is a lot of the taxonomy, a
lot of the language that we used

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.560
to describe the role of
people: public services,

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.270
that traditional reference
librarian that you would go up to

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:14.120 position:56%
at a desk even though those are kind
of disappearing a lot these days,

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.670
right, because of electronic means,
but the one that you would go up

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.020
and ask a reference question to;
access services, the type of person

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.120
that allows access, that will rent
-- that will check out, not rent,

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.090
but check out a book to
you and that sort of thing

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:30.690
or that will organize the
resources in the library;

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.320
instruction librarians --
it's very, very important --

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.190
instruction librarians who teach
people how to think critically

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.750
about those resources
that they're searching

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.070
for when they're doing
research, when they're trying

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.030
to find an answer to a
question, and many, many others.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.750
Technical services is
about description, right.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:51.260 position:56%
It's about creating those taxonomies
and those terms that are going

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:54.750
to help you when you go
to a search engine to --

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.680
to uncover a resource
that you really need;

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:03.130
subject liaison librarians and
getting into the technical part

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:07.520
of it; those who deal with the back
end like the system's librarian

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.980
to deal with the -- the
computer infrastructure

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.580
to make a library work today.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.790
But these days, and on -- on this
other side on the right side of --

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:21.520
of the slide, I have
highlighted some interesting roles

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.360
that are currently in much
demand, in high demand,

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.460
especially in a research
intensive environment --

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.020
in an academic environment.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.890 position:56%
Scholarly publishing or scholarly
communication's librarians that deal

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.940
with all that creative,
that research output,

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.950
all of those journals that are
being published at very, very,

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.650
very high cost to the consumer and
to students who are, you know --

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.660
You've -- you've had to pay
for a lot of these, right;

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:50.210
digital stewardship and digital
archivists, electronic resources.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:55.030
These days in an academic library,
sometimes as much as 70 percent

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.990
of a library's budget can go toward
electronic resources as opposed

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.810
to monograph, as opposed to books,

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:05.940
which by the way sell often even
the traditional book preferred mode

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:10.280
of delivery is often in
the electronic form also.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.750
Things like digital humanities,

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.630
looking across the humanities
disciplines and the engagement

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:24.310
of digital resources and textural
analysis and this sort of thing.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:27.040
User experience and
assessment, looking at things

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.740
like computer human interaction
and that sort of thing; geographic

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.490
and information system, very,
very much in demand today,

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.340
and of course looking at pairing
this with the public services

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:42.890
and the instruction instructional
design, looking at those pedagogies

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:46.830
within an academic institution
that is going to optimize learning

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.980
for students that's going to
allow you to learn as much

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.980
as you possibly can and
position you to find the answers

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.330
to those research questions.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:58.280
So those are some of the
kind of sexier, if you would,

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.890
sexier roles today, as opposed to
information science these days,

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.340
which I can go on a little bit.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.890
We've talked a little bit about it.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:12.610
But in terms of focus on knowledge
management in terms of just,

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.950
you know, taking the scope --

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:21.880 position:56%
a survey of what knowledge is within
the purview is within your personnel

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.210
and that sort of thing; web
services: health informatics,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.660
looking at health information
on a broad scale,

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.890
as well as small scales, looking

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.180
at [inaudible] information,
cyber infrastructure.

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.500 position:56%
We talked about a lot of this, and
looking at information architecture.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.380
In other words, all of the
things behind all of these tools

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.500 position:56%
that you're using on a day to day
basis to find information and how is

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.760
that technology assisting that?

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.500
So, that's a bit about
the profession today.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:54.750 position:56%
There are lots of really interesting
and exciting things -- Oh thank you.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.050
That's great.

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:59.450
I appreciate that -- going on in
the profession and I just wanted

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.180
to give you a little
glimpse about that.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:06.440 position:56%
But for the next few minutes, I just
wanted to talk about the other side

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.210
of what I do, which is why I
think largely I'm here today.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.360
And that is talking about the
diversity of the profession

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.890
and inclusion in profession
-- in the profession.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:20.050
A lot of times, what people
think about when they think

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.320
about diversity is thinking
about this, statistics --

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.090
statistics about representation,
okay.

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:29.000
How many women are in
the profession, right?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.220
How many Latinics are
in the profession?

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.520
That sort of thing, right?

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.510 position:56%
How many people who are veterans are

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.510
in your workforce and
that sort of thing?

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.440
Those things are terribly,
terribly important

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.060
and I think we do have
to think about those.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.940
Librarianship is not real
different from many, many sectors.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.260
It's about -- I mean when we
look overall in terms of sectors,

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:54.550
it's kind of right in the middle,
not quite as good as -- as --

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:59.250
as the military, not quite
as good maybe as education,

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.780 position:56%
but a bit better than other sectors.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.250
And I apologize that
the -- that the --

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:07.200
the slide here is a little
bit strange in its display.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.230
But this is where we are, our
small group of 124 libraries.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:16.960
Actually, this represents 99 of
them in colleges and universities

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.570
in the US because we don't
track those data in --

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:21.290
for our Canadian institutions.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:25.650
But right now are as
effective at 214, 2015,

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:30.610
we had about almost 15 percent
representation of racial

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:33.410
and ethnic minorities if you would,

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.310
people from historically
underrepresented groups.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.600
And that's only representing
those --

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.280
those categories that
are listed there.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.310
This is where we were in 1998.

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:45.610
So we were at about 11.2 percent.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.350
So we haven't grown a heck
of a lot in spite of a lot

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:52.670
of scholarship opportunities and
pipeline programs such as the ones

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.040
that you are participating in.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.400
This is where we are
profession-wide, profession-wide

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.880
within library information science,

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.290
we earn about 12 percent
representation of racial

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.470
and ethnic minorities, okay.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:10.040
So we clearly have a long
way to go if we're going

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.900
to represent the populations
that we serve.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.470
This is what gender looks like
in our university libraries.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.180 position:56%
So we're at about 36.4 percent male.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.940
This is actually -- these
data a little bit older.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.110
The library -- librarianship
in general is

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.420
about actually depending
on what source.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.560
You consult about 82
to 86 percent women.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.970
And then age diversity.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:35.490
It's actually very, very diverse.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:38.080
We're at a stage right now
where we basically have

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.130
about five generations in
the professional workforce

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:43.980
at this particular time,
which creates all kinds

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.430
of interesting challenges I
think and -- and opportunities.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:51.420
And then this is where we are or
this is where we are projected

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:56.420
that we will be in the United
States by 2050 that we will be

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:01.380
at about 50 percent
representation of -- of those --

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.670
those four categories again.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.090
So we have a long way to go.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:10.240
And this is where higher education
is also moving very, very quickly,

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.480
becoming much more
diverse very, very quickly.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.350
So, how are we doing on time?

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:19.880
Okay. I just want to
maybe touch just very,

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.500
very quickly on two
-- two other points.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:28.220
What I see going on in the
work that I do I think has --

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.520
is -- is very, very critical.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:33.810
We are at a critical juncture
here within our profession,

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:36.720
within our society
within the United States.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.120
There has been sort of a -- a
transfer, a thinking if you will,

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.630
a thinking about the state of
diversity which is really only

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:47.780
about a state of being, right, and
thinking about the work that we do

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.650
as centering on inclusion, that is
creating environments where people

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:55.530 position:56%
like you and like me feel welcome,
like we don't have to fake it to fit

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.690
in in these environments
that we -- that --

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.830
in which we work, right
and with our colleagues.

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:03.470
I think that, you know, like the
business sector has been talking

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:08.600
about inclusion for the better part
of probably 25 or 30 years or so.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.130
I like this, you know,
this definition.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.260
Diversity is just the mix of
all of those human identities

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.920
and inclusion is really
making the mix work.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.920
But this is what I see and
you can't see the bottom.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.220
I'm sorry about that.

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:24.450
I'll -- I'll explain to -- This is
where I think we are headed today.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:27.710
This natural progression from
thinking about diversity,

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.550
taking it a step further,
thinking about inclusion

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:34.660
and then even towards equity,
focusing on social justice

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:39.290
and that last little point that
you can't see is de-colonization.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:43.260
I think we are at a stage where
although I think if programs

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.450
like this internship
program that you're involved

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:48.380
with like the scholarship programs
that I manage are terribly,

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.210
terribly important, right.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:54.720
When we think about
diversifying our workforce, right,

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.620
where do we have opportunities
to really affect change?

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.980
We're not going to change
the demographics of the --

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.180
of my age group, the
40 to 60 year olds.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.160
We're not going to
affect change there.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.390
We are going to affect --
affect change at your level,

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.890
at people who are just now entering
whatever professional environment

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:14.220
that you're preparing
yourself to enter, right.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.310 position:56%
Now the idea of colonization I think
is an important one and it's one

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:18.820
that we really have
to think critically

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:25.670
about because it really focuses us
-- forces us to focus on systems,

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:31.910
on those historical barriers
to inequality and to inequity.

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:35.630
Those things that throughout are
-- are throughout our history,

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:36.930
especially a lot of it here

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:40.590
in the US has really created
those systemic barriers

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.330
to true inclusion being created.

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:45.200
So, I could say a lot
more about that.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.840
We'll maybe hopefully we'll
-- we'll save time for that.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.480
Just last few comments.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.810
Thinking about leadership and
thinking about management,

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:57.830
and I want to differentiate
those for you.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:01.630
It's important I think for many of
you to develop managerial skills

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:05.420
that is budgetary management,
like project management skills,

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:09.390 position:56%
these sorts of things, personnel
management skills to better yourself

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:12.700
and to allow yourself to
advance in your profession.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.640
But I want to close thinking
about and give you a challenge

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.310
to be thinking about
leadership and how

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:20.820
that is different than management.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.440
I love these guys,
Kouzes and Posner.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.120
They're very, very big in
the research literature,

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.550
and this is how they
define leadership:

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:34.480 position:56%
the art of mobilizing others to want
to struggle for shared aspirations.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.680
I'm going to go into this just
a little bit more as I close.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.670
I want you think about
-- This also based on --

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.880 position:56%
on that Kouzes and Posner's model --

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.600
about leadership being
everybody's business.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.190
So it's not about positional
authority.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.400
You do not have to be Karla
Hayden to be a leader.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.800
You do not have to be the CEO of
a company to be a leader, right.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.710
Leadership can and should happen
at any layer of an organization.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.480
Leadership is also about
building relationships.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.720
It's about building relationships
with the people that you would

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.790
like to lead that are
willing to embrace your vision

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:10.650
of where you would
like to take them.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.930
It's also about self-development.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.960 position:56%
It's about creating what we say the
leadership -- the leadership says --

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.710
literature says authority
and credibility.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:23.110
So, I challenge you to -- to --

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:25.000
to think about creating a path

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.320
to becoming the best
practitioner you can possibly be

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.020
because that lends
to that credibility.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.100
The best leaders are the
best -- the best learners.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.950
They're always on the path
to improving themselves,

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:39.400
to improving their practice,
and it -- and it is deliberate.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.720
You really have to think about it.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.560
It's also intentional.

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:47.440
A last few things --
last few things.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.270
I would hope that in
whatever you decide to --

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.600
to pursue professionally and --

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.600
and outside of your profession that
the things that you take leadership

00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.160
in align with your values,
with your belief structure.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.860
That is really critical and
that is going to feed you

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.200
as develop yourself as leaders.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.740
Leadership requires modeling.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:11.090
It means that you not only have
to tell people how to act and what

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.500
to do, but you have to
constantly model that behavior

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.610
for the people who
want to follow you.

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:19.430
And it requires vision.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:23.180
It requires a vision that can be
articulated, that can be shared

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.760
and that can -- that
other people can buy into.

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.210
We talked about credibility,
oh goodness, sorry.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.630
And then -- and finally
leadership is about building trust.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:35.440
It's about building trust so that
people will want to follow you

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.990
and that will want to
fully embrace that vision.

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:41.780
So, I'll end up with a
little bit of Dr. Seuss.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:46.170
This is why I think people
from underrepresented groups,

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:50.220
people from your age bracket if
I can be a little ageist here,

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.250
have to think about leadership.

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:55.690
People are often frustrated
with leadership, right -- right?

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.460
People complain about their
bosses if we're talking

00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.180
about managerial leadership.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.720
They -- they complain
about their bosses a lot.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.920
And if you don't take the time to
care an awful lot about the work

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.950
that you're doing and about the
organization that employs you

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:13.480
and if you don't build within
yourself the desire to be a leader,

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.700
then you're leaving leadership
up to some other people

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.650
who maybe don't have the
skills or don't have the vision

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:22.090
or don't have the passion to --

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:27.520
to at least enough to what
you to -- to follow them.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.020
So think about this a little bit,

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:34.070
and we can open this
up for discussion.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.510
Those are my comments.

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.440
Yeah, sure.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.150
Okay, so actually, it's systemic.

00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:00.090
We want to think about systemic.

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:04.370
This is the example that I
give, particularly in academe,

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:06.480
as I think about the --

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.330
the promotion and tenure
system in a traditional --

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.210
How many of you want
to be academics?

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:12.510
You want to be professors?

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.080
Anybody here want to be professors?

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.160
No? You? Yes, you want
to be a professor?

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:20.750 position:56%
Okay. So, thinking about the world
experience and thinking about things

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:22.900
like that are really,
really critical

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:26.310
to people achieving tenure
in a university, right.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:29.180
So permanent status,
continuing status has a lot to do

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.030
with mentorship and it has a lot do

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:34.240
with being -- being
exposed to things.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.220
People from historically
underrepresented groups frequently

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.420 position:56%
do not have that -- that experience.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:40.780
They do not have that world view.

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.050 position:56%
They do not have people and mentors.

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:47.640
It's very, very, very difficult for
them to find people to engage with

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.320
and to have conversations with to
talk about the struggles of what

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.890
that promotion and
tenure process is like.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:56.380
So that systemic thing is that
the system was really built --

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.700
If we think about how
universities were built many, many,

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:03.300
many moons ago, it was
really built to ensure

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:07.960
that the literate classes
stayed in power, right.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.900
That's -- that's really
-- It really wasn't

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.890
about dissemination
at the time, okay.

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:16.740
So that means that there is this
historical legacy that -- that --

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:20.570
that really is built around higher
education that makes it very,

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:26.280
very difficult for people of color
to achieve -- to achieve tenure.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.910
So that's just kind of an example.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.130
I mean I can give you, you
know, lots of other examples

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.840
that are based on economics,
right, that are based

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.940
on any number of different factors.

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:38.760

excellent question.

Yeah.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.400
&gt;&gt; Can you repeat the question?

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.700
&gt;&gt; Mark Puente: Sure.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:06.290
What can be done to recruit

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:10.070
or to encourage more minorities
to enter librarianship?

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:12.960
I would -- I would say that
-- Can I expand that question?

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.970
And let's talk about any field.

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:21.100
So, I think that -- Let me give you
an example in -- in librarianship.

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.950
You know, we've had these
programs, these scholarships,

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:26.240
these pipeline programs that
have been very, very beneficial

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.940
that have offered lots of money.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.540
I -- I was a product
of one of those.

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.800
I'm a graduate of the
University of Arizona program.

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.980
They have a program called
The Knowledge River Program,

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.920
which focuses specifically
on Latinics and made

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.040
of American populations to try to
recruit them into librarianship.

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:46.120
So, I got that second Masters with
no student loan debt, which is a --

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.500
a social justice issue
by the way, right --

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.360
right, social justice because of
the finances involved with that.

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.240
So, but -- but here's the thing.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.140
The recruitment addresses
the numbers,

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.830
but it doesn't address retention.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:03.300
The 12 percent that I talked about
of representation across racial

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.900
and ethnic minorities within
the profession has been static

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:09.600
for about 20 -- about 20 years
in spite of a lot of programs.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.160
So we are only able -- being
able to recruit as many people

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.900 position:56%
from historically underrepresented
groups, as there is attrition, okay.

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:20.110
Now, a lot of them -- There could
be lots of reasons for attrition,

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:23.500 position:56%
but we know from research that one
of the reasons there is attrition is

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.500
because people are going to
higher paying sectors, right,

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:30.490
but also because frequently
they are encountering barriers,

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:34.940
barriers to promotion, to
continuance, that sort of thing.

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.280
And they're finding in
many -- in many instances,

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.360
they're finding the
institutions and the organizations

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.610
where they are employed and engaged
to be less than inclusive, right,

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:46.790
where they don't feel welcomed,
where they do feel like they

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:50.350
in order to be successful, they
have to really kind of fake it.

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:52.500
They have to, you know, play
the game and act like, you know,

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.420
they're from majority
cultures, and that's very,

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.200
very difficult and
very disheartening.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.730
And that is why some people leave.

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:00.640
So, I think it's a very --
that's a very long answer to say

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:05.380
that if we can focus on culture
and building cultures of inclusion

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:10.940
and also to think about what --
what interventions are necessary,

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:14.210
you know, what do we as
leaders, people, you know,

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:19.380
who are in positional authority,
what do they have to do to instill

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:25.340
within their organization
an authentic commitment

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:27.370
to create an inclusive environment?

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.570
That is a very, very difficult
conversation, but luckily,

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.240
you know from my vantage point
with the ARL, which our --

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.750
our member representatives
are all the --

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:37.730
the CEOs, they're all the deans,
the directors, the university --

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:41.080
the head librarians of these
large organizations, those are --

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.040
those are conversations that
they are much more willing

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.340
to have these days.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.490
And so I'm very excited
about the future of that.

well at the ARL, the Association

We take people out of their work
-- everyday workplace context,

although I think LC focused
specifically on this institution

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:14.910
and -- and allows people to --

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:18.390
to take time out of their days
to develop these interests

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:20.560

all what are the philosophies,

what are the theories behind
developing yourself as the leader

that -- that -- that myself --

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:39.910
I mean what I have found
with working with students

that are largely graduate students
is that -- I mean they are eager.

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:50.310
They are really eager to
lead conversations, projects,

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:54.290
initiatives, whatever that sort of
thing is, and what we need to do

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:56.830
as leaders is simply
give them the agency

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.750
to -- to -- to let them do it.

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.050
I mean leadership is about --

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:02.870
I think true leadership is
about cultivating the talent

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:06.220
within your constituency
whatever that is,

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:08.610
and then letting them do it,
right, just letting them go.

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:12.330
And sometimes that means
allowing them to fail, right.

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:13.630
But hopefully you have the --

mentoring capacity behind that to --

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:18.100

You know, hopefully
that -- that exists.

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.830
But I think that --
that's largely --

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:25.470
Most of it is allowing
that person or those people

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:28.100
to develop those interests,
to develop those skills

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.810
and then giving them a really --

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:37.370 position:56%

those skills and see where it goes.

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:26.870
&gt;&gt; Eric Eldritch: How many
of you know the libraries

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:31.260
that specialize in
your career's field?

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:32.850
So if you were into agriculture,

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:34.870
there's the National
Agricultural Library.

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:36.170
&gt;&gt; Mark Puente: Right.

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:37.470
&gt;&gt; Eric Eldritch: But it's
also important for you to --

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:40.040
to understand that you
have a home library.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:43.340
So how many of you still have a
library card from your home area?

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:47.950
Maybe. One of the things
that I've noticed is

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:49.740
that information is
becoming expensive.

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.840
And it's really important
for us to look at this.

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.400
If you've looked a local
newspaper, you found that there --

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.070
they want to charge
you a subscription fee.

00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:02.730
You get three articles a month
that you get -- that you get.

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:06.470
After that, you need to pay
for those kinds of things.

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:12.470
Having a membership in your
local library, maintaining a link

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:16.390
with your school library, allows
you to have other open doors,

00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:19.680
and I think that that's the part
of librarianship that is going

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:22.620
to lead you and your
generation to be able to figure

00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:26.120
out other smarter ways to
continue to have access.

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.560

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.860

&gt;&gt; Mark Puente: Yeah.

00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:35.330
I mean, I just -- I mean, just
to reiterate what you said,

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:37.910
I think we're in a -- in
an environment where --

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:40.930
where information -- I mean it's
so ubiquitous and it's really,

00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:42.950
really difficult to -- to --

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:47.870
to manage that and to figure
out what is most relevant to us

00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:50.120
because this is going to
help us inform, you know,

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.480
who we are as citizens, you know
and -- and things like, you know,

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:57.060
where we -- we donate and who
we vote for and, you know,

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.330
what schools we support and
what school policies we support

00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:00.630
and that sort of thing.

critical to -- to think about how --

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.970
how that filter is
developed within you.

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:10.310

probably more important

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:12.360

01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:38.360
We hope that your experience at the
Library of Congress is something

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.010
that will whet your appetite,
that you will come back,

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:42.650
bring your friends,
bring your families.

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:44.650
We have weekend tours, but there's

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.770
so much available at
your fingertips.

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:48.610
So do visit us onsite and online.

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:51.510
Thank you very much for coming
to the Library of Congress.

01:00:51.510 --> 01:01:02.390
