00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.569
We are days away
from the 2016 election,

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:05.138
and the country
hasn't been this divided

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.806
since way back a few weeks ago

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.308
when we were all fighting about
that picture of the dog wearing

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:11.444
pants two different ways!
I don't know!

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.479
I don't know
what the right answer is!

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:16.249
-They both seem plausible!
-(laughter)

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.683
But if there's one thing

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.419
that can bring us together,
it's Starbucks.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.320
Ah, Starbucks.

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:23.890
Their new cup features a mosaic
of over 100 diverse people

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.324
who would never actually hang
out in real life,

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:27.326
but it's a nice thought.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.795
Meant to be a symbol of unity.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.430
And it worked,
'cause everyone loves it.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.665
Oh, wait. They don't,
'cause (bleep) the Internet.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:33.866
(laughter)

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.368
"Now that

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.071
"beloved diversity
has blown up in our faces,

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:41.307
"the libs @Starbucks
have begun shilling for unity.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.811
LOL, comma, comma, comma,
how typical."

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.279
(laughter)

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.081
What does that even mean?!

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.083
How do you shill for unity?

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.884
It's not a corporation.
It's a concept!

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:53.453
How does this possibly
anger you?

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:56.155
-Take your meds, Philip.
Take them. -(laughter)

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:58.524
Do you not have
a single real problem?

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:01.160
"I don't drink Coke
'cause the can is communist red.

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:02.895
"Don't even get me started
on Twizzlers.

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:05.431
-That candy aisle is rigged!
It's rigged!" -(laughter)

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:08.434
People are using the cup
as an excuse to be angry,

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.603
much like I'm using it
to be sarcastic.

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.839
So, comedians,
manufacture some outrage

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.907
about the delightful new
Starbucks cup. Tiffany.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.777
The cup doesn't really represent
actual Starbucks customers.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.213
Where are the people that are
masturbating in the bathroom?

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.215
-I'm just saying. -Yeah, yeah,
yeah, points, yeah, yeah.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.950
(laughter, applause)

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.853
Well, uh, fap and a frappe.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.122
-That should be their new, uh...
-(laughter)

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.723
(applause and cheering)

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.825
That should be their new motto?

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:36.529
Company tag line?

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.197
Brian.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.466
My Coffee Bean Aryan Nation
travel mug

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.201
holds way more coffee.

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:44.003
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:46.038
Points. Jim.

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.508
To get outraged, just use the
regular Starbucks cup,

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.309
but put Dunkin' Donuts coffee
in there.

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:52.044
HARDWICK: Yeah, all right.
That's the way to do it.

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:53.546
-(laughter, applause)
-Points to Jim Jefferies.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.379
Switch it up, switch it up.
