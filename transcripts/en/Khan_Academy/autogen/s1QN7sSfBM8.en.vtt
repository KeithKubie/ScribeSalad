00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.420
 . 

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.500
 Let's do a few tricky tasks. This tells us that 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.770
 Nadia is at home and Peter is in a school that is 6 miles away 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.660
 away from home. 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.820
 Let me draw a small chart here. 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.230
 So Nadia is there. 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.950
 Peter is there and they are 6 miles apart. 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.470
 So, this is the distance between home and school. 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.115
 It's 6 miles. 

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:25.630
 6 miles. 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.440
 They begin to travel to each other at the same time. 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.360
 They both leave at the same time traveling 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.680
 to each other. 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.890
 Nadia runs at 3 and 1/2 miles per hour. 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:44.460
 It moves 3.5 miles in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.990
 hour in that direction. 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.150
 And Peter drives a skateboard with 6 miles in 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.060
 hour in that direction. 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.160
 Peter goes in that direction 6 miles per hour. 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.410
 When they will meet you and how far away they are from home 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.980
 the place of their meeting? 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.200
 Let's say the place of their meeting is right - 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.390
 I do not know. 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.120
 It will be closer to home because this boy 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.000
 moves faster. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.630
 Peter moves faster. 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.020
 So let's say let x be equal to the distance 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.270
 from home to the place of their meeting. 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.340
 The distance from home. 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.120
 So this distance will be x. 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.750
 So how much will this distance be? 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.300
 If this is x and the whole thing is 6 miles, then 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.460
 this distance there will be 6 minus x. 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.760
 So Nadia will travel x miles, and Peter will 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.400
 travels 6 minus x miles. 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.340
 And they will travel the same amount of time. 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.730
 Remember that they both leave from time 0 and in time t, they 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.050
 both will meet right there. 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.050
 So, both will use the same amount of time. 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.180
 Nadia's equation, if we just do not forget the way is 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.510
 equal to the speed in time, we could use this for both, 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.950
 in the case of Nadia, the road she travels is x. 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.280
 x will be equal to its speed, which is 3.5 miles in 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.410
 hour, multiplied by t, which is the time it travels. 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.660
 And then, Peter's equation will be his way. 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.880
 It travels 6 minus x miles, so it's 6 minus x, 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.190
 will be equal to its speed, which is 6 miles per hour 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.600
 the time he travels. 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.960
 He also travels t hours, so on t. 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.660
 So, we have two equations and two unknowns, so 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.420
 we can solve them. 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.840
 We have already found x here. 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.660
 So, let's replace that for x there. 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.510
 We can rewrite this equation as 6 minus, but 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.390
 instead of x, we can put 3.5t, 6 minus 3.5t because 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.160
 we know that x is equal to 3.5t, is equal to 6t. 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.270
 And then let's see if we add 3.5t to both sides of this 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:17.130
 equation we get 6 equals 3.5t plus 6t is 9.5t or if 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:27.880
 we divide both sides to 9.5, we get t equal to 6 on 9.5 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.110
 hour, which is a small special number. 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.520
 But 9.5, we can write this again. 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.670
 It's the same thing as 6 on - see, 9.5 - that's it 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.020
 same as 19/2, right? 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.530
 19/2 by dividing it and getting 9.5. 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.620
 So, this is equal to 6 in 2 on 19. 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.860
 So, this is equal to 12/19 of an hour. 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.290
 That's how long it takes them to meet. 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.210
 And then, if you ask, at what distance from home 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.170
 will they meet? 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.310
 If you want to find the value of x, x will be 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.390
 equal to 3.5 - in fact, instead of writing 3.5, I can 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.779
 to write 3.5 as 7/2. This is the same thing as 3.5 - ours 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.672
 time, on 12/19. 

00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:25.740
 So, divide the numerator and the denominator into 2 and 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.360
 you get 7 by 6 and 42 for 19 miles. 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.230
 And this is in hours. 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.110
 So, after 12/19 of an hour - it's a special liver - they will 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.560
 meet exactly 42/19 miles from home. 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.580
 It's just over 2 miles from home. 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.150
 The next task. 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.760
 Peter bought a couple of Staples notebooks for $ 2.25. 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.650
 And he bought a few more notebooks in 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.650
 Right Aid for $ 2 each. 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.900
 He has spent the same amount of money in both places and 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.620
 has bought 17 notebooks in total. 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.530
 How many notebooks did he buy in each of the two stores? 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.320
 So let's define some variables. 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:22.120
 Let S be equal to the number purchased in Staples. 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.990
 And then we could say that R is equal to the number purchased 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.910
 by Wright Eid. 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.870
 So what do we know? 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.430
 What do we know? 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.630
 He bought a total of 17 notebooks. 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.800
 Let me do this in a different color. 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.550
 He bought a total of 17 notebooks. 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.330
 This tells us that S plus R is equal to 17. 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.600
 We also know that he spent the same amount of money 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.320
 in both places. 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.110
 So, how much did he spend on Wright Aid? 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.990
 Let me do that in orange. 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.190
 He spent the same amount of money in both places. 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.210
 So, how much did he spend on Staples? 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:21.940
 He bought S notebooks for $ 2.25 each, so 2.25S, that's it 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.345
 how much he spent at Staplers. 

00:06:23.345 --> 00:06:29.290
 Spent at Staples. 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.030
 This will be equal to the amount that 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.930
 has spent at Wade Ad. 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.340
 He spends $ 2 on a Wright notebook. 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.540
 $ 2 for a Wright Note notebook. 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.310
 So, $ 2 on the number of notebooks by Wright Eid, 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.680
 this is spent in Wright Aid. 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.890
 Once again, two equations with two unknowns. 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.710
 Maybe we could make a little substitution here. 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.900
 What is the best way to substitute here? 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.870
 Okay, let's share the two sides of it 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.070
 equation here at 2. 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.350
 So, you have - I will write again 2.2 - just will 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.950
 i do it so .. 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.590
 So, you have R. 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.570
 If you divide both sides to that of 2, you have 2.25 on 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.360
 2S is equal to R, right? 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.750
 I just divided the two sides of this with 2. 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:27.080
 So, if you take that value and replace it for R 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:34.540
 there, this equation becomes S plus - instead 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:44.930
 R, we have 2.25 on 2S is equal to 17. 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.610
 Let's make it simple. 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.200
 This is 1 - we can treat it as 2 on 2S, right? 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.200
 The odds there are only 1. 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.310
 So, we can see this as if we had one common denominator. 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:02.550
 This is the same thing as 4.25 on 2S is equal to 17. 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.710
 I avoid doing any difficult math yet. 

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.280
 Let's multiply both sides on the contrary. 

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.390
 2 / 4.25. 

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.490
 It 's a bit strange to have expressions at the same time 

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.045
 a fraction and a decimal number, but this is not illegal. 

00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:21.680
 Let's multiply both by 2 / 4.25. 

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.720
 These are canceled and so you get S equals 17 by 2, 

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.360
 is 34 on 4.25. 

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.850
 And in fact, I can see that ... 

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:40.169
 It seems like this should be equal to 8, right? 

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:48.300
 4.25 is 4 and 1/4, which is the same as 17 on 4. 

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.530
 So, that's the same thing as 34 on 17/4, which is 

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.750
 the same as 34 in 4/17. 

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.690
 You put 1 there, divided by 17, you get 2, divided by 17, 

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.210
 you get 1, 2 by 4 is 8. 

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.530
 So, he bought 8 notebooks in Staples, that's 8, then 

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:15.940
 in Wright Eid, bought - 8 plus R equals 17. 

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.820
 You remove 8 from both sides. 

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.920
 He must have bought nine notebooks at Wright Ad. 

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.540
 Let's make one more. 

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.400
 This is especially fun. 

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.980
 Peter is outside watching his pigs 

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.430
 chickens in the yard. 

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.310
 Nadya is inside and can not see the animals. 

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.590
 Peter gives her a mystery. 

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:40.200
 He tells her that he has counted 13 heads and 36 legs and asks 

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.540
 how many pigs and how many chickens are in the yard. 

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.520
 So, let's redefine our variables. 

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.160
 P equals the number of pigs. 

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.510
 Let C be equal to the number of chickens. 

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.550
 So, the number of chapters will essentially be the number of 

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.660
 pigs and chickens, assuming that each one has one head. 

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.920
 So, the number of pigs plus the number of chickens will be 

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.190
 equal to the number of heads, right here. 

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.490
 This is 13 chapters. 

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.160
 And then 4 on the number of pigs, right? 

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.460
 Each pig has 4 legs, so 4 on the number of pigs plus 

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.410
 2 on the number of chicks, assuming that 

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.130
 we deal with two-legged chickens, will be equal 

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:30.100
 of the number of legs equals 36. 

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.400
 Once again, we have two equations with two unknowns. 

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.750
 Instead of solving them with a substitution, I will 

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.230
 by collecting and subtracting the two equations. 

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.990
 What we can do, this equation we can 

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.740
 multiply by 2. 

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.240
 And when I say we multiply it by 2, we have to multiply it 

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.720
 the whole equation by 2. 

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.970
 So it's still true. 

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.590
 We multiply the whole equation by 2. 

00:10:53.590 --> 00:11:00.150
 This becomes 2P plus 2C equals 26. 

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.250
 And now what I'm gonna do is get this out 

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.790
 equation of this equation you can do. 

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.660
 Since this is equal to this, it is equal to this and so 

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.270
 we do nothing that violates the laws of the algebra. 

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.720
 So, if you subtract the equation from the above 

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.840
 equation or I can just put a minus sign everywhere 

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.760
 here, so that you know that we take out, 

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.650
 4P minus 2P is 2P. 

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.530
 2C minus 2C is 0. 

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.440
 This is why I did so in order for these to be canceled. 

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.750
 And then 36 minus 26 is equal to 10. 

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.670
 So, 2P equals 10. 

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.830
 We divide the two sides into 2. 

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.910
 We have 5 pigs. 

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:42.440
 And then, this plus 5 the number of chickens is equal to 13, so 

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.630
 we must have - we get 5 on both sides - 8 chickens. 

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.420
 Now, if this confuses you, you might want to try 

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.750
 with a substitution, but I have a lot of videos to solve systems 

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.430
 from equations, where I drive a bit slower and explain 

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.710
 little more than the logic of that. 

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.280
 So, what is best for you. 

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.500
 But anyway, Nadia must be true or true 

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.150
 to receive 5 pigs and 8 chickens. 

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.160
 And that must be true, is not it? 

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.280
 You have 13 animals. 

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.620
 You have 13 chapters. 

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:15.480
 And if you multiply 5 by 4, which is 20 pig legs plus 16 

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.190
 chicken legs. 

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.400
 20 plus 16 is 36 feet total. 

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:19.866
 .
