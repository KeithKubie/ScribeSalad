00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
If you’ve ever bought a new phone, a t-shirt or,
well, basically anything, it’s probably come a long
way – maybe even from a different continent!

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.980
That’s possible almost entirely because
of shipping – as in the kind with actual ships.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.680
Shipping is responsible for supporting
90% of global trade, from the latest toys to
life-saving  medicine.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.020
As the world grows increasingly connected,
we’re all looking to send and receive more
stuff than ever before.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.940
The weight of all those seaborne products
has grown by more than a quarter just in
the last decade.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.060
Although you probably don’t give it much
thought, getting all those ships safely across
the ocean is a big challenge.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:41.580
Ships have to contend with waves, sea life,
corrosion, and more on their journey to deliver
what we want, where we need it.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.980
To design vessels capable of weathering everything
thrown their way, you’ll need marine engineering.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:57.000
[Theme Music]

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.520
You might think that, after looking at nuclear
meltdowns, cheese catastrophes, and earthquakes, a
bit of water wouldn’t be the toughest thing to tackle.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.360
But the ocean isn’t just one big, wet blob.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.780
Below its depths lies a world of chemical,
biological, and physical complexity that throws
up all sorts of challenges.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.120
Which is why marine engineering has very different
considerations than the kind on land or in the air.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.840
Marine engineers work on pretty much anything
that will be spending time in water.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.220
Ships definitely fall in that category, but
so do structures like offshore oil rigs and
wind farms.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.900
For all of these things, marine engineers
need a broad knowledge of mechanical,
electrical and even civil engineering.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.320
They have to bring together fluid
mechanics, materials design, power generation,
and computer architecture

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.300
to build things that are totally independent
from the resources available on land.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.000
Although there are some very different challenges
for traveling vessels and permanent installations,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.240
they share many of the same problems in coping
with the tough environment of the sea.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.440
For starters, as any seasoned sailor can tell
you, the surface of the ocean is rarely perfectly calm.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.959
You’re dealing with huge swathes of dense
liquid colliding with everything you design.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.340
A cubic meter of water weighs a metric ton,
which gives crashing waves a force comparable
to that of a moving car.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.440
Even when the swells are small, water can
easily creep into structures and start causing
problems.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.140
Which is why in marine engineering, your first
goal is often to make something that’s watertight.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.700
As well as being an obvious problem for ships,
water leakage can end up short circuiting an undersea
cable or the electronics in mining machinery.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.320
The deeper you go, the more water there is
pushing down from above, which means more
pressure.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.100
That makes the challenge of making submarines
mechanically intact and watertight even trickier.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:44.200
To test the capabilities of something like a submarine
hatch, engineers will subject it to trials such as spraying
it with a high pressure hose and checking for any leaks.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.700
You can even locate tiny leaks that the hose test can’t
pick up by placing an ultrasound emitter on one side of
the hatch and checking if it can be detected on the other.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.800
By tracing the source of the sound through the edge
of the hatch, you can find and fix any small gaps that
might allow water into the submarine or air out!

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.960
Of course, ships don’t just sit in the water
– they need to move!

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.000
Water is 800 times denser than air and while
a ship moves, it’s constantly pushing water
out of the way.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.100
Fortunately, propellers actually take advantage
of that density.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.800
As the propeller spins, the blades are angled
to take the water around them and push it out
behind the ship.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.860
The more mass the propeller throws out the
back, the more it pushes the ship forward.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.080
That’s just conservation of momentum in
action!

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.520
To help with this, a propeller’s blades are shaped
such that water flows around and past them more
efficiently, like the wings of a plane.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.120
Unfortunately, ship propellers face some challenges
their airborne cousins don’t.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.120
When the blades revolve at high speeds, they
essentially boil parts of the surrounding water.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.420
And that’s not because the propeller heats the water
up, but because of the huge pressure difference on
either side of the rotating blades.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.480
That creates tiny bubbles of steam.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.000
And when those bubbles collapse, they
send out a shockwave that hits the propeller
in a process called cavitation.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.120
It might not seem like bubbles could cause much
damage, but cavitation can apply as much force as
whacking the blades with a hammer!

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.420
Over time, this can cause a serious warp and
prevent them from working efficiently.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.500
Cavitation crops up when the blades need to
rotate quickly to generate a large propulsive force.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.240
You can slow them down to avoid cavitation,
but that lowers the thrust the propeller provides.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.120
Unless you’re willing to get creative.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.180
The US Navy’s Ohio-class submarines
replace the standard three-blade propeller
design with one containing seven.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:30.120
These propellers are shaped to generate more thrust
at low speeds, enabling them to provide enough force
to move the submarine with much less cavitation.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.000
The Navy considers this such a breakthrough
that the exact details of the design have
been classified for decades.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.420
The exact details of any propeller depend
on the mass of the ship and the speed at which
it needs to travel.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.620
Fluid mechanics and thermodynamics are key,
since water temperature and pressure will
affect performance.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.420
And it’s not just the propeller’s design
that matters, but what it’s made of.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.760
In fact, what the whole ship is made of.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.440
Since metals are relatively easy to shape
and can withstand large amounts of pressure
without deforming,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.300
they’re the go-to material for constructing
the hull of a ship.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.660
But over time, metals and water don’t get
along so well!

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.300
Water contains a lot of oxygen, so submerging
a metal can lead to a chemical reaction called
oxidation.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.220
You’re probably familiar with at least iron
oxide, which is more commonly known as rust!

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.400
Oxidation corrodes the hull, causing it to
lose material and become brittle.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.160
Corrosion is a serious problem for any metal
structure in long-term contact with water.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.460
The more they corrode, the weaker they become!

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.060
The kind of chemical reaction that marine
engineers often worry about is galvanic corrosion.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.400
This happens when parts of an object are made
of different metals, such as having an aluminum
hull and a stainless steel propeller.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.420
Aluminum is chemically reactive, while steel
is relatively inert.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.860
And that difference is the heart of the problem.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:49.920
Saltwater is really good at conducting electrical
currents, which means it can carry a stream of
charged particles from the hull to the propeller!

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.380
And as the current draws molecules of aluminum
away from the hull, it leaves a corroded surface behind.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.620
To prevent this, marine engineers often use sacrificial
anodes, which are basically just slabs of zinc.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:08.520
It’s called an anode because it acts like the anode in
a battery: it gives up charged particles that create a
current between itself and other metal parts of the ship.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.820
Because zinc is much more reactive than
aluminum, it releases molecules more easily
and undergoes corrosion first.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.180
That’s the “sacrifice” it makes to prevent
the structural hull from corroding instead.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.220
Another way to stop corrosion is to purposefully
put a weak current through the hull that cancels out
the one produced by the flowing saltwater.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.940
Now, so far, we’ve mostly been talking about
the problems that water causes.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.290
But the ocean is more than just water, it’s
an entire ecosystem.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.580
In practice, large animals like sharks and
whales aren’t what you need to be worried about.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.280
It’s the small things like algae, mussels,
and barnacles that cause real trouble.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.640
These forms of sea life physically attach
to the hulls of ships and build up over time,
normally while it’s docked or stationary.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:54.720
Over time, all that living matter creates bumps
on the hull’s surface that make it less aerodynamic,
an effect known as fouling.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:02.640
Fouling forces the propellers to work harder as the
ship travels, burning up to 30% more fuel to compensate
for the roughness of the hull slowing it down!

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.100
The simplest way of dealing with this is to
just regularly clean the hull and remove anything
stuck to it.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.940
But in recent years, engineers have come up
with more sophisticated solutions to fouling,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.360
like special coatings that make the metal
too slippery for barnacles and mussels to attach.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.080
There are problems to think about above the
surface, too.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.500
Since ships are totally independent from the
infrastructure available on land, marine engineers
have to tackle everything themselves.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.120
That means knowing how to supply power,
maintain a comfortable temperature onboard,
and deal with waste storage.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.980
Big ships are like floating cities, so marine
engineers work on everything from fuel cells
to navigation systems!

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:42.440
But even after you have a basic ship design,
knowing what your ship will need is a very different
thing from actually putting it together.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.800
Even without any cargo, container ships can
weigh thousands of tonnes!

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.409
So you can’t usually build one on land,
pick it up, and put it into the water.

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:52.930
When it comes to construction, marine engineers
have to get creative.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:58.460
You could build everything on a shipway, essentially
a big ramp that lets the ship just slide into the water.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.240
But in the case of a large ship, like an oil
tanker, a better option would be to use a
dry dock.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.500
Dry docks are basins near the sea that can
be sealed off and drained so that ships can
be built inside.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:14.360
There, they can be constructed, made watertight,
and tested rigorously without any interference
from seawater.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:23.120
Once engineers have made any final touches,
getting the ship into the water is as simple as
flooding the dry dock and re-opening the gates
into the sea, so it can be towed out.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.300
Similar ideas are also used to build permanent
structures like parts of offshore oil platforms,

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.380
constructing each piece on a dry dock so they
can be carried out to sea and assembled.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.900
So as you can see, it’s no easy task putting
together ships and getting them into the ocean.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.060
But as more goods are moved around, the world
is going to need more ships.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.860
In this episode, we looked at marine engineering.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:50.680
We saw how ships are designed to handle aquatic
environments and challenges of engineering in the
ocean, like corrosion and marine life.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.500
We also looked at some solutions engineers
employ to overcome them.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.740
Finally, we saw one of the ways large maritime
structures can be built on land and eventually
transferred into water.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:07.780
Next time, we’ll look at how to take water
from the sea and turn it into something we can
drink, with the help of engineering design.
