00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
In the last video, I talked
about the two campaigns that

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.860
eventually lead to Napoleon's
downfall.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.510
One of those was the Peninsular
Campaign.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.860
Where Napoleon and the French
Empire had to waste a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.060
significant amount of resources
fighting and trying

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.460
to hold Spain.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.530
And the other, almost more
direct catalyst for the fall

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.630
of Napoleon, was his
invasion of Russia.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.110
We're going to see in this is
video why it was so disastrous

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.600
for Napoleon.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.560
This is easily one of the top
five, I would say, famous

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.480
military campaigns in
all of history.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.970
So let's remind ourselves the
relationship between Napoleon,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.110
or between the French
Empire and Russia.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.740
After the Fourth Coalition, you
might remember the Treaty

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:03.100
of Tilsit, they're friends.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.440
Russia was part of the
Continental System, which

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.700
means that they would boycott
or that they would not trade

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.710
with Britain.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.200
Or allow Britain to use
any of Russia's ports.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.090
And Russia was allowed to do
anything that they want with

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.990
the Ottoman Empire.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.730
So everything was good.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.750
But then we move forward
to 1811.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.090
We're in 1811 and Russia
starts relaxing the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.340
Continental System.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.240
Essentially meaning that they
started to trade a little bit

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.840
with Britain.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.760
So this all of a sudden begins
to annoy, it angers Napoleon.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.740
In order for an embargo to
work, in order for the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.290
Continental System to work,
everyone on the continent has

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.300
to not trade with Britain.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.310
Because if someone trades with
Britain, Britain could just

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.560
trade with them and then that
trade could circulate through

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.320
the rest of Europe.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.730
So in order for this to work,
it has to be total.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.080
So this already annoys
Napoleon.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.040
Especially because he defeated
the Russians

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.199
in the Fourth Coalition.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.650
In the Treaty of Tilsit
he thought he was

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.650
being nice to them.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.110
Just don't do any trade with
Great Britain, we're going to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.630
be good buddies.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.750
But then what really got
Napoleon is in 1812, he hears

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.230
that Russia is thinking about
taking the French Empire's

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.600
part of Poland, or the
Duchy of Warsaw.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:41.850
So Russia thinking about
taking Poland.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.360
So Napoleon figures, gee, we're
no longer friends, I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.690
better attack them
preemptively.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.330
So against the advice of a lot
of people about actually

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.820
invading Russia, Napoleon
decides to invade.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:04.290
So this directly leads
to Napoleon invading.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.090
And his other option, obviously,
would have been

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.950
just to defend Poland
from Russia.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.020
But Napoleon, he just says no,
look if they're going to

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.810
double cross me like that, I'm
just going to go full tilt and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.790
show them who's boss.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.380
So he decides to invade
in April of 1812.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.550
And Napoleon is no dummy.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.980
He realizes that the Russian
winter is really vicious.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.470
So he says, if I start in the
late spring like this and I

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.210
engage the Russians and I
decisively defeat them,

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.300
everything will be
said and done.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.140
And I'll be Emperor of
Russia, as well.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.960
Before Russia even begins
to get cold.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.330
So what I'm going to do here,
to just understand how

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.660
devastating this campaign ends
up being to Napoleon, I'm

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.750
going to use one of the
most famous charts in

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.780
the history of charts.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.060
Some people consider this
to be the best, most

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.400
well-designed chart ever.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.050
And this was created
by Charles-- let

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.910
me use another color.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.325
I keep using this.

00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:11.310
This was created by Charles
Joseph Minard.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.279
You can actually get a bigger
version of this on Wikipedia.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.820
But that was too big
for my screen.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.440
So this is a smaller version.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.770
But it's a fascinating chart.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.600
So what it shows is the size
of Napoleon's army as it

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.860
invades Russia.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.670
And the size of the army is
shown by the width of this

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.330
brown line right here.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.900
So when he starts invading
Russia, he has 450,000 men.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.300
If you could read this number,
that's what it says.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.990
And you can find zoomed
versions on the web.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.380
If you just do a search on this
and on the invasion of

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.040
Russia, you'll find
this chart.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.400
It's very, very famous.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.370
More than even teaching you the
history, this is also just

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.480
a neat chart to look at.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.310
And it's something that
you should be

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.030
exposed to at some point.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.660
But as you can see, and just
so you have some scope of

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.030
what's going on, not only does
it show you the size of his

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.690
forces, it shows the path
that it travels.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.040
And you can already see that as
the forces are travelling,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.130
the number of the soldiers in
the force is getting smaller

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.550
and smaller.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.000
And he keeps updating
the numbers.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.900
So obviously that width is
smaller than that width, by it

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.690
looks like it's less than half
the forces at this point than

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.300
at this point.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.490
And just to understand where
this is going on, here is a

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.840
map of Eastern Europe.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.930
And Charles Joseph Minard's map
starts right around here

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.550
in Lithuania.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.750
So this is where the Napoleon
forces were strongest, where

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.220
he had 450,000.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.530
And it kind of goes like this.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.830
This is Moscow right here.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.130
So this is kind of
the endpoint.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.290
And if I were to trace this
shape onto here, it would look

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.650
something like this.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.030
I'm just trying to
show the path.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.940
Roughly like this.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.850
And then you get to Moscow.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.130
So that line is the same
thing as that line.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.700
Just so you have some context
within the broader

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.800
geography of Europe.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.100
So it's starting off, in what's
almost exactly the

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.240
northeastern border of
present-day Poland, or you

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.930
could say the southwestern
border

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.260
of what's now Lithuania.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.290
Crosses through what
is now Belarus.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.320
And then goes on into Russia.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.770
Now, as you can see here, I
already pointed out, that as

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.830
he's traveling, as the forces
are travelling, these 450,000

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.530
men, horses, and armaments, and
cannons, and everything

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.110
else is getting thinner
and thinner.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.120
And one is, it's just basic
military logistics.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.100
You have to keep your
supply routes open.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.310
You have to keep leaving men
behind to essentially guard

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.250
the supply routes.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.640
So just as the longer your
campaign, and the further into

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.540
enemy territory you have, you
have to keep leaving men

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.800
behind to guard it.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.320
And this whole time, Napoleon
kept wanting to engage with

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.000
the Russians.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.850
The whole time that he was
travelling, he kept expecting

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.060
to engage the Russians.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.460
But just as he was about to
engage the Russians, the

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.860
Russians would back
up a little bit.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.800
And this kept happening.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.070
They're were small skirmishes,
so obviously he lost some

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.120
troops here or there.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.090
But most of this was just to
maintain the supply line.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.560
Eventually, he is able to have,
I guess we could say, a

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.520
skirmish, I don't want to say
a skirmish, it was actually

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.740
maybe a brief battle
with the Russians

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.420
in August in Smolensk.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.760
And that is, let me make sure
I get it right on the map,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.530
right there.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.660
But once again, Napoleon
was victorious.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.790
But the Russians retreated, it
wasn't a decisive victory over

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.210
the Russian army.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.990
Eventually, he just keeps
chasing them, keeps chasing

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:06.870
them, until we get to
September 7, 1812.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.360
And now you could imagine that
we're kind of in the fall now.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.620
And it gets cold quickly
out here in Russia.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.050
So already, it's getting to be a
kind of precarious position.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.330
But Napoleon is confident.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.060
He's like, you know what?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.300
If I can decisively defeat the
Russians, I can take Moscow.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.070
Moscow will have food it in.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.980
And all will be said and done.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.830
And that's actually brings
up another point.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.020
You might remember when I talked
about the War of the

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.140
Third Coalition, that Napoleon,
and in general good

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.880
military tactics to invade
during the fall.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.990
Because of fall is the
harvest season.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.440
That way you don't have to
have as many supplies

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.179
carried with you.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.730
You don't have to guard the
supply routes as carefully.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.600
Because you can just go and take
all of the farmer's crops

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.890
to feed your troops.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.420
But what the Russians did is
what they call scorched earth

00:08:53.420 --> 00:09:02.620
tactics, which essentially
means exactly

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.830
what it sounds like.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:09.050
As the Russians kept retreating
back, they burned

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.790
everything that could be of
benefit to Napoleon's troops.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.810
So they burned all the fields
as they retreated, so that

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.920
Napoleon's troops couldn't
access the local resources.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.600
So they had to keep having a
very-- I guess you could say--

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.480
costly supply chain from where
they started, as opposed to

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.910
just feeding off of the land.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.890
And the Russians just
continued to do this

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.190
on and on and on.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.540
All the way to Moscow.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.180
All the way to September 1812,
where we have the Battle of

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.000
Borodino, if I'm saying
it correctly.

00:09:52.345 --> 00:09:59.310
And at this point, Napoleon
only had a 135,000 of his

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.480
original 450,000 men.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.220
The rest had to be left behind
to guard the supply route.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.820
Or they deserted because they
were starting to get hungry.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.880
Or they were lost just with
minor skirmishes that happened

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.580
along the entire way.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.770
And at the Battle of Borodino,
after a long, protracted,

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.950
super bloody battle, in which--
let me write these

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.920
numbers down-- 44-- and these
are all estimates-- 44,000

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.940
Russian casualties.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.890
Mostly death, but also
wounded or captured.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.850
And 35,000 French.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.410
Many historians think this is
the most of bloody day of

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.940
battle up to this
day in history.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.960
The French are victorious.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.060
So we have a French
victory here.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.900
So Napoleon is feeling
good about himself.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.660
Borodino is right outside
of Moscow.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.260
He's like, you know what?

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.850
I'm just going to walk
into Moscow.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.180
They're going to hand the keys
of the city over to me.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.760
And then my troops are going to
have a good time in Moscow

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.740
being able to eat all the
food that must be there.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.380
And I will now be Emperor
of Russia, as well.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.600
So about a week later, he walks
into Moscow and it's

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.850
completely deserted.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.390
All of the inhabitants have left
and they've taken all the

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.860
food with them.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.433
And then on top of that,
Moscow starts burning.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.420
And there's some debate as
to why Moscow burned.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.750
Some historians believe it
is because the Russians

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.160
deliberately set fire
to the city.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.780
Some believe that it was just
a tinder box waiting to burn

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.410
and Napoleon's troops were just
a little irresponsible

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:45.800
with where they built fires.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.870
It's not clear.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:51.230
But needless to say, it made
Moscow useless to Napoleon.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.880
And this is kind of
a major change.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.900
Napoleon just expected look,
if I beat your army

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.300
decisively, like I did it
at Borodino, I won.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.200
I take the city.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.730
Now, you should give me
food and shelter.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.750
And I'm your new Emperor.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.740
But the Russians had something
different in mind.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.100
They said, no you will
never take Russia.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.270
You can have Moscow.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.650
You can have a burned Moscow.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.590
There's nothing in it.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:17.310
And we'll just like to see you
retreat in the Moscow winter.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:22.020
And by Napoleon's own accounts,
this is a quote that

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.370
he gave. The most terrible of
all my battles was the one

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.750
before Moscow.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.630
The French showed themselves
to be worthy of victory.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.950
This is at Borodino.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.940
But the Russians show themselves
worthy of being

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.170
invincible.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.510
So with no one to recognize
Napoleon or to help him out or

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.440
to feed his troops, he's kind
of in a worthless Moscow.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.090
He decides to just turn around,
especially because the

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.580
Russian winter is approaching.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.770
So on this chart you can see
they went all the way to

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.610
Moscow, they had
135,000 troops.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.610
They lose 35,000 of them.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.720
So you have 100,000 troops
coming back.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.730
This black line, right here,
this represents the retreat.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.970
And then things start
getting cold.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.780
So it's really interesting
about this

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.970
chart that Minard made.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.230
It has a couple things.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.940
You see the route that
Napoleon's army took as it

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.370
went into Russia.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.130
Then in black, this
is its retreat.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.660
It gets thinner and thinner
and thinner.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.940
And you see where they went.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.770
And on top of that,
he shows the

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.240
temperature as they retreated.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.470
And this is on something called
a Reaumur scale, but

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.120
you can just multiply these
numbers, if you can

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.230
see them, by 1.25.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.170
So you can see that it was
already, it was not that bad.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.190
But over here, we're already
below freezing.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.340
We're well below freezing
over here.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.620
At the coldest point, if
Minard's numbers are right,

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.080
and I've seen some historians
contest the numbers, but it

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.490
was cold nonetheless.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.740
It's negative 37 degrees as
we start approaching into

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.880
November and December.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.890
So Napoleon's forces, as before,
they had this whole

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.110
supply chain.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.950
They had scorched earth.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.020
So there's nothing to eat.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.110
They still had nothing to eat.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.600
Then it started getting cold.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.030
And while it was cold and they
were retreating, some of the

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.150
troops would desert.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.370
They would be attacked
by peasants.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.580
Just little bit by little bit
they'd be attacked by various

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.940
Russian forces.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.950
And then kind of the final blow
was when they were trying

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.710
to cross the Berezina River.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.130
So this right here is
the Berezina River.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.050
And you can even see from
Minard's chart that the width

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.440
was respectable.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.080
But then after trying
to cross that

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.260
river, it just got decimated.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.770
Almost half of the soldiers
died or disappeared.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.930
And these are depictions, these
are paintings, of the

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.320
retreat of Napoleon's forces
in the winter.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:50.850
This is actually a painting of
the crossing of Berezina.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.940
And by the time that the forces
got back at the end of

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.700
1812-- all the way over here,
by Minard's map-- you only

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.970
have 10,000 troops of the
original 450,000.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.930
So only 1 in 45 returned.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.000
The other were either captured,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.620
deserted, or just died.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.210
So when this happened, you could
imagine, not only did

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.290
Napoleon lose so many soldiers,
also lost on the

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.010
order of 200,000 horses.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:24.730
Actually, total casualties for
this one campaign, the

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.920
estimates are about 300,000
French troops.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.310
The estimates I saw had about
200,000 Russian troops.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:36.310
And just to be clear, a big
portion of the French troops

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:40.450
died as they tried to retreat.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.830
And then there was a huge amount
of Russian civilian

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:45.320
casualties.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.460
And there were also soldiers
from other countries

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.440
participating, especially
on the French side.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:58.390
When all is said and done,
estimates are over 1 million

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.000
dead from the French invasion.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.660
But beyond even just the human
casualties, Napoleon lost on

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.820
the order of 200,000 horses.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.160
I forgot the exact number,
but thousands of canons.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.250
So you could imagine, that it
was just this huge, huge loss

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.440
to the French military.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.750
So by the time this was done,
the rest of the powers of

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.910
Europe could kind of finally see
Napoleon being weakened.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.180
He was already bogged down
in the peninsula.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.140
He had this huge defeat as he
tried to invade Russia.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.510
They finally realized that now
is the time that they can form

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:38.070
maybe a Sixth Coalition and
really take Napoleon out.
