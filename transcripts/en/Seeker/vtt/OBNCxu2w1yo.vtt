00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.339
We’d all love to become less dependent on
our phone chargers, but current wireless charging

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.169
options just aren’t there yet.

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.250
So, what if we could charge our phones..with
WIFI?!

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.130
Wireless charging devices on the market now
use something called electromagnetic induction.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.230
First, a coiled wire in a charging pad turns
an electric current into a magnetic field.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.390
Then that field is received by another coiled
wire in your device that turns it back into

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.120
electricity and charges the battery.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.840
But, most of the inductive charging devices
we have today require direct or very close

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.289
contact between the device being charged and
the source of the magnetic field.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.899
Which doesn’t do much to resolve that feeling
of being tethered to an outlet.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.579
And while some researchers are looking for
ways to extend the distance of magnetic induction,

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.739
others are instead looking at how radiofrequency
signals (like wifi) could be used to do the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:48.739
same thing.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.199
To clarify- this isn’t new- researchers
have been working on it for a while now.

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.699
And charging via radiofrequency (or RF) signals
actually works pretty similarly to magnetic

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:58.699
induction.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.789
First, a transmitter (think: your wifi router)
sends out an RF signal.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.149
Then, a specially designed rectifying antenna
(or rectenna) in your device picks up that

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.240
signal, and converts it into an electric current.This
is a super promising technology- but there

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.930
are some drawbacks that have made developing
it challenging.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.829
The first being charge.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.549
Current WIFI routers don’t emit that much
power, and so would be limited to charging

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.860
low power devices like sensors or fitness
trackers.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.840
And that would be awesome for applications
like the internet of things.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.979
Which is, hold on on sec,I’ve got unlimited
data with Visible, so let me get a definition

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.180
for you.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.149
Which is “the networking capability that
allows information to be sent to and received

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.200
from everyday objects and devices using the
Internet"

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.150
But, making RF charging work for things like
our phones will likely involve setting up

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.970
a new type of RF transmitter, as well as installing
rectennas in any device we want to charge.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.619
That also presents a bit of a chicken or the
egg dilemma.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.450
Do you install the rectennas first, or the
transmitters first?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.210
Then there’s the issue of distance.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.320
The farther away from the transmitter you
get, the less power you’ll be able to pick

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.320
up.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.440
Finally, all of these systems need to get
agencies like the FCC to say they’re safe

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.960
before they can be sold to consumers.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.030
And that can take a lot of time.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.360
But despite all of these challenges, we’re
seeing a lot of progress.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.240
One company called Ossia has developed an
RF receiver and transmitter duo called Cota.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.720
The receiver in—let’s say your phone—first
sends beacon signals in various directions

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.790
around the location you're in.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.120
The transmitter picks up these signals and
then responds by sending concentrated RF waves

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.030
along the same path—thus charging your phone.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.100
This helps provide more energy to the device
than other systems, since you have a focused

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.740
RF signal instead of casting the power over
a large area.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.560
Ossia also debuted a new phone case and transmitter
combination at CES this year, that allows

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.890
for continuous phone charging at up to 12
ft.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.610
But it’s just a proof of concept.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.490
Another promising design is from a company
called Energous.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.160
Their technology called WattUp can charge
small devices with RF energy at a distance

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.130
of 3 ft - AND it’s already gotten FCC approval!!!!!

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.900
And they also have a newer version in the
works that claims to charge more devices at

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.190
a new distance of 15ft!

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.000
Even more, a new study from MIT has found
a way to make rectennas flexible, and do it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.400
with cheaper materials.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.420
Which could mean wearables powered by WiFi?

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.580
All in all, it doesn’t seem like we’re
that far off from real wireless charging at

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.680
a distance, and ditching those phone chargers
once and for all.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.270
So what do you guys think- would you buy one?

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.080
Well what about buying a new provider?

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.480
Visible is the new way to think about phone
service.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.480
No stores.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.480
No annual contracts.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.990
No hidden fees.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.760
Just 40 bucks a month for unlimited messages,
minutes, and data at speeds up to 5 megabits

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.760
per second.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.380
All on Verizon’s 4G LTE Network.When you
think the future of phone service, think Visible.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.470

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.730
One last thing- we only had time to talk about
induction and RF charging-- but some researchers

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.270
are also working on wireless charging with
infrared light.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.580
Man, the future is gonna be awesome.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.010
As always thanks for watching, and I’ll
see you next time on Seeker.
