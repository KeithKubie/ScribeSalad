JASON CRANE: Good afternoon,
and welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:05.880
My name is Jason Crane.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.216
I'm proud to welcome
Deborah Madison here today.

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:10.840
For over three decades,
Deborah Madison

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.700
has been at the vanguard
of the vegetarian

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.887
cooking movement,
authoring classic cookbooks

00:00:14.887 --> 00:00:16.970
in the subject and emboldening
millions of readers

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.260
to cook simple, elegant,
plant-based foods.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.360
Deborah Madison is the
author of 14 cookbooks now,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.230
and is well known for her
simple, seasonal, festival-base

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.880
cooking.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.280
She got her start at San
Francisco's Bay Area, Chez

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.619
Panisse, before
opening Greens, and has

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.880
lived in New Mexico
for the last 20 years.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.000
In addition to
writing and teaching,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.900
she has served on the boards
of Slow Food International,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.460
Biodiversity Committee,
the Seed Savers Exchange,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.479
and the Southwest Grassfed
Livestock Alliance,

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.020
among others.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.480
She is actively
involved in issues

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.710
of biodiversity, gardening,
sustainable agriculture.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.106
It is my great pleasure to
welcome Deborah Madison today.

00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:55.480
Thank you very
much coming again.

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:00.080
DEBORAH MADISON: Thank
you so very much.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.760
It's really a treat to be here.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.850
I know, you who work
here, it's every day.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.920
But those of us who
just Google at home,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.240
it's amazing to actually
be on the campus,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.170
and see what you do,
and how fabulous it is.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.180
I thought I would
talk a little bit

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.010
about-- because this is such
a useful audience-- about how

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.250
things used to be, and
where we came from.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.810
And if there's anything that
you want me in particular

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.440
to talk about, I'd be
happy to do that too.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.844
So I started cooking
a long time ago.

00:01:36.844 --> 00:01:38.510
When I started cooking
for other people,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.700
it was in the '70s, early
'70s, actually late '60s,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.830
and in San Francisco, at the
San Francisco Zen Center.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.000
So this is probably before
most of you were born.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.770
And at that time,
our mothers we're

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.850
being seduced by companies who
wanted them to make TV dinners,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.050
and Stouffers' souffles,
and chicken pot pie.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.450
And it was the beginning
of big food really,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.420
and ease in the kitchen, which
in part was easy to understand.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.300
It was just after
World War II, and it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.810
was a stressful time
for women and they

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.890
liked to be relieved of that.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.346
And as a kid, my mom didn't
buy into this at all,

00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:24.470
because she didn't want to
spend the money on food.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.950
But occasionally, there'd
be sales on pot pies.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.310
And this was a big moment
that they'd go out,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.580
and we could have those.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.915
But by the time I got to
move from Davis, California

00:02:37.915 --> 00:02:41.650
to San Francisco, and was
living at the Zen Center,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.490
and I decided I
wanted to cook there.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.380
Because I knew I was going
to be there and be working

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.150
and it looks like the most
interesting thing to do.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.120
And so when we had a
house meeting one night--

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.940
there were about
60 of us who lived

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.940
in a beautiful old
building on Page street.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.110
We needed a cook,
and my hand shot up.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.580
And I didn't even really
know I wanted to do that.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.900
I guess I did want to do it.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.390
So nobody else did,
so the job was mine.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.820
And what I inherited in
this kitchen on Page Street,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.420
was a store room filled
with grains, and groats,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.250
and grits, whole grains.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.570
And nobody knew how to cook
them, or what to do with them.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.360
But there was a prevailing
idea that what our parents were

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.520
doing was not so good, and
we could make it better.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.920
We should make it better.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.660
You know how kids
know everything,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.000
and especially what's
wrong with your parents,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.320
and the way they're living.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.340
Except that we really
didn't know how to cook.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.940
We didn't know a
grain from a grit.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.380
We didn't know their properties.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.440
Nobody knew how to
cook anything really,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.260
because it's not what
we were being taught,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.880
or what we were learning
at school or at home.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.200
And there were no cooking
schools I might add.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.560
So we just plunged in, and the
resulting vegetarian, usually

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.410
food was extremely
heavy and dark

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.570
and gray and brown and green.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.709
And there were restaurants
like the Good karma Cafe over

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.910
on Valencia Street, or the
Minimum Daily Requirement,

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.800
the MDR, that were
the vegetarian

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.040
restaurants at the time.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.660
And it just wasn't-- you'd have
to have a very strong ethical

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.270
profile to really
enjoy eating this food,

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.950
because it really
was not very good.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.250
So this is what I
inherited, and I

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.135
don't know how to
cook it either.

00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:45.100
But we did buy a grain mill.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.350
We ground some of
these whole grains

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.940
into flour for making bread.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.955
That was good.

00:04:51.955 --> 00:04:54.540
We could make
muffins and pancakes.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.840
But the cook who had
preceded me was macrobiotic,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.300
and he was really a good cook.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.660
But he stayed true to a lot
of macrobiotic principles.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.740
We had no sugar.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.630
We had no butter.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.360
We had no eggs.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.000
It sounds vegan, doesn't it?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.330
And modern.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.390
So pancakes, if you
could call them that,

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.570
were these flat rubbery
things like the soles

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.710
of your shoes, nothing had
any lift, nothing was light,

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.060
especially when he tried to
make the Western style food.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.390
So I did the backwards thing.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.640
It looks backwards from today.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.450
I introduced butter,
and baking powder,

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.400
and baking soda, and
eggs, and cheese.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.800
Because I was really
cooking for a community.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.870
And a community, like a
family is strengthened

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.920
when it eats together, when
it shares food together,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.900
talks over meals,
being nourished

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.610
by the same ingredients.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.040
And the way it was then,
people didn't really

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.910
want to eat miso soup
for breakfast, and tofu,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.460
and soy beans, and
things like that.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.580
So they'd go down to a cafe on
the corner called Lums Cafe,

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.970
and they would have pancakes
and eggs, and toast,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.830
and smoke a cigarette, drink
coffee, read the newspaper,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.120
like most people do.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.790
So my job was really to bring
the cooking more in line

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.340
with the taste of the
students who were there,

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:29.230
and what they would stay around
and be comfortable eating,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.220
and that's what I did.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.300
I really went from miso
soup and tofu and stuff

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.390
like that for breakfast, which I
actually happen to really like,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.220
but went from that to
more familiar foods,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.945
to pancakes that looked like
pancakes that we were used

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:47.910
to, to maple syrup, to put
a little butter on them.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.210
I don't know what Zen
Center is like nowadays,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.540
but I bet it has a really
heavy vegan component,

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.020
and I bet a lot of those foods
are pushed way to the side.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.070
I may be wrong.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.160
But in any case,
being a zen student

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.880
was not being about food, it
was about zen practice and zen

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.430
study.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.590
So it's not like we were
cooking school or trying

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:16.030
to do something with food,
but I took my job seriously.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.110
How you get people to the table?

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.440
You serve something
that they recognize.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.910
Oh, it's lasagna.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.449
It may be vegetarian
lasagna, but it looked right.

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:28.740
It's very different than
having something on the plate,

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.710
and you go, what is that?

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.720
You don't know what it is.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.450
You're a little
nervous about it.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.860
You're not really relaxed.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.540
It's hard to dig in.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.890
It's real hard to explain
it to a guest who's there.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.030
Like if we came to Google, and
everything was so just utterly

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.780
strange, and so just
utterly wonderful,

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.350
we'd be saying, what
is this you're eating?

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.410
What is it you're doing?

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.320
Human beings get nervous
if they don't understand.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.790
So anyway that's how
I got started cooking.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.330
And I did that for about
18 years at Zen Center.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.670
I cooked in a lot of
different capacities.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:11.110
I cooked for students
in every day situations

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.240
at the Zen Center
in San Francisco.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.980
I cooked for sesshins, which
are seven-day intensive periods

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.150
of meditation where
nobody is talking.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.490
And you really have
to think it out,

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.480
because the meals are
served in the zen though.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.580
They're served formally.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.370
You want to feel light and
nourished at the same time,

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.010
not heavy.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.309
You don't want to fall asleep
afterwards during meditation.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:38.450
I was a private chef for
the Abbott and his friends.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.309
And my motto was always tea
for two, and six for tea.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.630
It was like, oh, well we can
add six more, or ten more.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.090
I'd be running down to
the field at Green Gulch,

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.490
and harvesting a little
bit more food to cook.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.420
That was really
hard, but it gave me

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.060
a chance to do cooking that
was more elaborate, and more

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.360
adventurous really, and more
interesting, and more the kind

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.430
of foods that eventually
showed up at green.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.440
So you're asking about
greens, and how that started?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.200
Is that what you wanted to know?

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:19.330
So Zen Center owns a property
near Big Sur, called Tassajara,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.670
or Zen Mountain Center,
and it's our monastery.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:28.500
And during the year, it's
for 100-day long periods

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.870
of intense practice, two
of them back to back.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.090
And then in the summer,
we're opened to guests.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.740
And guests can come down,
and they can just be guests,

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.290
and they can relax and so forth.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.260
So we cooked our food.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.090
Originally, it
wasn't vegetarian,

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.280
because it was owned by a
family that wasn't vegetarian.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.841
And so Ed Brown would be
in there making lamb chops

00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:52.090
and things, and the rest of
us would be hanging around

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.380
like hungry dogs, going,
can I have some of that?

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.700
Would there be any leftover?

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.040
Actually, we weren't really
very good at vegetarian cooking.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.530
People were hungry.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.240
They just wanted,
lusted for something

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.000
more sustaining,
especially meat.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.650
So that wasn't going to work.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.000
So we decided to
scratch that menu,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.070
and just do vegetarian food.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:19.120
And because Tassajara is so
isolated-- have any of you

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.110
ever been there?

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.901
You have?

00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:21.400
OK.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.180
So you know.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.570
It's like this 18-mile road
that goes up, and it goes down,

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.750
and it winds, and there's like
a 10,000 foot drop on one side.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.120
It's not a road you're going
to take casually to go to town

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.680
and find something to
eat that you'd prefer.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.470
So basically, we had
a captive audience.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.160
And we got better at cooking
the food over the years.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.850
I also cooked there,
did the guest season.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.950
And people would say--
because a lot of our guests

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.700
were from the Bay
Area-- do you think

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.410
you could open a restaurant
in San Francisco?

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.580
And you begin to
hear that enough,

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.730
and then you begin to
think, well, maybe.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:01.500
And then Fort Mason opened,
when the GGNRA started.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.870
And they were looking for
a restaurant as a tenant,

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.910
but it had to be a non-profit.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.320
Now most restaurants
are non-profit,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.600
but not by intention.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.180
This had to be an organization
that was non-profit.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.800
And the Zen Center
was, and it just

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.500
seemed like the perfect fit.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.850
So we got this building.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.080
It's the same space where it is
today, and it was a disaster.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.040
It was filled with old
big pieces of machinery

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.360
that reeked of oil.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.650
And the windows were about
five feet above the ground,

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.420
above the floor.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.772
So we had to build a false
floor, because you're not

00:11:41.772 --> 00:11:44.230
going to have windows you can't
look out and see the Golden

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.780
Gate Bridge, and the
San Francisco Bay.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.040
That would be really cruel.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.140
So it took about a year
to build out this space.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.890
And during that year I actually
worked at Chez Panisse,

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.520
or maybe the year
before I started

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.490
working at Chez Panisse,
I had met Alice Waters,

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.000
and her pastry
chef, Lindsay Shere.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.330
They came to Green Gulch
to look at our farm,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.900
and I was asked to
show them around.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.450
And as I did I was
saying things like,

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.890
have you ever heard
of Richard Olney?

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:15.890
Do you make tarte tatin?

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.135
Do you do this?

00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:17.760
Do you do that?

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.530
And finally, Alice
said, haven't you ever

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.660
been to the restaurant?

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.740
Well, on $50 a month
stipend, no I hadn't.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.800
So she said, I'd
like to invite you.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.200
Bring somebody.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.290
So the next night, I went with
a friend, and we were smitten.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.190
And it's like I had had this
long quest for what I thought

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.110
French food was, or should
be, and never found it.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.030
And there I found it.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.340
And I can still remember
everything that we ate,

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.420
and how amazing it was.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.134
I just came back, and told my
abbot, I have to work there.

00:12:50.134 --> 00:12:51.300
That's what I'm going to do.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.560
I have to work there.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.540
And I started the next day.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.700
And it was an amazing
experience to work there.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.300
It was a lot of fun.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.720
Two years later, I didn't know
that there was this restaurant

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.220
idea.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.969
Of course, that's why
I got to work there,

00:13:05.969 --> 00:13:09.230
because I was going to be the
Chef, but I didn't know that.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.550
So I thought I was just
learning a little bit

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.630
about how to cook
at Chez Panisse.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.640
Then one day, it
was like, well, you

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.270
going to open this
restaurant, and so I did.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.260
Chez Panisse is a very
special restaurant.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.860
It's not like any place else.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.620
So if that's your only
experience of a restaurant,

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.780
and it happens to fit
your own vision perfectly.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.440
To open a big restaurant, and
do things in a conventional way,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.870
is really hard.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.370
I didn't want things
like rolling racks, which

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.540
you absolutely have to
have in a restaurant.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.340
I mean there are these
big industrial racks

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.010
that you put sheet pans on.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:48.720
I said, oh no.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.170
I don't want those.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.789
We're going to do
everything by hand.

00:13:53.789 --> 00:13:55.330
It's just going to
be really soulful.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.532
Well, actually it was a
pretty soulful kitchen.

00:13:57.532 --> 00:13:58.740
But we did get rolling racks.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.860
And thank heavens
we did, because you

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.800
have to wake up, and
be smart at some point

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.740
or you're going to hate it.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.170
It was really hard
doing that restaurant.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.960
We suddenly had
a big restaurant.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.200
We got a great review within
the first three weeks,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.440
which meant we were serving
300 plus lunches a day.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.320
None of my staff were cooks.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.190
So I had to teach
them all how to cook.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.740
I'm learning myself how
to run a restaurant.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.160
The learning curve was
pretty much like that.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.310
And it was just breathtaking.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.250
It was so difficult.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.600
But we had to figure
out how to do things.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.810
We had lots of failures.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.010
We had some successes.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.920
We focused on the successes,
and then we began to build,

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.170
and eventually
opened for dinner.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.040
In the beginning, our menus
were written five minutes

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.900
before dinner time, and xeroxed,
and there were misspellings.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.980
Nobody understood that it's
espresso, not expresso,

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.240
and all those kind
of nightmare things.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.270
But actually the
restaurant really worked.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:08.130
And I would say that most of our
customers were not vegetarian.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.190
They were coming, because
I had a little reputation.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.010
They were curious.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.850
There was lots of parking, and
there was a view of the bay.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.530
I mean, what more
could you want?

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.480
And so it was mainly women
coming to try it out,

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.260
and then they'd come back on the
weekends with their husbands.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.570
And you could see these
men being dragged in.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.370
They didn't want to go to
a vegetarian restaurant

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.670
on Saturday night.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.080
They wanted a steak.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.600
And so I had to really make food
that would put them at ease,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.760
and would offer
them something that

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.970
would take the
place of that meat

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.100
in the center of the plate.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.730
So I did food that
was complicated.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.500
I did, like dulse,
the little crepes,

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.800
and folded, and stacked, and
rolled, and things that had

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.420
form and shape in the
middle of the plate

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.880
that the eye could go
to, a sauce or whatever.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.600
It was complicated
cooking, which

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.030
is why the greens cookbook is my
most complicated book probably.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.830
But it had to be that.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.100
I had to offer something
to take the place.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.290
Now I think it's
very different times.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.390
I don't think we need
to do that so much.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:25.610
I think vegetarian food
can be and is much simpler.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.160
People understand now, just
because you're having it

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.970
on one Saturday
night, it doesn't

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.350
mean you're signing up for a
lifestyle, unless you want to.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.900
You can take a break.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.820
Lots of people might
order vegetarian food

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.620
in a restaurant, because it's
just different from having

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:45.000
salmon, lamb, beef, and chicken,
the same thing over and over

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.080
again.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.900
It's just another way of eating.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.550
For some people, it's
the only way of eating.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.740
Some people are pescetarians,
or porketarians,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.530
or they have their exceptions.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.150
And it's not for me to say
what's right, what's wrong.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.930
In my experience as
a cooking teacher,

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.260
I think we change a
lot through our lives.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.210
I do know a man, a
political cartoonist,

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.329
who's rather well known.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.270
He's Australian, and
he has been vegetarian

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.500
for three generations
in his family.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.470
And he's perfectly
fine with that.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.009
He doesn't like meat.

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:23.800
He doesn't like it.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.599
He doesn't know it.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.270
It's not on his horizon.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.270
It's just not there,
and he's comfortable.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.250
On the other hand,
I've I taught classes

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.660
where somebody will say, I've
been a vegetarian for 20 years,

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.030
and I keep dreaming of Turkey.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:36.986
What's wrong with me?

00:17:36.986 --> 00:17:39.360
And I said, why don't you have
some turkey, and find out?

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.420
Maybe it has something
that you need.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.384
Maybe you can get
it another way,

00:17:44.384 --> 00:17:45.550
if you don't want to eat it.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.695
But find out what it's about.

00:17:47.695 --> 00:17:51.150
We all move around and
shift a lot of times.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.170
So do books.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:59.660
So didn't this use to
be orange, the spine?

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.520
I think it did.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.550
So after I left Greens-- I'll
backtrack just a little bit--

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.560
at one point, I was
invited to go to Esalen

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.790
and teach for a week.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.580
And teach everything about
vegetarian food from soup

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.550
to nuts.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.090
And it was exhausting,
because I had

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.840
to gather all this information.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.670
None of it was in one place.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.750
And after I left,
I thought, oh I

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.840
wish there were a
Vegetarian Joy of Cooking.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.190
It would make my
life so much easier.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.190
And you have one of
those aha moments.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.990
You're pumping gas in your
car, and you're thinking,

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.790
I guess I'm the one that's
going to write that.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.430
Seven years later, I came out.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.980
It was a huge, huge project.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.220
But soy milk, for
example, if you

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.820
were interested in
soy milk, you had

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.460
to get a little pamphlet
at a health food store.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.030
It was something exotic,
and kind of dreadful

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.740
actually, and over there.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.062
Of course, hemp milk,
and almond milk,

00:18:56.062 --> 00:18:57.770
and rice milk, and
all these other milks,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.160
didn't even exist then.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.130
But I thought, why not
put this all together,

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.680
instead of having
something be in a corner?

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.510
Just put it all
under the same cover.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.510
So I wrote this book,
and for many years

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:15.710
I was the vegetarian doma matrix
on the cover with the spoons,

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.460
and this was really orange.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.290
And yesterday, I
was at Ten Speed,

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.420
and I noticed that
somebody was using this

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.560
under their computer
to lift it up.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.780
And I have traveled not
just once with this book,

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.090
and now with the new Vegetarian
Cooking for Everyone,

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.920
I can tell you can use
it in more than one way.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.880
You can use it to
lift things up with.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.720
But this came out, and it
was exactly what I wanted.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.790
It was called Vegetarian
Joy of Cooking originally.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.160
But Joy of Cooking came
out with their new version

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.840
the same year, so they asked
me to change the title.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.460
I really love the feeling
of opening the door ,

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.530
expanding the table,
not closing it.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.340
And that's why it
says for everyone.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.370
I didn't even want
to say vegetarian,

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.790
but my publisher would
not go for that at all.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.930
And Plant Foods
for Everyone just

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.670
doesn't have the right ring.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.580
This is really
about plant foods.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.720
It's not just vegetables.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.080
It's just the other side.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.960
It's the rest of the plate, or
it could be the whole plate.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.900
But that's always been my
feeling about vegetarian food

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:25.340
is, it's bringing
everyone to the table.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.770
Don't say no.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.750
For me, that's important.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.960
I recently came
out, just in March,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.220
with this new version of it.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.015
This is basically the same book,
but it has quite a few changes

00:20:39.015 --> 00:20:43.320
in it, including a beautiful
new cover without spoons on it.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.230
And it's already faded
to a lovely yellow.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.430
So this is probably
going to look--

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.000
and it's not quite
the golden bears,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.020
but it almost was, for a minute.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.650
And the reason, I
re-did this book

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.480
is because our
culture has changed.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.030
We have new foods
now that we didn't

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.700
have before, all those
alternative plant

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.050
milks I mentioned are some,
coconut oil, coconut butter,

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.610
ghee.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.420
It's not that these
are new foods,

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.240
they're just new to our culture.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.840
I made a little
list here, because I

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.140
was afraid I'd forget.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:26.620
We have new kinds of pepper
like shishitos, and fushimi,

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.490
and padrons, that are
very, very popular.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.630
We have millet that's
now made into grits,

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:38.200
instead of whole millet, which
is like infinitely better.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.960
We have all these beautiful
mixtures of seaweed

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.745
that make gorgeous salads.

00:21:42.745 --> 00:21:46.260
They're very nutritious,
beautiful salads.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:46.760
What else?

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.550
We have these beverages
like coconut beverage.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.200
It's not the coconut
milk in the can,

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.700
but you can pour it on your
cereal, and make a smoothie.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.860
We have smoked paprika.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.400
We have these Japanese
chili mixtures

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.510
like sashimi togarashi.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.660
There's just many,
many foods, farro,

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.110
an ancient, ancient grain.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.345
Well, now we have it.

00:22:07.345 --> 00:22:10.160
And emmer and einkorn-- we have
pastas made out of einkorn.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.950
So the landscape of
our food has changed.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.910
And of course
vegetable varieties,

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:19.060
in particular, have
expanded like crazy.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.290
I wanted to put-- because when
I wrote this book in the '90s,

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:27.040
people really thought tofu
was going to save you.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.870
It was good for Japanese people,
so if we ate a lot of it,

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.090
it would be really
good for us too.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.400
People were doing crazy
things like just pureeing

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.190
tofu in a Cuisinart and
eating it for breakfast.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.970
It's stuff that just--
just get it in you.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.820
And instead of treating it
as an exquisite food, which

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.160
I think it really
is, but now we know

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.775
tofu is good food
but not gobs of it.

00:22:55.775 --> 00:22:57.400
Fermented soy is better.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.030
So we want more
miso, and tempeh.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.560
So there's a little bit
more of that in the book.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.810
But I kept the tofu recipes,
because they're good,

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.230
and they're great for
vegetarians to turn to.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.390
There's a designation
of vegan recipes,

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.430
because so many
people are vegan,

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.460
and I just want to make it
easy for them to find it.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.030
This book is often used
maybe if your vegetarian

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.620
your mother's
might have used it.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.762
They say, oh I have a
kid who is vegetarian,

00:23:23.762 --> 00:23:25.220
I don't know what
to cook for them.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.740
Well, now I have a kid
who's vegan or raw vegan

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.900
or whatever it is.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.580
So I thought, I'm
going to help her out,

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.090
and help you out, and
just label those as well.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:38.320
I took away some recipes that
we're really rich or just too

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.120
challenging or didn't seem
right for our times any more,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.350
and put in 150 recipes that are
much different than that, more

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.300
contemporary.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.410
There is that no kneed bread,
which has become so popular,

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.890
which we didn't even know
about the first time around.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.610
And I also am
considering the fact

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:02.050
that now there are
experts in so many kinds

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:08.740
of cuisines, south Indian,
Lebanese mountain cooking,

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.860
some little province in
some section of Italy

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.220
has somebody who's
a master of it.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.170
Even though International
food is usually

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:22.670
the backbone of most
vegetarian collections,

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.094
I can't take the role
anymore of being an expert,

00:24:26.094 --> 00:24:26.760
because I'm not.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.060
I am just one person.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.110
I come from one country
and only one country,

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.370
even though I've
lived elsewhere I

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:38.780
thought there are many, many
voices now that we can turn to.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:43.620
So I kind of pull back a little
bit out of respect for those.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.370
But you'll still find, if
you've used this book at all,

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.130
your good friends
for the most part

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.610
I'll tell you a little story.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.810
I was talking about the process
of redoing a book, which

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.430
is very different from
writing a book from scratch.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.320
And I mentioned that I had
taken out a risotto gratin.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.280
I just felt it was too rich.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.600
I don't think anybody made it.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.300
Nobody ever emailed me about it,
and two women in the audience

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.070
said, you can't take that out.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.120
We make that for each
other for our birthdays.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.010
And I thought, it's staying in.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.680
Because it meant
something to someone.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.470
It was obviously a celebratory
food, not an everyday food.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.850
And of course, we do have
foods that celebrate,

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.240
and foods that nurture
on a daily basis.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.200
So they're all covered in there.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.630
And I'll just conclude-- I want
to mention before this came out

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:37.200
last year, I came out with
this book, Vegetable Literacy.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.350
This is just the cover
the books under here.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.860
Those are walking
onions on the cover,

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:46.130
which is really about plant
families, and their members,

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.140
and what they look like,
and how they behave,

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.540
and how much they're
interchangeable in the kitchen.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.790
So it's kind of an
interest-- I love this book.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.670
I grew all the plants
that are in it,

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.510
and it was kind of
process I learned so much,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.055
and if you read this, you can
walk around your campuses,

00:26:05.055 --> 00:26:08.900
and suddenly are saying,
oh that's a walking onion

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.950
or whatever it is.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.680
Or that's in the grass family.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.920
So I'm happy to stop here if
you need to get back to work.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.440
Or if you have questions,
I'm happy to entertain them.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.200
Yes sir.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.780
AUDIENCE: Can you address
the issue supposedly

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.710
around soy-based foods?

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.340
I've been a vegetarian
for 20 years,

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.490
and tofu has been a
staple in our family.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.650
But recently, people have
been rolling their eyes at me,

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.180
when I talk about tofu
and soy-based stuff.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.330
Do you know anything about it?

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.610
DEBORAH MADISON: I don't
know a lot about it.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.200
I think, partly, it's
the estrogen that's

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:53.310
in them has-- Some people
think that that's problematic.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:58.190
I haven't sat down and actually
read a lot of science on it.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.480
I think if they work for you,
you should enjoy eating them.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.220
But there is something
about the fermentation that

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.120
makes them more bio available.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:16.140
So soy foods that are fermented
like tempeh or miso or tamari.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.240
There's a bunch of them.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.260
Natto, which I don't
think will probably

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.630
become real popular
in this country.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.370
I've had a hard
time with it myself.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.500
I'm pretty open minded.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.260
That those are more
beneficial than just

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.600
relying on soy milk or tofu.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.400
My concern with the
soy food, is so much

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:41.860
of it is GMO, unless it
is stated USDA organic.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.730
And if you feel fine about
eating GMO food, go ahead.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.110
I would avoid it myself.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.240
I think that that's
part of the problem.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.060
I don't find soy
oil or soy flour

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.260
to ever have a fresh taste.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.000
They always seem rancid to me.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.240
I think they're
very unstable oils,

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.390
but we ate a lot of
soybeans at the Zen Center.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.340
And if you cook them
in a pressure cooker,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.220
they're really delicious,
and they're really silky,

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.650
and they're really
soft, but they

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:15.830
have to become
completely cooked.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.970
So it's like any bean,
if you don't really

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.090
cook it-- They're very
high in phytic acids,

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:26.560
and so that soaking, draining,
putting fresh water on it,

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.350
cooking them until their
really, really tender is good.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:32.810
I think you should
enjoy your tofu.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:35.565
I plan to enjoy mine.

00:28:35.565 --> 00:28:37.440
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
providing the context

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.740
around the origins of greens.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.850
So if greens was
on the forefront

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:44.906
of pushing a lot of these
trends, what is it's role now?

00:28:44.906 --> 00:28:46.030
I know you're not involved.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.850
But what is the state
of vegetarianism now,

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.636
and what role does Greens play?

00:28:51.636 --> 00:28:53.760
DEBORAH MADISON: I live in
a village of 200 people,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.150
I don't get out that much.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.570
I think Greens is
probably maintaining.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.670
And it's a fine
dining restaurant.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.220
And it's beautiful.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.930
And the presentation
is beautiful.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.630
And they no longer xerox their
menus at the last minute.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.250
They look really nice.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.790
It's more professional.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.470
So I think it's just
there as a kind of anchor.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:19.660
But we were just in Los
Angeles this weekend

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.950
and looking for some food.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.760
And went into-- it
has a funny name.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.370
Do you remember?

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.360
Went into a vegetarian
restaurant that turns out

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.000
to be a chain, and they
did a lot of Persian food.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.880
And it was crazy and mixed up.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.710
It was cold tapas, hot tapas.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.540
That had nothing to
do with Spain at all.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.450
But everything was organic.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.640
Everything was really wholesome.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.900
It was delicious.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:53.310
And I was very happy to
know that we could just

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.140
walk in and sit
down and have it.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.220
The place were pretty.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.140
They weren't super, super
constructed, but the fact

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.510
that that's a chain,
and there's a lot of it,

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:10.790
and its experimental is
very encouraging to me.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.590
I think vegetarian food is
just a whole lot better.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.980
It's so much broader.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.480
And people are better cooks.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.440
They're better eaters.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.380
They've been exposed to more.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.760
Every now and then,
a restaurant crops up

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:27.400
as an example of new vegetarian
cooking, that's not a big deal.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.370
It's not expensive.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.000
It's not a big date, night.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.520
I think it's gotten better.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.250
I think we're more relaxed
about it, which is good.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.710
AUDIENCE: What's it like
to introduce a new menu

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.200
or to try out a new dish?

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.450
Because I imagine if you're
running the restaurant you

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.686
might have certain
quality to uphold,

00:30:46.686 --> 00:30:48.310
and if you're trying
out something new,

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.755
it might be hard to uphold that.

00:30:49.755 --> 00:30:50.630
DEBORAH MADISON: Yes.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:52.610
What's it like trying
out a new dish?

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.100
It's a little like
a roller coaster

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:59.230
flag ride in the wind at
Six Flags or something.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.730
Yes.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.660
I tried new dishes all the time.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.170
I didn't know any other way.

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.920
That was my model
at Chez Panisse.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.070
And it was breathtakingly
frightening.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.510
Sometimes you weren't
sure if that's

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.790
how they were supposed to
be, or if it was right,

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.480
and the menu is printed.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.970
Sometimes my husband, when I'm
trying a new dish will say,

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.840
you know this isn't
your best effort.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.110
And I'd say, I know.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.812
It didn't work.

00:31:29.812 --> 00:31:33.210
But I think with more
experience cooking,

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.650
you start to know
what does really work,

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.390
and what you can do, and
how foods work together.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:43.630
So you can eliminate
a lot of false steps,

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.950
because you've already
had experience with them.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.120
When I'm working on a recipe,
three times is my limit.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.580
If I can't get it the third
time, I set way aside.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.750
There's something that's just
inherently not right or not

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.540
working.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.505
Later, I might figure
out what that is

00:32:02.505 --> 00:32:05.050
or I might find a new approach.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:11.440
But generally, I can see
what works and what wont,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.810
and what the result will be.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:16.170
But yeah, it had
its scary moments,

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.900
when you're doing
it for other people.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.615
AUDIENCE: Are you associated
with a restaurant now?

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:29.710
I'm just curious, how you decide
to be in a restaurant or not?

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.774
Is it just too intense.

00:32:31.774 --> 00:32:34.190
DEBORAH MADISON: Well I'm not
associated with a restaurant

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:35.720
now.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.110
It's a young person's game.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.030
You all ought to go to it.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.790
I did it, but it's
very hard work.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.100
And when I moved to
Santa Fe, I did open

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.310
a restaurant with David Tanis.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:51.040
It had a great run
for about six years,

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.180
and it was a real
farm driven menu,

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:57.360
as was Greens, as was
Chez Panisse as well.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.440
And that was my last
restaurant experience.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.410
It's hard.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:06.600
It's hard to be in your
feet for 12, 14 hour days.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.270
I'm not exactly
young so I really

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:12.990
don't want to spend my
time being that exhausted

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.580
when I'm not at the restaurant.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.650
But I have to say,
I think once you've

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.600
done it, you always
sort of miss it.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.400
And I'm always looking for--
I will see a space, I'll say,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.920
that's what I want.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.680
I want that for my restaurant.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.140
And I mean come on.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.250
But when you're
working hard, and when

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.450
you're under pressure, and
as they say in the weeds,

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:38.880
and everyone's cooperating, and
you're getting that food out,

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.120
it's the best
feeling in the world.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.670
It's just a rush.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.946
But part of what
makes a good I think

00:33:45.946 --> 00:33:47.820
is really because you're
working with others.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.100
You're not just by yourself.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.970
You're working as one body.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.510
You're getting
through that night,

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.030
and that is a real thrill.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:57.960
And I think that
there are other ways

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.800
to realize that quality
of community in our lives,

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.310
and we have to find
out what those are.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.530
It might be your
workspace at Google.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.830
Maybe it's not, but
it seems like you

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:11.870
have a lot of ways of
meeting and talking and being

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:16.550
together and working together,
which I think is the best.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.800
But like I say,
physically, it's a bruiser.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.570
At my age, I should be
sitting down in the corner

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:26.969
the dining room having
drinks with customers.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:28.832
But I do miss it.

00:34:28.832 --> 00:34:30.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for your other books.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.440
I really especially love
the introduction chapters,

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.980
about tools, and
foods in general,

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.250
and all the great recipes.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:43.940
But I was wondering about what
was it like to start up Greens?

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.440
You were just
starting a restaurant,

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.900
but also just it was with a
bunch of Zen students and stuff

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.050
on it.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.520
DEBORAH MADISON: It was hard.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.530
It was an adventure.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.930
It was an adventure every
single day to start greens.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.150
What are we going to eat?

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:02.120
What could possibly
be a main dish?

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.980
How do you teach 10
people, your lunch crew,

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:10.210
to not make silly
little garnishes.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:16.370
I had to be very exacting,
and I had to really lean hard

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.940
on the crew to get
that food right,

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.710
and that was not
always appreciated.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.090
So I was a little bit
battered between you've

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.390
got to do this right,
and you have to be nice.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.790
Now I'm so nice to,
people whatever they do

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.110
is find, because I
really didn't like

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.900
the experience of saying
no, you can't do that.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.490
It has to be like this.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.180
But that's what I
was there to do.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.860
I had to make that
restaurant work.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.100
And that's what it takes.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.960
But it was a difficult ride.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.100
Starting any restaurant is hard.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.580
It's just so hard

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.590
Alice waters told me she
said you won't go anywhere

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:57.590
for six months,
and she was right.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:00.410
And practically
on the day, I got

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.670
to go to Graffeo's in
North Beach to buy coffee.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.270
I got to leave the restaurant
in the middle of the day.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.300
And I went to the
bohemian Cafe, and I

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.740
had a beer and an
anchovy sandwich.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.980
And I went to Graffeo's
and got the coffee.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.530
Oh my gosh, the feeling of
being outdoors in the sun.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:22.150
I could eat something different
that didn't-- you smell like

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.520
your food, and your
clothes are saturated.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.300
It's like you can't
every get away from it.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.230
So to have that
experience-- it shows you

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.730
how much you're really
wed to your work.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:39.840
It's 24/7, because there's
no time when you're awake

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.770
after you-- you come down
at the end of the night.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:43.950
You're wired.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.000
You may be exhausted.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.450
It takes two or three hours to
calm down, so you go to sleep.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:52.130
And then I was a Zen student, so
I'm up at 4:30 the next morning

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.300
for a Zen meditation, for zazen.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.330
I was tired.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.520
It was hard.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.930
But once you get it started,
then it has its own life,

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.794
and it goes.

00:37:02.794 --> 00:37:04.710
AUDIENCE: For someone
who is learning to cook,

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.350
are there any techniques,
practices, or tips

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.530
that you think are
especially useful very

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:13.570
transforming cooking,
taking it to the next level?

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.720
DEBORAH MADISON: How
do you transform food

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.760
to bring it to the next level
when you're learning to cook?

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.202
Use a good knife that's sharp.

00:37:21.202 --> 00:37:22.410
You don't need a lot of them.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.860
But you need a
knife that's sharp,

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.620
and you need the
knife for the job.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.950
If you're cooking a
lot of vegetables,

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:29.850
you want to have a
long flat surface

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.630
you don't want to boning
knife that curves,

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.410
because you're only going to
have that much of it that's

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.060
in contact with your food.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.480
Choose a good vegetable knife,
give yourself a lot of room

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.490
to work.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:44.130
So many people work
on a little tiny board

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.710
that they got as
a wedding present

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.890
for a cheese board or
something, and that's

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.110
they're cutting board.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.470
Get a big board.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:52.290
Give yourself lots of room.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.600
Have a sharp knife,
a tool to sharpen it.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.210
It doesn't have to be a steel.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.060
There are lots of cool little
tools that are magnetized.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.620
You can pull your knife through.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.710
It makes it all so much easier.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.620
It really does.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.470
I can't remember if you
mentioned you had this book

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:13.900
or if it was somebody else, but
there's a lot about the steps

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.430
to make things easier.

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:19.580
You have to remember that
cooking isn't a linear process.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.270
Food TV makes it
seem very linear.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.130
Everything's prepped.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:25.870
You're going like that.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.360
That's not how it is.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.410
When you get home, nobody
left you a mise en place.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:32.770
I'll bet.

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:33.570
Maybe someday.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:34.980
But not today.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.740
So you have to know.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.240
OK.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.485
While the onions are
cooking down for your soup,

00:38:39.485 --> 00:38:41.110
that's when you're
going to chops this,

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.620
or you're going to do
that, or grind your spices.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:50.410
But to think about it as a much
more organic way of approaching

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:54.430
what you're doing
will help you a lot.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:55.510
There are suggestions.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:39:00.390
There's 10 suggestions
for making it easier.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.120
I always tell people, if
you're just learning to cook,

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.970
but you know something
about what you like to eat,

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:07.710
start with those dishes.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:11.650
If you love stir fries,
which I don't but if you do,

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.630
make stir fries, until
you get really good at it.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.250
If it's gratins, make gratins.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:20.030
If it's pizza, you can make
lots and lots of pizzas.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:25.620
Kind of focus, and until you
have that-- it's in your body,

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.650
and you can just do it.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:29.780
And then you might
look at a recipe

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.270
and say, oh I didn't know
you could use cold rabe,

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.020
and it's great with
mustard, because their

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.960
in the same family, and
a little-- whatever.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.120
But I think people who are
starting are very ambitious.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.700
They're exposed to so
many tastes in food.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.410
Ask yourself first,
what do I like to eat?

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:49.972
Look for those recipes.

00:39:49.972 --> 00:39:51.180
Work on those.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.300
This book has a lot of
the fundamental kinds

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.690
of instructions, because I
taught people how to cook.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.940
I taught my crew cook.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.610
so I can't get away from it.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.740
I'm always wanting to
make it easier for people.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.070
So does that help?

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.200
Sharp knife, big cutting boards,
lots of bowls to put things in.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:12.954
Start there.

00:40:12.954 --> 00:40:14.870
AUDIENCE: It was mentioned
in the introduction

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.030
that you had been involved
with the slow food movement.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.405
And I was hoping you could
talk a bit about what that is,

00:40:19.405 --> 00:40:24.050
and what impact, if any, it's
had on your cookbook writing?

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.360
DEBORAH MADISON: I don't
know what kind of impact

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.960
Slow Food has had on my writing.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.080
Slow Food started,
actually when I

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.680
was living in Rome
in the mid '80s,

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:40.650
as a response to McDonald's
opening on the Spanish steps.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.330
And that was very
painful to a lot

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.950
of Italians, the Spanish steps?

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:45.060
McDonald's?

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.940
And so a group got
together, and they

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.232
made pasta bolognese,
or some kind of pasta.

00:40:51.232 --> 00:40:53.190
And they stood in front
of McDonald's, and they

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.190
said, don't eat that.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:57.720
Have some of this.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.380
It really started because so
many of the little trattorias

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.730
or cafes were closing.

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:05.720
They no longer existed.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:10.440
People were going for fast food.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.840
And they didn't want to lose
that part of their culture.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.190
The same thing has
happened here by the way.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:19.450
It's very hard to find a good
family a Cafe, very hard.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:21.340
It's mostly just awful.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:25.850
And so the movement
started with that,

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.640
and then it grew to,
well what about our foods

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.260
and other customs,
and not just Italy,

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.650
but Europe, the U.S., China,
all kinds of countries

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:39.440
have lost many of their
foods, and how can they

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.895
be brought back and appreciated?

00:41:40.895 --> 00:41:42.920
It was about slowing down.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.640
Anyway, it's hard to find an
elevator talk, speech for it,

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.657
but I always used to say--
people say, what's slow food?

00:41:49.657 --> 00:41:51.490
And I say, you've heard
of fast food, right.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.740
And then something clicks.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.520
They've heard of fast
food, so slow food

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.410
is saying something to them.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:04.690
I have been involved with Slow
Food for a really long time.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.260
I used to wear a lot of
hats in that organization,

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.350
but the most
important one to me,

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.560
was the Ark and
Presidia committee,

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.900
which was very involved with
identifying those foods that

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.520
had historical and
gustatory significance.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.575
And in America, we
have lots of them.

00:42:20.575 --> 00:42:23.700
We have lots of apples, and
plums, and fruits, and grains,

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.470
and all animal breeds,
all kinds of foods

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:30.110
that have disappeared for
just something bigger, faster,

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.640
cheaper, whatever.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.020
So it's been very involved
in bringing these foods back.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.340
They're a part of my pantry
to the degree that I can.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:43.302
So I would say has it has
introduced me to food.

00:42:43.302 --> 00:42:45.760
Because I've used them in these
books, and talk about them.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.600
Anybody can buy real wild rice.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.040
You just Google
it, and go online,

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.700
and you can buy it, if you
don't live in Minnesota,

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:58.370
and it's completely different
from California Pati wild rice.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:59.900
It's totally
different, and yet it

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.030
comes out of a culture
that's still alive.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:04.550
So you could choose
to support that.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:05.540
So I do.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.670
And I do incorporate
those things in my books.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.440
Thank you all very much.
