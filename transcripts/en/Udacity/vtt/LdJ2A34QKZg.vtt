00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.575
Alright, Sara, I did what you said I should never do, I styled a div.

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:03.922
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:07.446
&gt;&gt; So, I gave it, I gave all div's black backgrounds, and I don't even

00:00:07.446 --> 00:00:09.350
really know what this does, but I

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.629
said margin 100, what I'm guessing means pixels?

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:13.649
&gt;&gt; Pixels, yes

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:13.870
&gt;&gt; I saw that, you know.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.900
&gt;&gt; So some of these are going to get overridden by

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.952
specific rules on like name divs that have class names, but.

00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:23.170
&gt;&gt; Sara, you said I shouldn't do it.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.019
&gt;&gt; No. Are you willing to put your money where, where your mouth is?

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.479
&gt;&gt; It's going

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:26.086
to look funny.

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:30.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah? Oh, crap. [LAUGH] It looks really. Hey, I'm still.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.120
&gt;&gt; Hey, you're still playing.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.049
&gt;&gt; I'm still doing well actually.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.220
&gt;&gt; You're combing things somehow.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Oh, there they are.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.150
&gt;&gt; You can probably see how to combine them here. Maybe.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.513
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:00:38.513 --> 00:00:38.918
&gt;&gt; That's interesting.

00:00:38.918 --> 00:00:43.120
&gt;&gt; Okay, so. [LAUGH] I guess, don't style your divs, is probably good advice.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
