00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:16.430
Today, Snoopy can be found on coffee mugs,
greeting cards and blimps, and even has his

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.830
own amusement park.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.730
But Charlie Brown’s lovable black and white
spotted dog wasn’t always mainstream.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.970
In fact, when the comic strip first appeared
in the 1950s, the dog and his Peanut friends

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.170
were considered, to quote Time Magazine’s
David Michaels, “the fault-line of a cultural

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.250
earthquake” due to the way the comic depicted
life, real characters, and sadness.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.940
Garry Trudeau, the creator of Doonesbury,
went so far as to call Peanuts “the first

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.079
Beat strip… everything about it was different….
[it] vibrated with ’50s alienation.”

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.789
The story of Peanuts is the story of its creator,
Charles Schulz- the man who changed everything

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.429
about comic strips.

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.519
Schulz was born on November 16, 1922.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.960
He would later state that a mere two days
after his birth, “an uncle came in and looked

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.270
at me and said, ‘By golly, we’re going
to call him Sparkplug.’

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.510
So, I’ve been called Sparky since the day
after I was born…”

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.710
Somewhat fittingly, this nickname was in reference
to a horse, Spark Plug, from the Barney Google

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.710
strip.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.590
Schulz was an only child and often talked
later about his feelings of isolation.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.280
With the freezing weather in St. Paul, Minnesota,
no siblings, and an introverted personality,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.840
he could be found most days reading comics
by himself, with his life’s ambition even

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.280
from childhood to be a comic artist.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.480
As to why, Schulz stated,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.520
When I was growing up, the three main forms
of entertainment were the Saturday afternoon

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.710
serials at the movie houses, the late afternoon
radio programs and the comic strips.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.240
My dad was always a great comic strip reader,
and he and I made sure that all four newspapers

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.420
published in Minneapolis – St. Paul were
brought home.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.990
I grew up with only one real career desire
in life, and that was to someday draw my own

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.990
comic strip.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.430
Schulz was also quite smart and skipped two
grades in elementary school, with the result

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.140
being even more isolation and inability to
make friends among his older classmates.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.099
It was in high school where his artistic skills
began to take off.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.050
Even late into his life, Schulz would show
off the collection of his early works, though

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.989
the school yearbook rejected printing any
of his submissions.

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.819
Beyond this perceived failure, Schulz also
stated in an interview with Johnny Carson

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.360
that high school didn’t go nearly as well
as elementary school academically- “I was

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.239
a bland, stupid-looking kid who started off
badly and failed at everything.”

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.310
A few years after finishing high school, now
at the age of 20, Schulz nearly simultaneously

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.950
experienced two abrupt life changes.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.180
The first occurred in February of 1943 when
his mother died from cancer, with her last

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.790
words to him reportedly, “Goodbye Sparky,
we’ll probably never see each other again.”

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.019
You see, Schulz had recently been drafted
and set off for basic training days before

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.019
her death.

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.530
Unsurprisingly for a young man who just lost
his mother and was soon to experience the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.920
horrors of WWII, his drawings from that era
were ones of depression and isolation.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.129
He would later state of his time in the army,
“The army taught me all I needed to know

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.519
about loneliness.”

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.280
This all seems to have eventually worked out
for the man who once stated, “You can’t

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.049
create humor out of happiness” and whose
first wife, Joyce Halverson, said he told

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.920
her on their honeymoon, “I don’t think
I can ever be happy.”

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.709
She further claimed, “He said he wouldn’t
go to a psychiatrist because it would take

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:20.939
away his talent.”

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.739
Schulz would further note in an interview
in 1997 with Charlie Rose, “I suppose there’s

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.060
a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists,
because cartooning, like all other humor,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.860
comes from bad things happening.”

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.529
Upon coming back from the war, he devoted
himself to becoming a full-time artist, first

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:42.519
teaching at Art Instruction Inc., and eventually
getting his first real cartooning job at a

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.620
Catholic publishing company where he lettered
a religious comic book called Timeless Topix.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.730
Schulz stated of this job,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.840
I eventually would letter the entire comic
magazine in English, French and Spanish — and

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.400
at one time I think I even lettered it in
Latin, I’m not sure.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.569
And for this [Roman Baltes] gave me $1.50
an hour — I was just to submit my time — and

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.250
I was always very efficient.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.829
He would call me up during the day when I
was working at Art Instruction.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.799
‘Sparky, I’ve got some things here and
I sure would like to have them by tomorrow

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:10.799
morning.’

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.989
So I would drive from Minneapolis all the
way to downtown St. Paul — sometimes taking

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.780
the streetcar if I didn’t have my dad’s
car — pick up what he wanted, which he left

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.190
outside the door, and then go over to Art
Instruction for the day.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.139
I enjoyed it thoroughly, and I could letter
very fast.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.460
One day I had done a special fast job for
him, and as a reward he let me draw a four-page

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.470
story which had something to do with some
soldiers or something, and then he actually

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.240
let me do two pages of humor cartoons, and
some of them were little kids.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.230
After they printed two of them, for which
I think I got $20 a page, he then said that

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.639
the priest who was running the outfit didn’t
care for those, so that was the end of that.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.590
Nevertheless, his work at Timeless Topix got
him enough local attention and experience

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.310
that, in June of 1947, he managed to get hired
by the Minneapolis Tribune to draw a strip

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.050
he called Li’l Folks.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.990
Still living in his father’s basement and
getting paid ten dollars per comic (about

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.150
$111 today), Schulz was in heaven.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.449
One can absolutely trace the origin of Peanuts
to Li’l Folks- from the well-dressed boy

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.879
who loves Beethoven to a dog with human traits
to a bald-headed kid named Charlie Brown-

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.520
named after a colleague of Schulz’ at Art
Instruction.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.530
The tone was also similar- a mixture of loneliness,
sadness, sarcasm, and outward expressions

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.199
of childlike joy.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.480
Schulz would later say that many of his characters
in both Li’l Folks and Peanuts came from

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.800
real-life inspiration.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.020
For example, Schulz noted, “The first dog
I ever had was a Boston bull named Snooky.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.080
She got run over by a taxicab when she was
about ten years old and I was about twelve…about

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.500
a year later we got a dog named Spike, and
he was the inspiration for Snoopy…

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.789
[Spike] was the brightest dog I ever met.

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.660
He had a vocabulary of at least 50 words – words
he understood, that is.”

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.789
Looking to name his comic dog after his real-life
one, he was disappointed to find out that

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.290
another comic at the time already had a dog
named Spike.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.789
So, he tried Sniffy but that was also already
taken.

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.460
Finally, he settled on “Snoopy.”

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.240
As for the character that would eventually
take the lead, Charlie Brown, this seems to

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.949
have been most closely inspired by the man
himself, though it’s generally thought that

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.220
all the characters embodied elements of Schulz’
personality.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.550
For instance, Schulz once revealed in an interview
that Linus, among other things, represented

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.000
his spiritual side.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.580
But as for Charlie Brown, said Schulz, “I
worry about almost all there is in life to

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.580
worry about.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.990
And because I worry, Charlie Brown has to
worry.”

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.159
Or as Charlie Brown once so succinctly stated,
“My anxieties have anxieties.”

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.629
Continuing the parallels, his father, Carl
Schulz, was also a barber the same as Charlie

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:35.629
Brown’s dear old dad.

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:38.949
On top of this, the red-headed girl Charlie
Brown always longs for but never attains also

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:43.669
mimics Schulz’s real life one time flame-
a red-haired woman by the name of Donna Mae

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:48.330
Johnson, who Schulz proposed to, but who turned
him down and not long after married someone

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.330
else instead.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.729
Going back to Li’l Folks, Schulz attempted
to get it syndicated into newspapers across

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.909
the country, which was generally necessary
for a comic artist of the day to make a career

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:59.909
of the job.

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:01.410
But for three years, there were no takers.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.720
Things finally changed when United Features
Syndicate expressed interest in the then 27-year-old

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.009
Sparky Schulz’ rather unique comic.

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:12.310
But there was a problem- there were already
comics out there with similar titles, like

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.539
Little Folks and Lil’ Abner, so a new name
was needed.

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.319
As for what the name should be, that choice
was taken out of Schulz’ hands when it was

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:23.259
decided at United that the comic should be
called The Peanuts– borrowing from the name

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:28.110
the TV show Howdy-Doody had for its on-stage
audience of kids- the Peanut Gallery.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.550
To the day he died, Schulz hated the name
“Peanuts” calling it “the worst title

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.430
ever thought of for a comic strip.”

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.919
In fact, he himself avoided using the name
whenever possible, stating, “If someone

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:42.919
asks me what I do, I always say, ‘I draw
that comic strip with Snoopy in it, Charlie

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:44.500
Brown and his dog.’”

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.099
In an attempt to phase out the name, at one
point he tried to give the strip a subtitle-

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:52.819
“Good Ol’ Charlie Brown”- but that name
didn’t catch on.

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:54.020
It was forever Peanuts.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.759
On October 2, 1950, the comic debuted in seven
newspapers, including the Washington Post,

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:02.190
Boston Globe, and New York World-Telegram
&amp; Sun.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.289
Even the first comic strip was slightly off-kilter.

00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:08.530
It depicts two kids sitting on a curb as a
joyous Charlie Brown skips past.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.530
“Well!

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.539
Here comes good ol’ Charlie Brown,” says
the sitting child (who would become Linus),

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:16.250
“Good ol’ Charlie Brown, yes sir.”

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.189
The final panel reveals the child’s real
feelings with Brown now out of view, “How

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:21.550
I hate him!”

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.939
At a time when comic strips were dominated
by action-adventure, slapstick, marriage humor,

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:28.090
and melodrama, Peanuts was different.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:34.110
The comic expressed sadness, anger, depression,
isolation, insecurity, and inferiority.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.289
While it was funny, it also did it at the
expense of some of the taboos of the time.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:43.800
For example, in the first panel of the March
27, 1959 edition of Peanuts, Lucy sits at

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.300
her cardboard box with “Psychiatry help
5¢” scribbled on the side.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.560
In the second and third panels, Charlie Brown
sits down in the chair and tells her “I

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.440
have deep feelings of depression.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.800
What can I do about this?”

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.240
After considering for a moment, she tells
him, “Snap out of it.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.660
Five cents please.”

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.120
Depression was rarely talked about out in
the open in the 1950s, much less in a comic

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.120
strip.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.030
Lucy’s advice – which she always gave
and always made Brown feel worse – was a

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:16.670
paraphrase of the typical given at the time-
as in it’s on you to choose not to be depressed.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.800
However, it’s clear that Schulz knew better.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.180
Not only that, but even the artistic style
of the comic was different.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.040
As the creator of Calvin &amp; Hobbes, Bill Waterson,
once noted,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.670
Back when the comics were printed large enough
that they could accommodate detailed, elaborate

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.190
drawings, Peanuts was launched with a tiny
format, designed so the panels could be stacked

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.889
vertically if an editor wanted to run it in
a single column.

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:41.850
Schulz somehow turned this oppressive space
restriction to his advantage, and developed

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:47.209
a brilliant graphic shorthand and stylistic
economy, innovations unrecognizable now that

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:50.980
all comics are tiny and Schulz’s solutions
have been universally imitated.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.980
Watterson would go on,

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.740
Every now and then I hear that Peanuts isn’t
as funny as it was or it’s gotten old.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.050
I think that what’s really happened is that
it changed the entire face of comic strips

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.699
and everybody has now caught up to him.

00:10:02.699 --> 00:10:06.709
I don’t think he’s five years ahead of
everybody else like he used to be, so that’s

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:08.020
taken some of the edge off it.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:12.180
I think it’s still a wonderful strip in
terms of solid construction, character development,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.800
and the fantasy element.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.860
Things that we now take for granted—reading
the thoughts of an animal, for example—there’s

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.970
not a cartoonist who’s done anything since
1960 that doesn’t owe Schulz a tremendous

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:22.970
debt.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.740
That said, things started off slow for the
strip and at the end of its first year in

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:31.010
circulation a reader survey of comics conducted
by New York World Telegram put it dead last

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.420
in popularity.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.899
Schulz kept churning the comic strips out,
however, and within a decade Peanuts was in

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:39.779
hundreds of newspapers across the country
and Schulz was beginning to be recognized

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:43.060
as one of the best comic creators in the world.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.510
Never giving in on its ideals or dealing with
hard-to-talk about subjects, Peanuts soon

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.480
found its way on the cover of Time Magazine.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.449
It also adapted to the times, bringing in
characters that continued to push the envelope

00:10:54.449 --> 00:10:55.730
in a changing world.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:01.510
For example, in 1966, Schulz introduced Peppermint
Patty- a tomboy who wears shorts, open-toed

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:05.010
shoes, calls everyone by a nickname, and lives
with only her dad.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.949
Peppermint Patty was quickly the strip’s
most complex, fully-realized character, who

00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:12.850
dealt with the political issues of the day
without hitting the reader over the head.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:18.320
Yet, she still possessed a similar inferiority
complex as almost every other character in

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.420
the strip- always believing she looked funny
and wasn’t quite good enough.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.779
Moving on to 1968, a few months after the
assassination of Martin Luther King, Schulz

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:31.330
introduced Franklin, Peanuts‘ first black
character, who attended the same classes as

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.779
the white students, became friends with them,
and whose father fought in the Vietnam War.

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:39.741
As you might imagine, however, adding Franklin
to the mix was not without controversy, even

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.670
before a strip with him was ever published.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.880
As Schulz said,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.881
I finally put Franklin in, and there was one
strip where Charlie Brown and Franklin had

00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:50.500
been playing on the beach, and Franklin said,
“Well, it’s been nice being with you,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.980
come on over to my house some time.”

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.910
Again, they didn’t like that.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.550
Another editor protested once when Franklin
was sitting in the same row of school desks

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.110
with Peppermint Patty, and said, “We have
enough trouble here in the South without you

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.209
showing the kids together in school.”

00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:07.240
But I never paid any attention to those things,
and I remember telling Larry at the time about

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.509
Franklin — he wanted me to change it, and
we talked about it for a long while on the

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:14.959
phone, and I finally sighed and said, “Well,
Larry, let’s put it this way: Either you

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:16.970
print it just the way I draw it or I quit.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.020
How’s that?”

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.960
So that’s the way that ended.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.560
In the end, Peanuts went on to branch out
into TV specials, movies, and best-selling

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.560
books.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.060
According to Forbes, for a time Schulz was
one of the highest-paid entertainers in America,

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:35.300
during his heyday estimated to have been earning
in the realm of $30-$40 million per year,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:40.060
while Peanuts appeared in over two thousands
newspapers and was translated into over twenty

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.910
languages in over 75 countries.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:46.760
On top of that, gross revenues from all sources
of revenue related to Peanuts combined saw

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.360
it bringing in in excess of a whopping $1
billion annually at its peak.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.399
All told, nearly 18,000 editions of Peanuts
were published- and, unlike so many other

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:02.600
famed comic artists who ultimately resorted
to hiring assistants to help out, Schulz drew

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.529
every single edition of the strip.

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:09.420
However, in the late 1980s, the artist began
to develop tremors leaving his lines wobbly.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:14.370
Said Schulz, “It’s just annoying, It slows
me down, and I have to letter very carefully.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.320
After my heart surgery, it was intolerable,
and then I wracked up my knee playing hockey.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.470
That was worse than the heart surgery; it
just took all the life out of me…I just

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.360
couldn’t hold that pen still.”

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.649
Nevertheless, he still refused to let anyone
but himself draw the comic.

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:32.029
Finally, in late 1999, he suffered a series
of strokes and would also undergo treatment

00:13:32.029 --> 00:13:36.280
for colon cancer, with the net result being
he was no longer physically capable of making

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.380
new strips daily.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.380
He said of this,

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.449
I never dreamed that this was what would happen
to me.

00:13:40.449 --> 00:13:44.510
I always had the feeling that I would probably
stay with the strip until I was in my early

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.510
eighties.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.300
But all of a sudden it’s gone.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.899
It’s been taken away from me…

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:53.170
And so it was that in December of 1999 he
announced his retirement.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:58.740
Mere months later, on February 12, 2000, Schulz
died – a day before his last Sunday strip

00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.740
appeared.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.690
In the end, Schulz summed up his comic as
something of a primer on disappointment.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.410
After all, as he said, “All the loves are
unrequited; all the baseball games are lost;

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:14.579
all the test scores are D-minuses; the Great
Pumpkin never comes; and the football is always

00:14:14.579 --> 00:14:15.810
pulled away.”

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.370
Despite all this, however, Charlie Brown and
all the other characters show an admirable

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:24.699
amount of fortitude and resilience when faced
with never ending stumbling blocks- they simply

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:27.709
never lose hope and never stop trying.

00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:31.889
On that note, unlike so many other successful
comic artists who contemplated quitting in

00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:36.860
their early days as the rejection letters
piled up, the obsessive worrier Schulz somehow

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.790
never lost faith that he would eventually
achieve his dream.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.790
Said Schulz,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.500
To me it was not a matter of how I became
a cartoonist but a matter of when.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.339
I am quite sure if I had not sold Peanuts
at the time I did, then I would have sold

00:14:50.339 --> 00:16:25.600
something eventually; even if I had not, I
would continue to draw because I had to.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:37.519
The

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:41.990
aforementioned art instructor Schulz named
Charlie Brown after, Charlie Francis Brown,

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.090
once stated in an interview that he got in
a little temporary hot water with a police

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.760
officer when the officer demanded his name.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.740
This prompted Mr. Brown to reply, quite honestly,
“Charlie Brown.”

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.220
The annoyed officer apparently didn’t believe
him.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:02.279
Charles Schulz once sagely stated, “A cartoonist
is someone who has to draw the same thing

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:04.550
every day without repeating himself.”

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.990
That’s a tall order for someone who created
nearly 18,000 strips- and it wasn’t always

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.990
easy.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:13.199
On this note, Cathy Guisewite, creator of
the comic strip Cathy, revealed in an interview

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.780
that Schulz once called her in something of
a panic as he couldn’t think of anything

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.179
to draw and was doubting whether he’d be
able to come up with anything.

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:24.280
Exasperated, she stated, “I said, ‘What
are you talking about, you’re Charles Schulz!’…

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.820
What he did for me that day he did for millions
of people in zillions of ways.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:35.100
He gave everyone in the world characters who
knew exactly how we felt.”

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.470
One of the most famous Christmas specials
of all time- A Charlie Brown Christmas, had

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.600
its genesis in a conversation TV producer
Lee Mendelson had with representatives from

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.679
Coca-Cola.

00:17:44.679 --> 00:17:48.960
They asked if Schulz had ever considered making
a Peanuts Christmas special, to which Mendelson

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.510
stated in the affirmative and a deal was quickly
made for the special.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.780
Mendelson then called Schulz, telling him,
to quote Mendelson, “I had just sold a Charlie

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.809
Brown Christmas show.

00:17:57.809 --> 00:18:02.100
He asked which show and I told him, ‘The
one we’re going to make an outline for tomorrow.’

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.590
And we literally did the outline in one day.”

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.060
Unfortunately for the pair, when the program
was screened by CBS executives, they were

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.250
less than thrilled.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.970
They didn’t like the jazz soundtrack; they
didn’t like the fact that real children

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:17.059
did the voices of the characters; they didn’t
like that the program lacked a laugh track;

00:18:17.059 --> 00:18:20.650
they didn’t like A Charlie Brown Christmas
– end of story.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.420
Their official verdict was, “this is probably
going to be the last Peanuts special.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.970
But we’ve got it scheduled for next week,
so we’ve got to air it.”

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:33.380
When A Charlie Brown Christmas made its debut
on December 9, 1965, it was seen in over 15

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.289
million homes, topped only by the wildly popular
Bonanza.

00:18:37.289 --> 00:18:42.419
It amassed glowing reviews, critical acclaim,
as well as an Emmy and a Peabody award.

00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:45.500
Well spotted CBS.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.460
When Schulz’ first wife, Joyce Halverson,
discovered the then 47 year old Schulz had

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.961
been having a several month long affair with
a 25 year old Tracey Claudius who he first

00:18:53.961 --> 00:18:56.910
met at a photo shoot, she demanded he end
the affair.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.890
Not long after, Schulz published an edition
of Peanuts in which Snoopy laments, “What

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:05.580
do you do when the girl-beagle you love more
than anything is taken from you, and you know

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.830
you’ll never see her again as long as you
live?”

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:12.160
Snoopy then is shown at his food dish, stating
“Back to eating!”

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.020
Ultimately Schulz and his wife divorced.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.770
As for his perspective, he would later state
in an interview, “I didn’t think she liked

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.710
me anymore and I just got up and left one
day.”

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.190
Within a year of that, he married another
woman, Jean Forsyth Clyde, who he met at his

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.190
hockey rink.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:30.690
The couple stayed married for 27 years until
his death in 2000.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:35.190
The character of Franklin would help inspire
a young Robb Armstrong to go on to become

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.220
a cartoonist himself, eventually creating
the famed Jump Start comic strip.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.890
Many years later, Schulz would ask permission
to give the character of Franklin the last

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:57.880
name “Armstrong” in homage 
to Robb.
