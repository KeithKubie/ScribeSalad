I certainly think the government needs

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090
I certainly think the government needs
 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.199
I certainly think the government needs
to regulate the use made of genetic

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:14.209
to regulate the use made of genetic
 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.980
to regulate the use made of genetic
information because if it doesn't we're

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990
information because if it doesn't we're
 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.679
information because if it doesn't we're
going to get into a situation where rich

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689
going to get into a situation where rich
 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.980
going to get into a situation where rich
people can buy information that enables

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990
people can buy information that enables
 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.590
people can buy information that enables
them to select certain among a variety

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600
them to select certain among a variety
 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.109
them to select certain among a variety
of embryos select the best children of

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119
of embryos select the best children of
 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.509
of embryos select the best children of
the children of the most talents and

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519
the children of the most talents and
 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.910
the children of the most talents and
poor people are not and I think that's

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920
poor people are not and I think that's
 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.430
poor people are not and I think that's
going to produce a society that's even

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440
going to produce a society that's even
 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.369
going to produce a society that's even
more sharply divided along lines of rich

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379
more sharply divided along lines of rich
 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.040
more sharply divided along lines of rich
and poor than our society is today and I

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050
and poor than our society is today and I
 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.130
and poor than our society is today and I
don't think we want or should one such a

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140
don't think we want or should one such a
 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.529
don't think we want or should one such a
society so on the genetics matter I do

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539
society so on the genetics matter I do
 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.139
society so on the genetics matter I do
think there's a need for regulation on

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149
think there's a need for regulation on
 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.979
think there's a need for regulation on
the use of stem cells for research the

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989
the use of stem cells for research the
 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.600
the use of stem cells for research the
only regulation that I would see would

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610
only regulation that I would see would
 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.880
only regulation that I would see would
be if any one we're going to use them

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890
be if any one we're going to use them
 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.340
be if any one we're going to use them
for Reproductive purposes but I don't

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350
for Reproductive purposes but I don't
 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.470
for Reproductive purposes but I don't
think that that's very likely I don't

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480
think that that's very likely I don't
 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.970
think that that's very likely I don't
know anyone who's focusing on that

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980
know anyone who's focusing on that
 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.560
know anyone who's focusing on that
so if stem cells or embryos are to be

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570
so if stem cells or embryos are to be
 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.630
so if stem cells or embryos are to be
used to remove stem cells and the stem

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640
used to remove stem cells and the stem
 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.020
used to remove stem cells and the stem
cells are then going to be used for

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030
cells are then going to be used for
 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.589
cells are then going to be used for
research and destroyed are not allowed

00:01:17.589 --> 00:01:17.599
research and destroyed are not allowed
 

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:21.730
research and destroyed are not allowed
to develop into an embryo and then a

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740
to develop into an embryo and then a
 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.339
to develop into an embryo and then a
fetus and a child I really don't see

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:24.349
fetus and a child I really don't see
 

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:28.200
fetus and a child I really don't see
much need to regulate that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210
 
 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.050
 
my defense of abortion is is unique

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060
my defense of abortion is is unique
 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.130
my defense of abortion is is unique
because it does not try to draw a sharp

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140
because it does not try to draw a sharp
 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.470
because it does not try to draw a sharp
distinction between the fetus and the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480
distinction between the fetus and the
 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.990
distinction between the fetus and the
infant it acknowledges the point that

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000
infant it acknowledges the point that
 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.180
infant it acknowledges the point that
opponents of abortion make that there is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190
opponents of abortion make that there is
 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.950
opponents of abortion make that there is
simply a gradual development of the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960
simply a gradual development of the
 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.950
simply a gradual development of the
human being that continues during the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960
human being that continues during the
 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.170
human being that continues during the
first months of life after birth as well

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180
first months of life after birth as well
 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.070
first months of life after birth as well
as beforehand so I think the question

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080
as beforehand so I think the question
 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.260
as beforehand so I think the question
about abortion we should ask is not is

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270
about abortion we should ask is not is
 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.050
about abortion we should ask is not is
the embryo or fetus a living human being

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060
the embryo or fetus a living human being
 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.640
the embryo or fetus a living human being
because I think the answer is

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650
because I think the answer is
 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.250
because I think the answer is
undoubtedly yes it is the the question

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260
undoubtedly yes it is the the question
 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.620
undoubtedly yes it is the the question
is what characteristics or capacities

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630
is what characteristics or capacities
 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.109
is what characteristics or capacities
does of being have to have in order to

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119
does of being have to have in order to
 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.930
does of being have to have in order to
make the case that that being has a

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940
make the case that that being has a
 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.900
make the case that that being has a
serious right to life and when we ask

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910
serious right to life and when we ask
 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.360
serious right to life and when we ask
that question I think it's not hard to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370
that question I think it's not hard to
 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.600
that question I think it's not hard to
see that the answer when it's a member

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610
see that the answer when it's a member
 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.910
see that the answer when it's a member
of the species Homo Sapien is not really

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920
of the species Homo Sapien is not really
 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.800
of the species Homo Sapien is not really
a very persuasive answer why should

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810
a very persuasive answer why should
 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.890
a very persuasive answer why should
membership of one particular species be

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900
membership of one particular species be
 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.290
membership of one particular species be
determinative of whether you have a

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300
determinative of whether you have a
 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.690
determinative of whether you have a
right to life or not so if we reject

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700
right to life or not so if we reject
 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.190
right to life or not so if we reject
that answer then we're going to have to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
that answer then we're going to have to
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.490
that answer then we're going to have to
look at the characteristics of the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500
look at the characteristics of the
 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.240
look at the characteristics of the
beings and say are these characteristics

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250
beings and say are these characteristics
 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.940
beings and say are these characteristics
such that if you have them you have a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950
such that if you have them you have a
 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.100
such that if you have them you have a
right to life and if if you don't you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110
right to life and if if you don't you
 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.490
right to life and if if you don't you
don't and I think we can explore what

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
don't and I think we can explore what
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.620
don't and I think we can explore what
those characteristics might be but the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630
those characteristics might be but the
 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.090
those characteristics might be but the
most important point is to break away

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100
most important point is to break away
 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.150
most important point is to break away
from the idea that its membership of our

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160
from the idea that its membership of our
 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.090
from the idea that its membership of our
species in itself that really is the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100
species in itself that really is the
 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.700
species in itself that really is the
morally crucial marking line dividing

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710
 
 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.770
 
you
