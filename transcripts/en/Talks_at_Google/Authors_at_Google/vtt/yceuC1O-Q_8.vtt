DAVID: Arun Sundararajan
is a professor

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.720
at New York University's
Stern School of Business

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.780
and an affiliated faculty
member at NYU's Center for Data

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.680
Science and NYU's Center for
Urban Science and Progress.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.920
He is here today to discuss the
sharing economy and the future

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.117
of digital governance.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:20.033
Please join me in welcoming
Arun Sundararajan.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:21.814
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.950
ARUN SUNDARARAJAN:
Thank you, David.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.730
And thank you,
guys, for having me.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.400
Thank you for taking
time out of your lunch

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.620
break to learn more about
the sharing economy.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.830
That's a picture of me
at Google the last time

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.600
I visited four years ago.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.230
I was trying out your bicycles.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.610
So this is the book
that you've been given.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.570
I have been a professor at
NYU for more than 15 years

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.040
I was never inclined to write
a book until I wrote this one.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.550
It wasn't part of the plan.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.740
The reason why I was motivated
enough to write this book

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.940
was that I started getting
interested in the sharing

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.490
economy through some examples.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.720
They seemed similar but
in different industries.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.830
You had Airbnb.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.590
You had Uber and Lyft.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.350
You had food-sharing sites.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.450
You had crowdfunding sites.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.300
And over time I started to see
a pattern that they shared.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.800
And I started to see them grow
at the pace that they did.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.460
And I began to
conjecture that we

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.930
were seeing the emergence
of a new way of organizing

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.480
economic activity.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.520
And so I wrote the
book to try and unpack

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.360
what that new way of
organizing economic activity

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.040
is, what its economic
impacts are going to be,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.940
how it's going to change
what it means to have a job,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.170
and what it means for the future
of how we regulate business

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.840
in the consumer interest and
in the employee interest.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.370
The subtitle of
the book has what

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.259
I think is the
most accurate label

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.660
for this new way of
organizing economic activity.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.527
I call it crowd-based
capitalism.

00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:20.110
That's not the title of the book
because "The Sharing Economy"

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.210
maximizes the number of
people who kind of know

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.160
what I'm talking about.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.770
And that was my publisher's
decision rather than mine

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.370
But let me explain to you
what crowd-based capitalism is

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.870
by giving you some examples,
many of which will be familiar.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.590
So when I was a kid, I
would watch television.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.080
I'd watch television
with my friends.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.560
The television programs that
I watched, the content itself,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.500
tended to be created by a
large corporation, typically

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.560
a television studio or
a television network.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.540
And then that content
was delivered to me

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.060
through the infrastructure
of another large corporation,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.140
either a government-owned
television

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.680
station or a privately-owned
television station.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.090
I have a 12-year-old
daughter now.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.930
She watches a little television,
but she watches YouTube.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.370
She watches YouTube the way
that I would watch television.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.203
She watches YouTube
with her friends the way

00:03:12.203 --> 00:03:13.980
I watched TV with my friends.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.830
And if you think
about YouTube, it's

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.570
a platform owned
by a large company.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.250
But the content that is
being delivered on YouTube

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.280
is pretty diverse.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.440
Some of it is created by
an individual amateurs.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.610
Some of it is created
by a group of people.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.060
Some of it is created
by small businesses.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.370
Some of it is created
by large studios.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.430
And so we've replaced
the model, or we're

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.920
starting to replace the model,
of corporate-produced content--

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.390
video content-- with a model
of corporate-delivered video

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.790
content but where the content
is created by a distributed

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.320
crowd of people of
varying scale and varying

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.080
levels of professionalism.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.930
And so this, to me,
is sort of a microcosm

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.460
of what's happening in a
lot of other industries.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.440
Philanthropy now has a
crowd-based alternative.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.990
If you want to be
a philanthropist,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.730
you can on Kickstarter.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.650
Again, you've got a platform
that is aggregating requests

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.529
for philanthropy, but the
philanthropists themselves

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.300
vary in their scale and it's
typically a distributed group

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.210
of people who are
collectively crowd-funding

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.230
the cause that they believe in.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.580
Traditional venture
capital is being challenged

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.720
by a crowd-based venture
capital where a platform

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.850
aggregates promising
companies, but the funding

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.114
is actually provided by a
distributed group of people.

00:04:39.114 --> 00:04:40.780
Some of them are
professional investors.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.380
Some of them are
amateur investors.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.160
If you want to loan, a small
business who wants a loan

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.080
can go to a bank.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.860
But they can also
go to a growing

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.310
variety of crowd-based
lending platforms.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.120
Let's take Funding
Circle as an example.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.970
It's based in the
United Kingdom.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.950
The typical loan ask on Funding
Circle is 50,000 pounds.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.000
The difference between
the 50,000 pounds

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.140
that you get from Funding
Circle and 50,000 pounds

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.870
you get from a
bank is that you're

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.840
providing the same
kind of documentation

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.120
on Funding Circle
as a small business,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.090
but the typical loan is
funded by over 200 lenders,

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.520
some lending as
little as 20 pounds.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.700
So we're replacing the model
of institution-based small

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.210
business lending with
a crowd-based model

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.700
of small business lending.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.470
Many of you have used to
Getaround, a peer-to-peer car

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.820
rental company.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.730
There's a competitor,
Turo, which is also

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.020
a peer-to-peer car rental.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.350
The platform aggregates demand,
but the supply of the cars

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.350
come from individuals who want
to monetize their cars when

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.980
they're not driving them.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.330
So, again, we're replacing
the Hertz and Europcar

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.170
model with a crowd-based model,
but a platform aggregates

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.770
micro-entrepreneurs
of sorts who are

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.250
running their own tiny
car rental businesses

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.930
through the platform.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.140
We're used to getting our
groceries from a grocery store,

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.120
like big food.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.360
There is a small,
but growing number

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.450
of peer-to-peer alternatives.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.400
I think the one that I'm
most familiar with is

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.786
called La Ruche Qui Dit Oui.

00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:09.580
It's based in France.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.470
It has 700 different
locations now.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.390
And it's a platform that
connects the growers of food,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.670
the producers of meat,
the fisher, the people who

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.460
are actually catching the
fish with the people who

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.410
want to buy their produce.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.640
And so the orders are
taken electronically,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.950
and then sellers and the
buyers are connected.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.610
So it's converting someone who
might have otherwise supplied

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.430
a large grocery chain
with the ability

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.110
to actually sell to
customers directly and run

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.973
their own small micro food
distribution business.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.770
Hotels would either
franchise their brand

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.350
to large companies, which
would then build buildings

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.100
and dedicate them for
short-term accommodation.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.960
That's being replaced
by a wide array

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.780
of crowd-based alternatives
where the demand is still

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.110
aggregated by a platform.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.990
Airbnb is clearly the
most visible example here.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.920
But if you think
about who is providing

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.120
the actual short-term
accommodation on Airbnb,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.910
it's a couple million hosts
offering 3 million listings,

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.790
each of whom, for all
practical purposes,

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.799
is running their
own tiny business.

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:21.090
They are managing their brand
through their reputation.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.240
They're setting prices.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.880
They're managing inventory.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.280
They are providing
customer service.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.970
They are providing
whatever labor inputs

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.650
are needed to provide the
short-term accommodation.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.570
The world's largest
hotel chain, which

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.030
is the merger of
Starwood and Marriott,

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.000
has 1.1 million rooms.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.399
Airbnb has 3 million listings.

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:42.440
By early next year, they
will have over a million

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.500
instant book listings.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.040
And so by any
measure, by next year,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.748
they will be the
world's largest provider

00:07:46.748 --> 00:07:48.400
of short-term accommodation.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.610
And I say that not to point
out how successful Airbnb

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.570
has become, but to
underscore the fact that this

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.640
isn't fringe activity anymore.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.906
A lot of these are familiar
things-- giving someone a ride,

00:07:59.906 --> 00:08:01.780
accommodating someone,
lending someone money,

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.490
supporting a cause
that you believe in,

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.540
maybe preparing
food for someone.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.730
But they're starting to
come out of the fringes,

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:12.200
and we're starting to see
platform-based mainstream,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.080
world-class, world-leading
center of the economy

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.540
alternatives to the
traditional corporate model

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.290
of aggregate resources and
provide goods and services.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.127
How many of you have
stayed in an Airbnb?

00:08:25.127 --> 00:08:26.710
How many of you have
hosted on Airbnb?

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.530
How many of you
have taken a Lyft?

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.409
How many of you have
you taken an Uber?

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:39.669
How many of you have tried
the carpooling feature

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.340
that Waze has?

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.309
Not bad.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:45.470
It's still early days.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.370
What I'm expecting to see
tip to crowd-based capitalism

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.760
in the future is energy
production and distribution.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.480
Today, energy is
largely produced

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.380
by large companies
that accumulate

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.160
resources and produce and
distribute this energy.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.680
Once the battery technology
for storing solar power

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.150
is good enough to be able
to reliably store it,

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.884
you will see local networks
that are platform-based that

00:09:07.884 --> 00:09:09.800
will emerge where people
who have excess power

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.700
can then redistribute it
to someone who needs it,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.730
either through a
transmission line

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.470
or by actually transporting
the battery from one

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.250
place to another.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.870
There's a company in China
called Trina Solar that

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.480
is thinking about a pilot along
those lines, where the power is

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.450
transmitted by actually
physically moving the battery.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.930
So the sharing economy is
much more than the companies

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.160
that you hear about in the news,
like Lyft and Airbnb and Uber.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.400
It spans a wide
range of industries.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.260
If you look at all
these industries

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.820
and put them together,
they constitute

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.720
over half the GDP of a
number of advanced economies.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.020
It's like the digital
transformations

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:56.480
that we saw in advertising, that
we saw in music, that we saw

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.540
in video entertainment,
that we saw in publishing

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.030
are starting to come
to the physical world.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.940
We're starting to see
digitally-enabled ways

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.310
of organizing
economic activity that

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.410
are entering the
very physical world

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.630
industries of accommodation,
of health care,

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.810
of retailing, of hotels,
of transportation.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.520
So I call this new way of
organizing economic activity

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.940
crowd-based capitalism.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.940
I see it as the third
phase in-- you know,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.990
I'm a business school
professor, so everything

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.130
has to follow three phases.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.530
The first phase was
pre-18th century

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.420
when most economies
that were market-based

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.870
or that were capitalist
were organized

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.570
through markets--
individuals producing

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.970
for other individuals.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.760
How many of you have
taken an economics course?

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.840
So in your textbook,
you would've

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.060
learned about the economy that
was the entrepreneur selling

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.030
to the customer.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.630
There isn't so much of a
mention of large companies.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.070
It's more like the
producer and the consumer.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.760
And that was what
the economy looked

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.847
like when Adam Smith wrote
"The Wealth of Nations"

00:11:07.847 --> 00:11:08.680
in the 18th century.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.970
That was the American economy.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.470
That was the British economy.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.610
But over the 19th
and 20th century,

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:18.620
the world's economy in
many countries reorganized

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.300
in a way where hierarchies
of increasing complexity

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.030
were created and started
to dominate how people made

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.360
a living and how the world's
goods and services were

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.340
produced.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.920
So by the end of
the 20th century,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.560
five out of six people who made
a living in the United States

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.300
did so by working as a full-time
employee for a company.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.670
That became the dominant model
of how you earned a living.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.400
It became the dominant model
of how the world's goods

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.800
and services were produced.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.370
What we're transitioning to
is a third alternative that's

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.600
going to set aside managerial
capitalism as a mainstream

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.870
alternative to organizing the
world's economic activities

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.660
where instead of an institution
accumulating the resources

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.870
and hiring the people
and producing the goods

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.100
and services itself, that
institution will instead

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.880
aggregate production by a
distributed crowd of people,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.550
whether it's lending money
or finding-- offering

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.990
accommodation, offering
transportation, food services,

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.700
energy, health
care-- all of these

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.290
are going to transition
in many sectors

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.900
away from the managerial
capitalism model

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.102
and towards the crowd-based
capitalism model.

00:12:31.102 --> 00:12:33.060
So what I'm going to do
in the rest of the talk

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.270
is just give you
a flavor for some

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.180
of the features of
crowd-based capitalism

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:42.460
I find interesting, but focus
mostly on digital governance

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.010
and regulation, and how I
think the way that we regulate

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.110
the world's economic activity
is going to have to change,

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.520
and what's actually
happening on that front.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.860
So there are many aspects
of crowd-based capitalism

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.870
that I found appealing.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.420
I think it redefines our
notion of perfection.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.150
We are used to expecting
perfectly folded towels that

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.360
are all the same color neatly
arranged in our hotel rooms.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.240
Once we start
staying in Airbnbs,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.940
we realize that that
feature of a hotel

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.850
may not be as important
as we expected it to be.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.471
We feel impatient when our
room service orders are late

00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:19.720
and then you start to wonder,
does this really matter?

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.250
So there are aspects
of perfection

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.670
that have been over-invested
in by the industrial economy

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.120
that we're going to start to
realize don't matter so much.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.220
But I think that a
more compelling change

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.320
is the blurring of
lines in the supply

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.910
system between the personal
and the professional.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.090
What do I mean by this?

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:46.310
Well, all of you
probably own cars.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.560
How many of you own a car?

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.380
I don't own a car.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.371
So I haven't owned a
car for a long time.

00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:52.870
So if you own a
car, you've probably

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.020
picked someone up from
somewhere, from the airport,

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.786
from the train station.

00:13:57.786 --> 00:13:59.910
You've probably given
someone a ride at some point.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.090
You've had people stay
over in your apartment

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.640
or in your house at some point.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.400
Maybe you've lent
a friend money.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.980
It's quite likely
that if you cook,

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.540
you've prepared a
meal for someone.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.670
All of these are
personal activities.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.229
They fell under the
personal umbrella.

00:14:18.229 --> 00:14:20.520
You didn't have to go and
apply for a government permit

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.020
before you gave
your friend a ride.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.080
It was just assumed that it's
between you and the friend.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.430
And on the other side, you
had professional providers

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.200
of the same services-- taxi
drivers, restaurants, bed

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.120
and breakfasts, money lenders.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.120
Now what the sharing
economy is doing

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.550
is it's blurring the
lines between personal and

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:45.420
professional in the provision
of these commercial services.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.820
It's allowing people
who don't do something

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.890
or who aren't trained
to do something

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.160
as their full-time profession
to participate as part

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.600
of the supply infrastructure,
whether it's lending money,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.280
investing in companies,
providing accommodation,

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.670
providing transportation.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.760
And the example
for transportation

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.170
that reflects this change that--
the two examples that I find

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.060
most compelling because they
are crowd-based capitalism

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.630
in the purest form, where
you're taking a distributed

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:21.460
group of people, tapping into
the resources that they have,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.150
and collectively
using those resources

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.190
to create something
that resembles

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.990
a billion dollar
infrastructure-- the newly

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.470
announced Waze carpool
where people can carpool

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.640
with other people
through the Waze app,

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.370
and the network that has
been created by BlaBlaCar.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.750
How many of you have
heard of BlaBlaCar?

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.500
So for those of you who haven't,
it's based out of Paris.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.140
It's got a funny name, a
carefully chosen funny name

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.040
that was chosen because it
had extremely high recall.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.100
If I asked you to name five
companies that I talked

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.010
about a week from
now, I'm sure you're

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.080
going to remember BlaBlaCar.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.260
What BlaBlaCar does is
that it makes it possible

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.690
for you to sell
seats in your car

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.660
if you're driving from
one city to another.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.400
So if you're driving
from Paris to Leon,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.550
and you're driving by yourself,
and you have three seats,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.508
you can advertise them.

00:16:15.508 --> 00:16:17.510
You can say it's
10 euros a seat.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.670
There are leather
seats in my Mercedes.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.860
I play soft jazz.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.770
And I'm a quiet person.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.750
Or you can say I'm
driving my Volkswagon.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:26.750
I play heavy metal.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.300
And I talk a lot.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.070
You can even rate yourself as
either being blah, blah blah,

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:35.330
or blah blah blah, depending
on how talkative you are.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.540
But here's 12 hours in
the life of BlaBlaCar.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.670
They operate across
22 countries.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.650
The blue dots are
people traveling

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.860
in an empty seat in
someone else's car

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.230
from one city to another.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.100
You count the
number of people who

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.350
travel on BlaBlaCar in France
every day, it's five times

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.810
the number of people who travel
on the Eurostar train network.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.930
You add up all the people
who travel on BlaBlaCar

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.860
across their countires,
it's way more than

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.590
the number of people who
travel on Amtrak every day.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.760
So they've created the
capacity of billion dollar

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.599
infrastructure without
spending any money

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.920
on new physical investments.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.164
This is pure
crowd-based capitalism.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:24.260
So this promises a new model for
building infrastructure, which

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.530
is crowd-based, where you'd
stop thinking of infrastructure

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.800
as being an investment with
high capital expenditure

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.620
and start thinking of
it as, well, there's

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.453
some underlying
infrastructure-- the roads--

00:17:35.453 --> 00:17:37.830
but how do we layer
on top of that

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.780
enough so that people will
start sharing commercially

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.240
the resources they have to
create new collective capacity?

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.740
You can think of this
applying to parking spots.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.630
It's already applying to demand
spikes during a sporting event,

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.220
like Airbnb picking up a whole
bunch of the excess demand

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.420
during the Olympics or
during the World Cup in Rio.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:05.000
And I've always understood
why people ride on BlaBlaCar.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.120
I mean, that was like I
understood that instantly.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.020
It's cheap.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.410
It's cheaper than
a train ticket.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.130
The schedule is
far more flexible.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.140
There are people leaving
at all hours of the day.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.359
If your driver is nice, he or
she will come and pick you up.

00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:21.150
And so it could be more
convenient as well.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.733
But I never fully
understood the logic

00:18:22.733 --> 00:18:24.570
of why someone would
drive for BlaBlaCar.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.060
I mean, you've got
a nice $30,000 car.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.809
Do you really want strangers you
don't know sitting in your car?

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:31.600
And what do you make
at the end of the day?

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.308
If you've got three
passengers, 30 euros?

00:18:33.308 --> 00:18:36.780
It's decent, but it's
not life-changing wealth.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.360
So I kept asking
the founders, why

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.943
is it that people
drive for BlaBlaCar?

00:18:39.943 --> 00:18:42.000
And they'd keep sending
me these charts that

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.230
say, look, we've launched in
Poland-- hockey stick growth.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.100
And I'd ask again.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.170
And they'd say, well,
consider the following survey

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:49.850
that we've done.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.970
Look at our trust framework.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.170
Finally, after asking
over and over again,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.130
they sent me a picture.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.780
And they said, look
at the picture.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.560
These are two young French
guys, like the picture explains

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.991
why people drive for BlaBlaCar.

00:19:02.991 --> 00:19:04.740
And this is the picture
that they sent me.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.240
I looked at the picture.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.020
And I said, aha.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.490
I get it.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.460
But it made me think.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.410
And what it made me
think about was--

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.080
and this is central
to understanding

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.940
one of the fundamental
shifts that

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:25.120
is being caused by the sharing
economy, which is that we have

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.330
been accustomed to a narrative
over the last 15 years

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.290
about how technology
is isolating.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.040
It takes us further
apart from each other.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.970
It creates digital
tethers where they

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:39.750
used to be high bandwidth,
emotive exchanges that

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.310
were face to face.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.100
And this is not a new narrative.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.730
It's something that
Nisbet was talking

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.820
about in the '50s when he
talked about the fragmentation

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.600
of community.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.290
And Nisbet quotes Durkheim
from his 1897 book

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.860
when he talks about how
technological progress--

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:01.520
fundamentally, the narrative is
that it takes us further apart.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.710
Now when I talk to people
who are participating

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.610
in this new world of
crowd-based capitalism,

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.700
typically they're
drawn to the service

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.470
because it's cheaper,
because it's more convenient,

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.010
because it's higher quality.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.480
It's more flexible.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.170
But what keeps them
coming back, what

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:23.120
keeps them using the service
is that feeling that they

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.880
are forming a genuine connection
with someone else as part

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.240
of an everyday
economic activity.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.220
It's not so much about I want
to meet friends and so let me

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.960
go on this friend-making app.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.520
It's more about I need a
ride or I need to get to work

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.170
or I need a place to
stay or I need a meal,

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.010
and we've taken out
all of the community.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.450
We've stripped out of
all of the connectedness

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.970
from our everyday
economic activities

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.470
over the 20th century as
industrial capitalism reached

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.130
its pinnacle.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.400
And I feel like crowd-based
capitalism is re-integrating

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.290
into our everyday economic
activities some of what

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.482
we yearn for, the simple
connection with someone else,

00:21:07.482 --> 00:21:09.690
whether it's sitting next
to them when you get a ride

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.850
or that feeling of intimacy you
have when you stay in someone's

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.230
Airbnb property even if they're
not there because you're seeing

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.310
little slivers of their life,
or like the nicer experience

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.810
of sitting at
someone's dining table

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.518
and sharing a meal
with a bunch of people

00:21:23.518 --> 00:21:26.414
rather than sitting
in a restaurant.

00:21:26.414 --> 00:21:28.830
Now the other point that I
want to make with the BlaBlaCar

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.320
example is that we are
completely rebuilding our trust

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.930
infrastructure.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.330
What do I mean by that?

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.100
Well, I've been
surveying BlaBlaCar uses

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.020
for a little while.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.740
And this is one of the results
that we got out of a survey

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.250
that we ran last year.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.040
It's across 11 countries.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.480
And the question had to do
with, give us the level of trust

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.382
that you place in
the following people.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.110
This was surprising not
just because the result

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.140
was so striking to us, but
because it persisted across.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.850
It's the same in Russia as
it is in France and Germany.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:15.310
It's the same in Poland
as it is in Belgium.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.340
And what seems to be the
reported level of trust

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.330
that these BlaBlaCar
users have is

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.440
that they trust
someone who they don't

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:29.300
know who has a full profile
on the platform at levels that

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.650
are comparable to the trust
that they place in friends

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.180
and family, higher
than the level of trust

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.180
that they place in a
colleague or neighbor,

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.170
and much, much higher
than the level of trust

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.550
that you place in a random
social media contact.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.580
So this either means
that BlaBlaCar users have

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.800
highly undesirable
neighbors and colleagues,

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.110
or it means that we've reached
this point where there's

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.680
a segment of the population who,
while they stopped trusting--

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.020
their level of trust in
institutions has fallen,

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.080
their general level of trust in
people in society has fallen,

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.610
but they are sufficiently
native in the digital world

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.150
that they can look
at a digital profile

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.610
and it can cause them to trust
someone who they don't know

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.710
sufficiently to
get into their car

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.840
and say, drive me
to another city.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.120
I've got ongoing research--
one of my Google faculty awards

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.220
is supporting this-- that are
trying to unpack this further,

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:28.040
go beyond surveys, look at
platform data, run experiments.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.670
But what makes me excited about
this is that every time we've

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.680
created a new system
of trust in an economy,

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.350
the world economy has
grown dramatically.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.720
We moved from
trading with people

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.260
we knew in our
village communities

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.590
to trading with people we
didn't know once government food

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.690
certification came along
and you could buy milk

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.856
not just from the person
you knew-- because you knew

00:23:52.856 --> 00:23:55.727
it was milk and not just
powder mixed with water--

00:23:55.727 --> 00:23:57.310
you could buy the
milk from the person

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.518
in the neighboring village
because now the government

00:23:59.518 --> 00:24:04.850
had set rules that outlawed
adulteration of food.

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.400
As many countries created courts
and contracts and property

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.500
rights, that expanded trading
possibilities significantly.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.410
If you think about
the everyday--

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.650
just spend 30 seconds
thinking about the things

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:21.100
that you've bought in
the last couple of days--

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.580
a cup of coffee or whatever
it is that you bought.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.470
Chances are that you're relying
on brand as a form of trust.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.420
Today that's the
mainstream form of trust

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.003
because you don't want to start
sign a contract every time you

00:24:33.003 --> 00:24:34.160
go to a coffee shop.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.349
I mean, it's too expensive.

00:24:36.349 --> 00:24:37.890
And so, instead,
you rely on the fact

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:43.510
that the business's desire
for your continued business

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:47.140
is going to cause them to invest
the right amount in quality.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.670
And each of these has expanded
commercial possibilities

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:51.370
dramatically.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.720
And so we're on the cusp of
creating a new infrastructure.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.900
It's a combination of existing
things like government IDs,

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.090
but new things like bringing
the social network online

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:05.060
through Facebook and LinkedIn,
like increasingly rich peer

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.340
feedback systems that
allow you to learn

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.480
from the experiences of others.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.230
And that's core to what
is making the sharing

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.640
economy possible today.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.660
Because 20 years ago,
we were trading stuff

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.790
with people on eBay.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.160
The feedback system was enough
to build trust in someone

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.022
you didn't know for them to
be able to send you a package.

00:25:26.022 --> 00:25:27.480
What's the worst
that could happen?

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.590
Maybe the product was broken?

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.590
It wasn't as advertised.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.000
That baseball wasn't real.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.180
It was fake.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.420
The jeans didn't fit you.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.270
The Beanie Baby
wasn't as advertised.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.650
Or you didn't get paid.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.310
Maybe you got paid late.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.520
But the risks were low.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.500
This was low stakes
sort interaction.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.030
And the feedback system
was enough to facilitate

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.140
that kind of trust.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.820
But we've expanded
this infrastructure

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.360
to the point where we are
engaging in this high stakes

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.605
interaction with people now.

00:25:55.605 --> 00:25:57.480
If you think about it
having a stranger sleep

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.771
in your spare bedroom, which
is what millions of people

00:25:59.771 --> 00:26:02.430
do on Airbnb, is a
pretty high stakes kind

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.500
of interaction in terms of
the level of trust needed.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.170
And yet it's been created.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:08.860
So is getting into
a stranger's car

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.750
and driving five hours if
you've never met them before.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:17.470
So given that we've created this
infrastructure of trust, that's

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:22.500
one of the reasons why I
think that we are-- it's

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.640
absolutely imperative that
we start to think differently

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.750
about how we govern
things and, in particular,

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:29.920
how we regulate business.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.280
There are plenty of examples
of the sharing economy

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.760
platforms butting heads
with city and state

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.990
governments around the world.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.980
Many of you have heard
about Uber and Lyft

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.490
leaving Austin
because they couldn't

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:49.930
come to an agreement about how
drivers should be screened.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.210
They're in the news
every day, like there's

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:55.550
a different city that is
either clamping down or being

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.080
accommodating.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.900
Airbnb has been in a multi-year
battle with New York state

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.329
regulators about the
legality of their B&amp;B. Even

00:27:05.329 --> 00:27:07.370
a small start-up-- and we
were talking about this

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.680
before the talk began--
food start-up Josephine that

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.662
allows people to prepare meals
and sell them to other people.

00:27:12.662 --> 00:27:14.120
They were shut down
in the East Bay

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.760
recently over food
regulation concerns.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.910
So part of the problem
here is that we've

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.280
got a regulatory system
that is expecting

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.650
full-time professionals
and large companies

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.000
as the suppliers.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.240
And now we've blurred
the lines between

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.460
personal and professional.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.140
And so we've got people at a
scale and a level of activity

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.700
where the old regulatory
boxes just don't fit.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.340
And so if someone drives a
Lyft for two hours a day,

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.430
do we really need the
same kind of oversight

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.570
that we needed for someone
who drives for 12 hours a day?

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.710
Someone is preparing
a meal twice a week.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.740
Do we really need the
same kind of oversight

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.990
that we needed for someone
who's running a restaurant?

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.040
And you might say, yes.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.415
I mean, of course, we do need
the same kind of oversight.

00:28:00.415 --> 00:28:01.540
Safety is safety.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.510
But we always make trade-offs.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.360
I mean, you don't
have a food inspector

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.874
stationed in every restaurant
testing every piece of food.

00:28:08.874 --> 00:28:10.790
We've already said, well,
that's prohibitively

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.007
expensive for the
government to do.

00:28:13.007 --> 00:28:14.090
So let's make a trade-off.

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:15.770
Let's have spot checks instead.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.260
And so we're willing to
accept some imperfection

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.190
in our regulatory
system by weighing

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:22.390
the costs and the benefits.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.750
And now, as the
supply system changes,

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.190
so do the costs
and the benefits.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.730
And we have to
rethink regulation.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.380
The fact that the
platforms are providing

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.010
pretty robust
digital trust means

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.860
that you can start to reduce
the role of the government

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.317
in providing those kinds of
interventions that were needed

00:28:41.317 --> 00:28:42.400
to prevent market failure.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.330
So if you take the
example of taxis,

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:48.560
25 years ago, I wouldn't have
gotten into a taxi in New York

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.170
City unless it had a government
body that was saying,

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.510
well, this is a legal taxi.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.110
This is metered fare.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.600
This driver has been
screened and is trustworthy.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.596
This car has been inspected.

00:29:02.596 --> 00:29:05.460
In the 1990s, the
taxi market would

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.350
have failed completely
unless there

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.500
was government intervention.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.450
It was absolutely necessary to
keep the market functioning.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.610
But now you've got
a new third party

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.360
that is providing a
lot of trust already.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.120
We've got GPS technology
that maps our route.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.640
Someone else can set a
fare and stick to it.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.891
There's a third party that's
interested in making sure

00:29:25.891 --> 00:29:28.223
that the drivers are high
quality, that the vehicles are

00:29:28.223 --> 00:29:28.940
inspected.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.390
So I'm not saying we toss the
government regulation out.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.680
But because of this
new way of trusting

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.680
that has been developed
between peer-to-peers,

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.200
we have to rethink
the role of government

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.250
and rethink other ways in
which we start to regulate.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.230
Because it's one thing
to say, well, I've

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.660
got this
infrastructure, and it's

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.400
going to regulate the 5,000 taxi
drivers in the San Francisco

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.705
Bay area.

00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:52.080
It's a completely
different thing

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.700
if you have half a
million people who

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.089
are part of the supply system.

00:29:55.089 --> 00:29:56.880
Some of them are giving
Waze carpool rides.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.920
Some of them are driving
Lyfts two hours a day.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.980
Some of them are driving
Ubers 12 hours a day.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.110
Once you have that
kind of scale,

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.830
the idea that the government
is the sole regulator

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.700
starts to make less sense.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.000
So what's the alternative?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.530
Well, we've already started to
shift a lot of the roles that

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.770
were historically the
government's to platforms

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:19.600
of different kinds.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.610
And you guys work at
Google, so you're already

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:23.260
familiar with this.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.390
But let's put Google aside and
look at some other examples.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.110
It used to be the case that
we would trust the government.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.510
We would entrust the government
with the responsibility

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:37.240
of dividing the rights between
the creators of content

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.670
and the consumers of content.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.900
We had copyright that would
say this is what you can

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.565
do with a book when you buy it.

00:30:42.565 --> 00:30:43.940
And these are the
rights that you

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.130
retain if you publish the book.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.897
This is what you can do
with a song that you buy.

00:30:48.897 --> 00:30:50.980
And these are the rights
that you retain if you're

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.790
the creator of the song.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:55.270
That division was done through
intellectual property law

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.250
and copyright law
by the government.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.630
We have de facto shifted a
lot of that responsibility

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:05.370
to platforms that provide us
with streaming music, platforms

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.780
through which we download music,
platforms through which we

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.430
buy electronic books.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:15.140
It's a license now between
you and the producer

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.910
of that content that is
mediated by the platform.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.460
There's a host of
other examples where

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.780
this sort of responsibility
that was the government's

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.490
has tacitly shifted
to the platform.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:29.750
And so we have to
embrace the idea

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.540
that many of the
functions that used

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.420
to be performed
by the government

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.040
can now be performed
by a third party.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.190
So what are my
answers to, well, how

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.480
do we deal with
regulation in a world

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.980
where it's quasi-professionals,
the scale of supply

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:49.110
is orders of magnitude higher
than just a few hundred

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:54.180
large corporations who can be
regulated by the government?

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.720
Well, I have three key ideas.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.090
One is to increase the
level of pure regulation

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.880
where people who are
participating in the system

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.380
start to become part of the
regulatory solution as well.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.020
So take the food
preparation example.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.430
Rather than having the
restaurant inspector inspect

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:17.550
every kitchen that is going
to be used to produce a meal,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:21.570
whether it's 10 meals a day
or one meal every three weeks,

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.270
instead have experts
on the platform start

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.680
to regulate the novices.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.800
Start to have some internal
peer-to-peer regulatory system

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.072
as an alternative to it all
flowing from the government.

00:32:35.072 --> 00:32:38.190
So that's one thing that I
think will start to expand.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.110
The second sort of
government solution

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:46.480
that I anticipate
an expansion of

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.710
is self-regulatory
organizations.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.700
This doesn't mean no regulation.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.660
It doesn't mean deregulation.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.040
It just means some of
the regulatory activity

00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:00.060
is conducted by an institution
other than the government.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.420
So we've had self-regulation
through history,

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.190
from the merchant
guilds in medieval times

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:08.070
through the
20th-century economy.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:11.900
Nuclear power has
successful self-regulation.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.700
The cotton industry has
successful self-regulation.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.020
Financial services as a
lot of self-regulation,

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.370
and the people argue whether
that's successful or not.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:23.210
The chemical industry, there's
a lot of self-regulation.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.230
And so this is not a new idea.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.770
And the stakes in many
of the industries which

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.670
we accept self-regulation
are comparable at least

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.470
to what's at stake with the
short-term accommodation,

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.720
point-to-point transportation.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.190
I think there's also
sort of some evidence

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.350
that the American
Medical Association is

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.050
a self-regulatory organization.

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:49.120
The bar associations are
self-regulatory organizations.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.850
The national
Realtors Association

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.340
is a self-regulatory
organization.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.650
And they play a part in
regulating health care

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.390
provision, provision
of legal services,

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.400
and the selling of real estate.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.930
Part of the reason why
you have self-regulation

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.180
as part of the solution
in these industries

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.150
is that they tend to
be more peer-to-peer

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:14.489
than, say, the production
of-- I don't know-- cars.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:16.620
And so individual
providers tend to be

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:21.300
more prevalent in medicine,
in law, in real estate.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.190
And so it seems
like the presence

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:24.980
of a self-regulatory
organization

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.929
is a natural complement
to a supply model

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.469
that is more peer-to-peer.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:37.020
And the final prescription that
I've been giving governments

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.880
around the country and,
actually, around the world

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.996
in terms of
regulatory approach--

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:43.370
and this is the
last point I make

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:47.739
before I stop for questions--
is data-driven delegation.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:52.860
To me, this is my competing
proposal to open data.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.170
Open data is very
popular these days.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.890
Every city government I talk
talks about their open data

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.440
initiative.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.750
And this has two sides to it.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:03.940
One side has to do with making
available data that governments

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.310
collect about us.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.340
But another side
to it tends to be,

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.540
well, if you're
operating in our city,

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.840
then you need to
give us some data.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:15.530
So Uber and Lyft hand over
data to many city governments

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:20.070
like New York City that provide
details about every ride

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.160
that they give.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.910
And this is supposed to be
part of a regulatory solution.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:28.420
I'm not a big fan of
that part of open data.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.640
I think it's much
more efficient instead

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.570
to delegate the regulatory
responsibility to the party

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.310
that holds the data.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:39.830
And so, let's say
that you want Airbnb

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:42.434
hosts to pay hotel taxes.

00:35:42.434 --> 00:35:43.850
Whether or not
that's a good idea,

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.210
let's put that
aside for a second.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.585
But let's say that
the government

00:35:46.585 --> 00:35:49.630
has decided that Airbnb
hosts are like hoteliers

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:54.510
and need to pay-- whatever-- 14%
of their revenue as hotel tax.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.250
They can either say,
register with us

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.130
and we'll collect
the tax from you.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:00.700
Or they can tell Airbnb,
listen, you already

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.400
have all of the data.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.280
Why don't you just
collect the tax for us

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.385
and give us an audited response,
and remit the tax to us?

00:36:07.385 --> 00:36:09.010
We don't need a system
for registering.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:11.550
And a lot of cities are
trying this-- delegate

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.180
the responsibility
to the party that

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.060
has the data for
actually enforcing

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.220
whatever rules are necessary.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:25.200
Or take the example of-- there's
a widespread casual evidence

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.850
in New York City
that the yellow cabs

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.370
in New York City discriminate
against passengers

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.950
of certain ethnicities.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:34.680
There are laws
against this, but they

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.889
have been impossible to
enforce from the looks of it.

00:36:36.889 --> 00:36:38.263
I mean, what are
you going to do?

00:36:38.263 --> 00:36:40.460
You can't have people
standing on the street corner

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.810
flagging down taxis that
don't pick up people.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:47.000
Now we live in a world now
where an increasing fraction

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.220
of those rides are
provided by Uber and Lyft.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.930
There's a data trail
about pick-ups.

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:57.880
Or consider the situation
that certain guests on Airbnb

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.870
are facing, where they feel like
people of certain ethnicities

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:05.140
don't get accommodation
as easily as others.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.620
The data driven delegation
approach here would not

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.860
demonize the platform,
but instead say,

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.990
well, you are a partner.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.220
You are part of the solution.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.010
You're not creating
the problem here.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:19.250
You're just manifesting
certain deficiencies

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.670
that human society has in the
interactions that are being

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.210
captured on your platform.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:27.190
Why can't you use
your data trails now

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.950
to detect and correct
the kind of behavior

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.710
that we consider undesirable?

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:36.930
It's been hard to capture this
kind of behavior in the past.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:41.040
And so data-driven delegation
is a way of saying, well,

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.850
if there is a data trail
through which behavior

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:47.770
that might need to be
corrected through regulation

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:52.380
can be detected, delegate the
responsibility of enforcing

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.910
those kinds of rules,
or even with coming up

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.020
with rules on your own, to the
platform of the entity that

00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.290
holds the data.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:02.540
Don't say, well, platform
give me your data.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.160
That seems far less efficient.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.270
And YouTube practices
data-driven delegation

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.380
on a daily basis with
their algorithms.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.430
And there are different
ways in which decisions

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.310
are made about whether
video content should

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:18.420
be streamed or not.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.160
I mean, it's inconceivable that
you have a government authority

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.412
regulating content on YouTube
at the same level of granularity

00:38:26.412 --> 00:38:27.870
and with the same
level of accuracy

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.020
that YouTube can do on its own.

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.550
Now you might ask,
well, what happens

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.660
when the interests
of the platform

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.740
diverge from the
interests of society?

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.660
What happens when,
say, the platform has

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.140
a certain set of objectives
that they want to fulfill,

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.210
but society's objectives
are different?

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.950
Maybe there are
externalities, maybe

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.320
we feel the platform is
over-providing certain

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.539
regulation, under-providing
other regulation.

00:38:54.539 --> 00:38:55.830
So you have to give them rules.

00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:00.020
And you have to figure
out a way in which they

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.570
comply with these rules.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.890
Well, the 20th-century
solution would

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:08.250
be to say, well, give
us an audited report.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:11.020
But I've started to think
of an audit as just one

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.940
particular response
to a specific query.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.210
We query publicly-traded
companies every quarter

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:21.940
and say give us the
following summarized data.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.400
It's of a specific kind.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.870
And every company,
instead of turning over

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:28.800
every single detail
of their operations,

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.910
every publicly-traded company
puts out a 10-Q. Every year,

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:33.850
they put out a 10-K.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:38.150
But that's the response to
one particular kind of query.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:40.950
And so I'm starting to see
more potential in the idea

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:45.100
that as you delegate regulatory
responsibility to platforms,

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.730
you also create some sort of
limited API infrastructure

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:54.080
where compliance with these
delegated responsibilities

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.850
can be verified
by a third party.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.554
So I'm still early
in my thinking there,

00:40:00.554 --> 00:40:02.220
but I wanted to toss
that idea out there

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.810
because I'm sure
that some of you

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:07.740
might have some
thoughts about it.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.510
But let me stop there.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.500
But this is where you can
reach me in case in the next 15

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.900
minutes of questions, you
don't get to ask your question,

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.035
or you decide not to.

00:40:16.035 --> 00:40:18.720
I'm easy to find on a
wide variety of platforms.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.530
So thank you for coming.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.608
And I look to your questions.

00:40:23.608 --> 00:40:25.592
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:29.700
Yes?

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.300
AUDIENCE: I really liked
what you said about trust.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.870
And one of the points
that I believe you made

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:40.080
was that one of the reasons
why that trust in the sharing

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.950
economy is so high
is because people

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:44.840
are able to learn from other
people's past experiences

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.070
and read reviews and
these sorts of things.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:54.050
But one question that I have is
that institutions and resources

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.670
determined by public
opinion really

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:57.960
isn't that new of a thing.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.630
If you think about even
voting in government,

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.810
most officials are
elected by the public.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.160
And people are well aware
that those decisions are

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.370
made based on public opinion.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:15.620
And yet, trust in
politicians is extremely low.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:20.210
So, really, the kind of trust
that exists within the sharing

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:24.810
economy is somewhat new and
revolutionary, and possibly

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:26.860
even quite an exception.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.960
I was wondering what you feel
has happened within the sharing

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.590
economy that has made that
trust succeed in a way

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:35.380
that it hasn't in the past.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.880
ARUN SUNDARARAJAN:
That's a great question.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.150
I think the ways in
which we could come up

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.420
with crowd-based
decisions in the past

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.400
have been at a very coarse
level of granularity.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:55.940
It hasn't been possible
to delegate responsibility

00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:02.160
for collectively making a
decision on small decisions

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.670
to a group of
interested stakeholders

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:10.360
because the process of running
an election is expensive.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.690
And so the big decisions, like
who should run the government

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:16.950
or who should be my
elected representative

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:20.400
have been determined by voting.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.960
But a vast majority of
other decisions have not.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.330
And so now with the ability
to capture information

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:31.660
from people who have an
interest either because they

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.890
have participated
in some process,

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:38.590
they have been customers of a
particular business, the costs

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:42.660
of collecting that information
have dropped dramatically

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:48.130
to the point where it is now
cost-feasible to have detailed,

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:52.360
granular feedback about every
restaurant, about every hotel,

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:58.360
about every nail salon,
about every small business.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:04.600
And so given that we have
that kind of information,

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:09.770
the way in which we
collect this feedback

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:15.850
is naturally aligned
with interested parties

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.860
contributing information.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.730
And so I think part of
the reason why there's

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:25.470
a higher level of peer-to-peer
trust in the sharing economy

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:29.460
than from, say,
population-scale voting systems

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.960
is that it's more
specific to something

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.380
that you are interested in.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:38.450
And the participation is also
from people whose incentives

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:43.100
are aligned, who actually
are informed about the thing

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:47.250
that they are providing feedback
on rather than randomly being

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.837
asked to make a choice of
pretty coarse granularity.

00:43:51.837 --> 00:43:52.712
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:54.792 --> 00:43:56.000
ARUN SUNDARARAJAN: All right.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.800
So the question was you focused
on the successes, what have

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.320
we learned from the failures?

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.640
I'll answer that in two ways.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.240
First is to say that there are
certain industries that I don't

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.700
think will make the transition
to crowd-based capitalism

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.710
any time soon, like
high-end health care,

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:14.010
meaning complex, health
care-- open heart surgery,

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:16.580
unlikely to be a crowd-based
platform for that.

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.230
I wouldn't use it if
there was one, for sure.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.307
On the other hand, I
cut my finger cooking.

00:44:21.307 --> 00:44:22.765
And I need someone
to stitch it up.

00:44:22.765 --> 00:44:24.850
I can certainly see a
crowd-based platform

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.900
where registered nurses who
live in the neighborhood

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.450
come and provide that for
a couple hundred dollars,

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.220
once the trust gets
to the level where

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.190
we can delegate health
care responsibility

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:36.680
to a registered provider.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.920
So there are certain
industry segments,

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.770
like heavy manufacturing,
those things

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:44.450
are likely to maintain
their industrial capitalism

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.580
structure.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.860
There've also been a
number of platforms

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:52.830
in the sharing economy that
have started and then shut down.

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:56.340
Some of them are just
because of VC enthusiasm.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.380
There's a lot of
money sloshing in.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.750
Bad ideas will get funded.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.390
It's the part of the process
of creative destruction.

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:04.700
I think some of
the platforms, you

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.560
have to get to-- there's a
distinction, for example,

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.840
between offering
something on demand,

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.220
instantly-- you place
the order and it

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.710
comes to you-- versus
offering something

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.080
as a scheduled service.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.540
I think we're
starting to realize

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:23.920
that some services-- on-demand
laundry, for example-- lend

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.430
themselves better to
the scheduled approach

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.806
rather than I ask
you to pick it up.

00:45:28.806 --> 00:45:30.430
And you come and pick
it up in an hour,

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.209
where the logistics start
to become more complicated.

00:45:33.209 --> 00:45:35.250
I think one of the things
we've learned from some

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:40.150
of the failures is that you
need a certain immense-- just

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:43.130
because Uber and Lyft are
successful with the on-demand,

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:47.070
instantaneous model doesn't mean
that every other industry needs

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.030
that.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.290
If I want a ride, I
want it right now.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:52.090
And I want it in three minutes.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:56.650
But if I want my laundry done,
or I want dinner this evening,

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:58.870
it's quite feasible that
the successful model

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.780
is going to be one where instead
of saying I want it now, bring

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:03.960
it to me, you might
say in the morning,

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.520
well, this is what I want,
and I want it at 7:00 o'clock,

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.860
or come and pick it up
at 3:00 in the afternoon.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:13.415
And those models may
end up dominating.

00:46:13.415 --> 00:46:14.790
I guess what else
have we learned

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:15.960
from some of the failures?

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.890
Well, there've been
a number of attempts

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.980
to create peer-to-peer
rental markets for assets

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.080
other than cars and
space in your home.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.660
If you think about it, space
in your home and your car

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.170
are the two typically
most valuable

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:34.250
assets an individual has.

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:36.150
The home is utilized
at a high level,

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:39.810
but it's so valuable relative
to a person's typical income

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:42.400
that even a small
amount of slack

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.180
can overcome the
transaction costs,

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.730
and you've got a
market like Airbnb.

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:49.060
A car is underutilized
vastly, and so

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.560
peer-to-peer rental
markets work.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.880
But they haven't worked for
things like vacuum cleaners

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.460
and power drills and all of
these celebrated 2012 sharing

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:57.721
economy examples.

00:46:57.721 --> 00:46:59.970
I think what's happening
there is that the transaction

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.860
costs are still too high.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.480
The value that is created
from lending clothing--

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:10.040
every city I've gone to has a
peer-to-peer clothing rental

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:13.540
market that is struggling
with logistics.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.360
So I think once we
get to the point

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.710
where the objects
that we're sharing

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:22.920
are self-aware-- the
digitization of the physical--

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.900
an object knows where it is.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.850
It knows how much
it's being used.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:29.260
And it can call on
transport, if needed.

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.580
And so if there's a drone
delivery network that

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:33.620
can pick it up and
take it, then you're

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.700
going to lower the
transaction costs to the point

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:39.290
where a lot more peer-to-peer
rental markets will

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:42.505
become feasible for
lower value assets.

00:47:42.505 --> 00:47:44.880
I think about this, and I
think about the only thing more

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:48.750
frightening than a network
of drones flying above me

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:53.040
is if they're carrying
power drills as well.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.080
So it may not be the power
drills that start it,

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:59.410
maybe the $500 dress that you
want to rent from someone.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:00.910
I think those are
some of the things

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.400
that we've learned from
some of the failures,

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.816
that the transaction
costs are too

00:48:03.816 --> 00:48:06.690
high for certain peer-to-peer,
and that on-demand may not

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:07.470
be instantaneous.

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:10.690
On-demand may not be-- unit
economics may not work out,

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:14.880
but a scheduled
model may work well.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.030
Well, I don't have
a good answer.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.380
So the question was, we
had a high level of trust

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.570
in the 1950s.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.310
In the United States,
people would hitchhike.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.330
That trust level
seems to have dropped.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:28.240
What happened?

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.400
And will we see a
similar drop-off

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.960
in trust in the sharing economy
as it gets more commonplace?

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.520
So I don't know why
trust has dropped off

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.390
so much in especially the US
economy over the last 40 years.

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:44.830
I've been tracking these numbers
from the General Social Survey.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.850
They ask people as part
of that [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:49.350
Every year or two years,
they have the giant survey

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:53.130
about everything from like
gun control to choice.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.860
And one of the
questions they ask

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.210
is, in general, you feel
people can be trusted

00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:59.990
or you can't be too careful.

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:03.080
And the response is
a reliable metric

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.100
that we've got 40 years of
data about the level of trust

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.930
in society.

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:12.240
So I've seen that number fall
from about 50% in the mid '70s

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.590
to about 30% today.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:16.710
So our level of trust in
other people, in general,

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:17.780
has gone down.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:22.250
The fall has been steepest
among people under the age of 35

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:25.420
where less than one in five
people under the age of 35

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.470
today believe that other
people are trustworthy.

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:32.950
The thing is that in parallel
with this fall in general trust

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.210
has been an increase in
digitally mediated trust.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:40.010
We're getting more accustomed
to reading digital cues

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.120
because we're growing
up reading Yelp reviews,

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.430
reading Amazon reviews,
understanding what's real

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:48.560
and what's fake about a
Facebook or LinkedIn network.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.610
And so our ability
to make assessments

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:54.230
about someone else based on
digital information about them

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:56.330
is getting more sophisticated.

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.540
And that's part
of the reason why

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:02.900
when although the average
person will definitely not

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.210
hitchhike in the United
States, it's likely

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:10.550
that as city to city
car-sharing comes along,

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:12.530
people will participate in it.

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.080
Or the average
person wouldn't stand

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.204
on the side of the road in
France and hitch a ride,

00:50:16.204 --> 00:50:19.280
but they would trust the
person on BlaBlaCar enough.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.420
Will this trust
dissolve over time?

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.210
I hope not.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:28.360
I think that an alternative
path that it could take

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.900
is that it could raise
the general level of trust

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:35.360
in society because more and
more of our everyday economic

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.160
activities are going to be
taking that leap of trust

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.110
with someone we don't know.

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:43.510
The vast majority of these
are positive experiences.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:47.100
And so, as we get accustomed,
as we stop buying from brands

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.230
and start to get our rides,
our food, our accommodation

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:53.000
from other people, and
as these end up being

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.200
positive experiences,
this may start

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.750
to inject a greater
level of general trust

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:00.290
in society because
we'll discover

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:03.410
through our own experience
that most people are,

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.590
in general, trustworthy.

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:09.950
And now that we also have
these digital feedback systems,

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:13.460
it raises the bar for
behavior, as well.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:21.000
Because if you were running a--
if you were, say, selling food

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.250
to your community in
the past and someone

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:27.710
had a bad experience, maybe
they'll tell their friends.

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:32.450
But it's not going to permeate
across your entire demand base.

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:34.920
Today if you're selling
food through Josephine

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:38.890
and someone gets food
poisoning, the entire community

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.330
is going to know instantly
through your feedback.

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:42.950
And that will shutter
your business.

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:46.140
So it raises the bar
on you to behave,

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:49.281
take actions that
are more trustworthy.

00:51:49.281 --> 00:51:52.426
AUDIENCE: So how do you see
the long-term [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:52.426 --> 00:51:54.300
ARUN SUNDARARAJAN: Well,
to the second point,

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:59.500
it seems likely that there
will be some things-- there

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.130
are some people who stay in
an Airbnb because they say,

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:02.810
oh, it's cool.

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:03.480
It's different.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.420
It's not what my parents did.

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.720
But Airbnb is
becoming, for example,

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:13.599
increasingly the
preferred solution

00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:14.640
for more and more people.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.410
It's not quite there yet
for business travelers.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:19.390
But for people who
are taking a vacation,

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:23.339
it's not so much about it
being cool and fringe anymore.

00:52:23.339 --> 00:52:24.880
I mean, they are
the biggest provider

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.940
of short-term accommodation
in the world now.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.900
So it's no longer
a fringe activity.

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.580
I think that kind of model will
persist because it will just

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.760
become normal.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.500
It enters the cultural dialogue.

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.110
It becomes the way in which
you find accommodation.

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:44.830
You don't think twice about
staying in a hotel now.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:46.360
It's just the thing
that you do when

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:48.250
you travel to another city.

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:50.400
And so I don't think the
acceptance or rejection

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.410
of Airbnb in a decade is going
to be colored by, is this cool?

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:55.214
Or, is this fringe?

00:52:55.214 --> 00:52:55.880
Or, is this not?

00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:00.180
It'll just be the way in
which you find accommodation.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.730
To the economic
factors, well, that's

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.690
an industry by
industry question.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:09.470
The unit economics
associated with Airbnb

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:13.540
are fundamentally superior to
those of the hotel industry

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:18.820
because you are tapping
into excess capacity.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:23.630
And so the unit economics
of peer-to-peer car rental

00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:26.670
are fundamentally
superior to that of Hertz

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:31.720
because Getaround now has more
members in the San Francisco

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.360
Bay area than Zipcar.

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.710
They've done it in an
extremely short period of time.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:39.960
And this is not
Uber-level funding.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:44.250
They're a modest-sized company,
but they're already that big.

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:46.250
How are they able
to scale so rapidly?

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:48.550
Well, because scaling
there involves

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:52.580
tapping into existing cars,
not leasing a fleet of cars

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:53.770
yourself.

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:55.920
So I'm optimistic
about many slices

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.410
of crowd-based capitalism
here because the underlying

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:02.090
economics are just
fundamentally superior.

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:03.890
I think most of the
subsidies that we've

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:05.820
seen from venture
money have been

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.560
in the point-to-point
transportation

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:11.080
space, the ride-sharing space.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.126
Over there, we've got
another transition

00:54:13.126 --> 00:54:14.500
that's coming that
all of you are

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:18.860
familiar with, the autonomous
vehicle transition.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:22.490
And that will take
longer than, I think,

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.210
Uber and Lyft
think it will take.

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:28.060
I don't expect that we will
have autonomous vehicles that

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:32.000
are mass market and
widespread in five years.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.376
I'm sure the
technology is ready,

00:54:33.376 --> 00:54:34.791
but there's a
cultural acceptance.

00:54:34.791 --> 00:54:36.270
There's a regulatory acceptance.

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.300
There's an interaction
between the autonomous

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.600
and the non-autonomous.

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.390
All of these need
to be ironed out.

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:43.930
And it's mostly the
acceptance factor.

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:45.660
But those start to come in.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.210
And so as these
subsidies start to phase,

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:52.150
the cost structure will
start to improve to the point

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:56.740
where, for an increasing
fraction of the population,

00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:00.040
on-demand transportation
will be as economical or more

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.560
economical than buying a car.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.560
I mean, right now
it's the case for me.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.240
I live in Manhattan.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.800
75% of us don't own cars
anyway because owning

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.470
a car is just useless.

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:13.490
You can't find parking.

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:14.730
It's really expensive.

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.550
And so you use subway.

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:17.150
You use taxi.

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:19.420
You use on-demand
transportation.

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:24.090
And you have similar, like San
Francisco, LA, the big cities.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:26.770
But at least half the
population of the US

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:28.850
lives in a densely
enough populated area

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:33.430
where if the costs fall enough,
the on-demand alternative

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:37.297
will be cost comparable
to owning your own car.

00:55:37.297 --> 00:55:39.630
And so if you think about
that, you think about the fact

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:42.460
that Americans spend
over a trillion dollars

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:44.740
every year buying new and
used cars-- just buying,

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.660
forget about maintenance
and all of that.

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.320
So what the investors
in Lyft and Uber

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.050
and there are for
others-- Go-Jek

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:58.480
in Indonesia, Grab in
Singapore, Didi Chuxing

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.610
in China, Ola in India--
all of them are unicorns.

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.820
But what the VCs are betting
on isn't that these guys

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:06.010
will be the new taxi.

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.509
What they're betting
on is that they

00:56:07.509 --> 00:56:10.120
will capture a slice of
the trillions of dollars

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.010
that people spend
buying cars every year.

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:14.431
So if you capture
5% of that trillion,

00:56:14.431 --> 00:56:15.805
you've justified
your valuations.

00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:21.860
So over there, I think
the model will work,

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:26.800
but it'll expand dramatically
as the unit economics improve

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.797
because of automation.

00:56:29.797 --> 00:56:31.380
Well, there's one
more point, as well.

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:34.560
Because of automation, but
before that, because also that

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.640
you have gotten
enough of a density

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.130
where genuine carpooling
through a market

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.220
starts to become possible.

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.010
And so you've got people driving
from San Francisco to Mountain

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:47.250
View and then driving back from
Mountain View to San Francisco.

00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:48.749
Even today, you
look at the highway.

00:56:48.749 --> 00:56:49.870
Most people have one car.

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.680
Most cars have one person.

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.380
If you get enough of a density
in a market where you can start

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.990
to get people to
share that space,

00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:59.410
then that model starts
to become viable.

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:02.290
And so that's another thing that
will drive down unit economics.

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:04.710
But I'm not making a
living driving the car.

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:08.090
I happen to be driving it from
one place to another anyway.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.320
And I'm just making
some extra money

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:13.480
by having someone else
subsidizing my costs.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:18.450
ARUN SUNDARARAJAN: Well, I can't
quantify how much of a reason--

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:22.880
so the question was,
I argued that part

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.090
of the reason why someone would
become a driver on BlaBlaCar

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:28.590
is social reasons.

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:30.940
To what extent is this
a convincing reason

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:35.590
and how much is a similar reason
present in other industries

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:37.990
in the sharing economy?

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:40.640
My conversations
with BlaBlaCar have

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.100
suggested that this
is a big part of why

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.190
people supply on BlaBlaCar.

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:49.378
You get lonely traveling a
long distance by yourself.

00:57:49.378 --> 00:57:51.127
It's nice to have other
people in the car.

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:58.770
It seems that, on average,
we live in a society

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:02.850
where people have insufficient
connection with other people.

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:04.440
There's a lot of
research that has

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:09.020
suggested that, physiologically,
we need social connection.

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.970
There's something
analogous to physical pain

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:14.590
that lights up in
your neural network

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:16.710
when you don't have
enough social connection.

00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:18.730
Neurologists call
it social pain.

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:20.990
So that's certainly
part of it that

00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:23.700
would cause you to make
a decision that just

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.740
purely on the economic
aspects isn't something

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.290
that you'd be drawn to.

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:31.330
So it's a combination
of reasons.

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:34.140
I think a lot of
recent Airbnb hosts--

00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:37.610
the fastest rate of
growth in Airbnb hosting

00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:40.600
tends to be in not the
millennial demographic,

00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.050
but in the over 50 demographic.

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:46.900
And I think over there, empty
nests, and I have spare space,

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:49.780
and it'll be nice to have
people staying in my home also

00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:53.710
plays a role that is
operating in conjunction with,

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:55.180
OK, I can trust
this person enough

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:57.660
and I make some money as well.

00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:00.770
So I don't think that
it's the only reason.

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:03.020
Well, the one place where
it's the only reason

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.960
is with couch surfing.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.640
Couch surfing is a
platform that allows

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.431
you to sleep on someone's
couch in exchange

00:59:08.431 --> 00:59:11.250
for letting them sleep on your--
or people sleep on your couch.

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:15.360
But there's no money there
because couch surfing is not

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.750
really a marketplace.

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:19.250
It's a social network.

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:22.150
The typical couch-surfing person
goes to a new city and says,

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:23.200
where's the party?

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.690
It's not like, I
need a place to stay.

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:30.210
It's a pure gift economy in that
the exchange of accommodation

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:34.690
is purely incidental,
and the real objective

00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:36.270
is to build the connection.

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:39.040
So over there, the social
reason is dominant.

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:43.470
But in other situations, it's
a combination of factors.

00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:46.670
Well, I mean, you
certainly have a point

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.060
with-- so the
question was, there

00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:52.080
are a couple of conjectures
that are given about why there's

00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:57.100
been a drop in societal
trust over the last 50 years.

00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:02.300
One is the sensationalization
by the media of negative events

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.230
with increasing intensity.

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:07.310
And the other is, I guess,
flawed regulatory intervention

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:11.010
and reaction to bad
events that have

01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:14.760
suppressed certain things that
would have otherwise proceeded

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.960
well.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.580
I mean, both are possibilities.

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:26.760
I certainly think that if you
look at the level of trust

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.760
or the level of activity
and, as a consequence,

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.730
the implied level of trust that
BlaBlaCar users in the United

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:37.940
Kingdom have, it's a little
different from the rest

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:38.780
of Europe.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.530
And that could be attributable,
in part, to the fact

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:46.130
that you don't have the
sensationalized "hitchhiking is

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:49.040
dangerous" kinds of stories
in France and Germany

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.070
as much as you do in
the United Kingdom.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.800
And so that's certainly
a possibility,

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.610
that certain activities have
been labeled as negative

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:03.500
because of a relatively small
number of extremely bad things

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.680
that have happened.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.470
But I think that there is
something more basic that

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:13.010
has happened when it
comes to explaining

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.110
that drop of trust--
I mean, I don't

01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:20.520
know exactly what it is--
because the drop in the level

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.140
of trust in society
hasn't just been

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:26.020
on specific kinds of activities.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.820
It's been fairly
broad-based, which

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:31.750
is why I think the sharing
economy holds so much promise

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.280
of re-injecting this trust.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.400
To your second point about is it
flawed regulatory intervention?

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.140
If that is the reason,
then the sharing economy

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:46.180
is probably in better shape
because a lot of people

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.920
think of these
platforms that we've

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.910
talked about as somehow
making an attempt

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.500
to reduce regulation.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.970
But that's actually
not the case.

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:01.890
The changes that they're
trying to induce,

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:04.560
or the changes that they
will induce, are different.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.120
They are a change in certain
government regulations

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.520
that don't fit anymore
and actually an increase

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.890
in total regulation, except
that the regulation is

01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:17.000
done by someone other
than the government.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.560
And so if you think about
the amount of regulation that

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.870
will be done in a crowd-based
capitalism economy,

01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:24.270
it will actually be more.

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:27.360
It just won't all come
from the government.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.490
And where I'm getting to is
that because in some ways

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:34.210
the equivalent to
government regulation that

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:37.420
emerges from a
platform is targeted

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:42.540
at solving a real problem and
is created by a crowd of people.

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.550
The chances that
it will be flawed

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:48.580
regulation that might suppress
the activity are a lot lower.

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.740
I mean, it's naturally aligned
with encouraging the activity

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:53.610
rather than discouraging it.

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.860
So if your conjecture about
regulatory intervention leading

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.840
to lower trust is correct,
then the sharing economy

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.910
is a solution.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.146
The regulatory systems
of the sharing economy,

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:04.270
they're more participatory.

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:05.740
They're more ethical
in some ways.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:10.205
They're more targeted at
solving actual market failures.

01:03:10.205 --> 01:03:12.700
There's some promise there.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.200
All right.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.459
Thank you very much enjoy.

01:03:14.459 --> 01:03:15.500
I enjoyed the discussion.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.250
[APPLAUSE]
