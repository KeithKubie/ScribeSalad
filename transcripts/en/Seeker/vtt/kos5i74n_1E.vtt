00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:12.550
A new experiment finds that leftover pasta
could actually be healthier for you, than

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.040
fresh pasta!

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.790
Science is amazing.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:26.869
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and as a fellow
lover of food and perpetual dieter, I cannot

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.620
tell you how happy I was to read this story
today.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.070
But before I get into it, I wanna mention
that what I’m about to talk about, isn’t

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.800
a scientific article or a peer-reviewed study
- it’s from a British television program

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.960
called Trust Me, I’m a Doctor, in which
a group of scientists did an experiment and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.290
found that reheating pasta - actually makes
it healthier for you.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.829
It sounds crazy - but here’s how it works.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:49.940
Pasta is a carbohydrate, right?

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.039
And like all carbohydrates, when you eat it

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.110
- it gets broken down by your body into simple
sugars, and absorbed - and that, in turn,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.039
causes your blood glucose to spike.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.320
In response to that spike, your body produces
a rush of insulin to stabilize your glucose

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.280
levels and bring them back down to normal.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.290
So foods with a lot of sugar - like sweets
or refined carbs - will cause very intense

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.470
spikes in your blood glucose levels.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.040
Foods that are rich in fiber, will still raise
your blood glucose levels, but in a much more

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.040
gradual manner.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.530
So it’ll be more like THIS and less like
THIS.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.370
Which is good - this is part of the reason
fiber is so good for you.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.030
And that’s where the experiment comes in.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.310
The idea is that by cooking pasta and then
cooling it down, you’re changing the structure

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.920
of the carbohydrates, and transforming them
into something called “resistant starch.”

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.400
Meaning it’s resistant to the particular
enzymes in our stomach that break down carbs

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.530
and release them in the form of glucose.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.090
So essentially, our body is treating the pasta
more like fiber than carbs.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.270
Which also means that you’re absorbing fewer
calories.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.810
But of course, a lot of people don’t like
cold pasta.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.810
So the scientists thought - well what if you
cooked pasta, cooled it down, and then heated

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.960
it back up again?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.950
Up until now, they assumed it would go back
to its original state.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.240
But nobody knew for sure.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.400
So for this episode, they did just that.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.340
Scientists had three groups of volunteers
eat either hot pasta, cold pasta, or pasta

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.950
that had been cooled down and heated up again.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.480
Afterwards, they gave blood samples every
15 minutes for two hours, to see how their

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.810
blood glucose levels changed over that time.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.240
And all of them started this experiment with
empty stomachs.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.530
As expected, the hot fresh pasta caused people’s
blood glucose and insulin to spike - whereas

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.910
the cold pasta, caused a significantly smaller
spike.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.910
But what was unexpected, is that the pasta
that had been reheated - which they assumed

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.620
would cause a spike similar to that of hot
fresh pasta - actually caused an even smaller

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.500
spike than the cold pasta.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.470
In fact, reheated pasta - reduced the rise
in blood glucose levels by 50%.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.140
Which has enormous implications for health
- and especially for people living with diabetes.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.260
Even the research team that conducted this
experiment was blown away by the findings.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.180
The next step, they say, is to see if adding
more resistant starch to one’s diet over

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.480
time, can improve the blood results of someone
with diabetes.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.150
What do you guys think?

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.290
Are you into leftovers?

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.600
I’ll be honest - reheated pasta sounds kinda
weird.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.530
But I do love a good pasta salad.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.790
You can let us know your thoughts in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.060
watching!
