SIMON MORRISON: "Within
the Quota" dates

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.750
from the early 1920s.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.440
It was premiered
in 1923 and toured

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.976
throughout Western Europe
and the United States

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:18.600
by a company called
the Ballet Suédois.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.980
It's a work that disappeared
from ballet history

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.360
despite being really prominent,
popular, good reviews.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.030
It has music by a fabulous
composer named Cole Porter, who

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.241
is an American classic
America’s songwriter,

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:32.574
and the fact that he actually
composed a piece for stage

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.470
for dance is little known.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.515
This current project
is about kind

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.730
of restoring Cole Porter to
Cole Porter in terms of style,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.480
and this kind of --

JULIA JANSEN: Princeton
University Ballet

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:43.960
is performing
"Within the Quota."

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.720
It is a production in which an
immigrant comes to the United

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.780
States and encounters all
of the American stereotypes

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.300
that he has of American society.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.250
The way we've updated
"Within the Quota"

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.280
is that we've added a political
element to every character

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.860
in the original production,
and this element

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.310
consists of an alteration
of the character

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.970
to reflect a policy issue
or political issue which

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.460
we're facing today, and more
specifically immigration.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.660
Yeah, that works.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.076
SIMON MORRISON:
The music is being

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:14.890
played by Penguin Cafe, which
is a professional ensemble based

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.665
in London.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:18.367
And they were very enthusiastic
about taking on this piece A,

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:20.700
because they're interested
in doing more work with dance

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.760
and B, because they're all
over the 1920s and Cole Porter.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.570
And because one of
the local schools,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.390
the Stuart School for Girls,
has a wonderful design program,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.656
we were able to work
with them on developing

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:34.030
the various slides that are
shown during the performance.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.260
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.830
PAIGE SHAW: This is a really
interesting project for me

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.140
as a history major and
historian because we

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.470
get to look at this
ballet, which was basically

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.800
lost to history, and take
that original plotline,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.050
original Ballet
Suédois production,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.717
and bring it into
the contemporary era.

00:01:51.717 --> 00:01:53.050
So it's been really interesting.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.630
Julia and I thought a
lot about the characters

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.360
and what their contemporary
roles are, what

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.279
their roles are now in today.

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.320
SIMON MORRISON: This work,
when it was premiered,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.290
was political because it was a
complaint against immigration

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.820
restrictions.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.220
Obviously, no matter how
you perform it nowadays,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.110
that parallel is easy to make.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.699
During periods of crisis,
the arts really matter,

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.240
and if you are
actually going to make

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.430
a point, political or
otherwise, the arts

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.060
is the best vehicle for it.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.476
And as I said to the students
involved in this production,

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.480
if you can, go for
it in this context.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.140
You know, making a statement.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.060
We're actually
offering a solution.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.657
When can you, and in what
context can you do that?

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.620
SWANEE GOLDEN: For me, dance
has always been kind of a way of --

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.920
a mode of self-expression, a
way to kind of express myself

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.610
and my feelings on things but
through a physical activity.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.560
So to have the
opportunity to react

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.830
to the current political
times in a method of dance

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.560
will be kind of supported,
not only by the University

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.040
but by an orchestra, an
international orchestra,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.100
is an incredibly
amazing opportunity.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.000
And I think it's really
amazing what Julia and Simon

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.830
Morrison have done,
in terms of updating

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.020
the characters and the
roles so that they're

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.400
so relevant to today's time.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.150
I think that'll really engage
the audience in a way that's

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.608
pretty different
than anything else

00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:09.490
we've done here at Princeton.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.170
JULIA JANSEN: It
is a ballet which

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.810
invites everyone,
invites all Americans,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.370
invites international students.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.090
It's not made for a single
group of individuals.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.700
It's made for everyone.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.750
And I think is the
bottom line of the story

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.610
is that America, as a
society, despite the hardships

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.980
that we're going through,
is a place for everyone.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.010
It's a place of
hope and prosperity.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.030
We are not exclusive.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.450
PAIGE SHAW: We're presenting
these opposing characters

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.060
and one represents
progression and liberalism

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.660
while the other kind of
represents conservatism,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.820
and neither is
conquering the other.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.980
They're kind of just
interacting in the end.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.640
So there's no real resolution,
but in the end of the ballet,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.070
you do feel this
sort of hopefulness

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.910
and this positive
optimism for the future.
