to score each of your pieces of art

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420
to score each of your pieces of art
 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.410
to score each of your pieces of art
we're going to insist that all of the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420
we're going to insist that all of the
 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.300
we're going to insist that all of the
rectangles have got different dimensions

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
rectangles have got different dimensions
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.349
rectangles have got different dimensions
and your score is going to be equal to

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359
and your score is going to be equal to
 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.980
and your score is going to be equal to
your largest area of rectangle - your

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
your largest area of rectangle - your
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.860
your largest area of rectangle - your
smallest area of rectangle your smallest

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
smallest area of rectangle your smallest
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.110
smallest area of rectangle your smallest
score possible is what you want to go

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
score possible is what you want to go
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.880
score possible is what you want to go
for the other condition is that you have

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
for the other condition is that you have
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.850
for the other condition is that you have
to tile the whole canvas so let's let's

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860
to tile the whole canvas so let's let's
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.920
to tile the whole canvas so let's let's
start out Brady how big do you want this

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
start out Brady how big do you want this
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.279
start out Brady how big do you want this
first rectangle to be 3 by 2 3 by 2 okay

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289
first rectangle to be 3 by 2 3 by 2 okay
 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.029
first rectangle to be 3 by 2 3 by 2 okay
there's a 3 by 2 so we can no longer

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
there's a 3 by 2 so we can no longer
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.790
there's a 3 by 2 so we can no longer
make a 2 by 3 or a 3 by 2 anywhere else

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
make a 2 by 3 or a 3 by 2 anywhere else
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.549
make a 2 by 3 or a 3 by 2 anywhere else
then I can make a 6 by 1 you can't make

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
then I can make a 6 by 1 you can't make
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.150
then I can make a 6 by 1 you can't make
a 6 by 1

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
a 6 by 1
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.040
a 6 by 1
in fact why do we do that there we go

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
in fact why do we do that there we go
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.380
in fact why do we do that there we go
there is a 6 by 1 what else would you

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
there is a 6 by 1 what else would you
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.880
there is a 6 by 1 what else would you
like in here should we make that little

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
like in here should we make that little
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.310
like in here should we make that little
square that 2x2 2x2 yeah and if you were

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
square that 2x2 2x2 yeah and if you were
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.859
square that 2x2 2x2 yeah and if you were
to stop right now this is area 20 so if

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
to stop right now this is area 20 so if
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.109
to stop right now this is area 20 so if
you were to stop right now your score

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
you were to stop right now your score
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.140
you were to stop right now your score
would be 20 that's your biggest - your

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
would be 20 that's your biggest - your
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.109
would be 20 that's your biggest - your
smallest for your score would be 16 and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
smallest for your score would be 16 and
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.480
smallest for your score would be 16 and
that is not very good you want low and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
that is not very good you want low and
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.240
that is not very good you want low and
16 is not low enough so what we could we

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
16 is not low enough so what we could we
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.899
16 is not low enough so what we could we
do we could split this into an 8 here

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
do we could split this into an 8 here
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.749
do we could split this into an 8 here
and a 12 we could do that and so now our

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
and a 12 we could do that and so now our
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.789
and a 12 we could do that and so now our
score is 12 minus 4 is equal to 8 you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
score is 12 minus 4 is equal to 8 you
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.039
score is 12 minus 4 is equal to 8 you
can tell Mondrian you are scoring this

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
can tell Mondrian you are scoring this
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.179
can tell Mondrian you are scoring this
an 8 you can score 5 so let me let me

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
an 8 you can score 5 so let me let me
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.819
an 8 you can score 5 so let me let me
show you this one your largest rectangle

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
show you this one your largest rectangle
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.800
show you this one your largest rectangle
is 8 - your smallest is 3 so that scores

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
is 8 - your smallest is 3 so that scores
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.520
is 8 - your smallest is 3 so that scores
5 and that is the best possible score

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
5 and that is the best possible score
 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.749
5 and that is the best possible score
that you can get for a 6x6 Mondrian art

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
that you can get for a 6x6 Mondrian art
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.789
that you can get for a 6x6 Mondrian art
puzzle of course you have to ask

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
puzzle of course you have to ask
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950
puzzle of course you have to ask

so for example for an odd square let's

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
so for example for an odd square let's
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.650
so for example for an odd square let's
say that you are dealing with a square

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660
say that you are dealing with a square
 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.309
say that you are dealing with a square

you know for sure that you can split
this nearly in two so that this is a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760
this nearly in two so that this is a
 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.250
this nearly in two so that this is a
rectangle 50 times 101 and this

odd square you can see that it's just
 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.449
odd square you can see that it's just
the edge length so you can guaranteed

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459
the edge length so you can guaranteed
 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.970
the edge length so you can guaranteed
that you can at least do a hundred and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980
that you can at least do a hundred and
 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.440
that you can at least do a hundred and
