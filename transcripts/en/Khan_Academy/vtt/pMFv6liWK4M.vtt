00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.820
We now have the tools, I think,
to understand the idea

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.680
of a linear subspace of Rn.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.900
Let me write that down.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.130
I'll just always call
it a subspace of Rn.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.630
Everything we're doing
is linear.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.090
Subspace of Rn.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.710
I'm going to make a
definition here.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.450
I'm going to say that
a set of vectors V.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:32.410
So V is some subset of vectors,
some subset of Rn.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.430
So we already said Rn, when we
think about it, it's really

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.010
just really an infinitely large
set of vectors, where

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.390
each of those vectors
have n components.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.620
I'm going to not formally define
it, but this is just a

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.460
set of vectors.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.240
I mean sometimes we visualize it
as multi-dimensional space

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.290
and all that, but if we wanted
to be just as abstract about

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.770
it as possible, it's
just all the set.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.400
It's the set of all of the --
you know we could call x1, x2,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.920
all the way to xn-- where each
of these, where each of the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.250
xi's are a member of the real
numbers for all of the i's.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.470
Right?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.410
That was our definition of Rn.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.880
It's just a huge
set of vectors.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.880
An infinitely large
set of vectors.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.040
V, I'm calling that, I'm going
to call that a subset of Rn,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.590
and which means it's just some
-- you know, it could be all

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.550
of these vectors, and I'll talk
about that in a second.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.140
Or it could be some subset
of these vectors.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.040
Maybe it's all of them but
one particular vector.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.090
In order for this V to be a
subspace-- so I'm already

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.280
saying it's a subset of Rn.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.240
Maybe this'll help you.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.300
If I draw all of Rn here
as this big blob.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.760
So these are all of the vectors
that are in Rn.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.390
V is some subset of it.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.220
It could be all of Rn.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.385
I'll show that a second.

00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:59.950
But let's just say
that this is V.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.470
V is a subset of vectors.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.500
Now in order for V to be a
subspace, and this is a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:16.140
definition, if V is a subspace,
or linear subspace

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.210
of Rn, this means, this
is my definition,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.270
this means three things.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.605
This means that V contains
the 0 vector.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.530
I'll do it really, that's
the 0 vector.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.620
This is equal to 0 all the
way and you have n 0's.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.960
So V contains the 0 vector,
and this is

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.660
a big V right there.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.820
If we have some vector x in V.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:57.470
So let me write this, if my
vector x is in V, if x is one

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.870
of these vectors that's included
in my V, then when I

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.270
multiply x times any member
of the reals.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.470
So if x is in V, then if V is a
subspace of Rn, then x times

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.290
any scalar is also in V.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.360
This has to be the case.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.410
For those of you who are
familiar with the term, this

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.900
term is called closure.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.700
If I have any element of a set,
this is closure under

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.520
multiplication.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.180
Let me write that down--
in a new color.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.283
This is closure under scalar
multiplication.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.720
And that's just a fancy way of
saying, look, if I take some

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.860
member of my set and I multiply
it by some scalar,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.840
I'm still going to
be in my set.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.500
If I multiplied it by some
scalar and I end up outside of

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.940
my set, if I ended up with some
other vector that's not

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.080
included in my subset, then this
wouldn't be a subspace.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.020
In order for it to be a
subspace, if I multiply any

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.940
vector in my subset by a real
scalar, I'm defining this

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.570
subspace over real numbers, if
I multiply it by any real

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.130
number, I should also get
another member of this subset.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.880
So this is one of the
requirements.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.170
And then the other requirement
is if I take two vectors,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.410
let's say I have vector a,
it's in here, and I have

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.360
vector b in here.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.320
So this is my other requirement

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.710
for v being a subspace.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.430
If a is in a-- sorry-- if vector
a is in my set V, and

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:51.100
vector b is in my set V, then if
V is a subspace of Rn, that

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.470
tells me that a and b must
be in V as well.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.120
So this is closure
under addition.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.840
Let me write that down.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.910
Closure under addition.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.430
Once again, just a very fancy
way of saying, look, if you

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.040
give me two elements that's in
my subset, and if I add them

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.740
to each other -- these could be
any two arbitrary elements

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.990
in my subset -- and I add them
to each other, I'm going to

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.980
get another element
in my subset.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.320
That's what closure under
addition means.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.330
That when you add two vectors in
your set, you still end up

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.660
with another vector
in your set.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.540
You don't somehow end up
with a vector that's

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.380
outside of your set.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.910
If I have a subset of Rn, so
some subset of vectors of Rn,

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.060
that contains the 0 vector,
and it's closed under

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.930
multiplication and addition,
then I have a subspace.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.870
So subspace implies all of these
things, and all of these

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.540
things imply a subspace.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.600
This is the definition
of a subspace.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.870
This might seem all abstract to
you right now, so let's do

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.860
a couple of examples.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.650
And I don't know if these
examples will make it any more

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.860
concrete, but I think if we do
it enough, you'll kind of get

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.810
the intuitive sense of
what a space implies.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.740
Let me just do some examples.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.370
Because I want to
stay relatively

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.470
mathematically formal.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.210
Let's just say I have the almost
trivially basic set.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.760
Let's say my set of vectors, I
only have one vector in it and

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.470
I have the 0 vector.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.670
So I'll just do a really
bold 0 there.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.335
Or I could write it like this,
the only vector in my set is

00:06:33.335 --> 00:06:35.410
the 0 vector.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.830
Now Let's say?

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.830
We're talking about R3.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.860
So let's say my 0 vector
in R3 looks like that.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:53.710
What I want to know is, is my
set V a subspace of R3?

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.670
Well, in order for it to be a
subspace, three conditions.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.030
It has to contain
the 0 vector.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.110
Well the only thing it does
contain is the 0 vector.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.430
So it definitely contains
the 0 vector.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.830
So 0 vector, check.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.980
Now, is it closed under
multiplication?

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.650
So that means, if I take any
member of the set, there's

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.810
only one of them, and I multiply
it by any scalar, I

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.440
should get another member
of the set.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.820
Or I should get maybe itself.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.640
So let's see, there's only
one member of the set.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.670
So the one member of the
set is the 0 vector.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.810
If I multiply it times
any scalar, what

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:27.370
am I going to get?

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.120
I'm going to get c times 0 which
is 0, c times 0, which

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.610
is 0, and c times 0.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.280
I'm going to get its
only member.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.250
But it is closed.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:42.140
So it is closed under
multiplication.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.720
You can multiply this one vector
times any scalar, and

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.750
you're just going to get
this vector again.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.840
So you're going to end up being
in your 0 vector set.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.010
That's a check.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.000
Is it closed under addition?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.660
Well, clearly if I add any
member of this set to itself,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.260
I mean, there's only one
member, to another

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.070
member of the set.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.650
There's only one option here.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.990
If I just add that to
that, what do I get?

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.430
I just get that.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.750
I just get it again.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:18.550
So it definitely is closed
under addition.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.270
Check.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.980
So it does turn out that this
trivially basic subset of r3,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:29.520
that just contains the 0 vector,
it is a subspace.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.860
Maybe a trivially simple
subspace, but it satisfies our

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.140
constraints of a subspace.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.750
You can't do anything with the
vectors in it, they'll somehow

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.230
get you out of that subspace.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.640
Or at least if you're
dealing with scalar

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.549
multiplication or addition.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.450
Let me do one that maybe the
idea will be a little clearer

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.340
if I show you an example
of something

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.700
that is not a subspace.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.660
Let me get my coordinate
axes is over here.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:58.880
Let's say I were to find some
subspace, some subset.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.170
I don't know whether
it's a subspace.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.830
Let me call it my set S.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:19.010
And it equals all the vectors
x1, x2 that are a member of R2

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.330
such that, I'm going to make a
little constraint here, such

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:30.670
that x1 is greater than
or equal to 0.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.160
It contains all of the vectors
in R2 that are at least is 0

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.960
or greater for the first term.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.850
So if we were to graph that
here, what do you get?

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:40.780
We can get anything.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.510
We can move up or down
in any direction.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.110
Right?

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.530
We can go up and down in any
direction, but we're

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.330
constraining ourselves.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.520
These are all going to
be 0 or greater.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.530
So all of these first
coordinates are going to be 0

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.530
or greater.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.950
And this one, we can go up
and down arbitrarily.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:04.390
So we're essentially, this
subset of R2, R2 is my entire

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.020
Cartesian plane.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.690
But this subset of R2 will
include the vertical axis,

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.125
often referred to
as the y-axis.

00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:14.950
It will include the vertical
axis, and essentially the

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.175
first and fourth quadrants.

00:10:16.175 --> 00:10:18.210
If you remember your
quadrant labelling.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.920
So that's the first
quadrant and

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.890
that's the fourth quadrant.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:33.810
So my question to you is,
is S a subspace of R2.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.080
So the first question, does
it contain the 0 vector?

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.870
So in the case of R2, does
it contain 0, 0?

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.395
Well, sure.

00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:48.790
It includes 0, 0 right there.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.610
We said x is greater than or
equal to 0, so this could be 0

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.190
and obviously, there's no
constraint on this, so

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.290
definitely the 0, 0 vector
is definitely

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.870
contained in our set S.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.410
So that is a check.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.840
Let's try another one.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.520
If I add any two vectors in this
set, is that also going

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.820
to show up in my set?

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.270
Let me just do a couple
of examples.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.230
Maybe this isn't a proof.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.860
If I add that vector to
that vector, what

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.690
am I going to get?

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.730
If I put this up here, I'm
going to get that vector.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.660
If I add that vector to
that vector, what

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.330
am I going to get?

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.530
I could put this one heads to
tails, I would get a vector

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:34.140
that looks like that.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:39.200
And if I did it formally, if I
add -- let's say that I have

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.550
two vectors that are a
member of our set.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.503
Let's say the first one is
a, b and I add it to c,

00:11:45.503 --> 00:11:48.570
d, what do I get?

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:55.400
I get a plus c over -- this
was a d -- over b plus d.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.100
So this thing is going
to be greater than 0.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.120
This thing is also going
to be greater than 0.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.550
That was my requirement
for being in the set.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.060
So if both of these are greater
than 0 and we add them

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.190
to each other, this thing
is also going to be

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.200
greater than 0.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.190
And we don't care what these,
these can be anything, I

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.320
didn't put any constraints
on the second

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.830
component of my vector.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.410
So it does seem like it is
closed under addition.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.790
Now what about scalar
multiplication?

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.620
Let's take a particular
case here.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.170
Let's take my a, b again.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.070
I have my vector a, b.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.340
Now I can pick any
real scalar.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.400
So any real scalar.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.830
What if I just multiply
it by minus 1?

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.440
So minus 1.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.140
So if I multiply it by minus
1, I get minus a, minus b.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.880
If I were to draw it visually,
if this is-- let's say a, b

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.235
was the vector 2, 4.

00:12:56.235 --> 00:12:59.500
So it's like this.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.910
When I multiply it by minus
1, what do I get?

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.650
I get minus a, minus b.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.580
I get this vector.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.300
Which you can be visually
clearly see falls out of, if

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.540
we view these as kind of
position vectors, it falls out

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.040
of our subspace.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.500
Or if you just view it not even
visually, if you just do

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.070
it mathematically, clearly if
this is positive then this is

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.040
going to-- and let's say if we
assume this is positive, and

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.250
definitely not 0.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.610
So it's definitely a
positive number.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.300
So this is definitely going
to be a negative number.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.000
So when we multiply it by
negative 1, for really any

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.635
element of this that doesn't
have a 0 there, you're going

00:13:36.635 --> 00:13:39.460
to end up with something that
falls out of it, right?

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.460
This is not a member of this
set, because to be a member of

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.270
the set, your first component
had to be greater than 0.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.530
This first component
is less than 0.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:54.040
So this subset that I drew out
here, the subset of R2, is not

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.920
a subspace, Because?

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.650
It's not closed under
multiplication or scalar

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.900
multiplication.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:17.910
This is not a sub space of R2.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.560
Now I'll ask you one interesting
question.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.570
What if I ask you just the span
of some set of vectors?

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:34.980
Let's say I want to know the
span of, I don't know, let's

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.390
sat I have vector
v1, v2, and v3.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.660
I'm not even going to tell you
how many elements each of

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:52.590
these vectors have. Is this
a valid subspace of Rn?

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.150
Where n is the number of
elements that each of these

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.500
have.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.320
Let's pick one of
the elements.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:09.610
Let me define, let me just call
u to be the set-- the set

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.030
of all linear combinations
of this is the span.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.740
So let me just define
u to be the span.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.830
So I want to know, is
u a valid subspace?

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:18.890
So let's think about
it this way.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.630
Let me just pick out a
random element of u.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.090
Actually, does this contain
the 0 vector?

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.590
Well, sure.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.950
If we just multiply all of these
times 0, if we just say

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:37.530
0 times v1, plus 0 times v2,
these are all the vectors, I

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.480
didn't write them bold, plus
0 times v3, we get

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.390
the 0 vector, right?

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.790
We did everything
just zeroed out.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.720
So it definitely contains
the 0 vector.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.685
This is a linear combination
of those three vectors, so

00:15:49.685 --> 00:15:52.120
it's included in the span.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:58.740
Now let me just pick some
arbitrary member of this span.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:02.650
So in order to be a member of
this set, it just means that

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.550
you can be represented-- let me
just call it the vector x--

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.500
it means that you can be
represented as a linear

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.040
combination of these vectors.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:16.420
So some combination, c1 times
v1 plus c2 times v2

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.145
plus c3 times v3.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:19.940
Right?

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.900
I'm just representing this
vector x, it's a member of

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.880
this, so it can be represented
as a linear combination of

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.030
those three vectors.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.570
Is this set closed under
multiplication?

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.850
Well let's just multiply this
times some arbitrary constant.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.980
What is c times x?

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.240
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.600
What does c times x equal?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.370
Let me do a different
constant actually.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.400
Let me multiply it times some
arbitrary constant a.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.810
What is a times x?

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.200
What's a times c1 times v1--
I'm just multiplying both

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.300
sides equation times a--
a times c2 times v2

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.710
plus a times c3, v3.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.280
Right?

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.109
If this was an arbitrary
constant, you could just write

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.520
this as another arbitrary
constant.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.050
This is another arbitrary
constant.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.869
This is another arbitrary
constant.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:10.290
I want to be clear.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.520
All I did is I just multiplied
both sides of the equation

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.640
times a scalar.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.410
But clearly, this expression
right here, I mean I could

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:23.040
write this, I could rewrite this
as c4 times v1 plus c5

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.150
times v2, where this
is c5, this is c4.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.890
Plus c6 times v3.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.410
This is clearly another
linear combination

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.320
of these three vectors.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.300
So, the span is the set of all
of the linear combinations of

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.370
these three vectors.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.100
So clearly this is one of the
linear combinations, so it's

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.080
also included in the span.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.980
So this is also in u.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.620
It's also in the span of
those three vectors.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.410
So it is closed under
multiplication.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.160
Now we just have to show that
it's closed under addition,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.540
and then we know that the span
of -- and I did three, here

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.600
but you can extend an arbitrary
n number of vectors

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.620
if the span of any set of
vectors is a valid subspace.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.930
Let me prove that.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.410
We already defined one x here.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.140
Let me define another vector
that's in u, or that's in the

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.640
span of these vectors.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.780
And it equals, I don't know,
let's say it equals d1 times

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:29.120
v1 plus d2 times v2
plus d3 times v3.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:35.900
Now what is x plus y?

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.090
If I add these two vectors,
what does it equal to?

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.550
Well, I could just add.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.570
x plus y means all of this stuff
plus all of this stuff.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.620
So what does that equal?

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:52.020
It means if you just add these
together you get c1 plus d1

00:18:52.020 --> 00:19:04.020
times v1 plus c2 plus d2 times
v2 plus c3 plus d3 times v3.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.930
Right?

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:08.260
You had a v3 here, you had a
v3 there, you just add up

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.480
their coefficients.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.930
Clearly this is just another
linear combination.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.600
These are just constants
again.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.960
That's an arbitrary constant,
that's an arbitrary constant,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.420
that's an arbitrary constant.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.660
So this thing is just a linear
combination of v1, v2, and v3.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.880
So it must be, by definition, in
the span of v1, v2, and v3.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:36.340
So we are definitely closed
under addition.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.400
Now, you might say, hey, Sal,
you're saying that the span of

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.500
any vector is a valid subspace,
but let me show you

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.440
an example that clearly, if I
just took the span of one

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.900
vector, let me just define u
to be equal to the span of

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.250
just the vector, let me just
do a really simple one.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.500
Just the vector 1, 1.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.550
Clearly this can't be
a valid subspace.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.540
Let's think about
this visually.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.190
What does vector
1, 1 look like?

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.622
Vector 1, 1 looks like this.

00:20:08.622 --> 00:20:09.680
Right?

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.260
And the span of vector 1, 1--
this is in its standard

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.300
position -- the span of vector
1, 1 is all of the linear

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.040
combinations of this vector.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.880
Well, there's nothing else to
add it to, so it's really just

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.710
going to be all of the
scaled up and scaled

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.050
down versions of this.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.020
So if you scale it up
you get things that

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.900
look more like that.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.970
If you scale it down, you get
things that look more like

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.250
that if you go into the
negative domain.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:35.060
So just by multiplying this
vector times different values,

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.370
and if you're going to put
them all into a standard

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.240
position, you'd essentially
get a line

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.880
that looks like that.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.070
You say, gee, that doesn't look
like a whole subspace.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.180
But a couple of things.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.800
Clearly, it contains
the 0 vector.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.060
We can just scale it by 0.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.180
The span is just all of the
different scales of this.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.820
And if there are other vectors,
you would add it to

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.480
those as well.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.750
But this is clearly going
to be the 0 vector.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.580
So it contains the 0 vector.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.980
Is it closed under
multiplication?

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.120
Well, the span is the set of all
the vectors, where, if you

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.230
take all of the real numbers
for c and you multiply it

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.920
times 1, 1, that is the span.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.130
Clearly, you multiply this times
anything it's going to

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:24.590
equal another thing that's
definitely in your span.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.540
The last thing, is it closed
under addition?

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.190
So any two vectors in the span
could, let's say that I have

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.690
one vector a that's
in my span.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:43.660
I can represent it as c1 some
scalar times my vector there.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.305
And then I have another vector
b, and I could represent it

00:21:47.305 --> 00:21:52.690
with c2 times my one vector
in my set right there.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.020
And so what is this going
to be equal to?

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.390
This is going to be equal to,
this is essentially going to

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:01.550
be equal to c-- well, get a
little more space-- this is

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:07.030
going to be equal to c1 plus
c2 times my vector.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.150
This is almost trivially
obvious.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.080
But clearly this
is in the span.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.820
It's just a scaled up
version of this.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.260
This is in the span, it's in a
scaled up version of this.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.370
And this is also going to be
in the span of this vector,

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.190
because this is just
another scalar.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.380
We could call that c3.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:28.110
If you just do it visually, if I
take this vector right there

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:33.700
and I were to add it to this
vector, if you put them head

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.080
to tails, you would end
up with this vector.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.200
Right there in green.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200
I don't know if you
can see it.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.410
I'll do it in red right there.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.720
You end up with that vector.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.160
And you could do that any vector
plus any other vector

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.020
on this line is going to equal
another vector on this line.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.585
Any vector on this line
multiplied by some scalar is

00:22:52.585 --> 00:22:55.130
just going to be another
vector on this line.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.280
So you're closed under
multiplication.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.830
Your closed under addition.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:03.880
And you include the 0 vector.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:09.640
So even this trivially simple
span is a valid subspace.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.460
And that just backs up the
idea that we showed here.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.290
That, in general, I could
have just made

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.740
this a set of n vectors.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.060
I picked three vectors right
here, but it could've been n

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.490
vectors and I could have used
the same argument that the

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:26.980
span of n vectors is a
valid subspace of Rn.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.050
And I showed it right there.
