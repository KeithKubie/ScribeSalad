1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.210
Okay.
Last lecture of the semester,
we're going to talk about the big question.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.360
How did this little group of Jews following a profit and apocalyptic prophet

3
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:17.030
around Galilee who is then executed,
uh,

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.070
shortly thereafter in Jerusalem become what we now call a major world religion?

5
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.110
How did that happen?

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.520
Because the whole first hundred years we've talked about in this class of what

7
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.110
we now call Christianity,
of course,

8
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.470
it's not even called Christianity until the letters of Ignatius.

9
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.810
There was no term Christianity and the Bible itself,
and as I've said,

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.690
the Apostle Paul certainly did not use the term Christian.

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.470
He probably would have rejected it because that would imply that he was doing

12
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:50.010
something else besides just bringing the gentiles into Israel.

13
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.430
He thought he was continuing Israel,
not making another religion.

14
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.910
So how did this ragtag bunch of people following Jesus and then these different

15
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:02.340
house churches become what's called now a major world religion.

16
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.370
We'll talk a bit about that today and then I'm going to talk in the class with a

17
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:12.030
little bit of stuff on a theory of interpretation that we've hit on over the

18
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:15.510
semester.
I should also remind you that,
um,

19
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.840
at the end of the class will be passing out the instructions for your final

20
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:23.190
exams.
I'll leave about 10 minutes or so of time for us to talk about that.

21
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.640
So you'll have plenty of time to ask questions about the final exam once you get

22
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:31.020
the instructions.
And finally,
since this is your last chance,

23
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.380
I'll be sure and stick up your hand if you want to ask a question or make a

24
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:37.284
comment.

25
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.500
This is the time if you want to throw things and be a rebel against the course,

26
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:44.700
this is probably the best time to do it.
Your last chance.

27
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.960
So ask any questions you want also about any of these topics and we'll talk

28
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:49.794
about that

29
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.260
from the teachings of Jesus to the Gospel about Jesus.

30
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.120
That's one of the first things that happens.

31
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.430
We've already seen that going on the historical Jesus.
And if you really are,

32
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.620
have not had enough of this and you want to take a historical Jesus course,

33
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.610
I'm going to be teaching a seminar for undergraduates on the historical Jesus in

34
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:13.530
the fall,
uh,
open to anybody.
And we'll have a full semester to,

35
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.250
to deal with these problems with the historical Jesus in a seminar setting that

36
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:21.300
hits the historical Jesus did not talk about himself as the Christ.

37
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.420
We just don't have them doing that except from the gospel of John.

38
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.570
It may well have been that he thought he was the messiah or that he thought he

39
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:29.100
was preceding the Messiah Messiah.

40
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.220
Somebody must have thought that he was a messianic figure because that's what

41
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:36.120
the Romans executed in for.
So either he may have thought he was the messiah,

42
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:39.620
or some of his disciples may have hoped that he was my messiah,
uh,

43
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.360
but he didn't go around preaching about himself.

44
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.770
The topic that Jesus talks about the most in the synoptic gospels is actually

45
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:50.400
the Kingdom of God.
This thing that was expected to happen in the future.

46
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.770
So the historical Jesus first is,

47
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.690
is talking about some gospel that it's a,
it's good news,

48
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.750
but it's about this coming kingdom of God that's gonna be when God's going to

49
00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:04.090
break in.
But very quickly after his death,
uh,

50
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.190
as we see already by the letters of Paul,

51
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.480
the earliest material in the New Testament,
the gospel of Jesus,
the Gospel,

52
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:14.740
the good news he proclaimed became the gospel about Jesus.
In other words,

53
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:18.550
the good news was who was this man and what does that mean for us?

54
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.230
So that's the first major change that happens in early Christianity on the way

55
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.610
to becoming Christianity.

56
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.280
And there you've seen the growth of the Pauline churches.

57
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.700
So the first thing that happens is it moves out of Palestine and it moves

58
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.970
through up the Greek speaking world in the West.
And very early,

59
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.910
we don't know by whom that a church,

60
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.820
a church was planted in Rome because it's already there.

61
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.730
By the time Paul writes to the Romans has been there for four years,

62
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.360
we've seen how there's a diversity of early Christian groups.
And in fact,

63
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:49.540
your final exam will require you with you choose,

64
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.740
you'll choose one of two questions.

65
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.770
It will cry you to address this issue that we've been hitting on all semester

66
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.800
long about how diverse this early movement was.
What did it,

67
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.300
what did different groups look like?

68
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.820
We've also talked the last lecture about how did some of the institutions of the

69
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:08.440
church start gradually being developed,
such as having a bishop,
having priests,

70
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.210
having deacons,
uh,

71
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:15.211
and then the establishment of the Lord's supper as a piece of liturgy and ritual

72
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.820
that becomes celebrated throughout these different groups.

73
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.780
The practice of baptism being pretty much universally practiced by these groups

74
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.570
very quickly.
We also have seen,
uh,

75
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:28.690
the part of the beginning of the rise of Christian scripture.
We,

76
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.060
we've not gotten to the cannon in this course,

77
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:34.180
that actual development of cannabis because that doesn't happen until the
fourth,

78
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:34.451
fifth,

79
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:38.650
and sixth centuries when the list of these books that become the New Testament

80
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.760
Canon become more solidified.
But we've seen the beginnings of this,
right?

81
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:46.720
We've seen how a different gospel writers were used,
other gospels,

82
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.520
we've seen how the writer of Second Peter will talk about Paul's letters as

83
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:52.354
scripture.

84
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.510
So we've seen a collection of Paul's letters coming about and we've seen the

85
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:58.870
gospels coming about as a collection in the second century.

86
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.070
And then one of the major things we've seen the beginnings of that will become

87
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:07.450
more and more important for the nature of Christianity later is its separation

88
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:11.020
from Judaism.
As I've repeated several times in this course,

89
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.550
the earliest people who followed Jesus never thought they were starting a new

90
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:16.150
religion.

91
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.150
They thought they were simply continuing the right behavior of Judaism and Paul

92
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:23.710
himself thought he was continuing.
Judaism is just,

93
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:27.820
he thought that he was bringing non Jews into it in an in a fairly new way.

94
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.590
But we've seen the beginnings of how in the letter to the,

95
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.980
to the Hebrews who seen the letter,

96
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.040
the sermon end with the author making this weird statement about let us go

97
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.720
outside the camp.

98
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.490
As Jesus was executed outside the city of Jerusalem and the sacrifices were done

99
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.050
in exodus outside of the camp.
So we as now followers of Jesus,

100
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:53.980
we should go outside the camp sounding like he's meaning we're going to leave

101
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.400
Judaism.
We have announced superior liturgy in the second century.

102
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.230
This separation of the church from the synagogue will start becoming clear in

103
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:07.220
certain places.
And finally,
what you'll end up with after the fourth,

104
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:12.221
fifth and sixth century is a Christian Church that's not Jewish and rabbinic

105
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.270
Judaism that comes to look more like what Judaism has looked,
uh,
since that time,

106
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.810
even different from the Judaism as it was in the time of Jesus.

107
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.180
The second century therefore sees some important changes.
First.

108
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.321
As I've said,

109
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:32.321
Christianity is still remarkably diverse even in the second century and it does

110
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:33.314
grow.

111
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.030
How quickly it grows numerically is really impossible to say.

112
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:42.590
We don't have the kind of demographic data to know how much growth,

113
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.370
how much numerical growth there was in the Christian Church in the second

114
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.490
century,
but we can obviously tell it's happening in different places by,

115
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.221
if nothing more,

116
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:53.900
see increase in lieu written literature that comes about in different

117
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.970
geographical locations during the second century.

118
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.190
Connections among these different groups also started growing.
As I've,

119
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.930
as I've tried to make clear,

120
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.010
we don't really have any reason to believe that the churches that Paul founded

121
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.750
where that closely connected to say other churches that may have existed in

122
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:14.390
Syria or in Egypt or in Italy.

123
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.950
Paul did want his churches to remain closely connected to the church in

124
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:22.610
Jerusalem.
And that's precisely why he started this collection.
Uh,

125
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.690
among the gentiles.

126
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.690
Predominantly gentile churches have money to give to the poor,

127
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:29.570
our church in Jerusalem.
So Paul had this already,

128
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:32.900
was starting this connection and he's writing letters back and forth.

129
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.750
And we've seen already that other churches seem to be writing letters back and

130
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:36.410
forth.

131
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.000
These connections start coming a bit more networked in the second century.

132
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:41.834
Also,

133
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.000
we've also seen how Christian churches start in the second century imitating

134
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.580
Roman political and social structures.

135
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.580
They start imitating the Roman household and their government,

136
00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:56.990
which is having the monarchical bishop,
the one ruling bishop over a town area.

137
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.740
Oh yeah.

138
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.280
We call it the monarchical bishop because the bishop becomes like a king,

139
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.670
a monarch,
uh,
the single bishop over a town.

140
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.030
So that starts happening in more places in the second century.

141
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:10.100
We've already seen it written letters of Ignatius.

142
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.040
It becomes a lot more prevalent by the time you get to the end of the second

143
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:17.870
century,
Jewish Christianity starts dying out,
uh,

144
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.890
in the second century.
We do have some Jews who follow Jesus,

145
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.810
they take Jesus to be the Messiah.

146
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.930
Some of them don't seem to believe that Jesus is divine.
They just,

147
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.410
they take them to be a great profit and we maybe even the Messiah,
but not,

148
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:32.540
that doesn't make him God necessarily.
Uh,

149
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:36.170
and these Jewish churches are still there in the second century.

150
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.190
We gradually see them become less and less,
uh,
visible,
uh,

151
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:41.390
after the second century.

152
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.080
But we've already seen some other things in the second century that are going
on.

153
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.180
I've talked in the class about gnosticism.

154
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:55.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.560
<v 0>So the Gnostics,
oh,
well they didn't,
there was no church of the gnostics.</v>

156
00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:02.770
There was not a movement that had a sign and a website somewhere that said

157
00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:03.604
gnosticism.

158
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.920
But we use the term as an umbrella term for Christians who held on to certain

159
00:09:08.921 --> 00:09:13.330
kinds of mythological views about genesis and angels and the creation and

160
00:09:13.331 --> 00:09:17.560
different divine figures.
So that's one thing that becomes,
um,
more visible.

161
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.191
In fact,

162
00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:22.480
we believe that most of the texts that come that we find in the non commodity

163
00:09:22.481 --> 00:09:25.450
library,
we know that the library itself,

164
00:09:25.451 --> 00:09:28.240
things have been written in the fourth century,
the actual text.

165
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.990
But we believe that a lot of those texts were written originally in Greek in the

166
00:09:31.991 --> 00:09:35.050
second century.
And then they were translated into most,

167
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.470
mostly Coptic by the fourth century.
So,
but they,
these,

168
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.360
this literature that modern scholars place under the bigger rubric of

169
00:09:43.361 --> 00:09:44.194
Gnosticism,

170
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.440
it starts being written in the second century with elaborate mythologies with

171
00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:48.550
different layers of heaven's,

172
00:09:48.551 --> 00:09:52.390
with different angels are beings a ruling those different layers and different

173
00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:55.780
mythologies about creation and how,
how the creative world came to be.

174
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.980
There is also a very important figure that some people will call gnostic a

175
00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:02.530
gnostic.
But,
uh,
we now cannot tune.

176
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:04.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

177
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.550
<v 0>Valentine's Day was a Christian scholar who lived in Rome in the middle of the</v>

178
00:10:09.551 --> 00:10:12.820
second century and he gathered around him,
uh,

179
00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:16.630
other Christians and they indulged in sort of a very philosophical way of

180
00:10:16.631 --> 00:10:19.270
thinking about Christianity and the Gospel.

181
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.640
They look gnostic in some ways,

182
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.770
but they don't seem to have a belief in to God's necessarily that,
that,
uh,

183
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:26.800
other gnostic groups do.

184
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:31.450
So Valentine is though represents another kind of Christianity that becomes very

185
00:10:31.451 --> 00:10:32.680
visible in the second century.

186
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.760
And it remains important for a couple of centuries after that until all these

187
00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:40.150
kinds of Christianity or declared heretical later in the fourth,

188
00:10:40.151 --> 00:10:43.340
fifth and sixth centuries.
And they're run underground.
But Valentine,

189
00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:46.720
this is a major figure because you can see him [inaudible] he's a highly

190
00:10:46.721 --> 00:10:48.160
educated,
uh,

191
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.220
we don't know a whole lot about him historically biographically but you can just

192
00:10:51.221 --> 00:10:54.760
tell from pieces of the history that he must've been a highly educated,

193
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.360
philosophically educated individual who is trying to do,

194
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.480
to raise the mythologies that he found in genesis and in the Bible to a level of

195
00:11:03.491 --> 00:11:06.610
higher philosophical,
platonic special,
a speculation.

196
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.030
So that becomes very visible.
We've already talked also about Marcien

197
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.800
and I've said that a lot of scholars take it,

198
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.370
that when Marcia and came up with his own Canon of the New Testament,

199
00:11:18.371 --> 00:11:21.280
his list of New Testament,
which included the gospel of Luke,

200
00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:23.350
which he edited to take out all the Jewish stuff in it,

201
00:11:23.351 --> 00:11:27.700
the thought was shouldn't be there.
And they'll make the letters of Paul,

202
00:11:27.701 --> 00:11:29.530
which he also edited.
And just those,

203
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.920
that list of things was his sort of New Testament,
his Christian Canon,

204
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.820
any throughout the Hebrew Bible,
the Old Testament,
because that was too Jewish.

205
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.690
So Marcy and also then is being kicked out of the church in Rome and being

206
00:11:40.691 --> 00:11:42.400
declared a heretic in the second century.

207
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:47.290
But he founds churches that exist then for a couple of centuries after his
death.

208
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.530
Uh,
and especially in the eastern part of the empire.

209
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.740
So these are all different of Christianity that are really boiling up,

210
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.390
uh,

211
00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.860
in the second century as church churches are trying to figure out what does it

212
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:03.040
mean to be Christian but not necessarily Jewish anymore.

213
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.490
And that one of the other figures that we haven't talked about is mindfulness.

214
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

215
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.980
<v 0>This was a prophet who went around the clean declaring that he had a special</v>

216
00:12:15.411 --> 00:12:17.870
gift of the Holy Spirit,
maybe that he was the Holy Spirit.

217
00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.190
There were two women who also follow them and they all claimed to have prophetic

218
00:12:22.191 --> 00:12:24.680
gifts and to be able to uh,
speak,

219
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.990
have the Holy Spirit and God speak directly through them.

220
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.880
They developed quite a following.
They were very aesthetic,
very strict.
So they,

221
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.180
for bad marriage and these sorts of things.
And so they,

222
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.390
they were practicing a certain kind of early asceticism and monasticism,

223
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:43.520
but with this very,
uh,
um,
strong prophetic stream of it.

224
00:12:43.521 --> 00:12:48.320
Also,
they were very active in the second century also.
And then people like,
uh,

225
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.780
Agustine would later have to sort of fight with these people.

226
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.730
You also have in the second century,

227
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:57.200
the first people that we really can say are Christian philosophers.
These are,

228
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.700
you could say that Paul had a rhetorical education and every once in awhile you

229
00:13:01.701 --> 00:13:05.540
can see stuff in Paul's letters that looks a bit like what you'll see in say,

230
00:13:05.541 --> 00:13:08.330
philosophy.
Stoicism perhaps.
Uh,

231
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.970
there's a friend of mine trials Engberg Peterson,

232
00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:14.810
a professor at University of Copenhagen in Denmark has written a lot trying to

233
00:13:14.811 --> 00:13:18.450
prove that Paul's ideas are heavily stoic,
uh,

234
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:23.000
and probably deeply influenced by stoicism itself.
Most of us don't buy that,

235
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.840
but we think that you might see traces of stoicism in Paul's writing.

236
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:27.771
You might say these,

237
00:13:27.771 --> 00:13:31.970
you see traces of Platonism in say the letter of the Hebrews are in the gospel

238
00:13:31.971 --> 00:13:32.804
of John,

239
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.410
but you don't find any new testament riding that looks like it would have come

240
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.420
out of a real philosophical school.

241
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.160
It doesn't have that a high level of philosophical speculation or knowledge that

242
00:13:43.161 --> 00:13:45.980
we have in the second century.
We do have though some,

243
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.160
some individuals arising who style themselves as Christian philosophers and they

244
00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:54.500
style Christianity as itself a philosophy.

245
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.780
And one of the most famous is Justin martyr.

246
00:13:59.140 --> 00:13:59.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

247
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.380
<v 0>Martyr of course is not as nice.
His last name.</v>

248
00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:07.381
It's not like Justin h martyr martyr is his nickname because he was martyred

249
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.680
around the year one 50 in Rome.
Justin claims,
uh,

250
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:14.830
and we have several writings of him that survive as along with an account of his

251
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:15.940
martyrdom.
Uh,

252
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.050
Justin claims that he shopped around when he was a young man to all the

253
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:23.530
different philosophies and he couldn't find any that really satisfied him until

254
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:27.520
he found this Christian teacher and he attached himself to that Christian

255
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:31.330
teacher and that teacher introduced him to the philosophy of Christianity.

256
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.430
So you have a person who,
he goes around in robes,
he grows his beard long,

257
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.330
he carries scrolls around tomorrow so he can look like a philosopher at his

258
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:44.470
trial when he's being condemned.
He defends himself as a philosopher,

259
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:47.830
like philosophers had,
had to defend themselves against Roman emperors,
uh,

260
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:50.050
often in the first,
uh,
for centuries.

261
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:55.320
So Justin martyr is one of the first truly sort of philosophical Christian,
uh,

262
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.163
another,

263
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.180
<v 2>uh huh</v>

264
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.930
<v 0>that exist in a little bit later.
This is Clement of Alexandria.</v>

265
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.420
He was,
uh,
probably head of a catechetical school,

266
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.000
a Christian school in Alexandria in Egypt.

267
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.210
He wrote toward the end of the second century.

268
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:16.700
So around the year 200 is when he's riding.

269
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.650
And Clement also clearly has a very good philosophical education.

270
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.560
His writing is,
is excellent.
He,
uh,
he tries to make Christianity,
for example,
he,

271
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.720
he downplays apocalyptic kinds of stuff in Christianity because he knows that

272
00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:32.360
that doesn't look very philosophical.

273
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:37.570
He downplays the incidents on poverty and they that there are lots of parts of

274
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:40.130
the new testament's would basically teach that if you're rich,

275
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.000
you won't go to heaven.

276
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.260
Remember how the letter of James Basically seems to condemn rich people just out

277
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:48.020
of hand,
not just rich people for being,
uh,

278
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.650
when they're evil and not using their money batty,
but just by being rich itself,

279
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.750
you're condemned in some early Christian documents.

280
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.850
Clement rocks against that kind of stuff.
He,
he,

281
00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.470
he writes stuff showing how you can be a rich person and enjoy nice things and

282
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:04.790
still be a Christian.
So he's riding at at the end of the second century,
again,

283
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.510
making Christianity into something that looks much more like a philosophy.

284
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.750
So these things are going on in the second century and that's going to change

285
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:15.800
Christianity to a great extent because what becomes traditional Orthodox

286
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.290
Christianity is heavily influenced by philosophy,

287
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.410
especially by the Platonism that's around in late antiquity.

288
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.750
The very notion for example,

289
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.140
of the immortality of the soul that you're getting a lot of popular
Christianity,

290
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.380
it comes from Platonism more than it does from anything in the New Testament.

291
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.250
The other development that's going on at this time that will become very

292
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:37.310
important is martyrdom.
I've talked about that last time.

293
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.420
And of course Justin martyr is one of the examples of this.
So there's no,

294
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.570
there's no general empire wide persecution of Christians in the second century,

295
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.270
but you do have sporadic persecutions arising against Christians in certain

296
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.740
areas.
So in Rome at certain times you all have certain people martyred,

297
00:16:57.741 --> 00:16:59.400
usually leaders or bishops or uh,

298
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.870
people like Justin martyr who are a key figures martyr.

299
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:06.950
Then therefore starts developing its own ideology and its own theology in the

300
00:17:06.951 --> 00:17:07.784
second century,

301
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.900
which will become very important for later monasticism and way Christian becomes

302
00:17:11.901 --> 00:17:14.780
in the Middle Ages.
You have this idea I talked about last time,

303
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:18.530
that martyrs or especially close to God,
martyrs go straight to heaven.

304
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:21.110
They don't pass.
They don't have to,
you know,
uh,

305
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.870
go to Paris to paradise or any place else.

306
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:27.650
First they go straight to heaven on being killed.
Um,
confessors that is,

307
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:29.960
people are condemned to Margaret and,
but not martyred.
Uh,

308
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.950
also become especially important as figures who are considered to be closer to

309
00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:34.784
God.

310
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.500
These attacks on Christianity and the way Christians respond to it.

311
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:43.700
With this sort of marshal almost warlike ideology of martyrdom,

312
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.510
the martyr becomes a soldier in the army of God in the way it's depicted in the

313
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:51.300
second century.
And this is even up by enemies of Christianity.

314
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.130
So salsas,
the very famous,
um,
no,

315
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.470
Galen,
I mean the,
a very famous doctor.

316
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

317
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.750
<v 0>There is a Celsus I'll mention two gallons,</v>

318
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:07.350
the most famous medical writer of antiquity,
and he's,

319
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.920
he's tons and tons of his medical medical writings.
Still survive.

320
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.100
And it takes forever to read through them,
even in an English translation,

321
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:17.220
much less than Greek.
And now an Arabic translation that a lot of them surviving.

322
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.540
Galen actually mentions Jews and Christians a few places in his writings.

323
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.060
And one of the things he says that he thinks Christians are stupid.

324
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.880
He thinks they're crazy because they believe in a god who gets angry.

325
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.700
God doesn't get angry.
That goes against the very definition of God.

326
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.330
So he believes that Christians are superstitious,
uneducated.

327
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:36.930
He thinks that it probably only could succeed with the gullible,

328
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.550
but he's still admires Christians because of the way they faced death.

329
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.030
So even Christians enemies recognize that they had a certain bravery and courage

330
00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.310
and being totally willing to face death.

331
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.790
Celsus was as contemporary also living in the middle of the second century.

332
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.570
He wrote against Christianity,
also wrote against Christians.

333
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.600
And he will admit though that they seem to have a certain better bright,

334
00:19:02.601 --> 00:19:05.820
but he just says there foolhardy and being willing to throw themselves on a

335
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:06.654
sword,
uh,

336
00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.490
the way they do and throw themselves to the beast as we've Seen Ignatius,
uh,

337
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.170
do in his letters.
Let the bees come to me.

338
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:18.450
So Celsus and Galen Admire Christians for the courage and the almost military

339
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.960
discipline they have,
even though they despise them for being,

340
00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:25.380
they believe gullible,
superstitious bumpkins.

341
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.750
So you have for the first time,

342
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:32.550
the second century also then educated non Christians taking notice of the

343
00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:36.240
movement and writing about it and having an idea about it.

344
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.160
And then in response to this kind of thing,
you had the beginning of apologists.

345
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.750
People like Justin martyr himself who wrote an apology for Christianity against

346
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.130
its detractors,

347
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.420
either against the governmental type detractors who said it was a seditious

348
00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:55.500
because it wasn't loyal enough to the emperor or philosophical detractors who

349
00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:59.730
said it was superstition.
And Celsus famously said,

350
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.541
the only people,

351
00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:04.710
these people can convince our old women and slaves and kids know,
you know,

352
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.850
educated band would fall for all this bunk.
But you have Christian apologists,

353
00:20:08.851 --> 00:20:12.960
therefore riding apologies in the second century trying to defend Christianity

354
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.920
against these attacks.
So all of that's already in the second century,

355
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.950
100 years after Jesus is d is turning this little Palestinian movement into

356
00:20:23.131 --> 00:20:25.680
something that is going to start looking more recognizable to us.

357
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.200
But it still takes a long time.
In the third century,

358
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.180
you have developments that are very important.

359
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.000
You have the real rise of monasticism.

360
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.610
Now all the way from the beginning of Christianity,

361
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.640
we've seen that some Christians practiced asceticism and you know that word

362
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.590
asceticism just comes from the Greek word exercise,

363
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.570
but it's come to mean any sort of self discipline for a higher good.

364
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.310
The avoidance of sex,
the avoidance of of food as much as possible.

365
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.890
The avoidance of wine,
drinking only water.

366
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.950
So different groups in the ancient water,
including an ancient world,

367
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:05.620
including some Jewish groups will be called,
for example,

368
00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:08.890
water drinkers because they will avoid wine out of this.

369
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.400
It's not because they felt like these things were in themselves sinful.

370
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.630
It's that they were using these deprivations of pleasures in order to train the

371
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:18.670
body and train the soul.
Again,

372
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:22.360
they were borrowing from Roman military imagery in military audiology.

373
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.620
So Antony,
uh,
Saint Anthony becomes famous.

374
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.720
He's not necessarily the people.

375
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.350
He gets the reputation later for being the first one to go out in the desert and

376
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:34.870
live totally by himself and discipline his body.

377
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.960
And he gets attacked by demons all of the time.

378
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.820
Demons are always going out to the desert to find him and disguising themselves

379
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.330
as young,
lovely girls or boys and,
and trying to seduce Anthony.

380
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.090
And so he has to fight these demons all alone out in the desert in the middle of

381
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.060
the night.
But he does how you,

382
00:21:47.061 --> 00:21:50.020
how do you fight demons in the like that will you Buffet's your body,

383
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:52.060
you Buffett,
your soul,
you make your will strong.

384
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.690
And how you do that will you avoid sex?
You avoid desire.
You avoid,
uh,
rich food.

385
00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:57.580
Do you avoid wine?

386
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.410
So strength training the body and training the will like a soldier or an

387
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:06.310
athlete,
they use both these they athletic imagery and soldier imagery to,

388
00:22:06.311 --> 00:22:07.870
to describe the training.

389
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:13.020
This all becomes a highly elaborated a ideology and theology starting in the,

390
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.770
in the third century.

391
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.780
And so you have not only groups of monks and sometimes nuns living together,

392
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.570
that's one kind of,
um,
uh,
uh,

393
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:27.810
monasticism we called [inaudible] our CMO bidic or are Koinonia monasticism that

394
00:22:29.711 --> 00:22:32.860
his monks or nuns living,
not monks and nuns living together,

395
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.050
although that seldom happened,
but sometimes did,

396
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.960
but usually monks living together or nuns living together.

397
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.170
And then you have with this movement,
like I said,
with Antony of,
uh,

398
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.020
some monks going off into the desert and living alone and that sort of thing.

399
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:50.440
So you have both these forms of monasticism starting to develop in the third

400
00:22:50.441 --> 00:22:54.460
century.
This will become hugely important.
As you know,

401
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:58.780
for Christianity all the way through the Middle Ages,
you couldn't have Europe.

402
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.860
As we think about Europe,
you couldn't have had the learning,

403
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.610
the vast learning and the texts and,
and the classical stuff,

404
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.960
the all the classical texts,

405
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.550
the passing on of literature and Philosophy from antiquity.

406
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.960
You could've had any of that without monasticism through the Middle Ages that

407
00:23:16.961 --> 00:23:17.491
begins.

408
00:23:17.491 --> 00:23:21.220
See in the third century when you have these movements really taking off and

409
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:24.700
they become hugely important and hugely popular for people.

410
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.440
You also have in the third century,

411
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:31.530
the first really empower wide persecution of the church and attempt to actually

412
00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:36.160
destroy it and get people to deconvert and to denounce Christianity and a

413
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:40.420
sacrifice to the emperor.
And this happens with,
uh,

414
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.310
the empire,
the emperor decis.

415
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.210
So we call this the DCN or desean up persecution.

416
00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:50.090
It happens around the time you're one to 50.

417
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.890
So right in the middle of the third century.

418
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:57.250
And this is the first time that there is an empire wide attempt to suppress the

419
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:01.730
Christian Church.
Also in the third century,

420
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:06.731
you have one of the most brilliant and famous it Christian scholars of,

421
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.400
uh,
all of history actually,
origin

422
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.110
origin was later considered to be a heretic.
Um,

423
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.530
for some of the teachings that he came up with about,
for example,

424
00:24:21.531 --> 00:24:24.280
he taught that even Satan could be converted.
In the end,
he,

425
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.180
he believed that all created,

426
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:30.950
created beings would be brought back up somehow and to God in the end.
This,

427
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.920
and he had views about the nature of a,

428
00:24:33.921 --> 00:24:38.921
of God and the nature of human beings that later would be deeply suspected of

429
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:43.070
being not quite orthodox enough.
In his own day,
though in the third century,

430
00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:46.740
he was completely orthodox.
Uh,
he had actually been trained,
uh,

431
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.540
and probably the catechetical school in Alexandria that I mentioned before,

432
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:52.730
that Clement,
uh,
probably headed up.

433
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:56.810
He started his own school then in Palestine and that's where he spent the rest

434
00:24:56.811 --> 00:25:01.250
of his life in Palestine.
Origin was a great biblical commentator.

435
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.320
He was the first one,
for example,

436
00:25:03.321 --> 00:25:07.070
who took all the different versions of the Greek,
of the Old Testament.

437
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.160
For example,
the Hebrew of it,
the Septuagint,

438
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:11.870
which was the most famous Greek translation,

439
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.490
but then parts of other Greek translates like by Theodocia or Aquilla.
And he,

440
00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.530
he would put these in parallel columns.

441
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:23.360
And this was a remarkable sort of technology for studying the Bible to be able

442
00:25:23.361 --> 00:25:27.410
to have all these things in parallel columns to be able to compare side by side.

443
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.640
He did that sort of thing.

444
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.720
It's called the Hexapla because it had six columns of the Old Testament.

445
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.370
He wrote reams and reams of,
of commentaries on different books of the Bible,

446
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.230
most of which don't survive.
But,
uh,

447
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:44.150
we do have quite a bit of it and origin practiced this a way of interpreting

448
00:25:44.151 --> 00:25:44.481
scripture.

449
00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:49.160
I illustrated for you from the medieval period that scripture always has more

450
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:50.960
than one level of meaning.
In fact,
you remember,

451
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:54.530
you read some of origin's commentary when you read that chapter from my book

452
00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:58.580
pedagogy of the Bible.
So origin represents in the third century,
um,

453
00:25:58.910 --> 00:25:59.930
a new,
very,

454
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:04.550
very strong arise in the level of Christian Biblical scholarship.

455
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.070
He's also very philosophically educated.
So he's a part of that tune.
So the,

456
00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:15.071
the tradition of commentary and high level of Christian scholarship also becomes

457
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.320
much more visible in the third century than it had been before,

458
00:26:18.321 --> 00:26:19.700
especially to people like origin.

459
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:25.360
The fourth century then brings us to basically where I'm going to stop for a

460
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:31.210
much detail because it's in the fourth century that you have the triumph of

461
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:36.720
Constantine as the sole.
He beats all the other rivals to the throne,
the,

462
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.960
the empire,
the Roman Empire.
But by this time,

463
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.380
by the year 300 had been divided up into two different basic empires,

464
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:47.280
the west and the east.
And there was an emperor emperor for each one.

465
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:49.440
And then there was also a Caesar for each one.

466
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.310
So there were four rulers who ruled the Roman Empire in the year 300,

467
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.750
a two emperors,
one of the West,
and one of the east and two seasons,

468
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.200
one of the West and one east Constantine went to war with w uh,

469
00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.470
the other guy on the other side and t one,

470
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:07.710
he was actually in the West in the beginning.
He won,
he,

471
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:12.570
you reunited the Empire East and West.
He built his new Rome.

472
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.760
He did.
He didn't take Rome anymore as the capital.

473
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.940
He moved the capital to Constantinople named after him.
Of course,

474
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:22.230
the city of Constantine or what we call Istanbul,
our Byzantium was,

475
00:27:22.231 --> 00:27:25.180
is it's a ancient name also.
So this is when,

476
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.790
this is basically where we start talking about the beginning of Byzantine

477
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.900
Christianity because it's named after the town Byzantium or Constantinople or

478
00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:37.990
Istanbul that becomes the capital of the Roman Empire,
uh,

479
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.270
that goes on for them.

480
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:44.450
Constantine also want it to stop all this feuding about what was Orthodox

481
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:45.600
Christianity.

482
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.600
So he uses the power of the emperor's throne to force bishops to come together

483
00:27:51.391 --> 00:27:55.500
in several different councils.
The most famous of which in three 25

484
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:02.640
is the council of Nicea.
And of course this is where we get the term,

485
00:28:02.641 --> 00:28:03.990
the nice seen creed,

486
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.700
which if you're Roman Catholic or Episcopalian or several other kinds of

487
00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:09.534
Christianity,

488
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:14.130
you may recite the Nicene creed in on certain holy days are in church.
It's,

489
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.210
this is the longer creed,
which talks about Jesus being fully man,
fully human.

490
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.530
It brings in the trinity.

491
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:24.620
So you have trinitarian theology becoming a bit more solidified at the Council

492
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.620
of Nicea.

493
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.460
It didn't win the day because throughout the fourth century you still had fights

494
00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:32.340
among different bishops.
Some people not accepting the Nicene creed.

495
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.940
Years later you had the cows,
the uh,
another creed,
uh,
pronounced at cal Seaton,

496
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.470
so that's called the Caledonian creed.
And all of these were attempts though,

497
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.940
promoted by the emperors.

498
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.970
See the emperors wanted to use Christianity to solidify a one empire again and

499
00:28:47.551 --> 00:28:49.950
to keep it from being split.
And if you couldn't do that,

500
00:28:49.951 --> 00:28:53.550
if you had different groups claiming to represent the right Christianity and

501
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:55.440
claimed everybody else represents the wrong Christianity.

502
00:28:55.650 --> 00:29:00.600
So the real push for what counts as Orthodox Christianity and the bringing of

503
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:04.830
more unity to Christianity,
which we've not seen.
Right?
And this semester we've,

504
00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:09.270
we've noted how you don't have what you would call a correct trinitarian

505
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:11.370
doctrine in the new testament.
It's just not there.

506
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.030
You've got all kinds of views about Jesus that would later be declared
heretical.

507
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.020
They're still there in the new testament.
And Chris,

508
00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:21.120
what Christians do is we just read kind of carefully and interpret it slickly so

509
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:24.840
that,
you know,
it makes it look more orthodox than it actually is.

510
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.880
But that's because there was no orthodoxy that could claim to rule,

511
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.270
uh,
different Christians who call themselves Christians who have the empire.

512
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.150
This is what starts changing in the fourth century.
Like I said,

513
00:29:36.151 --> 00:29:39.810
they don't succeed.
So you have debates about orthodoxy for centuries,

514
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.620
but it's with in the beginning of the fourth century and then his,

515
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.670
he had a long dynasty,
his,
his,
uh,
his progeny,

516
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.870
his sons and their sons and their sons,
uh,
retain the throne,
uh,

517
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.420
four years after that.
And so you,

518
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.890
you had this constant Tinian dynasty that was able to bring a good bit of

519
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:03.670
solidity to the Roman Empire in the fourth century that it hadn't enjoyed in the

520
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:04.504
third century.

521
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.680
And therefore they use this to sort of bring about Orthodox Christianity as the

522
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:12.780
single form of Christianity.
That's the most important,
uh,
changed,

523
00:30:12.781 --> 00:30:17.680
therefore for the fourth century.
But how do we get after that?
Of course,

524
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:19.900
as you know from your history,
uh,

525
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:24.280
the empire splits again and later you have the split between eastern

526
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:25.120
Christianity,

527
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.680
which is represented by those churches we call Orthodox located mainly as with

528
00:30:29.681 --> 00:30:32.440
the Greek,
the,
the authority of the Greek Orthodox Church.

529
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:35.920
But of course you have Orthodox churches in each of the nations of the east.

530
00:30:35.921 --> 00:30:39.640
So you have Russian orthodoxy,
Greek Orthodoxy and Syrian Orthodox Church.

531
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:42.040
You have different orthodox communities,
uh,

532
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.640
in the east and then Roman Catholicism in the West.

533
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.190
And that split of course is still with us.

534
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.140
That starts happening in later antiquity.
What,

535
00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.410
but notice it's still not what anybody would call a world religion.

536
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:00.010
Now the very term world religion is something that has only come about in the

537
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:02.730
20th century.
And it was,
uh,

538
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.250
it was a term that was invented when Christians,

539
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.430
we're exploring around and seeing that there were other ways of being religious

540
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:13.150
and how do you want to categorize these things?
So around 1900,

541
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.190
some scholars invented this guy,
well,

542
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.460
there's world religion and then there are local religions.
You know,

543
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.220
African religion is not a world.

544
00:31:20.221 --> 00:31:23.480
Religion is just a certain different kinds of paganism.
They thought,
uh,

545
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.850
and they thought,
well,
uh,
Judaism is not a world religion.

546
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:31.450
It's a religion of the Jews.
And by its very definition,
it's an ethnic religion.

547
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.900
Therefore it's not a religion that is any for anybody in the world.

548
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.260
That's why Jews don't go around missionizing and trying to convert everybody in

549
00:31:38.261 --> 00:31:40.840
Asia to Judaism or everybody in Africa to Judaism.

550
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:42.430
But they said Christianity is different.

551
00:31:42.431 --> 00:31:46.400
Christianity believed that it was the one true religion and therefore,
uh,

552
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.690
launched in the 19th century all these missionary activities.

553
00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:53.920
And that was in the 19th century that you had a mainly Protestants in the 19th

554
00:31:53.921 --> 00:31:57.310
century really trying to convert the whole world to Christianity and sending out

555
00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:58.144
missions.

556
00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:01.810
There's of course it started in the beginning in the 17th century with Roman

557
00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.250
Catholics and in the,
uh,

558
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.910
North American South America trying to convert the Indians and trying to set up

559
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:11.410
colonies.
So the conversion of the Indians in North American,

560
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:15.070
South America,
mainly by Roman Catholics to Roman Catholicism,

561
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.720
and then later the the attempt in the 19th century by Protestant churches to

562
00:32:19.721 --> 00:32:21.520
convert people all over the world.

563
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.450
It really does make Christianity start looking like a worldwide phenomenon,

564
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.950
but that's not really until the 19th century say that that happens before that

565
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.590
Christianity is basically the religion of Europe.

566
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.630
That's why Europeans still to this day,
even if they're not religious,

567
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:40.640
even if they don't consider themselves Christian,

568
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:42.260
they may consider that as completely atheistic,

569
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.500
but they see Christianity as part of the very fabric of European identity.

570
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:53.390
This is what's leading to the big debate about whether to admit Turkey into the

571
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:54.950
European Union.
There are a lot of people in Europe,

572
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.250
even good liberal people who are open minded and don't necessarily have anything

573
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:01.370
against Islam who don't want to have Turkey as part of Europe.

574
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.460
And one of the main reasons,
because it's not a Christian nation,

575
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:05.480
it doesn't have this.

576
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.780
And of course most of their nations aren't really Christian in the sense of

577
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.880
having the majority people observing Christianity,

578
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.830
but they still have this idea that what it means to be European is some

579
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:17.510
connection historically with Christianity.

580
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.350
And that's quite true because Christianity was not a world religion.

581
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:25.040
It existed in Europe until the modern period.
So,

582
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:29.060
but with the idea that there are other world religions that happens with

583
00:33:29.061 --> 00:33:31.970
colonialism,
Christianity starts defining itself as a world religion.

584
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:34.070
So the first scholars who talked about this term said,
well,

585
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:37.700
there's only one world religion,
Christianity,
all the rest are local religions,

586
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:41.330
uh,
linked to some particular geographical area.
And then they start saying,
well,

587
00:33:41.331 --> 00:33:43.760
okay,
wait a minute.
Buddhism kind of,
they kind of liked Buddhism.

588
00:33:43.761 --> 00:33:47.630
They thought it kind of looked a bit like Protestantism.
So they said,
okay,

589
00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:51.080
we'll let Buddhas and be a world religion also.
So for a while,
around 1900,

590
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.930
the two world religions recognize where Christianity and Buddhism.

591
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.340
And then gradually I started saying,
well,
maybe,
um,

592
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.490
maybe Islam is because it's actually not,

593
00:34:01.491 --> 00:34:05.660
you don't have to be an Arab to be Muslim and you can see Muslims existing all

594
00:34:05.661 --> 00:34:08.540
through Asia and that sort of thing in Africa.
Uh,

595
00:34:08.541 --> 00:34:13.541
so maybe Islam is the third world religion and then kind of more for ideological

596
00:34:14.391 --> 00:34:17.840
purposes,
they said,
well,
we'll let the Jews in,
you know,

597
00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:20.720
so Judaism can be aware of religion also because you don't actually have to be

598
00:34:20.721 --> 00:34:21.980
in one location to practice it.

599
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:27.340
Hinduism was a problem because the very word Hindu is a made up term for

600
00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.060
religion because it just means Indian,
right?

601
00:34:29.061 --> 00:34:34.061
This was just so Hinduism is a modern invention to a label to put over whatever

602
00:34:34.431 --> 00:34:35.264
Indians in this,

603
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.630
whatever people in the subcontinent practice that relate something to something

604
00:34:38.631 --> 00:34:41.690
that we would call God's,
we're going to call that Hinduism.

605
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:47.290
So Hinduism gets invented in the 20th century and then that gets to be another

606
00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:50.090
world religion.
So then you get this ideology.

607
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.010
If you had to take a class in world religions or an introduction to religion and

608
00:34:54.011 --> 00:34:59.011
say the year in 1980 you would have probably read a textbook that would probably

609
00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:04.100
list as the undisputed world religions,
five Christianity,
Judaism,
Islam,

610
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.120
Hinduism,
Buddhism.

611
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.420
Now does Confucianism Count?
Well,
some textbooks and say,
yeah,

612
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:16.370
I wanna know does,
uh,
you know,

613
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.630
what do you paganism,
just,

614
00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:20.840
you know what stuff that people just worship all kinds of gods of,
you know,

615
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.870
trees and rocks and things.
Well,
so,
but this,

616
00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.890
the whole category of having world religions and having a list of them become

617
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:31.340
something that really is only developed in the academic study of religion in the

618
00:35:31.341 --> 00:35:34.940
20th century.
So if someone asks you the question,

619
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.080
how did this little started by this Jewish Prophet in Galilee but went,

620
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.940
how did it become a world religion?
You really the honest,

621
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:45.990
most honest question and say,
well,

622
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:50.220
it didn't really happen until scholars invented it in the 20th century because

623
00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:54.060
that's when the very category of world religion came about for us to use.

624
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.630
Of course,
if you wanted to say,
well,
when did you have start having Christians?

625
00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.330
And are all over the world,
not just in Europe.

626
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:04.990
Well you'd have to say starting in the 17th century with the missions to north

627
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.920
and South America and then really in the 19th century with the,

628
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.650
with the missionaries,
especially from England and North America,
uh,

629
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.440
going to China and going to Japan and going to all over Africa.

630
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.830
So when you talk about when did this thing become a world religion?

631
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.310
Probably about the 19th century would be a good answer,

632
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.250
but that's counterintuitive to most of us.

633
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

634
00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:32.810
<v 0>The last question I'm talking about is,
Nah,
we're out of time.</v>

635
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.940
I was going to talk about why did Christianity grow before Constantine.

636
00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.140
Obviously with Constantine,

637
00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.880
you've get the emperor promoting this religion now and there are various

638
00:36:45.881 --> 00:36:47.800
theories about what causes it to grow.
Before that,

639
00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:52.990
some people have said because they for bad abortion are um,
and uh,

640
00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.650
uh,
child and um,
birth control,
contraception.

641
00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.550
Most early Christians seem to think that contraception was wrong and abortion

642
00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:03.970
was wrong and putting out infants was wrong.
Some people will say,
well,

643
00:37:03.971 --> 00:37:05.200
it's because they promoted the family.

644
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.140
I don't particularly buy that cause he got all these monks and nuns running

645
00:37:08.141 --> 00:37:12.340
around to not reproducing.
Um,
some people even said,
well,

646
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:16.300
when Christians themselves right in this period about why they grow and why

647
00:37:16.301 --> 00:37:19.330
people are flocking to this cause because we're better healers and exorcist,

648
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.350
we're better than Asclepius that healing people and exercising demons.

649
00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.300
So Ramsey Macmullen,

650
00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:29.290
retired historian right here at Yale has written famously about this,

651
00:37:29.291 --> 00:37:31.600
that at patently enough,
second,

652
00:37:31.601 --> 00:37:35.200
third century Christians were just really damn good healers and excesses.

653
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:37.810
And that may be why they grew,
uh,
itself.

654
00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.230
So the question of why Christianity grew before then is a hot one that,

655
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.830
that a lot of historians or even right now debating.
Okay.

656
00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:48.640
Any questions about that?
All right,

657
00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:52.150
I'm gonna cut the lecture there because I want to pass out the final exams.

658
00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:56.230
I think we've talked enough about in previous classes the difference between

659
00:37:56.231 --> 00:37:59.890
historical interpretation and theological interpretation and modern

660
00:37:59.891 --> 00:38:01.510
interpretation and postmodern interpretation.

661
00:38:01.511 --> 00:38:04.810
That was what I was going to end up on.
But I believe we've covered that enough.

662
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.440
And you can always ask me questions about that later.
At some point if you like.

663
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:10.330
So let's pass the exams out please.

664
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:15.363
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

665
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.020
<v 0>Any questions though,
why they're doing that?
This is your chance.
Yes sir.</v>

666
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.633
<v 1>Okay.</v>

667
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:28.760
<v 0>Why we think Rahm was persecuting Christians.
Where was your question?</v>

668
00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:32.630
What evidence do we have that they were doing it or why were they motivated to

669
00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:34.940
do it?
Why were they,
why were they motivated to do it?

670
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:36.690
That's a very good question.

671
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.760
And when you realize that so much of the power of Rome was built on the ideology

672
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:47.310
of the emperor,
Romans really did believe they,

673
00:38:47.311 --> 00:38:50.690
that they were the most pious nation on earth.
And one of the,

674
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.560
this is why whenever the Roman,
the Roman army went to another country,

675
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.310
they would always sacrifice to the local gods because they believed the local

676
00:38:57.311 --> 00:38:59.170
gods protected them and cause growth.

677
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.820
So the Romans would sincerely believe that if you don't sacrifice to the gods,

678
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:07.180
if you don't,
if you're not a pious person,
the gods may punish you.
Well,

679
00:39:07.181 --> 00:39:07.691
what happens then?

680
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:10.660
If you have a bunch of these Christians run around who refused to sacrifice to

681
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:12.640
the gods,
refuse to sacrifice to the emperor.

682
00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.310
Not only is it a threat against the emperor himself,

683
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.310
it's a threat against all the people.
So in,

684
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.020
and it's also just a matter of patriotism.

685
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:24.130
What would happen to you right after nine 11 or even now if at a Yankees game

686
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.070
where when they said stand up and read and sing the Star spangled banner,

687
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.850
if you refuse to stand up,
you sat down,

688
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.020
you kept your baseball cap on your head and you started singing happy birthday.

689
00:39:35.021 --> 00:39:40.021
Instead you're going to get beat up because the locals just won't like it.

690
00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.760
Well,
that's the way it was a lot with early Christians.

691
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.270
It was the locals who felt like what they were doing was dangerous.

692
00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:50.560
It tore against the social fabric of Roman society and it offended the gods.

693
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.000
So they had a lot of reasons to actually try to suppress Christianity.
Yes sir.

694
00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.520
Do we know about Constantine converted?
He says,

695
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:02.140
because he saw a vision right before the battle.
Uh,

696
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.800
scholars debate that some scholars say he,

697
00:40:04.801 --> 00:40:07.360
he converted because he looked around and he saw that this was,

698
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.930
although it was a minority movement,

699
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:10.630
there's no way that this has been a majority.

700
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:14.530
It was a vibrant movement that was going on in Rome and the Roman Empire.

701
00:40:14.531 --> 00:40:16.840
And maybe he said that's something I can use.

702
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:20.440
He was already an admirer of the Sun God of the,

703
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:24.520
and he was moving toward a certain form of monotheism where the son was the only

704
00:40:24.521 --> 00:40:25.240
God.

705
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.500
And so some people say it wasn't that big of a jump for him to switch that to

706
00:40:29.501 --> 00:40:30.334
Jesus.

707
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:35.590
And so some people say he had this political idea that it was be a smart thing

708
00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:37.840
to do,
and then he made up the vision later.

709
00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.160
So there are different reasons we don't really know truly his psychological

710
00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:44.860
motivations or conversion.
Okay.
Yes sir.

711
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.650
Okay.
The question was,
what was the nature of persecution?

712
00:40:55.651 --> 00:40:57.810
Was it really throwing Christians to the lions and that sort of thing?

713
00:40:57.811 --> 00:40:59.400
Or was it more like destroying Christian texts?

714
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.110
It was different things at different times.

715
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:05.190
A lot of times it was crucifixion or killing people.

716
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.400
Torture to get people to confess.
Uh,
sometimes,

717
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.110
especially in the DC and persecution,

718
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:14.070
there was an attempt to get to force priests and bishops to turn over bibles and

719
00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:16.140
Christian literature.
And in fact,

720
00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:20.930
people could save their lives by giving up Christian books or Christian bibles

721
00:41:20.931 --> 00:41:23.010
and they would be destroyed by the authorities.

722
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.960
So it took different forms like that,

723
00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.110
and sometimes it was just less overt pressure.
You know,

724
00:41:28.111 --> 00:41:30.940
you couldn't get promoted,
you couldn't do certain things.
Uh,

725
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:34.400
sometimes people would try to get you out of the Roman army if they found out

726
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:38.390
you were a Christian.
So that it took different forms.
Yes,
sir.

727
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.390
The institution of what?
The Papacy,
well,
it was originally simply,
uh,

728
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.410
he asked about the institution of the papacy.

729
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.280
It was originally simply the bishop of Rome.
But as you might imagine,

730
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.190
pretty early on,
Christianity in the third century,

731
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.850
bishops of the most important cities just became more important.

732
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.940
So the bishop of Jerusalem was important because Jerusalem was important.

733
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.290
The bishop of Alexandria was important because Alexander,

734
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:06.770
he brought the bishop of Constantinople was important because it was

735
00:42:06.771 --> 00:42:08.180
Constantinople.
Likewise,

736
00:42:08.181 --> 00:42:11.810
the Bishop of Rome was important and that was struggling among different major

737
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:14.540
bishoprics about which one would be,
uh,
leading.

738
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.960
It so happened that the bishop of Rome was still considered the center of the

739
00:42:17.961 --> 00:42:19.970
earth for a long time.

740
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:24.920
And so gradually it just came that the bishop of Rome just sort of held

741
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:29.880
preeminence among all other bishops.
And it was informal that developed,

742
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:30.580
uh,

743
00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:35.580
the real recognition of the Bishop of Rome as sort of the pope in way we think

744
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:39.980
of it that actually has to go into the middle ages before it starts developing.

745
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.971
And you don't,
for example,

746
00:42:40.971 --> 00:42:45.830
you don't have papal infallibility declared as a doctrine until Michael,

747
00:42:45.831 --> 00:42:50.780
the 19th century,
early 20th century.
So,

748
00:42:50.781 --> 00:42:54.440
um,
I'll have to defer to Michael on Roman Catholic history because that's one of

749
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:58.220
his specialties.
But,
um,
so when we think of the Roman papers,

750
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:02.440
the papacy now as being sort of the infallible pope who,
who,
uh,

751
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:06.640
has his kind of has full say over everything that really is almost,
uh,
uh,

752
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:10.400
development that starts in more in the medieval period and comes into the modern

753
00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:15.200
period.
So in the beginning it was just he was recognized as the head,

754
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:19.010
the sort of recognized,
uh,

755
00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:23.570
more respected bishop.
All right,
let's talk about the finals.

756
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:29.120
You have two questions on your final and you get to choose option a and option

757
00:43:29.121 --> 00:43:33.320
B.
I'm not going to read all of this.
You can talk to your section leaders,

758
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.770
email them,
talk to me,
email me if you have questions about this.

759
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:41.450
The things that I want to stress are a few things.
Don't go to the library.

760
00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.820
If you need things like a concordance,
that's great.
It gives a concordance.

761
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.960
Use a Bible dictionary.

762
00:43:47.961 --> 00:43:50.420
If there's something you just don't know the meaning of a word or a concept,

763
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:55.310
but don't go look up commentaries because already we've gotten papers from,

764
00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:58.430
from some of you that it's clear that what you did was you went rent and read

765
00:43:58.431 --> 00:44:01.400
some books and where in the library that told you about something in the New

766
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:01.730
Testament,

767
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:05.960
chances are it's bullshit because there's been more shit written about the Bible

768
00:44:05.961 --> 00:44:10.460
than any other topic in the world for the last 2000 years.
And you probably,

769
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:11.990
even after taking this semester course,

770
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.140
you may not be able to tell the good stuff from the bad stuff.

771
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:18.050
So you don't need other scholarship to answer these questions.

772
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:21.860
These questions are designed so that you can use Bart Ehrman's textbook,

773
00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:26.900
the tools we've shown you and the notes from class and just your own brain and

774
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.400
the primary texts you've been reading.

775
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.460
You can answer these questions yourself with what we've given you in class.

776
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.130
So that's one of the main things is don't try to go to the library to get

777
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:38.400
answers to these questions.
Use your brain.
Um,

778
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:43.710
I'm going to stress the length.
We always said eight pages,

779
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:46.420
but some of my teaching fellows have been complaining that,
uh,

780
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.370
y'all have creative ways of either stretching,

781
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:53.190
stretching our shrinking eight pages.
And so there's a word limit,

782
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:56.520
2,500 words.
So we're still looking for eight pages,
double spaced,

783
00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:01.200
but not to exceed 2,500 words.
Use Your word counter on your software.
Now.

784
00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:05.850
Uh,
the papers are due by five o'clock,
Monday,
April 27th.

785
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:10.230
You may email them,
uh,
as an attachment to your teaching fellow.

786
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:12.000
If the teaching fellow has given you permission to do that.

787
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:15.360
And I think they all did.
Um,
otherwise if you want to turn into hard copy,

788
00:45:15.361 --> 00:45:17.430
please do so at the religious studies department and forth.

789
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:18.330
Did you on college street,

790
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:23.190
both of the questions addressed the kind of issues we raised all semester long,

791
00:45:23.191 --> 00:45:24.930
so they shouldn't really be a surprise.

792
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.220
Several times we've talked about how to Christianity spread geographically and

793
00:45:29.221 --> 00:45:33.750
when I gave the lecture on ax I explained how ax gives you a schematic outline

794
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.290
of the growth of Christianity.
So taking that one lecture,
uh,

795
00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:39.240
on acts and the,

796
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:42.960
and the readings that you've done at that and then pull things from other

797
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:45.780
lectures and from other things in the semester.
Sort of thinking about,

798
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:50.670
well now what kind of Christianity would promote the sort of,
um,
uh,

799
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.870
letters of John,

800
00:45:51.871 --> 00:45:56.400
what kind of Christianity would look different and use other of these writings

801
00:45:56.401 --> 00:45:57.270
to say,
well,

802
00:45:57.271 --> 00:45:59.970
I think maybe this kind of Christianity may have developed a bit differently.

803
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:04.050
You can focus on doctrinal issues,
you can focus on social structures or forms.

804
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:05.640
You can focus on ideologies.

805
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:08.910
And many of the issues that we raised up the semester,
it's your choice.

806
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:10.110
The main thing is,
oh,

807
00:46:10.111 --> 00:46:15.000
just to show how Christianity did not develop in the smooth schematic way that

808
00:46:15.001 --> 00:46:18.030
it's presented in the book of acts.
The second question,

809
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.350
I've given a couple of lectures where I stressed a whole lot more christology.

810
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.250
What Christology is,
uh,

811
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.860
the nature of Christ and how different early Christian documents 10 seem to be

812
00:46:28.861 --> 00:46:32.280
working with different Christologies.
So what this question is to,

813
00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:36.960
you've given three columns of text,
primary texts and it's,

814
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.460
it's a Chinese menu kind of thing.

815
00:46:38.461 --> 00:46:42.720
Your suppose you have to choose at least one source from column a at least one

816
00:46:42.721 --> 00:46:45.360
source from column B and at least one source from column c.

817
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:48.990
And you can use any others too.
You're not real,
you're not restricted to this,

818
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.660
but you have to use one of each of those,
uh,

819
00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:57.180
sources in order to construct this answer of illustrating the diversity of

820
00:46:57.181 --> 00:47:00.180
Christologies in early Christianity.
Any questions?

821
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.140
We do not accept or read late papers,

822
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:13.350
they just get a flat zero.
If you do need an extension,

823
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:17.280
ask for it ahead of time.
Not at five o'clock on Monday.

824
00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:19.800
All right?
We will.

825
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:25.010
You're teaching fellows have the authority to work with me and grant you an

826
00:47:25.651 --> 00:47:28.710
extension,
but you have to ask for it ahead of time,

827
00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:34.020
but otherwise we expect those papers to be done by five o'clock Monday.
Okay.

828
00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:39.960
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
