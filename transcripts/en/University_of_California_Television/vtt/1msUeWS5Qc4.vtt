00:00:01.214 --> 00:00:04.131
(electronic beeps)

00:00:05.518 --> 00:00:07.935
(calm music)

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:23.095
- Well increasing evidence suggests

00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:25.401
that normal brain development is impaired

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:28.672
in a schizophrenia and other
neuropsychiatric disorders

00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:31.203
long before the onset of symptoms.

00:00:31.203 --> 00:00:33.715
So emerging genetics and other data

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:36.646
intriguingly have been
implicating immune molecules

00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:38.248
and immune related pathways,

00:00:38.248 --> 00:00:41.762
raising many questions about
the underlying biology.

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:44.869
So we recently discovered
an unexpected role

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.954
for our resident immune
cell called microglia

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:50.683
in this sculpting process,
this pruning process.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.542
And so today I'd like to tell
you about what we've learned

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:54.988
about how it is that these cells

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.758
know which synapse to prune

00:00:56.758 --> 00:00:59.321
and which synapses perhaps not to prune.

00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:01.216
And how our work using mouse models

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:03.604
are providing new biological insight

00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:04.763
into this pruning pathway

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.281
and how this might go
awry in schizophrenia

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:10.254
and other neuro developmental disorders.

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:12.057
Neuro circuits undergo
tremendous remodeling

00:01:12.057 --> 00:01:13.258
during development.

00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:17.278
We start out with an excess
of synaptic connections

00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:18.794
that are maintained in the mature brain.

00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:20.593
And through a developmental
process called pruning,

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:22.408
or synapse elimination,

00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:24.302
many of these extra synaptic connections

00:01:24.302 --> 00:01:25.415
are permanently removed

00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:27.660
while others get
strengthened and maintained.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.558
This concept of use it or lose it.

00:01:29.558 --> 00:01:31.327
So this process is of course regulated

00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:34.430
and modulated by experience.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.311
And this process, refinement
process, is necessary

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.705
for developmental and the precise wiring

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.318
of synapses in the brain.

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.015
And disruptions in this process of pruning

00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:46.177
are thought to underlie neurodevelopmental

00:01:46.177 --> 00:01:47.951
and neuropsychiatric disorders.

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:50.049
Now interestingly, there are
different critical periods

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.247
of pruning that happen in
different parts of the brain.

00:01:52.247 --> 00:01:53.899
And as you heard earlier today,

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.402
interestingly, parts of the
brain like the frontal cortex

00:01:56.402 --> 00:01:58.720
are the last areas of the brain to prune.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.083
So the big question of course

00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:02.815
is what regulates this pruning process?

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:04.259
So a major question in the field

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.490
and one that my lab has
been intensely interested in

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.266
is understanding how it
is that specific synapses

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:10.455
are eliminated during development.

00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:12.481
If we can understand the mechanisms

00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:15.874
by which specific synapses
get pruned or vulnerable,

00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:17.441
this might provide new insight,

00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:18.968
and even therapeutic insight

00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:21.860
into how these synapses
get lost and diseased.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.752
So it's well established,
as you heard today,

00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:26.068
that neuronal activity
plays a critical role

00:02:26.068 --> 00:02:29.268
in refining synapses and
synaptic connections.

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:30.379
So we know, for example,

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.018
that activity sets up a local competition.

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:34.788
So if you look at this cartoon here,

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:37.511
you can see that this neuron
is innervated by inputs.

00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:39.081
These left and right eye inputs.

00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:40.890
If you were to, for
example, label these inputs

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.417
in the visual system.

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:43.823
But over the course of development,

00:02:43.823 --> 00:02:45.514
you can see that this neuron,

00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:47.610
that some of the inputs, in
this case, the blue ones,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.932
get permanently removed

00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:51.691
while the red ones get
strengthened and maintained.

00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:53.636
So what is the question mark
that we're interested in

00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:55.255
is understanding what are the molecules

00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:57.482
that link chains in activity

00:02:57.482 --> 00:02:59.917
that with a physical
elimination of the blue input

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:01.446
but not the red one.

00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:02.441
So much of the field, of course,

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.924
is focused on the neurons themselves.

00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:05.866
These are, in fact, the
cells that get pruned.

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:07.682
But emerging evidence implicate glia,

00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:10.288
the non-neuronal cells of the
brain in this pruning process.

00:03:10.288 --> 00:03:12.565
And more recent work have been implicating

00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:14.325
these cells called microglia.

00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:16.426
Now as a card carrying glial biologist,

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:19.355
I have to say I've ignored
these cells my entire career

00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:20.468
until very recently.

00:03:20.468 --> 00:03:23.323
And that is in part because
these are the only cells

00:03:23.323 --> 00:03:24.888
not born in the brain.

00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:26.333
These are our immune cells.

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:28.561
They actually, now we know, reside,

00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:30.834
or are originating from the yolk sac.

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:32.978
And they actually enter the brain

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:34.387
very, very early in development.

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:35.795
In fact, in a mouse, they enter the brain

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:37.821
as early as embryonic day eight.

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:40.506
That means they're the first
non-neuronal cell in the brain.

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:42.695
They're there when amazing
growth is happening

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:43.971
in the embryonic brain.

00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:46.658
Yet we know surprisingly
little about the normal roles

00:03:46.658 --> 00:03:47.778
of these cells.

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:48.807
Much of what we knew about them

00:03:48.807 --> 00:03:51.207
was in the context of injury and disease.

00:03:51.207 --> 00:03:54.065
Now these cells make up about
10% of the cells of the brain.

00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:55.636
They tie all the brain.

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:57.826
But one of the things that
makes them incredibly unique

00:03:57.826 --> 00:03:59.400
and different from any other cell

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.099
is they're our resident phagocytes.

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.247
They're actually, by nature,

00:04:02.247 --> 00:04:03.727
the fact that they're immune cells,

00:04:03.727 --> 00:04:05.126
they're really good at eating things

00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:06.772
or phagocytosing things.

00:04:06.772 --> 00:04:07.922
But the other thing

00:04:07.922 --> 00:04:10.149
that two photon in vivo
imaging has shown us,

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.047
meaning if you were to put a microscope

00:04:12.047 --> 00:04:15.063
over a mouse's brain and thin their skull

00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:17.654
and use a reporter line
in which all the microglia

00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:18.904
are labeled green,

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:23.268
what you can see is that these
cells are incredibly dynamic.

00:04:23.268 --> 00:04:26.423
You can see their processes
are constantly moving

00:04:26.423 --> 00:04:27.290
all the time.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.759
And they're serving the
extracellular environment.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.276
And the big question we wanted to know

00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:33.008
is what is it that they're serving?

00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:35.815
And one of the things we now
appreciate that they're serving

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:36.799
are synapses.

00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:39.869
So if you were, for
example, to overlay neurons,

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:42.833
in this case, this
neuron is labeled in red,

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:45.014
you can see the processes
of these microglia

00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:49.258
intimately contacting spines
and axons all the time.

00:04:49.258 --> 00:04:51.493
This is happening in your brain right now.

00:04:51.493 --> 00:04:52.326
It's amazing.

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:53.764
And one of the things we also appreciate

00:04:53.764 --> 00:04:56.269
from our work and others
is that they can even sense

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:58.215
local changes in neuronal activity.

00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.990
So if you manipulate that
neuron and you fire it more,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.716
or if you silence it, the
microglia knows somehow.

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:06.122
And that suggests that there
must be some sort of signals

00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:07.403
that are being transmitted

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:09.674
and that the microglia have receptors

00:05:09.674 --> 00:05:11.452
that recognize those signals.

00:05:11.452 --> 00:05:13.221
So what about the postnatal brain

00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:16.439
when all of this remarkable
plasticity is happening?

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.918
What about early in development?

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:19.526
So that is the question
we set out to address

00:05:19.526 --> 00:05:20.850
a number of years ago.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.713
And we use the developing
mouse visual system

00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:24.865
as our model because so much was known

00:05:24.865 --> 00:05:26.301
about how synapses prune

00:05:26.301 --> 00:05:27.864
in this particular part of the brain.

00:05:27.864 --> 00:05:30.415
And so we use the developing
retinogeniculate system

00:05:30.415 --> 00:05:33.760
of the mouse where you can
actually label the inputs

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.509
from the two eyes with a dye.

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:37.940
And then we could ask what
are the microglia doing

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.371
at that circuit during the
critical period of pruning?

00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:41.824
And what you can see here

00:05:41.824 --> 00:05:44.674
is that the microglia in green
are intimately associated

00:05:44.674 --> 00:05:47.395
with the left and right eye axons.

00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:50.124
And the question that Dory
Shafer in my lab asked was

00:05:50.124 --> 00:05:53.185
are they actually engulfing
or eating those synapses?

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:55.403
And what we found is that
almost every microglia

00:05:55.403 --> 00:05:58.336
we surveyed during this peak
of remodeling at this point

00:05:58.336 --> 00:06:00.652
were full of inputs from
the left and right eye.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.511
They were actually in their lysosomes.

00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:04.860
And quite importantly,
this process of pruning

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.596
was developmentally regulated.

00:06:06.596 --> 00:06:08.782
They were doing it during these
critical periods of pruning

00:06:08.782 --> 00:06:09.737
but not later.

00:06:09.737 --> 00:06:11.670
And that suggests that
there must be some signals

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.490
that tell the microglia to do this

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.665
and other signals that
tell the microglia to stop.

00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:16.498
And we're very much interested

00:06:16.498 --> 00:06:18.386
in understanding what those signals are.

00:06:18.386 --> 00:06:19.784
So the next big question of course

00:06:19.784 --> 00:06:24.138
is how is it that microglia
know which synapses to prune?

00:06:24.138 --> 00:06:27.321
Now, we now appreciate that
it's not a random process.

00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:29.757
The first hypothesis is
well, they're phagocytes.

00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:30.625
They just happen to be there

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:32.476
and anything that's
around, they're gonna eat.

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:34.799
But we know there are
critical periods, again.

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:37.198
And so that suggested the possibility

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:40.186
that they were recognizing
synapses through some molecules.

00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:43.663
So going back to that activity
dependent competition model,

00:06:43.663 --> 00:06:44.728
the red and the green,

00:06:44.728 --> 00:06:48.036
the red and the blue inputs,
if you change activity,

00:06:48.036 --> 00:06:49.686
we know that the less active inputs

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:51.289
are selectively eliminated

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.145
or more preferentially eliminated.

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:54.598
And again, using the visual system,

00:06:54.598 --> 00:06:56.922
we can manipulate activity in the two eyes

00:06:56.922 --> 00:06:59.071
and block activity in one eye with a drug

00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:01.298
that blocks sodium
dependent action potentials.

00:07:01.298 --> 00:07:03.281
And what we found is that microglia

00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:07.074
preferentially engulf the
axons from the less active eye.

00:07:07.074 --> 00:07:07.980
And that again tells us

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.247
this is some activity dependent cues.

00:07:10.247 --> 00:07:13.069
So how do microglia know
which synapse to prune?

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:14.671
Well, recent work,

00:07:14.671 --> 00:07:16.369
if we go back to work I did as a post op

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.691
in Ben Barres's lab,

00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:20.470
back then, we unexpectedly
identified a rule

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.109
for a group of immune
molecules called complement

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.882
in this process of synaptic pruning

00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:26.647
in the mouse visual system.

00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:28.258
Now this is a group of immune molecules

00:07:28.258 --> 00:07:31.564
traditionally associated with
the innate immune system.

00:07:31.564 --> 00:07:33.585
And this was a surprising
finding at the time,

00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:36.552
but we essentially found is
that the retinal ganglia cells,

00:07:36.552 --> 00:07:38.702
the cells that are
actually getting pruned,

00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:42.542
are actually expressing some
of these molecules like C1Q,

00:07:42.542 --> 00:07:45.844
and if you knock out
C1Q and downstream C3,

00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:47.659
these mice failed to segregate

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:49.305
into their eye specific territories

00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:52.575
and they remained multiply
innervate, even into adulthood.

00:07:52.575 --> 00:07:54.795
And so this raises question of how is it

00:07:54.795 --> 00:07:56.868
that a group of secreted molecules

00:07:56.868 --> 00:07:58.480
that are related with the immune system

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.380
could be doing something
as precise as pruning?

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.953
Well, going back to the immune system

00:08:02.953 --> 00:08:04.398
is where we learned a lot.

00:08:04.398 --> 00:08:06.545
Complement's main role
in the immune system

00:08:06.545 --> 00:08:10.700
is to tag apoptotic cells and
bacteria for rapid removal.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.924
So for example, C1Q would
bind to that bacterial cell.

00:08:13.924 --> 00:08:15.659
This would set up a proteolytic cascade

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:19.420
that then cleaves downstream
components like C4, C2, C3.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.516
And the canonical way by which
that cell would get removed

00:08:22.516 --> 00:08:24.667
is that it would get tagged by C3

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:26.158
and then a main way it gets removed

00:08:26.158 --> 00:08:28.918
is through phagocytes like
macrophages in your periphery

00:08:28.918 --> 00:08:30.898
that express receptors for complement.

00:08:30.898 --> 00:08:32.148
And what we found is that complement

00:08:32.148 --> 00:08:34.836
was actually tagging, if you will,

00:08:34.836 --> 00:08:37.561
subsets of synapses during development

00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:39.745
and that microglia are the main cells

00:08:39.745 --> 00:08:41.431
that express this comp neuron receptor.

00:08:41.431 --> 00:08:43.126
And that led to this hypothesis

00:08:43.126 --> 00:08:46.879
that microglia were recognizing
complement tag synapses.

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:48.736
Maybe the less active synapses.

00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:50.182
And indeed, when we knocked out

00:08:50.182 --> 00:08:53.429
either the receptor on the
microglia or complement itself,

00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:55.985
microglia are only about half
as good as engulfing synapses.

00:08:55.985 --> 00:08:57.509
So this identifies complement

00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:00.431
as one of the main ways by
which these synapses get pruned.

00:09:00.431 --> 00:09:03.148
But of course that also tells
you it's not the whole story.

00:09:03.148 --> 00:09:04.509
Now importantly,

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:07.166
if you fail to prune
through this mechanism,

00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:10.044
this leads to sustained defects
in synaptic connectivity.

00:09:10.044 --> 00:09:11.279
There were too many synapses.

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:13.015
In fact, David Prince's lab later went on

00:09:13.015 --> 00:09:14.956
in the C1Q knock out mice to show

00:09:14.956 --> 00:09:17.301
that these mice remain multiply innervated

00:09:17.301 --> 00:09:20.162
and hyper connected and they
were more prone to epilepsy.

00:09:20.162 --> 00:09:21.855
At least through the adolescent period.

00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:23.509
And that of course raises many questions

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:25.078
we're actively investigating

00:09:25.078 --> 00:09:27.840
related to the functional
and behavioral consequences

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.193
of not enough pruning

00:09:29.193 --> 00:09:31.212
or too much pruning during development.

00:09:31.212 --> 00:09:33.392
And that now brings me to this question

00:09:33.392 --> 00:09:35.794
that this as one of many mechanisms

00:09:35.794 --> 00:09:37.941
by which synapses gets
pruned is unexpected

00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:39.438
because it involves an immune cell

00:09:39.438 --> 00:09:41.170
in a group of these
secreted immune molecules,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.369
but there's many other
lines of evidence now

00:09:43.369 --> 00:09:46.527
that are implicating both glia
and other immune molecules

00:09:46.527 --> 00:09:48.892
like the MHC and the pure B.

00:09:48.892 --> 00:09:51.065
Now importantly, much
like the immune system,

00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:53.462
this pruning pathway we've identified

00:09:53.462 --> 00:09:55.435
seems to be tightly regulated.

00:09:55.435 --> 00:09:57.762
Microglia do not continue
to do this through life.

00:09:57.762 --> 00:10:00.969
There are times and places
when which this is happening.

00:10:00.969 --> 00:10:03.570
They become less phagocytic
as the animal matures.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.395
And a lot of these molecules like C3

00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:07.915
are dramatically down
regulated in the healthy brain.

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:10.691
You'd not want to have pruning
continuing all the time.

00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:12.012
But what if it did?

00:10:12.012 --> 00:10:12.956
What if it kept pruning

00:10:12.956 --> 00:10:14.606
and what if the breaks weren't there?

00:10:14.606 --> 00:10:17.355
Or what if something turned
this pathway on too much?

00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:20.285
We hypothesize that this
could lead to an excess

00:10:20.285 --> 00:10:21.733
or an inappropriate pruning

00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:24.251
of either the wrong synapse
or too many synapses.

00:10:24.251 --> 00:10:29.006
And this could potentially lead
to some of the pathobiology

00:10:29.006 --> 00:10:31.509
underlying neurodevelopmental
and neuropsychiatric disorders

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:33.202
such as schizophrenia.

00:10:33.202 --> 00:10:34.316
So this has been the question

00:10:34.316 --> 00:10:36.491
that we've been interested
for a very long time.

00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:37.483
But of course, as you know,

00:10:37.483 --> 00:10:39.768
there are not very many good
animal models of schizophrenia

00:10:39.768 --> 00:10:42.611
so it's been a very
hard question to tackle.

00:10:42.611 --> 00:10:44.753
Now indeed, several
lines of evidence suggest

00:10:44.753 --> 00:10:47.560
that synaptic pruning may
be altered in schizophrenia.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.262
In fact, the pruning hypothesis put forth

00:10:49.262 --> 00:10:50.822
by Finder 40 years ago

00:10:50.822 --> 00:10:52.970
propose that altered cortical pruning

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.118
is critical for
development of the disease.

00:10:55.118 --> 00:10:58.299
And indeed, this classic
study by David Lewis's lab

00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:00.700
shows very intriguingly, a loss of spines

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.481
in the prefrontal cortex
of some individuals

00:11:02.481 --> 00:11:03.847
with schizophrenia.

00:11:03.847 --> 00:11:07.358
And imaging studies have
also showed cortical thinning

00:11:07.358 --> 00:11:09.956
in patients even before
the onset of symptoms.

00:11:09.956 --> 00:11:11.245
And putting this together,

00:11:11.245 --> 00:11:13.643
the pruning hypothesis
is pretty attractive.

00:11:13.643 --> 00:11:17.276
However, it's not actually
been directly demonstrated.

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:19.831
We don't yet know, for
example, in these patients,

00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:21.771
were these really a pruning defect?

00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:24.004
Were these lost or never formed?

00:11:24.004 --> 00:11:25.566
Was this cause or consequence?

00:11:25.566 --> 00:11:28.175
And again, this is very
difficult to really tackle

00:11:28.175 --> 00:11:30.534
in models because there really aren't

00:11:30.534 --> 00:11:32.271
any good animal models.

00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:34.781
Well this of course is
where human genetics

00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:36.232
can be extremely useful.

00:11:36.232 --> 00:11:38.038
And in the next few slides
I'd like to share with you

00:11:38.038 --> 00:11:39.816
new and recently published findings

00:11:39.816 --> 00:11:41.428
by my colleague Steve McCarroll

00:11:41.428 --> 00:11:43.245
and his graduate student Aswin Sekar

00:11:43.245 --> 00:11:45.903
who have been using genetics
to identify mechanisms

00:11:45.903 --> 00:11:48.359
and novel pathways for treatments.

00:11:48.359 --> 00:11:50.919
Now the strongest genetic signal, by far,

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.451
has been on chromosome six

00:11:52.451 --> 00:11:54.479
in a region known as the MHC locus,

00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:56.130
which contains many genes,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.321
many of which relate to the immune system.

00:11:58.321 --> 00:11:59.895
But researchers had no idea

00:11:59.895 --> 00:12:02.737
which of these many
genes contribute to risk.

00:12:02.737 --> 00:12:05.125
Now this region spans hundreds of genes,

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:08.388
many of them, as I said, in
code immune related genes.

00:12:08.388 --> 00:12:12.111
But the MHC signal has
really remained unexplained.

00:12:12.111 --> 00:12:14.755
And really, it doesn't
follow any mathematical

00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:16.445
or statistical patterns explainable

00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:18.841
by any one known genetic variance.

00:12:18.841 --> 00:12:21.036
So what could be explaining this effect?

00:12:21.036 --> 00:12:24.013
Well, intriguingly and
interestingly, within the MHC,

00:12:24.013 --> 00:12:25.166
this is one of the strongest risks

00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:29.685
for associated with loci near
the gene C4, complement C4.

00:12:29.685 --> 00:12:32.002
Which of course is a key part
of the complement cascade

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:33.481
I talked to you about earlier.

00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:36.850
Now Aswin honed in on this
for that and other reasons.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.992
And he was also, and Steve's
lab has been interested

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:42.353
in this question of
structural variability.

00:12:42.353 --> 00:12:44.392
Why different people
have different numbers

00:12:44.392 --> 00:12:46.335
and copies of different genes.

00:12:46.335 --> 00:12:48.385
And they developed methods,

00:12:48.385 --> 00:12:50.583
molecular techniques to characterize

00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:53.604
the C4 gene structure
in human DNA samples.

00:12:53.604 --> 00:12:55.259
And quite interestingly, what you'll see

00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:59.135
is there are actually
two C4 gene, C4A and C4B.

00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:00.992
And unlike most genes,

00:13:00.992 --> 00:13:04.209
this gene has a high degree
of structural variability.

00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:05.530
Variation.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.673
And what he found is that
some people's genomes

00:13:07.673 --> 00:13:09.313
have extra copies of A.

00:13:09.313 --> 00:13:10.803
Some have extra copies of B.

00:13:10.803 --> 00:13:13.616
Some have completely
lack one or the other.

00:13:13.616 --> 00:13:15.102
And this led Aswin to ask

00:13:15.102 --> 00:13:17.502
could the structural
form of C4 you inherit,

00:13:17.502 --> 00:13:21.339
could this related to the
increased risk of schizophrenia?

00:13:21.339 --> 00:13:23.531
Now the challenge was
that although the Aswins

00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:26.182
developed these techniques
to measure C4A and B

00:13:26.182 --> 00:13:29.081
and the variation in
different individuals,

00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:32.880
how do you link this to
schizophrenia risk, right?

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.736
So Aswin and Steve developed a novel way

00:13:34.736 --> 00:13:38.900
to map how C4 structure
relates to SNPs, right,

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.212
or from which genetic data
was already a variable

00:13:41.212 --> 00:13:43.740
from tens of thousands of individuals.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.949
They essentially built a map

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.629
to infer the four most common forms of C4

00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:49.935
from the SNP data surrounding the gene

00:13:49.935 --> 00:13:52.080
which essentially created
molecular barcodes

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.069
from the SNP patterns.

00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:56.182
And it works because humans
share long genomic segments

00:13:56.182 --> 00:13:57.872
that they have inherited
from common ancestors.

00:13:57.872 --> 00:14:00.272
And this map then allowed
them to take advantage

00:14:00.272 --> 00:14:03.371
of SNP data in giant beta
databases from around the world

00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:05.889
which essentially turned a
molecular biology problem

00:14:05.889 --> 00:14:07.408
into a big data problem.

00:14:07.408 --> 00:14:08.933
And here's what they found.

00:14:08.933 --> 00:14:11.494
Alleles of C4 appear to shape risk

00:14:11.494 --> 00:14:14.423
in proportion to their
effect on C4A expression.

00:14:14.423 --> 00:14:16.237
On the left, which you'll see,

00:14:16.237 --> 00:14:20.585
is how each alleles here
relates to schizophrenia risk.

00:14:20.585 --> 00:14:22.691
And you can see those that have more C4A

00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:24.635
have significantly increased risk.

00:14:24.635 --> 00:14:26.831
On the right is each allele's affect

00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:28.731
on C4A expression in the brain.

00:14:28.731 --> 00:14:30.377
They found that C4 gene structure

00:14:30.377 --> 00:14:32.877
could predict C4 gene activity.

00:14:32.877 --> 00:14:35.151
And notice now that those that have C4A

00:14:35.151 --> 00:14:37.018
have more C4A expression.

00:14:37.018 --> 00:14:39.939
And together, I know I'm
oversimplifying this story

00:14:39.939 --> 00:14:42.367
which has been recently
published earlier this year,

00:14:42.367 --> 00:14:44.102
but for now, the
important thing to realize

00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:46.695
is the more C4 you make from the locus,

00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:48.679
the greater the risk of schizophrenia.

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.409
Now that raises a number of questions

00:14:50.409 --> 00:14:52.604
that we're now actively investigating.

00:14:52.604 --> 00:14:55.549
And we're starting to collaborate
Steve's lab with my lab

00:14:55.549 --> 00:14:58.567
and also Micheal Carroll's
lab to ask this question.

00:14:58.567 --> 00:15:01.124
How is it that elevated C4A,

00:15:01.124 --> 00:15:03.980
how could this contribute to
the risk of schizophrenia?

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.652
What is the biology
underlying this risk factor?

00:15:07.652 --> 00:15:09.186
Now this brought together my lab,

00:15:09.186 --> 00:15:11.246
which has been studying
complement and pruning,

00:15:11.246 --> 00:15:13.174
Michael Carroll's lab as an immunologist

00:15:13.174 --> 00:15:15.112
who's been studying C4 for his career

00:15:15.112 --> 00:15:17.628
and all of our labs
together sort of join forces

00:15:17.628 --> 00:15:19.823
in this multidisciplinary collaboration.

00:15:19.823 --> 00:15:22.909
And the first thing we did is
we looked at the C4 protein.

00:15:22.909 --> 00:15:24.144
And they're actually a pretty good

00:15:24.144 --> 00:15:25.260
human antibodies for this.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.618
And we basically asked,

00:15:26.618 --> 00:15:28.104
much like we noticed in the mouse,

00:15:28.104 --> 00:15:31.449
could C4 be tagging synapses
in the brain of humans?

00:15:31.449 --> 00:15:33.938
And we used tissue that was generated

00:15:33.938 --> 00:15:36.332
and given to us by the Stanley Collection.

00:15:36.332 --> 00:15:38.441
And we looked in these brains and showed

00:15:38.441 --> 00:15:41.614
that C4 was, in fact, binding
to subsets of synapses

00:15:41.614 --> 00:15:43.248
in the human brain.

00:15:43.248 --> 00:15:45.942
In the schizophrenia patients.

00:15:45.942 --> 00:15:47.474
And then more over,

00:15:47.474 --> 00:15:49.658
Heather de Rivera in Steve McCarroll's lab

00:15:49.658 --> 00:15:51.765
grew cortical neurons
and then stained them

00:15:51.765 --> 00:15:54.201
after they developed with C4 antibodies

00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:57.836
and shown that C4 also binds
to these synaptic structures

00:15:57.836 --> 00:15:59.029
in cortical neurons.

00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:00.803
And interestingly and importantly,

00:16:00.803 --> 00:16:02.831
C4 is actually being made by the neurons

00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:05.137
and secreted by these human neurons.

00:16:05.137 --> 00:16:07.821
So this is just early data to suggest

00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:09.057
that the protein is there

00:16:09.057 --> 00:16:10.593
and it's actually binding to synapses,

00:16:10.593 --> 00:16:12.077
at least under these conditions.

00:16:12.077 --> 00:16:14.633
But of course the big question
is is it related to pruning?

00:16:14.633 --> 00:16:16.865
So this is when we again
went back to the mouse.

00:16:16.865 --> 00:16:18.434
So we went from human
to mouse in this case

00:16:18.434 --> 00:16:21.562
and we asked does C4
mediate synaptic pruning?

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:23.434
And so we went back to our very classic

00:16:23.434 --> 00:16:24.923
retinogeniculate system.

00:16:24.923 --> 00:16:27.318
We used mice that were
generated by Mike Carroll's lab,

00:16:27.318 --> 00:16:29.011
these C4 knockout mice.

00:16:29.011 --> 00:16:30.987
And Allison Bialas who was
a graduate student with me

00:16:30.987 --> 00:16:33.581
and now a post op with
Mike did this experiment.

00:16:33.581 --> 00:16:35.731
Basically did the eye specific segregation

00:16:35.731 --> 00:16:39.319
or pruning experiments in C4
knockout mice versus control

00:16:39.319 --> 00:16:41.973
and the prediction
would be that lacking C4

00:16:41.973 --> 00:16:44.899
would lead to a defect or lack of pruning,

00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:47.585
much like we saw in the C1Q and C3 mice.

00:16:47.585 --> 00:16:49.071
And that's exactly what we saw.

00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:51.509
And interestingly, the
retinoganglian cells

00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:54.119
were expressing a lot of C4
during the peak of pruning.

00:16:54.119 --> 00:16:56.136
So this is the pre-synaptic neuron.

00:16:56.136 --> 00:16:59.437
And mice that lack C4
failed to segregate nicely

00:16:59.437 --> 00:17:01.009
into these eye specific territories,

00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:02.913
which you can actually label

00:17:02.913 --> 00:17:06.879
by tracing the left and
right eye with color toxin

00:17:06.879 --> 00:17:08.154
and then doing this thresholding

00:17:08.154 --> 00:17:10.898
to show the two eye interactions.

00:17:10.898 --> 00:17:15.027
So this told us that lacking
C4 led to failure to prune.

00:17:15.027 --> 00:17:17.047
But the big question now moving forward

00:17:17.047 --> 00:17:19.404
is could excessive pruning contribute

00:17:19.404 --> 00:17:21.091
to the pathobiology of schizophrenia?

00:17:21.091 --> 00:17:23.903
Could this relate to
the David Lewis's study?

00:17:23.903 --> 00:17:25.297
And so that is actually what we're now,

00:17:25.297 --> 00:17:28.597
together as a collaboration,
actively investigating.

00:17:28.597 --> 00:17:30.554
Could overactivation of complement

00:17:30.554 --> 00:17:32.202
during these critical periods of pruning

00:17:32.202 --> 00:17:35.043
contribute to wiring
defects and schizophrenia?

00:17:35.043 --> 00:17:36.445
A number of other questions were raised

00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:38.380
that we're actively pursuing as well.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.357
And one of the questions
that again stem from

00:17:40.357 --> 00:17:42.316
beautiful work presented earlier today.

00:17:42.316 --> 00:17:44.260
Could pruning also help us to understand

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.211
the age of onset of schizophrenia?

00:17:46.211 --> 00:17:48.356
Might pruning become too intense

00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:50.793
and prolonged in certain individuals?

00:17:50.793 --> 00:17:53.107
Might it expose other
pre-existing vulnerabilities

00:17:53.107 --> 00:17:56.077
and how is it that
environment, like stress,

00:17:56.077 --> 00:17:59.553
impinges on the genetic pathways like C4?

00:17:59.553 --> 00:18:02.196
And we're also wanting to now
move from the visual system

00:18:02.196 --> 00:18:05.155
that we love so much into much
more uncharted territories,

00:18:05.155 --> 00:18:06.768
which is the prefrontal cortex.

00:18:06.768 --> 00:18:09.626
And Mike Carroll is
developing mouse models

00:18:09.626 --> 00:18:11.240
to look at over expression

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.876
of multiple copies of human C4A in mice

00:18:13.876 --> 00:18:16.301
so that we can start to address
some of these questions.

00:18:16.301 --> 00:18:18.109
Now I'm just gonna end in my last slide

00:18:18.109 --> 00:18:19.479
to try to pull this together.

00:18:19.479 --> 00:18:21.497
But also to broaden this a bit more.

00:18:21.497 --> 00:18:23.554
The idea that although we've been focused

00:18:23.554 --> 00:18:26.116
on neurodevelopmental and
neuropsychiatric disorders,

00:18:26.116 --> 00:18:28.057
could this pruning pathway represent

00:18:28.057 --> 00:18:29.962
a more general common pathway

00:18:29.962 --> 00:18:33.535
that not only might explain
synapse loss during development

00:18:33.535 --> 00:18:36.945
but also could it actually
also help to understand

00:18:36.945 --> 00:18:39.088
why synapses are vulnerable
in the adult brain,

00:18:39.088 --> 00:18:41.516
especially in aging and
neurodegenerative disease

00:18:41.516 --> 00:18:42.879
such as Alzheimer's?

00:18:42.879 --> 00:18:45.704
And so indeed, multiple
work now from several labs

00:18:45.704 --> 00:18:47.527
including our own has suggested

00:18:47.527 --> 00:18:49.585
that this very same pruning pathway

00:18:49.585 --> 00:18:52.399
that I just told you about
becomes aberrantly activated

00:18:52.399 --> 00:18:54.761
very, very early in
Alzheimer's disease models

00:18:54.761 --> 00:18:56.126
and other models.

00:18:56.126 --> 00:18:59.061
And that indeed, that this overactivation

00:18:59.061 --> 00:19:00.601
contributes to synapse loss

00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:03.243
and very excitingly, if
you block this pathway,

00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:06.324
either genetically or the
antibodies or other mechanisms,

00:19:06.324 --> 00:19:07.803
you can prevent synapse loss

00:19:07.803 --> 00:19:10.383
and in some cases, even some
of the cognitive impairment.

00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:12.452
And so I'll end with
this sort of positive,

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:14.472
on sort of hopeful last slide.

00:19:14.472 --> 00:19:16.779
This suggests that maybe by understanding

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:19.134
detailed mechanisms by which complement

00:19:19.134 --> 00:19:21.981
and microglia are selectively
targeting synapses

00:19:21.981 --> 00:19:23.496
in these various models,

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.817
could this help us to try to identify

00:19:25.817 --> 00:19:29.559
new targets to particularly
manipulate synapse loss

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:31.451
in the right time in the right place?

00:19:31.451 --> 00:19:33.888
And could it also identify new biomarkers

00:19:33.888 --> 00:19:35.289
for some of these disorders?

00:19:35.289 --> 00:19:38.017
So I'll just end there by
thanking a lot of individuals,

00:19:38.017 --> 00:19:39.998
past and present lab members,

00:19:39.998 --> 00:19:43.721
incredible collaborators and
of course generous funding.

00:19:43.721 --> 00:19:44.626
Thanks so much.

00:19:44.626 --> 00:19:46.060
(applause)

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.477
(calm music)
