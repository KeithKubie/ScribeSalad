00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.932
Previously we initialized an instance of
RPSGame and assigned it to self.game.

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:08.790
What does self.game refer to?

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.978
Take a few seconds to guess.

00:00:09.978 --> 00:00:12.258
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:17.423
Since we're in the RPSController class,
self refers to the RPSController,

00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:21.998
self.game refers to the game
property of the RPS controller.

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:24.230
In Objective C, just like in swift,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.370
we can use dot syntax to access
properties of an instance of a class.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.650
So if we wanted to say
orchestrate a tie,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.540
we could access the move
property of each turn like this.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.580
Notice that we never wrote any getters
or setters for the game property.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.140
Objective C generated
them automatically.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.070
Swift generates getters and
setters automatically, too.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.820
In fact, you might not even
know what I mean by getters and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.860
setters because in most cases you
can get away with not writing them.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.110
If we were using a custom setter,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.100
the code to set self.game would
look something like this.
